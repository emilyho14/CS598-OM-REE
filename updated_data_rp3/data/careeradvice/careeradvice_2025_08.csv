1n598hl,NYS Labor Law Violation? Fired for leaving work to go to the Dentist after owner refused to let me go-had accrued Sick Time.,"TL;DR: Fired after going to the dentist 

It’s been 3 months already so I doubt I have any recourse after that long but I was dealing with extreme depression and a nervous breakdown in July. I am just now feeling up to looking into filing a complaint against my former employer. 
   For context: I’m a bartender and I’ve worked for this company for 4 years. It was 4 years of harassment, targeted bullying, toxic and a severely hostile workplace for me. I’m a female and the only one that didn’t quit or get fired in the time I was there.
      Anyway, in June of this year I got a root canal. Soon after, I had gotten an abscess and cherry on top- a SINUS INFECTION! All directly on the same side as the root canal and abscess. 

**On the day I was fired, we had no refrigerators, so all of the beer and mixers had to be put in buckets with ice. My face was swollen 5x the other side. Monday, this was a Monday, sales never exceeded $200 on a Monday in June. To top it off, I didn’t have the supplies I needed to safely do my job.**

I called the owner and asked if I could go home as there was no refrigeration and my infection had worsened. He refused. I then asked if I could just go to my dentist who is 2 blocks away, I’d be back in 45 min. He said, “No do that on your day off if you can’t sit there for 8 hours get the f*** outta my bar” and I reminded him I have unused sick time as well as unused vacation days. He still told me I’d be fired. I went to NYU Langone as the dentist had closed by then. 

Do I have any legal grounds for damages?!",parabolic86,1,0.5600000023841858,5,1756682629,2025-08-31 23:23:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n598hl/nys_labor_law_violation_fired_for_leaving_work_to/,8,2025
1n5958y,"Looking for advice, need to vent a little","So I've all but been fired (union is arguing but in vain) from my industrial job of 10 years because I blew up one too many times, around the wrong people, when put in a new, high-stress station with very little training. HR has of course twisted my self-awareness of being hot tempered into ""is a liability,"" so chances of getting my job back are slim to none. It feels very terrible that HR would use my self-awareness and honesty (virtues to normal people) and blindside me by using those as evidence I'm not fit for (re)hire... almost feels like you need a Business Communications course to avoid such a pitfall. A decade of loyalty and dedication is worth less when you *could* be viewed as a liability, and working class honesty is itself an apparent liability when dealing with HR corpo-speak.

1n576l4,Feeling unsure about love of professional,"I’ve been a software engineer for about 3 years at this point working in mid to small IT consultancies on different web portals for different organisations. 

I picked this field because I liked solving problems and developing cool and useful software in a collaborative team in University. 

Over the past couple years I’ve gained confidence in my ability to to do job well and solve problems etc. as one can expect but I’ve never felt a crazy love/passion for programming which claws at me a bit because it makes me feel my work can be more fulfilling that it actually is and that something is wrong.

To be clear I do take a professional interest in the things I NEED to know and make sure I do my job well and my job is quite decent all things considered(at least for my taste) but I’ve been lowkey hoping/expecting my enthousiasm for it to increase steadily with competence and that I would be even more into it over time than when I first started but I don’t feel like that. 

I find it difficult to motivate myself to try personal projects on my own time or watch lots of content that will benefit my job/knowledge and help me progress professionally even though I know it would be good for me but my heart is just not into it even though I’m happy/satisfied ish with my job. 

I’m considering expanding my knowledge of ML/AL and Data Science to see if that interests me and even learn more about entrepreneurship to see how my interest compares to software engineering.

Are there other people who encountered similar feelings over their profession?

I currently work at a small <500 employee private start up and we're just now implementing safeguards around USB usage.

Two months ago, I received a new work laptop and needed to port over data to it from my workstation.

I handed over the drive immediately, haven't touched the data since two months ago. I don't care about the drive, don't care about the personal data I had on there (to be honest there might be personal info/porn on there). It's been about a week and I haven't heard anything.

1n55ybv,About to hit one year of unemployment and dunno what else to do…,"Hi everyone, I hope this is the right space for this kind of post (if not, mods feel free to delete)

As title suggest, next week (Sept. 12th) it’ll be exactly 365 days of being unemployed since I was unceremoniously let go from my previous full-time gig. I dunno what else to do because I feel like I’ve done EVERYTHING you’re supposed to do:

• ✅ immediately filed for unemployment benefits until I hit the maximum cap
• ✅ updated and tweaked my resume and have multiple CVs on file for different job roles/titles—ranging from corporate communications + digital marketing all the way to part-time retail work (whatever I can get, because I know I get shit done)
• ✅ streamlined my website, portfolio and LinkedIn with all sorts of SEO, metadata, mobile-friendly accessibility, etc.
• ✅ network both online and IRL groups, attend job fairs and sign up for professional development courses
• ✅ hired a career coach this past summer, completed tasks from said career coach—only for him to confirm “yeah it’s this job market”
• ✅ rehearsals of strong interview questions and answers ready to go, send follow-up “thank you” emails within 24 hours, and further follow-ups until ghosted and rejected

And this is a small preview within the last year. There’s also the fact that I have a strong list of professional references from managers I’ve kept in touch within each career stage of my life, have a master’s degree and graduated with top honors while working full-time during pandemic times, I’ve been working since I was 16, and managed to navigate post-2008 recession with a lot of administrative/clerical temp work overlapping between contract periods circa 2009-2012. 

TL;DR - my 1-year unemployment anniversary is coming up and I’m crashing out because I did everything society told me to do (work hard, go to college, network, be adaptable, etc.), yet I feel like a failure and dunno the missing ingredient. Is it me? Or is it just this job market?

1n55v1z,"My boss is a narcissist, should I compliment him?","I’m a developer who works hard and solves problems, but my boss (a clear narcissist) didn’t seem happy when I delivered results. Instead, he became anxious and kept insisting the team wasn’t doing well.

I noticed a colleague who constantly complimented him avoided blame, so I tried it too and it worked. He calmed down and gave me less trouble.

Still, I feel conflicted. Am I just feeding his ego and making things worse for the company long term? Or is this just smart office survival?

I even asked [an AI website](https://decidesure.com/), and it said:

""It isn’t inherently immoral to compliment your boss in this situation; you’re not lying so much as adapting your communication to someone who needs validation to function. The key moral line is whether your flattery actively enables harmful decisions if you simply frame your contributions in a way that keeps him calm and allows the team to work, that’s pragmatic, not dishonest.""

1n53z35,What career paths can banking open up?,"I have my first “proper” job out of school and I absolutely despise it. I am being a bit dramatic— the pay is good, I work with some great people and I actually really like the company. As well as all the skills I’ve learned just 6 months in. However I’m realizing how much the “banking” industry just isn’t for me.

I went to school for media communications. (Please be gentle. It was peak pandemic and I was a wide eyed 18 year old who didn’t know any better. I just wanted to follow my dreams!)

The job is extremely emotionally draining. Especially as someone who grew up extremely poor, being surrounded by talk of finances really takes it out of me. As well as seeing so many folks in horrible situations, homelessness, addiction etc. As well as all the things I have to know, I feel like I can’t keep up. I spend a lot of nights after work studying just to not completely suck at my job, but some things just won’t click. 

Everyday I come home and worry about what I did wrong. I get nightmares constantly where I’m at work just messing things up. I can’t escape my job.

It just makes me feel… icky? And stupid. And anxious.

I’m not just jumping ship. Like I said I like the company but I think it’s fair to acknowledge that this is not something I’d want to pursue for a long time. My goal is to stay for two years and move onto something I would be more interested in.

I just want to know what fields these skills could translate to? For more reference it’s similar to a teller/advisor role mixed into one.

1n53538,Switch from FP&A to Asset Management via MBA + CFA?,"Hi –

I’m currently working as a financial analyst at a smaller company. I just wrapped up my MBA, and in my role I’m closely involved with senior leadership. I’ve built a strong reputation internally, and there’s talk of higher-level opportunities down the line. That said, I’m not sure I want to stay in this industry long term.

I’ve switched industries before and done well each time, so I’m open to another pivot. The challenge is that FP&A, while valuable, isn’t as stimulating as I’d like. A lot of my time is spent on variance analysis and reporting, with some exposure to strategy discussions. I’m more drawn to asset management because it’s market-facing, more dynamic day-to-day, and seems like it would make better use of the skills I picked up in my MBA. Additionally, I want to raise my income ceiling as I progress into higher levels of management. I would have much higher earning potential as I progressed through a career in asset management vs continuing my career in FP&A.

My question is: how realistic would it be to transition into asset management without direct experience? Would a background as a financial analyst, plus an MBA (and eventually the CFA), be enough to open doors, or would it still be a very tough switch?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts.",Mountain_Platypus_73,1,1.0,0,1756667233,2025-08-31 19:07:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n53538/switch_from_fpa_to_asset_management_via_mba_cfa/,8,2025
1n52zwm,I need some guidance,"So I didn’t really have an opportunity to go to college and it’s been rough for me the last 6 years. I’m looking to change careers as I’ve been in the food service industry since I was 16, and I genuinely hate it. It started off as a fun job to help me get into college to maybe one day start a certificate course however after being kicked out over something kind of silly (I take responsibility for my own decisions and actions however it really wasn’t much that I did to get kicked out long story 🥲😅) and living in my car since I was 18 trying to put food in my stomach and find a place to live— or just to park overnight where I wouldn’t be causing anyone any trouble, it’s not been easy to make ends meet or even meet the bare minimum to get to where I need to be. I’m able to pay my bills and feed me and my dog as well as get to work, however I’m tired of barely scraping by, having to depend on someone else if my check is just a little bit short, and never being able to have money to have fun or go do something or hell to get a nice-ish car. I’ve busted my ass with nothing to show but a lousy paper that says I can properly work in a restaurant without getting people sick 🥲. I want to buy a house one day, have a family, treat myself and my loved ones to something nice like a lil trip or hell I want to buy dinner for everyone, to pay for a party or even just be able to buy furniture for an apartment one day and not be sinking I want to be able to give nice gifts to my boyfriend and make him feel even a fraction of how special he makes me feel. I don’t want to be a leech but I can’t help but feel like that as my world seems to fall in on me whenever a slight increase in expenses pops up. It doesn’t make sense cuz I’m not even bad at my job and I work a lot it’s just not good enough money for me to justify staying in this field in my area. I’m tired and I would like something that pays me good, I’m not good with technology but heck I feel like everything requires knowing the basics of technology these days. I’d love to go to school but honestly I can’t afford to and he can’t pay all the bills and help me and take care of everything else. I just feel lost with this as everyone keeps asking me what I want to do and I don’t know. I’m passionate about health and fitness, herbs and all the hippie dippy woowoo stuff but that isn’t going to make me a decent living. I’m 24 and sure I’ve still got time but it’s becoming less and less with each passing day and I feel like I should already have this figured out. Most of my friends from Highschool have graduated college have really great paying jobs and are married and happy moving to another state or country and have what seems to be the life I’ve always thought I’d have by now. I can’t even find a guy who will treat me right (this one’s good so far) let alone figure out what I want for lunch 😂🤦🏽‍♀️ I can’t seem to focus on multiple things when I’m working and researching a new career field seems to be a never ending nightmare in which I get nowhere and I’m wondering if anyone knows where I could start. Maybe could help me figure it out as I don’t have any support or someone to say that I’m being a wishful thinker. I don’t want money or handout s just some advice from someone who’s been through it and might be able to guide me through what feels like the biggest storm I’ve been through in a while. Cuz I don’t want to struggle anymore it sucks I just want to be able to do something more meaningful and be able to show the same kind of love to others and idk maybe be able to work one job and have weekends off.

For past reference I’ve never worked in the food industry before and never planned to if the job market wasn’t so rough and I need money to go back to college. I do have my two associates but I’m not sure what I want to do with my life so I took a gap year to work and maybe figure it out. So this isn’t exactly my dream job but I’m grateful to have it. 

I was trained two weeks before I started shifts on my own where I can earn tips. I find enjoyment in engaging with customers and making a long lasting impression  I always make a good number of them laugh or smile, and I always am cheerful over the phone and if I need help I ask for it from a manager. The problem lies in that I suck at my job, like every shift I hear of a mistake or more I’ve made directly from a manager or a co worker, to make it worse is they track how many mistakes r made during a shift so I get to see everyday how many of them I probably made. 

I’ve made so many it feels like they are piling up around me and abt to suffocate me. The managers don’t talk to me unless it’s to help or tell me abt smth I did wrong. It feels like any second they are going to fire me, what are the signs in the restaurant industry that you r on ur way out? Or how can I improve maybe?

1n5294h,I'm worried for my future.,"Hi,

I had to leave my job of 8 years at a law firm due to my boss making a pass at me. I tried to keep it in and not say anything considering he could retaliate or fire me. This was not the first time. It's just gotten worse through the years. Out of loyalty and love for all of their family. Husband and wife started business together. When I first started I was 21, young and very naive ig. Anyways they had a kid and she left on maternity leave and never officially came back. She was/is the office manager. Her presence, kept him in check I think. Since then, her being gone he's pushed and pushed boundaries like giving me unwarranted, unasked for massages. I'd freeze. He'd tell me about how they hadn't had sex (him and his wife) in 2 years then, 7 now. He'd let out his emotional frustrations on the staff. I believe that's why his associate left. I spoke with him one day and aired my frustrations about the boss to him. I didn't mention the inappropriate stuff he'd do and say to me. But I remember him telling me to tell my boss that, "" I am not your work wife"". 

Well, I didn't even know what ""work wife"" meant. The man's married and bc the phrase alone sounded so weird and gross to me, I didn't tell him what my former coworker told me to tell him.

Looking back, maybe I should've. I did leave a couple of times  before but because of how much I loved them and all of the stuff they'd done for me, and fear of retaliation, and a need for a job to make a living,  id come back to help. 

There was a gap between this last time I left and me coming back. His behavior got worse. The emotional outbursts from him, him sending me inappropriate (and I mean inappropriate) texts over the weekend (when i do not want to think about work, he'd text me). Even at work. He'd send me inappropriate messages on our work instant messaging system...

Our IT guy was working on my computer and boss sent me a message saying, ""You look stunningly beautiful today."" Like, I cannot make this up. I was embarrassed for him and of me bc the IT guy was on my computer via a phone call to where I granted him access to use my computer in order to fix my tech issue.

This time around he'd tell me they hadn't had sex in 7 years (him and his wife). I never asked him about it his sex life. Why would I? It has nothing to do with work and what the heck did he want ne to do with that info. 

I'll say this last long gap was me taking time to get sober from alcohol. It all started there. I acknowledge ultimately it was my choice to drink but looking back, that's where it started. 

I am not proudly 1 year 8 months sober. 

Looking back it feels like I'd been groomed in a way. Looking back as a 29 year old, less naive, I wondered what was my value? Did I have any at all? I am ok with being used in order to help assist him in his job, but not being used in the other ways. Looking back it feels like I was used for an emotional outlet for him. He had all the time in the world to tell me of his ""crushes"" of women he'd met through theatre. Some of which were younger than me. And he's 25 years older than me. He very well could've been my dad or that girl's dad. I hated how badly he'd speak about his wife to my newish coworker who was older than him yes man type coworker person that was miserable in her own marriage so I'd just be at my work area and be in awe of him calling her "" a worthless wench"" bc of something she didn't do for their kid or something. And not for him it was something that didn't warrant someone (especially not his wife if anyone) being called that when she was not their to defend herself. 

Oh it ate at me. And I tried to talk to him about it and lay down boundaries he'd acknowledge he was inappropriate but within a matter of a day or 2 be back at pushing at my boundaries I'd set like a toddler would push with a parent in order to get what he wanted. He had tried to kiss me multiple times when I'd hug him. I'm a hugger and still to me that was my ""family ""

The last time I couldn't stand it. I had to tell her. I talked to my stepdad about what I should do. He said ""leave, leave now, that is a sick man, I told you not to go back there."" 

I sent her just a few screensnips of how he'd message me and said how I'm tired of him speaking I'll of her, make passes at me, etc.

Bc If my husband was acting that way, I'd want to know. And I figured I owed her that much. Bc in his head somehow he thought or somehow maybe tried to reason with himself that somehow it was some mutual thing. God the delusion. I didn't help by catering to his ego, I know buy I was trying to just have my job, not rock the boat nor anything. I was afraid he'd fire me. And all the times I tried to tell him that his behavior was inappropriate, did not work. I was at my wits end. Bc through all I've said and I could tell yall so much more. But this post has gotten long enough as is. What did it was his previous attempt literally a week prior to kiss me yet again, me reminding him it's not appropriate.  Him acknowledging it as such too. His mood since I've been back was up and down. And he was on a good mood ""high"" so to speak.

He'd settled a trial finally that had been a thorn in his side, he was so happy. He called his wife (that he talk terribly about over little stuff to us without her nor anyone there to defend her) he called her saying "" I love you so much baby, let's go to dinner tonight!"" 

I doubt myself now, it just happened a little over a week ago but I was livid inside. So I sent her the screenshot of the work instant messages alone along with a rushed explanation as to why I cannot take it anymore and I'm leaving. 

I have so much respect for her. She has been the most consistent in her character and everything since the day I met her. I sent that email knowing after having said that and my stepdads advice to leave asap... I knew I had to go, and out of fear of him retaliating, making my work life he'll, etc. I knew once I sent that I had to go. He made a lot of $ off of that case alone. My coworker retired early and can only legally make so much $ and despite all that he offered to give me a raise (while I didn't know she was capped out at $12 an hr) meanwhile I'm only making $15 an hr bc he'd constantly talk about how much he didn't know if he could keep the business going bc of ""how little he made from clients"" I quote that bc I see now it's bs and manipulative. Bc when he offered the raise, I told him to give it to my coworker bc she deserved it. I saw him make her cry, id come to bat for her, etc. This all due to his up and down emotions.  Everything everyone else's fault but his own. So he didn't give me the raise I denied. But he could've. It's not abt the $

So when he made all that $ off of that recent case he dropped me $200 dollars maybe 300 by eyeballing it. I didn't care. I was in the middle of sending his wife that email. 

I said ""keep it"" he said ""too bad"" dropped it on my desk. Started to walk away, asked me if I was OK. As many times as I'd tried to tell him b4 I knew he wouldn't understand nor listen.  I held strong I said ""I'm fine, just busy."" So he'd leave me alone. I took my keys to the office off of my Keychain and left it and the $ he dropped on my desk to show its not about the $. I sent that email and got the hell outta there.

I blocked him alone. Not his wife nor my coworker. He must've gone into panic mode thinking I'd come back and sue him, and I really could, but out of respect for his wife and his son, I would never. 

Bc after me leaving and blocking him. And after sending that email with the screenshot to his wife....he stalked my practically dead tiktok. I made it 2 yrs ago to kinda document my journey to sobriety.  And I never got into tik tok so I didn't keep it up. So I knew he was grasping at straws thinking he might have to attack my ""character"" to defend himself. But there's nothing of note nor relevance to even remotely bring about a stalwart defense on his end. I know he stalked my tiktok bc I got an email notification and it was his general username he uses for personal accounts like the time he emailed me a love poem to my personal email account. That was yrs ago. I replied saying ""ty for the poem but I do not want to engage in or entertain any behavior that would in any way give off the wring impression that if your wife found out abt it, would jeopardize his marriage and also cause her to not look at me the same bc of his behavior.

He joked and said back then ""______(wife) knows about all my ""crushes"" and that poem was a joke...

Fast forward to the most recent time I hugged him just the week b4 I sent that last email to his wife and left. I hugged him he didn't pull away and kept his face there and out of instinct I jerked away. He laughed and said ""you really think I was going to try to kiss you?"" And blah blah so on. Same story same excuse. Same cover his ass excuse he'd say all the other times just like the poem he sent and his cover his ass response back then.

I could say so much more and I guess I had to vent but lastly when I saw he was stalking my tiktok (literally he created one just to do that, I could tell due to the account having just been made and having 0 posts, 0 followers, following 0 ppl) 

When I saw he was doing that it sent shivers down my spine. I messaged him politely and said ""please leave me alone. If you're worried I'm going to sue you, I'm not so please leave me alone.""

And he responded, i didn't dare read it considering how unhinged he'd gotten over me exposing him to his wife and also just how up and down he'd been acting since I recently came back to work there. 

So I sent him one last text bc I kept getting notifications still from tik tok via email from his account. 

In that text I said,  you need to let go. I have to move on with my life. You need to work on your marriage and being a good father to your son, please leave me alone, i am going to block you again now.""

So I started this post to see about anyone anywhere that's hiring. I'm scared for my future. It's just me. I have no one to lean back on financially. Just money saved (from selling my house 2 yrs ago, which has dwindled down to 7k).

That won't last me long, I know. I'm scared he's blacklisted me from the legal field by saying who knows what to whoever about me and the saddest thing is i wonder if he manipulated his wife into not talking to me by probably saying ""oh she's drinking again or she's crazy or whatever"" I thought I knew him. I thought I could help him, stopped my worst I doubt and almost regret even standing up for myself and respecting his wife by sending her that last email.

I haven't heard from her nor my other coworker (other coworker isn't much of a surprise tbh, she's the kind that says she loves you so much that you believe it but when I'd stick up for her, she'd act like she didn't just cry to me about how horrible he was to her or that she didn't say she was going to quit and leave and that she didn't call him a narcissist before following by saying ""all men are narcissists"" yet she craves their attention like no other. Bc she doesn't get it from her husband ig, idk but it's not abt her. Nor me. Except I guess I needed to vent. I am scared for my future in so many ways but proud I stood up and finally said what needed to be said in order to protect my dignity and honor my integrity. 

As a recovered alcoholic, I'll always have that stigma around me from ppl who don't understand, I have to overpolice my actions, reactions etc just so no one says or even thinks I'm back drinking again. I scared and uncertain for my future and in this economy,  but I value my integrity, and I am proud I finally stood up and said something. 

I pray for them every day that for their child they rekindle the love the lost so that they may all be healthy and his first intro to and relationships (his mother and farher) is a good, strong, healthy one. 

If anyone read this, I welcome honesty. I want to k know if objectively, I was wrong to send her that email about him and leaving the way I did. 

I am grateful and thankful for my family's support. Bc idk if after me saying I won't take legal action against him out of respect for his wife and son that he somehow has them worried abt talking to me for fear I might retaliate even though I made it clear multiple times now to him, I will not. It hurts bc I've known them all for so long and not a word from her nor my coworker, stings.


This was long enough of a post, I could write a book on this alone. 

Any advice would help. I welcome it. Be honest with what your opinion is etc. 

Thank you. ",Calloutgirl,3,1.0,0,1756665108,2025-08-31 18:31:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n5294h/im_worried_for_my_future/,8,2025
1n51qne,"Did I mishandle this finance leadership interview, or was the process unfair?","I applied online for a leadership role in finance. A few weeks went by with no response, so I messaged the hiring manager on LinkedIn. He looked at my resume and scheduled an interview for the next day.

The interview (Monday) went almost 2 hours — we connected really well and unpacked a lot of core deficiencies in their finance setup. It felt positive, and I thought an offer was coming.

The next day (Tuesday), HR called and said it went well and they wanted to run compensation by me before moving to a procedural meeting with the president. I said that was fine, just send me benefits details to review. Instead, I got a semi-offer email — basically wages/benefits but no contract.

On Wednesday, I said I needed a bit of time to review and asked if I could speak with the hiring manager the following Monday to go through questions. Instead, HR insisted the meeting with the president had to go ahead that Friday. I explained I had questions but didn’t want to drag the process out, and suggested we do the meeting and finalize details later. They pressed me for questions on the spot. I hadn’t gone through the package in detail yet, so I asked a couple but deferred back to the manager.

The hiring manager called me Thursday. By that point, I had come up with an idea to propose starting in a contract capacity to “keep things moving” while sorting out details later. I didn’t pitch it well — it was clumsy and came across wrong. The manager took Thursday to think, canceled the Friday president meeting (I never got an invite), and I felt like I had blown it.

Friday, the manager called again to clarify a couple of points (contract, RRSP matching). I mentioned I was used to a much higher match and reiterated the contract idea, but only as a way not to stall the process. He felt I wasn’t committed and said I wasn’t what he wanted on his team. The call ended.

Since then I’ve tried to follow up — messaged the manager on LinkedIn, emailed HR to explain that my hesitation was just me trying to buy time to review properly, and that I’d still welcome a quick call to clarify. No response from either.

So now I’m sitting here frustrated. I went from feeling like their top candidate to being completely ghosted.

Was I wrong to expect more than a 1–2 day turnaround on a senior role offer?

Did I completely mishandle this by floating the contract idea?

Or is this just an example of a rushed, flawed process where I never had a fair shot once I hesitated?

1n50rhh,"Accounting job + school, is it realistic combination?","Hello. I'm 24 years old living in Central Europe and I'm late. I'm behind in education and career due to some personal circumstances. I'm currently trying to finish high school remotely, (with very good results so far) and plan to go to college afterwards.  
I'd very much like to start my career somewhere while finishing schools. I'm considering taking an accounting course. My country's public employment office offers funded courses, though the selection is limited. Accounting struck me as something learnable and also maybe it could provide both some potential job prospects and good practical, versatile skills that could be useful in my future field of study.

So my question is: Is this realistic given my situation? Since I'm doing remote schooling, I have flexibility most of the time. The only few days im busy with it is during January and June, when there is exam period. So I'm wondering if it's possible to work in accounting when you can't commit to a standard full-time schedule, especially during busy periods like year-end closing

1n500bm,"Is CFA worth it for me (CS background, heading to NYU, interested in quant/finance internships)?","Hey everyone,

I’m starting my Master’s in Computer Engineering at NYU this fall. My long-term career interests lean toward quant/finance roles where I can combine my CS background with financial markets (think quant research, trading, or data-driven finance roles).

I’m considering whether pursuing the CFA would actually add value for me. A few details about my situation:

* Background: Computer Engineering undergrad → heading to NYU for MS in Comp Engg.
* Career goal: Quant/finance internships during my program, and potentially a full-time role in quant finance after graduation.
* Time commitment: I can realistically spare \~20 hours a week alongside my coursework.

My questions are:

1. Would the CFA be worth it for someone coming from a CS background, aiming for quant/finance internships? Or would it be better to focus on more technical/finance-specific skills (like math-heavy quant prep, Python/ML for finance, etc.)?
2. If it *is* worth it, when would be the best time to take the Level I exam—during my MS (while I have some bandwidth) or after I graduate?

I’d really appreciate any input from people who’ve gone through a similar path or know how recruiters in quant/finance view the CFA.

I was shocked, and she also thought it was weird since I have been doing my job in this profession for a few years - as well as other high level professional work.  We talked about it and she seemed supportive.  

When I was able to compose myself the next day, I emailed to tell her more about what I had been experiencing - being sideline, ignored, not allowed to do anything and people treating me like I am incompetent.  The thing is the manager never said anything to me, didn't tell me the truth when I asked many times why no one would talk to me and really, if I had been so awful - why wouldn't she want to coach me and help me become ""independent.""  I was livid because this manager has herself made many mistakes and lacks the education level I have and often seem overwhelmed with simple things.  I am going to transition out of this mess in the next few months and I told the upper manager that it wasn't a good fit for me, and she agreed.

1n4z178,Willing to accept any advice,"This has been a rough week/labor day weekend. On Wednesday I was terminated from a position I held for less than a year due to an incident but moreover burnout/ health problems I didn’t know I had. I working at a volunteer event and wrongfully accused of being intoxicated. I had to travel and I should have just canceled because I found out I had a tiny shot of liquor in my travel bag after it fell out. I was super professional about it, threw it away, called my supervisor and apologized profusely. I was terminated for having it as this was an at will government employee and someone made a complaint. I was trying to get out of there for a number of reasons and had already been interviewing. Now that I’m terminated I likely won’t get a public sector job for another year. The benefits were amazing and I’ve now suddenly lost my health insurance I so badly need. I know some will say sue them but this is a state agency with amazing attorneys and I don’t as an at will employee. I haven’t signed any papers or picked up my stuff, but 2/3 lawyers have said it’s not worth making complaints or filing a lawsuit. The attorney I’m talking to next week is asking for $100 to a consultation. I don’t even know if I should spend the money to talk about what I am more than likely already know. I can barely afford to survive right now.  

I reached out to all contacts, attended interviews I already had scheduled and I have an interview set for Tuesday at a temp agency. My friends know the owners and it’s looking like I’ll at least get a bookkeeping position for now. I have food stamps coming in 7 days and I’m going to get WIC. I have 2 kids who depend on me and I have to stay strong. 
I already have appointment set up to get iron infusions because of my anemia. I didn’t realize this was making me so tired was causing all the brain fog. My doctor urged me to go get those. I’ve also reached out to domestic violence survivor therapist and my psych doctor to make sure I have appointments and everything set up ahead of time. I don’t want to burn out again and keep job hopping. I really need to settle into a career. 
I’m an accountant and I have a decent track record, but some sketchy job history due to moving, domestic violence, accepting a toxic environment just to get a paycheck. 
I’m so mad at myself for losing this job and I have rent, car payment, all of my bills due. 

I live closer to family now and I do have somewhat of a support network to keep me sane, watch my kids every so often and lend an ear.  I’m so very grateful for that! I’m also planning on going back to church to rebuild a strong community/backbone, eventually help others too. 
Family has plenty of money but they’ve helped me before with my rent, etc.  I’m taking my kids to our family cookout tomorrow and I already feel at ease knowing we can relax and spend time with family. They are encouraging me to keep at it and not be so picky about what I take, just get back in there. 
I guess I’m just asking for any advice someone may have. I feel like I have all my ducks in a row and I can get on board and at least get some money coming in again. I was living paycheck to paycheck and I can’t afford to waste any time Without revenue coming in. I’m pleasant to work with, very much committed to being a dependable employee and team player.

1n4y9nm,Recent Marketing Graduate Feeling Stuck - Any Career Advice ?,"Sorry kind of huge texts ....
Hi everyone,

I'm a recent B.Com graduate with a marketing major from a tier 2 college, and I'm feeling pretty lost about my career direction right now.

My Background:
I thought getting an internship at a startup would be perfect - I'd get to do creative marketing work, build new ideas, and understand how businesses really operate. So I joined an agri-robotics startup as a marketing intern.

The Reality:
It took me a while to understand the agricultural field, but once I got the hang of it, the founder started piling on expectations. Now I'm expected to:
- Generate leads from the SEA market
- Handle PR tasks
- Do HR work
- Plus all the regular marketing stuff

I knew startups would throw different tasks at me, but everything feels so scattered. As the only marketing person, I'm not included in discussions and feel pretty isolated.

My Concerns:
This experience is making me question everything. Is this what a 9-5 job looks like? Just constant deadlines and time flying by? I had planned to join a recognized marketing firm next, but now I'm honestly scared.

Finally Questions:
- Will all 9-5 jobs feel this chaotic and overwhelming?
- If I pursue an MBA and get into higher positions, will things change?
- Is this startup experience normal, or am I in a particularly tough situation?
- Any advice on next steps for someone feeling this burnt out already?

Anyone plz any sort of advice .

1n4urjm,When should I stop looking for my first job after uni and move on?,"

Hello everyone,

I've been thinking recently about exiting the job market after failing to land my first job after uni. I graduated in July 2024 with a masters in finance in the UK, I also completed a bachelors in economics in the UK as well. I started applying for jobs early, during my first year at uni (2020) I applied for spring weeks then in my 2nd year i applied for internships and in my 3rd year I applied for graduate programmes, but failed to secure any job. The same happened during my masters. Apparently all the meetings that I'd spent with the university's career consultants were futile.

Upon finishing my studied I returned to my home country Israel and I've been looking for a job ever since. I only had 2 interviews this years with no job secured. Recruiters in Israel literally find it weird that I have degrees from British universities but applying for jobs that don't require a degree (e.g bank teller). I reckon they think that my degrees are forged or something. It's been 13 months since my graduation and I'm thinking when should I forget about my education and staring a career and start looking for a different path?

If anyone had the same experience please do share it with me!

Thanks a lot!",SeriesOk7091,0,0.5,1,1756646997,2025-08-31 13:29:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n4urjm/when_should_i_stop_looking_for_my_first_job_after/,8,2025

1n4u4ql,im lost on what to do- what type of work could i find online or in person?Advices?,"Good morning,

I have a bachelor degree in language (english, french, spanish- my native language is italian). Currently I'm working as an intepreter in healthcare setting in my native country, italy. The issue I have is that the field is very competitive and that i just work ''on call'', for 1 agency only. Which mean I make very little money. And i have moment where i work almost every day and then out of the blue 0 work for a few weeks. the money im making isnt enough.

I'm considering changing work, or seeing if I can also find agencies that hires from overseas, from home. But the issue is, i really don't know where/how to start. I was thinking about receptionist (I live in a city w lots of tourists) or something from home (but what? aside from translation?) or something like back office. something language related where my skills might be useful.

anyone has any advices? what type of remote work could i find online with my degree/skills? where to start finding other type of jobs? what should i put in my resume given there's basically 0 experience outside of what im doing now and volunteer work?",NotteSenzaStelle,2,1.0,1,1756645342,2025-08-31 13:02:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n4u4ql/im_lost_on_what_to_do_what_type_of_work_could_i/,8,2025

1n4swe3,[Discussion] Career advice for a graphic designer shifting to a social-media–driven art career,"Hi
I grew up in South Korea and have been living in France for about 15 years now. I studied at a design school for 5 years and earned a master’s degree in object design in France.
After that, I started working as a freelance graphic designer for a Paris-based jewelry brand. I was responsible for all visual communication, branding etc — it was nearly full-time work but freelance, and the collaboration lasted for around 7 years.

Since early 2024, that collaboration has significantly decreased, and during this transition I started a personal art project for the first time — a tarot deck. I became deeply interested in tarot and began creating the artwork myself. Using my graphic design skills, I’ve been designing not just the illustrations but also the packaging, box, and booklet — creating a deck that’s quite unique and atypical in its style. I’ve now been working on this project full-time, even though I haven’t had much income for the past year and a half. I’m preparing to launch the deck soon via crowdfunding and self-publishing.

I have experience with social media (since I used to manage it for the jewelry brand), so I feel somewhat confident using it to share my work. I’m not aiming to become a big influencer, but I’d love to grow a solid artist account and eventually build a strong enough audience to sustain my creative practice.
Currently I have under 5k followers on each platform (IG and Xiaohongshu), and I’m hoping to grow that in a more meaningful direction.

Alongside this, I’ve been building some small online communities on different places. And through this tarot art project, I hope to expand into other forms and themes of digital painting and acrylic painting, aiming to grow as a full-time visual artist. My goal is to eventually make a living from my creative work — whether through selling art, offering services, or other means based on my communities.

I’d really appreciate any thoughts or advice, especially around:
• What should I focus on right now to grow this into a stable art career?
• How to better grow my small community into a meaningful audience?
• Any advice on monetizing art?
• I started with tarot-related art, but I’d love to take on more commissions outside this theme. Any advice on how to broaden my artistic subjects or attract diverse requests?
• If you’ve transitioned from client-based design work to personal creative work, how did you navigate that?

Any device will be appreciated. Thank you!",Easy_Protection6758,1,1.0,0,1756641736,2025-08-31 12:02:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n4swe3/discussion_career_advice_for_a_graphic_designer/,8,2025

1n4rfl0,"Patchwork CV, sick of IT - what's next?","Hi all

So I have a bit of a quirky career history. If positioned correctly, this could be an absolute strength. But in most cases, it is quite a big hindrance. 

In short:

* BSc in Business Administration / Economics, Germany
* Worked as Data Analyst for 4 yrs, Switzerland
* 1yr MSc in Psychology, Scotland (this is a bit of an odd ball, because it was a ""conversion degree"". On paper it is a Master's, but without specialization and more a general direction, like a BSc)
* Worked as IT consultant for half a year, Germany
* Worked as Data Scientist/Engineer and Software Developer for 4 years, Switzerland
* Got a 3-months nutrition certification for fun

  
I have grown more and more frustrated  with programming. It has always been a fast paced field, which I hard largely been shielded from due working in a highly regulated environment. My job pays incredibly well (at least in relation to what I am actually doing) and requires very little. Bit of a golden cage really. 

But while I love problem solving and creating new things, the minutia of actual software development is getting to me. I want a change. Just don't know what's next. 

Here is what I love doing, and, incidentally, what way too many corporate strength & aptitude tests (e.g. Cliffton etc.) have confirmed I am good at

* creative problem solving
* giving advice, directly or indirectly
* teaching
* communication
* working with data

  
I have considered furthering my Psychology career path, but I might be in a bit of a mess there. Since I only have that 1yr Master to show for, even if I got a subsequent degree to build out my knowledge, in many markets I could not work as a therapist (in Germany for instance I need a minimum of 240 ECTS to be a psychologist - which equates to 4 yrs of full time study). 

If I could just take a pen to a blank sheet of paper, I would want to be an online therapist that helps people with some regular ""talk therapy"", so no deep mental health stuff, and helps people navigate aspects of nutrition and fitness. I would say ""life coach"" but that term has, rightfully, fallen into disregard. 

  
Any ideas what I could be doing next? 

  
EDIT: Two years ago I saw and applied for my absolute dream position: User experience researcher at Valve, the gaming company. It combined everything I love, problem solving, communicaiton, field work, data analysis.

The first one is doctor...when I was younger, my dad told me that he wanted atleast one of the family members to be a doctor but no one did, and maybe i could if I wished...that really touched me and I wanted to be a doctor ever since, also I kinda fell in love with biology since middle school. I love my dad and don't want to let his wish down, and the fact I'm interested in the career myself because of biology.

Second is Writer, I want to become a writer or novellist...I have discovered a new passion of mine which is writing and I'm quite intrigued by writing...whenever I write anything, i go blind out of love (compassion for writing). I want to pursue it full time but since there are other things in the picture, I decided to settle with it as a part time activity for now...be it monetized or not...

The third is an Entrepreneur or Businessperson...I like the idea of creating my own opportunities instead of waiting for someone to give them to me. It means I can take my ideas, turn them into something real, and have the freedom to do work I actually enjoy.

1n4nu5j,Working on a project but not invited to the conferences that showcase our work - how do I approach this,"So I am a lead on a project, and we have 5 global upcoming conferences. I was not invited to the first 4 for fiscal reasons, but then I found out someone from the other project (different than mine) was invited to one of the conferences because they speak the local language. Its been pretty disappointing having being lied too, and being the only person in the company that will not get to meet with the customers they will be working directly with (I oversee the African region). I was told that I would get an opportunity to go to the big global meeting next April, but I am holding my breathe. 

  
In the interim, I am being left behind and I will be the most senior person on my projects. As annoyed as I am, I see this as a great opportunity to shine in my role, and to lead the projects for a total of a month as they are jet setting. Long term, the experience will be great for my long term goals (become a SVP). 

  
How should I feel about this? I get paid extremely well ($250k+ a year), I am fully remote, go in the office 4x a year, and have 5 weeks of vacation. And I recognize that respect matters to me the most... However this economy sucks ass and our projects/products have a great shot of being purchased by a big tech company. I don't want to miss the forest for the trees so how should I approach my involvement with these networking events if they are also great for my career and development. Its hard to accept that they do not see me as someone that can speak for the company or represent them, even though Ive had senior leadership tell me I have ""it"" and that I am the only one that will go speak to our clients and mingle with them when we are at conferences. Am I not playing the favorite game well? 

  
Do they just see me as a worker - I work a lot, hard, and late, and I'm afraid that I am maybe being taken for granted. The person above me constantly haggles me in a passive aggressive but lightly coded way. I am under the impression that they are intimidated by me because even though I am a lead, I am fearless, I write better than them, and I am good looking. Part of me feels like it's a bit of ""star dampening."" I don't play the office politics game and people have complained that I am ""hard to crack"" - quite frankly I don't trust almost anyone in the work place so I keep most of my personal thoughts to myself unless its something so out of bounds. I do open up about my private life and my interests, but I am not a partaking the politics part./ Maybe that's what's holding me back",rrilesjr,0,0.33000001311302185,3,1756622737,2025-08-31 06:45:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n4nu5j/working_on_a_project_but_not_invited_to_the/,8,2025

Working within the infrastructure of a well-known national org for the same pay and with less responsibility sounds good for the nervous system, but I don't want to f*ck up my career especially given how challenging the current job market is.

1n4ltg9,Company financially unstable take paycut or quit,"
I work for a small construction general contractor. I was hired in April as an Ops VP. There is only one other VP of Sales(who quit 3 weeks ago) and the Owner. Everyone under us is either contract or sales guy who gets paid on commissions. We have about 10 people in the org total. 

I didn't really dive into job costs or company finances Until about June. My first few months were fixing and streamlining broken processes.

Anyway I got the job pipeline running more smoothly then starting looking at costs and where funds have been allocated. This is where the cash flow eyebrows started getting raised.

Cashflow on jobs was questionable at best and I've been monitoring it since.

Fast forward to two weeks ago. CEO tells me he hasn't been paying himself for the last few months. I only find this out because One of our supply houses kicked back an order and told me our account was on hold and I raised the question. (This was resolved within a day) So I didn't think anything of it as far as the account goes as this is fairly common with credit lines.

Mind you our accounting system is tiered so I only have access to information I ""need"". 

Fast forward to Thursday this week. 

CEO calls me after hours and says we need to talk. Pretty hard conversation for both of us honestly. Long story short I was told I could take a 37.5% paycut with an increase in commissions roughly the equivalent amount OR I could find another job. 

Weighing options....",MasterStream,22,0.9100000262260437,33,1756615436,2025-08-31 04:43:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n4ltg9/company_financially_unstable_take_paycut_or_quit/,8,2025

1n4l18o,How would I go about speaking to my boss about communication problems?,"So some context, my company/my department got hit with multiple projects that require my boss to be more hands on with them. 

However, it’s really done some damage to the department I currently work for. Essentially, the department was left in limbo as my boss was working on the projects. 

Here’s where things get from bad to worse: since my boss has taken on those new projects, they essentially ghosted the department, only really responding whenever they need something from me. Not only that, whenever I do bring up something for them to make a decision concerning the department, I get no response and they still end up asking questions not relevant to the situation. These actions are causing the department to miss important deadlines. 

On my end, I try to set meetings with them to talk about these issues. However, they keep asking to reschedule and still not attend any of those meetings. 

I’m at my wits end but I don’t know how to go about this because the person I need to talk to does not communicate with me at all. 


Tl;dr:

I am having a hard time reaching out to my boss about everything within our department and it’s really going to bring out a lot of consequences in the future.

1n4kpy5,Quitting job to pursue school full time,"Hi Folks,

  
Im 25 working in a corporate position making around 90k CAD per year. My job is application support with a mix of business analyst duties. It's fairly easy, but I find myself feeling unfulfilled in my work. On top of that, my job is moving from 2 days in office to 4 days in office in the coming months. I would have to move to Toronto, a very high CoL area, to avoid a 2 hour commute (4 hours both ways)

I graduated with a biochem degree in 2023 and developed biochem related software as my capstone project. I have gained a fair bit of programming and overall technical systems experience in my current role and side projects. Now, I want to go back to school and gain a computer science degree. I hope to gain a strong theoretical foundation in computation to apply in the biochem space. My goal is to work as a software developer in biotech companies.

  
However, I feel I would be taking a big risk by quitting in this job market. My work is stable with a decent salary and growth opportunities, but wholly unfulfilling. If I pursue a CS degree full time, I feel I would essentially be at square one again, while losing 2-3 years of income and work experience, and potentially being out of work at the tailend of it (as many CS grads are these days).

I'd love to hear any similar stories from people who went through a similar dilemma as my own, taking a risk by leaving a cozy job to go back to being a broke college student in order to pursue their dreams.

1n4k85j,Anxiety over switching jobs,"Hi guys. This is going to be a long post...

So just a little bit of background. I was diagnosed with OCD and Depression back in 2020 and my whole world came crumbling down. I had to drop out from university and was admitted in hospital for suicidal ideations. When I came out, I managed to find a job. This job helped me to get back on my feet. I stayed there 2 years. 

Eventually, I decided to leave because it was a dead end job. The company products were bad and I didn't agree with their philosophy. I landed a job in an MNC, a pretty good one. But I fucked up.

I didn't know how to get along with people and I failed my probation and was left jobless. This left another deep scar on me as I never expected myself to be such a failure in life. I went back to applying for jobs. Somehow, I ended up in another MNC where I found what I thought was my dream job, as I really liked the system that I was working on. But then it was not to be...

I am still currently in this job. So this is my third job. But I am once again thinking of switching. Although I like the system, problem is the system is defence related and very restricted. I spend most of my time in the office just lazing around and playing games. So I started looking for other jobs.

Fast forward to now. I just finished interviewing for a company that I really hope I can get. But, for no apparent reason, anxiety started to kick in. 

What if I can't do the job properly ? They asked for a hands on person while I am more of a software person. What if I fail my probation again ? I don't think I can take another hit like that...

I don't understand. I've gone for like 5 interviews and this is the one that triggered my anxiety. Its not going away. I've popped more benzos to try and curb it but its not going away...

Can anyone please provide some sort of advice ? ",SignalAdagio3221,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1756610125,2025-08-31 03:15:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n4k85j/anxiety_over_switching_jobs/,8,2025

Day after I put in my notice I was having a conversation with a coworker who I have a shared interest in firearms with. I just bought an Israeli Weapons Industry X95 bullpup and referred to it as my “ethnic cleanser.” We weren’t even talking that loudly because I realize that not everyone is a 2A absolutist like myself and some people don’t like them. There was 5 other guys in the office while conversation was going on and 1 of them, who was a lead, overheard part of the conversation where I referred to congressmen as MAGA morons for not fighting for the repeal of the NFA so that tax stamps were no longer needed for suppressors and SBRs called corporate H.R. telling them(found this out later in the day) he told them I was engaging in decisive political talk while also threatening to shoot up the work place. My boss called me, informed me what was going on and H.R. said I didn’t need to fulfill my notice and not return to work. They weren’t going to investigate it, just told me to turn in my keys/badge and they’d send someone to my house to get them. The irony of the whole situation was the guy called H.R. claiming all this, basically held mini MAGA pep rallies 2 or 3 times a week during morning meetings with our manager(who is a MAGA boomer).

1n4io9d,"Just a toxic work environment, or infringing on civil rights?","Last year my department was a team of 3, now we are down to a team of one, me. HR met with me and told me that my role won’t be changing even though it changed when one of my team members retired and I agreed to take on some of her responsibilities. 
Now that my boss has also left, my role has changed more already and I told them that and they essentially disregarded that completely. 
After the meeting with HR where they told me they were frosting my boss’ position and my role wasn’t changing, and that I would now be reporting to HR they sent a follow up email going over what was discussed in the meeting and left out the part where I told them my role had already changed. I responded to the email with this: 
Hi name, 

Thank you for sending this recap and for outlining the interim support structure.

I do want to be candid that I am disappointed with this arrangement. Over the past four years, I have consistently expanded my responsibilities, noting since name’s retirement I've taken on the responsibility of visiting the high school to procure content for communications purposes, and have taken on critical functions such as district-wide communications and management of the website. These are core elements of the communications operation, yet I have not seen that work fairly reflected in either job descriptions or compensation.

At the same time, I have observed that others in leadership have received new titles and raises, while my contributions have not been similarly recognized. I want to be clear that this feels inequitable, especially given the level of responsibility I carry and the results I’ve delivered.

As the district makes a determination about the CCO position, I expect to be considered for the role. My experience, knowledge of the district, and proven ability to manage communications at a high level position me well for this opportunity.

I will of course continue to carry out my responsibilities under the interim structure, but I want it on record that I do not agree this arrangement reflects the value or scope of my work.

And I haven’t received any response since I sent it on August 19. That email was sent to both people in our HR department and the superintendent. 

A month before my boss left, they changed his title from director of communications to chief communications officer, with that he was given a new job description which listed multiple of the things I manage alone under his management. 

I manage 7 different systems for the district at this time and am making $60k and my boss was making $140k. They haven’t even offered to give me a raise or re-evaluate anything. 

Some women are treated differently in our district as well it seems. They recently promoted a man that was not qualified or experienced in facilities management to the director role and passed up a woman who has worked in facilities for at least 15 years and was doing the job when the previous person in that role up and left. She applied for and interviewed for it but they passed her up for a guy that had experience in IT. 

The woman that replaced the IT guy is getting paid 30k LESS than the man who was doing the exact same job. 

I’m stuck on what to do next, confront them? Consult a lawyer? 

I’ve been looking for new jobs already, and had a couple interviews, but I don’t know how long it might take for me to actually land a new job.

I have a Master’s degree in a subfield of psychology and landed this job at an opportune time when I was eager to leave my previous job due to a toxic work environment, low salary, my coworkers leaving in batches every other month, and overall burnout.

I’m currently a student at Desautels Faculty of Management (McGill), and I’ll have to declare my major next year. I’m trying to decide between Business Analytics and Mathematics & Statistics.

I enjoy math and I’m comfortable with quantitative work, but I don’t have a clear picture of the career opportunities that a Math & Stats major within a business program could lead to. On the other hand, Business Analytics seems more directly applied to industry, but maybe less rigorous in terms of quantitative depth.

I’m also wondering about the value of combining the two — for example, majoring in one and minoring in the other. Would this be a strong profile in the job market, or would it be better to focus deeply on just one?
I’d really appreciate any insights from people who have studied or worked in these fields. 

Specifically:

What kinds of careers are open to someone with a Math & Stats major in a business school context?

How does it compare to Business Analytics in terms of opportunities and long-term growth?

Is a combination of both majors/minors valuable, or does it spread me too thin?

I’m a senior full-stack engineer at a small consulting company (only dev on staff since 2017), working alongside a couple of electrical engineers, a couple of embedded engineers (all of whom are with the company since 90s), and a small electronic assembly operation. I’ve built/maintained our APIs, SPAs, CI/CD on AWS, internal tools, and some legacy desktop apps. The work has been broad, and I’ve had a lot of autonomy, but pay has stagnated since 2020, and there are no big-company benefits (no employer health plan, no 401k, etc.).

My family context: two young kids; my son has complex medical needs that require frequent appointments and periodic multi-week hospital stays. My spouse has also had a few extended hospitalizations almost every year since my son was born. My current boss is aware and very supportive (flexible WFH and time off on short notice), which I value a lot.

I’m considering moving to a larger company for better compensation and benefits, but I’m concerned about the reality of taking intermittent time off in a corporate or big business environment. I’m aware of FMLA/intermittent leave and that policies vary by employer/state; I’m looking for firsthand experiences and practical tactics. I just have a feeling that my family situation puts me at an unfair disadvantage to compete for experienced dev roles.

1. How caregiver-employees at larger companies structure work so intermittent absences don’t tank performance ratings.
2. What to look for in benefits/policies (intermittent leave, caregiver leave, care-coordination programs, backup care, health plan nuances).

I started working at my current company as a hard goods product developer in August 2024. The pay is good and they sponsored my visa. My manager told me at my year-end review to be more confident and take the lead, but it’s been hard because she’s super busy (Director level, 3 other associates under her), so I don’t get much feedback/training.

The company is majority white, everyone bonds over reality TV gossip I don’t relate to, and it feels fast-paced sink-or-swim with no HR department.

Since March 2025, my boss has gotten increasingly passive-aggressive. She’s shut down a lot of my creative ideas, and I might’ve made a mistake joking to a coworker that I thought she hated me. Later, my boss confronted me, saying she “heard through the grapevine” that I think she hates me. I denied it, but things only got worse. Now she barely speaks to me, gives me deadpan responses, excludes me from projects, and took two other associates (including one who started after me) to a trade show in China.

I work hard, but I’ve made mistakes. I feel my self-confidence is gone. I’ve never struggled this much in school or career. I can’t easily leave because the job market is bad and visa sponsorship is rare in fashion/home goods.

1n4guu0,"Feeling stuck between internship, new opportunities, and career uncertainty what should i do?","
 Hi everyone,

I’m a recent postgrad and could really use some guidance on my next step. Here’s my situation:

Current internship (remote, flexible): I’ve been doing a work-from-home internship for 3 months now. The work is good, hours are super flexible (I can work anytime of the day), and the company itself is nice. The con is that it’s just a 6-month internship and will end in December. After that, there’s no guarantee of a full-time offer, which makes things uncertain.

Opportunity 1 (remote, fixed hours): A recruiter from a global company reached out saying my profile fits some of their open roles. The drawback is that it’s a strict 9–6 job (no flexibility). Salary and details will be shared after the first interview.

Opportunity 2 (friend’s referral): A close friend told me her company is hiring for multiple roles and she can refer me. It’s also a good company, but I don’t yet know the exact positions or salary.

Other concern: Since my internship is WFH, I’ve been at my hometown post-uni and honestly, the lack of social life and interaction is getting to me.

1n4bioo,Help a tired zoomer out :),"Hi everyone,

I'm 24 years old and currently working as a team lead bookkeeper in an outsourcing company for US clients (based in Europe). The job pays solid for my country, but I mostly dislike it and find myself in a stressful environment.

I enjoy problem-solving and communicating with clients, but I really dislike looking at data, data entry, multitasking, project management, and working in a team or in an office setting. I'm looking for a career that offers less responsibility, fewer hours, and less stress, but ideally, I want to maximize my income while working remotely. I'm comfortable working for the international market and the US market.

Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind committing and working hard for my own business or something I truly care about, but I don't have a clear direction at the moment. I want to focus on my well-being until I figure things out.

Here’s a bit about my background:

Education: Bachelor of Economics
Skills: Outstanding English, great communication skills (clients find me trustworthy and a good explainer over calls), detailed and thorough, solid problem solver, responsible.
Interests: I generally don’t care about traditional careers or positions, as I think that’s for brainwashed people. Well, maybe I am exaggerating a bit, but I am sure you get my point.

I want to make the most of my life and work as little as possible on things I don't care about. Some topics I like include psychology, history, economics, language, philosophy, free and open-source software, data privacy, music, politics, and self-development.
I prefer jobs that won’t be completely replaced by AI within a short time. Ideally, I’d like to work flexible hours and fewer hours if possible, as I want to focus on having kids with my wife, figuring out my spiritual path, working out, having a better diet, and pursuing additional formal and informal education—things that actually matter to me. I barely have the energy for this with my current job, so finding work that suits me better will drain me less and free up my time and energy for the things I care about.

I would love to hear your thoughts on potential career paths or business ideas that might align with my skills and interests. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Were you or are you in a similar situation?

Thanks!",nucleargiraffe01,1,1.0,2,1756585197,2025-08-30 20:19:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n4bioo/help_a_tired_zoomer_out/,8,2025

Earlier this year, I took a different role into inside sales in the company and now have a new supervisor. I am a fully remote employee with a company office location about 40 minutes north of me (I used to go into this office daily before COVID, we became remote during COVID and never went back into office). I now report to a guy who also works remotely in another state. 

He has been asking several times about meeting me in person. I have already done this twice with him already this year, once in that office nearby me and once in a hotel for a day. He now is saying he wants to meet with me again next month but not in office and at a hotel again. He mentioned meeting him for breakfast, working for the day at the hotel, going to dinner, then possibly meeting again the next morning for breakfast before he heads out to the office. Not sure why if he's going to that office the following day anyways I wouldn't just meet him there....

More on my role- I am an inside sales rep mostly handling inbound quote requests. I guess he's going to watch me send emails and make calls again? It's like lol. It's also annoying to only be on my laptop and not have my additional two monitors that I have at home or would be able to use at the office.

1n4850g,Confused student,"Hey everyone, I’m looking for some career advice from those of you in the tech field. I’m 25 Y/O M. I’m currently studying computer science in Antwerp and have about two years left in my bachelor’s. After I graduate, I’m considering working here in Belgium for a year or two, and then I’d like to move to the U.S. for better work opportunities and income. 

Eventually, my long-term goal—maybe in 8 to 10 years—is to return to the Middle East, specifically Dubai, because that’s where there’s good pay for senior positions and it’s closer to home, I really wanna live in Jordan but the pay isn’t in the range that I’m looking for over there, but if any remote work comes into play that’s where I would be at in the end.

I’m a more hands-on learner and not a big fan of the academic route, so I’m trying to decide if going straight into the workforce with my bachelor’s is the way to go or if a master’s would really be worth it. I’d love to hear from anyone who’s taken either path and can share how it worked out. 

There’s a lot of noise around me about masters is such an important thing to get but in my eyes it’s just more work for 4 years and all it pays off is 1-2 years of shortening my plan while taking away a lot of my time between studies and work, at least that’s what I’ve gathered from the people around me who see a masters degree as some holy object haha. 

Just looking for a balanced view to help me figure out the best route for my goals. Thanks so much!

1n45y6v,Should I contact HR,"I was forced to resign yesterday from a position I really enjoyed. I started working as Loss Prevention for a large corporation in early August. I know that company's have the right to terminate your employment for any reason and I'm fine with that. The way I was forced out is where I have an issue. 

When I started, the first two weeks I was there, I worked with another Loss Prevention for at 5 hours total. This was one hour after orientation, doing computer training with one person, and four hours the second day where that just basically showed me around the store. My manager went on leave my third day so it wasn't addressed until like day ten when the district store manager came in and the store manager told them that I had basically been left out to dry. So, my manager l comes back and I start actually training with people. 

Fast forward two weeks, I'm getting comfortable with the position. Im current in my training as I get a new set of computer based training to complete every week. Everyone i talk to is so happy that the store has Loss Prevention again. I had even caught a couple shoplifters.  

I show up to work yesterday, and my boss has scheduled a meeting labeled as a touchbase for that morning. This was supposed to have been done my first week. Im assuming that it was just that. I hope on the call and he asks me how things are going and I was honest with him saying that they were going well and that the store team is great but they feel the company is more focused on employee theft that shoplifters. At this point he says I'm glad you brought this up and goes on to say that he has eleven complaints on me. All of which are about how I've been yelling at associates in the store, yelling at the store manager, even following an employee around the store on their day off.  No one has said that I was doing anything wrong, or anything like this. I had even talked to my boss on Monday about how the broach issues with the store manager, as when I had brought anything up, she would brush it off as an ""anomaly"" and nothing to worry about. Nothing was mentioned about any issues on this call. 

I tried to tell my manager that none of this was true, that I hadn't even raised my voice at anyone, let alone yelled at anyone. Anything that had been brought up had been started with, "" i may be in the wrong lane here, and please tell me if I am...""

My boss told me that if this goes to hr I would be suspended without pay and then asks how this would look to HR with eleven complaints. I tried to tell him to check cameras, but he said that they dont record audio. He told me loss prevention is a small industry, and how would it look if I had a misconduct on my record. He then said I could resign and avoid all of this. I asked if I could have a few moments to think about this but he insisted on an answer then and there. 

With all of this, something doesnt add up, as the normal associates dont communicate with my manager. Not to mention, if I was yelling in the store, someone would have surely brought that up to someone at that time. Like if you break all of these complaints down, none of them hold any water. Im thinking of calling hr, as none of this makes any sense. Not so much to get my job back, but just to figure out what the he'll is going on. Any advice is helpful.

1n45sx9,"Career advice: Integrated Resource Planning at a large utility, or demand response/virtual power plants for a private company","

Hi all, I’m weighing two career paths and would love some outside perspective.

Right now I work at a company that aggregates distributed energy resources (DERs) into Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) and participates in demand response programs. I just got an offer from my local electric utility to join their Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) team.

For those familiar with these areas, what do you see as the long-term upsides and tradeoffs between staying in the DER/VPP space vs. moving into utility-side IRP? 

**From my point of view:**

VPP space pros: 

* Lots of growth potential: It's a new enough frontier, FERC order 2222, and people will continue to adopt home batteries (hopefully), smart thermostats, etc.
* Interesting problems and tech stack: It is non-trivial to orchestrate DERs to get the most value out of a VPP. Current programs offered for DER participation currently rely on simple DR, but VPPs have so much more to offer. 
* I get to learn a lot: This is subsequent to my first point - it's a new frontier so there's room for a lot of experimentation

VPP space cons:

Only cons I can see are specific to the company I work for - I'll refrain from elaborating here.

\[Potential\] Utility IRP Pros: 

* As I see it, IRP gets to touch a little of everything, including getting to interface with the utility's DR/VPP programs
* Interesting work - I'd imagine that the work can be pretty challenging at a time with load growth and technology disruption
* Lots of learning - I'm not trained in power engineering so I think there's a lot to learn from transmission planning to distribution planning etc, this excites me

 \[Potential\] Utility IRP Cons: 

* Slow moving - utilities are known to be less fast-paced than other types of orgs

* Bureaucracy - this is really coupled to slow moving, they are known to have lots of red tape around everything.

I am trying to weigh my options and understand which route has more upside potential in the long-term, so happy to hear any insights, opinions, etc. I’m especially interested in growth opportunities, impact, and overall career trajectory.",iheartdatascience,1,1.0,2,1756570996,2025-08-30 16:23:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n45sx9/career_advice_integrated_resource_planning_at_a/,8,2025

1n45btu,Should I take the RA opportunity?,"Hi everyone!

I'm new to Reddit, so I'm trying to post on different subreddits because I really need help. Apologies if this is long.

I'm an undergraduate student, and I was just recently offered an RA position for one of the labs at my university. I am really, really interested in their work, and I think it would be great experience. However, the position is unpaid. I know it is common for undergraduate research work to be unpaid, but I am stuck on whether the opportunity will be worth it.

For some context, the position will require me work for a total of two semesters (beginning this semester). To add, I'm almost sure i would NOT get any course credits for this specific lab (because it's not a requirement for my major or minor), and I only get a letter of recommendation at the end of the two semesters.

And to be clear, the work itself isn't *too* difficult. I would be responsible for handling the test subjects (rats), conducting the experiments, and collecting the data. I'm expected to work 9-10 hours a week where I would be at the campus lab for only one day out of the week to conduct the experiments + another day to attend an hour long meeting with the other PhD and undergrad researchers.

My predicament comes here. Like any other college student, I am in desperate need of making money, so I really want to get a paying job. Because of my visa status, I was only able to recently get work authorization (I'm in the U.S), so despite my age, I have practically no work experience other than some volunteer work here and there.

I have applied to other jobs, but I have been rejected from majority of them. I am almost confident it is due to my lack of work experience. I understand everyone has to start somewhere, but my worry is that if I pass on this position, it might hinder my ability to get future job opportunities in my field. However, I do not want to spend the next year working an unpaid position when my main priority other than school is to bring in money.

Some people I have spoken to expressed that they do not think this would be worth it, but I want to get some other opinions and advice from people who have also worked undergrad RA positions or from anyone in general.

1n44r0r,Opportunity in West Africa Advice Needed After My MSc,"I’m about to graduate with my MSc. For context, I’m 24, from the UK, and during my MSc I had the opportunity to travel to a west African country for fieldwork. While there, I was able to do some networking as a result I’m now in the final stage of the interview process for a role in the renewable energy sector in that country which is basically continuation of my MSc thesis focus - the role involves doing project finance (which is the area I want to build my career in), client engagement, and ESG.  To my knowledge I'm the only candidate being interviewed.

Before my MSc I only worked for a year, so I don’t have loads of experience, but this position would mean working across three countries in West Africa. The salary is around £40–45k, paid into a UK account, which is significantly above the local average wage. The package also includes private healthcare. I see it as a fantastic opportunity. The job also offers 15 days’ holiday a year (it’s a US company, so not as generous as what I’m used to in the UK). However, there is some flexibility: I could work remotely for 2–3 weeks before a holiday - which makes little holidays alot better.

At the moment I live with my parents, and I’ve been in a relationship for three years. It’s already long-distance, but nothing on this scale. She’s supportive but understandably concerned.   
I see this as a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I feel I’m at the right age to take it. At the same time, I’m honestly quite scared. The positive side is that I have a strong support network at home, so moving back later would always be an option. I just don’t want to look back on my life and feel like I haven’t really *lived*.

1n44ipx,Is a biotechnology degree a good idea for me?,"**Hey everyone!**

I’m in my mid-20s and going back to university for a bachelor’s. I did my FSc in pre-med, so I already have a background in biology and I really enjoy the subject.

Recently, I also tried a bit of web development online and found that I actually enjoy programming (though I know I’m still at a beginner level). For software engineering I’d need to study math from scratch, but I don’t mind that, physics is the more difficult for me.

1n44h3k,Can I get some career advice?,"Hello everyone, I’m in need of some advice from someone, because I’m kind of just lost on what I can do.

I dropped out in the 11th grade, but immediately got my GED with a 3.6 GPA and got to work in factories. I hopped in and out of jobs just trying to find the right place. Tried all kinds of factories, retail, sales, starting my own electronics repair business, etc for years. I got really good at doing a lot of things, but it’s not like I have any certs or anything for these things, so to employers, it means nothing. 

I’m now 27, have had a solid job since 2022 being a Solar Technician for a local solar site. I got into it by the grace of God, and I was miraculously hired for it. They preferred education, and I didn’t have much to show them being a dropout, but they took their chance on me.

I repaired things on the site that have never worked since it’s commissioning, I’ve found ground faults in the field in hours when it would take the others days or a week. I exceeded expectations, and I loved my job. I was headed for a technician 2 raise, and then something unfortunate happens. 

I got out of the truck to go check on something in the field without putting my boots on, and the customer rolled up and saw me, and called a stop work because of unsafe conditions, and the customer of the site banned me from the site, and that led to my job firing me. 

I’m now on unemployment, but it is a third of the way done, I’ve applied to over 20 jobs and have had 1 interview with no luck. The only thing I have to show for myself is a letter of recommendation from my previous job, and my nearly 3 year tenure at a solar plant. The same company owns all solar plants within an hour of me, so solar is now out of the question unless I move. 

I’d love to do some technician/repair work, but factories depress me, and that’s pretty much my only other option. I love IT, but don’t want to do schooling and get more debt, I don’t have anymore savings. 

I think I’m screwed unless anyone can think of some close alternatives I’d be able to transition into, but from right now, looks like it’s time to start over from the bottom.

1n43vup,A good word situation has suddenly turned toxic. What should I do?,"I took a job 10 months ago and wasn't sure at the time if it was the best fit. But, I was pleasantly surprised by the work and my immediate colleagues and direct reports. I was hired in with another person - same position,  different division but same immediate boss. About 7 months in, she is placed on a PIP with no explanation then fired for failing to meet probation period expectations in July (probation period is 1 full year from hire which is ridiculous).

I was shocked. And then immediately started worrying about my future at this job. 

Everything was okay for a couple weeks. And then the nit-picking started. My boss made weird comments about things she's never brought up before (I sighed in a meeting which she found disrespectful and I don't believe actually happened). She is notorious for not being very responsive, frequently holding onto to work turned into her causing missed deadlines on my part (and other colleagues). She is poor at communicating and doesn't directly state expectations or deadlines. And she gets angry when information about how a process works in my division that is against how she thinks something should be done. My boss is hands off until she isn't. 

The other day, she strolled into my office and put me on a PIP. I have 80 days left in my probation period. Prior to this, there had been no issues communicated with me about my work product or performance. I have great working relationships with my direct reports and immediate colleagues. I have a great reputation within our division and my boss's supervisor has often told me I'm doing well. So, this all feels a bit out of nowhere.

I've recently learned from others that my boss has a very negative reputation throughout our organization for this exact behavior. Unfortunately, I have absolutely no confidential recourse to address this issue. Her boss won't do anything to her. She is very likely to become more aggressive and retaliate if I complain. 

To demonstrate my boss's pettiness and vindictive behavior: my now former colleague who was fired attended a FREE training event at a professional organization we all belong to. Our boss went to the event sponsor to complain my former colleague shouldn't have been permitted to attend as she is no longer employed and this no longer a member of the organization. 

After discussion with my family, I've decided to seek other employment despite my short tenure in this role. I don't think it's worth the anxiety to continue working for an aggressive and toxic woman.

Full disclosure: I am female and we're around the same age.

Any advice is appreciated here. Feeling pretty beat up.",Significant_Fox_9475,12,0.9300000071525574,20,1756566254,2025-08-30 15:04:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n43vup/a_good_word_situation_has_suddenly_turned_toxic/,8,2025
1n432eq,"Boss approved holiday pay, then reversed it after checking with his wife (who’s barely involved). Should I bring it up?","I’m working full-time and recently got a small raise. My boss has told me he values my work, wants me to stick around, and sees potential for me to grow at the company. I’ve been showing up, working hard, and doing my best to prove myself.

Recently, I asked about getting holiday paid for Labor Day. My boss immediately said yes — he seemed happy to approve it and said, “That’s totally fine with me.” But then he added that he’d check with his wife first. But the last thing he said was “it’s fine with me.”. 

For context: his wife is technically connected to the business, but she’s not involved in the day-to-day at all. She’s barely ever around and just recently started showing up here and there. After he talked to her, the answer changed to no holiday pay.

That kind of hurt. It felt like he wanted to recognize my work, and then someone who doesn’t see what I do stepped in and yanked it away. I don’t get PTO, insurance, or any benefits — holiday pay felt like one small way to show appreciation, so losing that stung more than I expected.

1n4214z,Is it possible to stay neutral and try to enjoy myself while I have this job?,"So I work as a software engineer. I enjoy my job and like the perks it comes with. I grew up kinda poor (or at least poor compared to my colleagues), so I’m honestly content and chill at the moment. This is me personally though.

There has been some more imposed structure from the higher ups, and I’m not going to lie their behavior isn’t the best. They’ve earned where they’re at, but they do seem dismissive to a lot of concerns and the workload has increased. They also kinda take the stance of they can do whatever they want while in there, which can be kinda brutal. One has taken the reigns and kind of has become the villain.

Then there’s another coworker who is incredibly perturbed by this structure and has been defiant. This guy also clearly doesn’t respect me professionally. He’s from one of those preppy schools so I’ve seen first hand just how talented he really is, but he is a bit of an ass. Still, I have done some work related things that have gotten his and others ire. Another guy seems to only get mad if I don’t do the work correctly, but is chill when it’s good.

Still these factions have formed. I want to remain neutral and not look like I’m brown nosing the higher ups, and I also want to put in enough work to not piss off my colleagues (especially the one who is coming at me). How do I do this? What’s the corse of action? I have been keeping an incidents list of both the major players just in case HR or another higher up comes to me and has something to say. Is that the right corse of action? Just keep head down and keep this document to protect myself? I want nothing to do with factions, I just want to be happy and enjoy myself bc growing up I didn’t really enjoy a whole lot of things (long story).",prettyg00d1729,3,1.0,2,1756561557,2025-08-30 13:45:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n4214z/is_it_possible_to_stay_neutral_and_try_to_enjoy/,8,2025

1n41ahk,Move or stay,"Hello,

So I've reached a crossroads, I have two job opportunities that are guaranteed in aviation. Both of them are management. One where I move to Texas for lower money (45k) and I have my foot in the door at the airline hub and the other one, I stay where I am and it's more money (54k). I've been wanting to move out of state for a while now and this would be a great opportunity to do it. 

The job in Texas, I would just be moving planes between gates and hangers which is something I really enjoy. The second job I would be a supervisor for a ramp, which has its ups and downs. 

If I ended up going to Texas, it would take a little bit longer to get to my current career goal. Where if I stay here I can get there in about 2 years. 

Family wise, I don't have family in Texas which for me is a plus as I'm the reliable one and it's starting really wear on me. I took care of Mom for 12 years before needing to move out for my on sanity. She is elderly and has learned helplessness. I don't feel like I can live my own life here. If I stay, I have more time to try to get her into a nursing home. If I leave, I feel like I'm abandoning her.

Time wise, I have about 2 weeks to decide, I am on the last extension of my lease. After October I well either need to leave or renew for another year.

I am a 32-year-old man. I never really got to be selfish and missed most of my twenties due to being a caretaker. The money isn't really important to me as as I am financially stable.

I probably left some stuff out that I'm not remembering. So if you have any questions. I'm just not sure what route to take and would like some opinions. Thanks.",xiflip,2,1.0,6,1756559508,2025-08-30 13:11:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n41ahk/move_or_stay/,8,2025

1n4130h,Career Dilemma,"Hey everyone — I could use some outside perspective on a big decision.

A little background: I’m in my early 30s, work in healthcare finance/strategy, and just finished my PhD in business (focus in healthcare/strategy). I also teach part-time as an adjunct. I enjoy the finance/analytics side of my work, but I’m also a people person and can see myself thriving in operations leadership too.

I have two offers on the table, both paying around the mid-$100Ks with bonuses — but they’re very different paths:

⸻

Option 1 – Regional Director of Operations
	•	Director-level role, lots of visibility.
	•	Travel-heavy at first (visiting hospital sites), then less ongoing.
	•	CEO personally wants me in the role, but two senior leaders I’d report up to aren’t thrilled (not because of me personally, but because higher-ups are pushing them to give me the job) → so some political headwinds.
	•	If I perform, could move to Regional VP in 2–3 years and keep climbing the operations leadership track (potential COO/President level down the line).
	•	Upside: Fastest track to big titles and higher compensation, direct leadership experience.
	•	Downside: More stress, constant site/client issues, and some politics to navigate.

⸻

Option 2 – Senior Finance Manager
	•	Finance/FP&A leadership role (reporting to my former manager, who was the best boss I’ve ever had).
	•	Fully remote, more flexibility and better work/life balance.
	•	Lots of financial modeling, board presentations, capital planning, and exposure to private equity and higher-level strategy work. They even offered to let me shadow clinical sites so I understand the ops side better.
	•	Likely to move into Finance Director within ~2 years, and potentially VP Finance/CFO track in the long term.
	•	Upside: Supportive leadership, strong career alignment with my PhD/research background, exposure to private equity/strategic work, more lifestyle flexibility for teaching/family.
	•	Downside: Slower title progression compared to the operations role, and the company may sell in 2–3 years (though high performers are usually kept).

⸻

So the trade-off:
	•	Ops role = higher stress, more politics, but a faster path to big titles and leadership in hospital operations. This is my current company and the CEO and COO personally want me in it. Almost feel like their mentee and I’d be dumb not to take it. 
	•	Finance role = steadier growth, very aligned with my long-term finance/strategy goals, great mentor, more balance — but slightly slower climb and some uncertainty due to the company’s potential sale.

⸻

If you were me — would you chase the fast-track ops leadership role, or take the finance path that’s more aligned with long-term strategy/CFO goals and offers more balance?",Lower-Cupcake-703,1,1.0,2,1756558917,2025-08-30 13:01:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n4130h/career_dilemma/,8,2025

After 3 interviews for a job opening in a large multinational company I got today an email from recruiter telling that the hiring process is temporary paused due to organisation changes and they will reach out once they will be ready.

I feel that the hiring manager selected me but I am slightly overqualified for the role I applied (and so I might have salary expectations higher than the range) and they didn’t manage to upgrade the role or the budget in the last 3 weeks that I have been waiting for the feedback, however this is just a perception, the director department changed so it’s also possible that he blocked new hirings or something like that.

How long and how many people does it usually take to upgrade a role and/or increase the budget? I ask this because if it’s usually a smooth process than I can deduce the real reason is probably due to organisational changes.

And how likely it is that an hiring process paused will resume?

1n3ziwg,How did you land into this career path? What is the process to get there?,"I didn’t start with much. Just a diploma, a dream, and ₹800 a month. Coming from a middle-class family, that first job wasn’t glamorous but it was mine. It taught me humility, discipline, and the quiet power of showing up every day.
While working, I pursued my Bachelor of Computer Science not because it was easy, but because I knew it was necessary. Balancing studies and work wasn’t a challenge it was a lifestyle. And when I finally completed my degree, it was my friend Ganesh who helped me land my first IT job. That moment changed everything. It wasn’t just a break it was belief. Years later, I found myself in Singapore navigating global teams and new cultures. It was exciting, expansive, and everything I thought I wanted. But one day, I felt something deeper than ambition . A longing not just for a place, but for belonging. I returned to India, not because I had to, but because I chose to.
Today, I work as VP at Barclays But titles don’t tell the full story. Behind every milestone is a mosaic of moments some triumphant, some quiet, some deeply personal.
And at the center of it all is my mother. She didn’t teach me values by preaching them she lived them. Integrity, kindness, resilience. Her lessons weren’t loud, but they echo in every decision I make.
So yes, I’ve built a career. But more importantly, I’ve built a life rooted in for the people, the places, and the principles that shaped me.

1n3z1k6,Help/advice needed,"TLDR - Having issues at work and need to move to a new job but really don’t know where to start, under a lot of stress at the moment.


Ive worked in the UK for a company I don’t wish to enclose for the last 10 years within the same team.

I have very niche experience that I don’t think easily lends itself to a move somewhere.

My salary is 40k per year but I receive around 10k as part of a roster agreement and also get overtime to top this up, last year I made around 60k.

I have a mortgage and my first child on the way.

Over the 10 years in this team I’ve worked my way from entry level to where I am now and during that time I have tried my absolute best to always deliver good work and help anyone who needs it.

The company is hugely affected by nepotism and almost everyone who works here is related to someone or friends with a manager etc etc.

Recently the company has been under investigation for fraud as basically people have not been working their hours and going home early, this was reported and the investigation is still on going.

When this investigation was announced I very quickly came under scrutiny by a large portion of the team as it was seen that this investigation wouldn’t affect me as I hadn’t taken any part in these activities and so that made me guilty. This wasn’t helped by comments made from management about myself or things I had said being taken out of context to prove my involvement.

For example guys were told to take company vehicles home (I wasn’t made aware of this) and operated to the standard that this wasn’t allowed, this then made it appear as if I was trying to stop it happening, when I simply didn’t know it was given the green light.

So now in the team I am very much a pariah, nobody speaks to me or even acknowledges that I am there most do the time. I say good morning to people being polite and I am met with frosty silence.

As this has affected me more and more and since the accusations I have really made effort to distance myself from everyone in the team and not put myself in-front of them. I seen this as the path of least resistance, they don’t want to acknowledge me and I don’t want to be around them, we all win.

Recently I’ve been taken aside by my manager who has said it’s clear I’m avoiding interaction with the team and this can’t continue, the problem needs to be resolved. However my only issue with this is nobody has actually told me there is a problem and any time I’ve tried to address it people say there isn’t one.

This was under the guise of a chat for my benefit, but it has been followed up by an email making it clear I need to communicate better and “work my hours” so I now feel I’m being accused of not doing my job.

I can’t go to anyone above my manager as they are all good friends, I don’t even feel confident in a trade union or HR person as I’m not exaggerating there is all but no independence in review of these things it’s always someone who knows someone.

I’ve been offered external mediation but I feel this will only worsen this as is often the case with people trying to bully someone, if it’s then reported it becomes worse.

Ultimately my goal is to just leave and start afresh somewhere as very often I start to believe 
The way I am treated and it has a huge affect on my mental health outside of work.

My main issue is trying to find a job which will allow me the same money as I, like everyone else have bills to pay and can’t really afford to take a pay cut but I also can’t go on like this. I can’t be in my late 30s wanting to cry at my work.

I’ve always been really sociable, big group of friends outside of work, get on with everyone in other teams and I find it really hard to understand how I’ve ended up here.

My best explanation is that because I played by the rules while everyone else broke them the team has now all but been told it must have been me that put them into this mess and they are acting based on that, but I haven’t had any part in it.

Apologies for my ramblings I’m having a really rough weekend and becoming more and more stressed with how trapped I feel in this situation.

Any advice appreciated thanks!

1n3y1c3,[Ireland] Career Advice - moving into HR Sector,"Hi all, 

Looking for some advice on my career (stupid going to Reddit I know, but searching online is pulling me in 150 different directions) 

For context, I have masters in Communications & have been working professional jobs since 2018 so have good years of experience. Have been feeling directionless for the last 2/3 years for sure but now I know I want to transition into HR 
(I’ve gained experience with HR and would love HR in Pharma, as I have the healthcare background too) 

Having spoken to people in the HR industry, I’ve been told that a good (preferably CIPD recognised course) is all I need to do to upskill. I can do a part time/online one, as I’ll need to work still (also, my employer won’t pay for me to do one just fyi)

However I can’t decide which course/ which are considered the best in Ireland. Does anyone have recommendations or advice on this? 🙂",EAFlood,1,1.0,2,1756548927,2025-08-30 10:15:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n3y1c3/ireland_career_advice_moving_into_hr_sector/,8,2025
1n3xo2h,"Potential job, big pay cut?","I have been searching for a job in HR for less than 2 weeks and applied to maybe 15 jobs. I've got 7 years in the field so I'm trying not to take a step back in my career.

I had a phone screen with the an interview pending in the next couple weeks but now I'm considering turning down the interview. The title is the same as my last job, however I would be going from 100k, 3 weeks PTO, 17 holidays, 3 flex days, unlimited sick to a job that's 63k, unlimited PTO, 11 holidays. I did not ask about 401k match or other perks.

My husband is the breadwinner and makes about 150-180k a year but I know he wants me to not be unemployed for a long time. I just feel I should test the waters for a few more months before I settle. I have incredible anxiety over a recession and everyone saying this is a tough market. This is also the first time since college I've had any employment gap, it's always been job to job, and I've really lucked out in that regard.

Thoughts? We do have 1 kid in daycare so I really have to consider our family first. Is the job market that bad to where I need to take anything I can get? Im looking for a mid level HR job, generalist track.

For context, this job is $30/hr, my first HR job was an HR Assistant making $25/hr, nearly 5 years ago. I also carry my daughter on my insurance which I did not when I was being paid $25/hr.

1n3xb5g,Lingoda honest review | 3 free classes | 20 eur voucher,"

As many of you might be struggling with language learning too, I am also trying my best to conquer this Kraken called ""Deutsch"".

I studied on Lingoda, a platform where you can learn German, English, Spanish, Italian and French. Sign up with my link https://www.lingoda.com/en/referral/?url_everflow_clickid=3c734026bcc9464894741c8ffdbecead&utm_source=everflow&utm_medium=cpcontent&utm_campaign=Madalina+Lucaci&coupon=lingoda2025
And get 3 FREE classes during the trial period to test and if you like, 20 eur code applied afterwards.

My journey with Lingoda started in April 2023, I started with a Sprint, my advice: it's only worth it if you have the the certainty you can attend every f day, if not you will end up disappointed like me.

Lingoda, itself, it's a great platform with very good teachers, serious classmates and thorough rules that kind of ""motivate"" you to stay disciplined.


Try the first trial week for free!( 3 classes with a native speaker)

What I wished I knew as a beginner in Apr 2023:

1. **Orientation class is a waste of your credit** because it basically just presents the platform, DM me and I will send you a summary of what happens there and save your actual learning credit.
2. **If you like a teacher,** you can go to the that teachers board and book their classes, I swear having a class with a teacher I liked made the biggest difference.(My German recommendations: Agnieska, Ozlem, Julia, Branislav, etc).

**\*hint:** book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.

3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.

4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.

5. You only need to do **45 classes/50** to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy). **NEVER** skip in GRAMMAR classes because in my opinion are the most important.

As a comparison to Babbel Live, Lingoda offers more, the certificate is recognized and Lingoda has for B1 135 classes offer, while Babbel has only 36, focusing mainly on speaking.

My honest advice, when you want to take a break from Lingoda, **take 1 month of Babbel 1o1(150 eur),** unlimited( don't be fooled, you won t find so much time slots of available teachers, but you will have the chance to open up with speaking, sadly after 1 month, you will most likely do more than 1 level since they have around 30 classes/level, so think of it as a more freeing speaking classes, one month is definitely worth it, I liked Altayeb as a teacher).

If you are thinking about trying out Lingoda here is my referral link with **DISCOUNT CODE APPLIED**: https://www.lingoda.com/en/referral/?url_everflow_clickid=3c734026bcc9464894741c8ffdbecead&utm_source=everflow&utm_medium=cpcontent&utm_campaign=Madalina+Lucaci&coupon=lingoda2025 

I dig monthly for discounts because I am a cheap as that can't pay full price so I got most of the months 20-30% discounts on plans for 20-40 classes so the price/class stayed in 7-8 eur range which is cheaper than a class in my home country.

No hidden truth: you get paid for recommending Lingoda, but what I would offer you is a **free 30 mins presentation from my account** of their possibilities and my honest B2 from 0 feedback after many errors I wish I knew better.",Ok_Ebb_6545,1,1.0,0,1756546044,2025-08-30 09:27:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n3xb5g/lingoda_honest_review_3_free_classes_20_eur/,8,2025

With this I believe I have pretty good people skills and knowledge on how to make connections with people. I love working in a fast paced environment and take on upselling as a challenge all night long. With this in mind along with a love of cars I landed on service advisor at Lexus/BMW. Starting pay is around 45-55k and I Currently make around 85k/yr now but do not want to work in a restaurant forever. My fixed monthly expenses are right around $3300 and I’m just afraid with my spending habits I might shoot myself in the foot with this new job leap. I obviously will keep bartending on the weekends for some extra cash. Is there anyone that is currently a service adviser at a luxury dealer that can give me some advice? I also see this as a “real” career path I can pursue and essentially climb the “ladder” and potentially make a lot more than I’d ever make bartending.

1n3v0l0,I feel stuck and confused,"im in a very weird place rn, i took a gap year after 12th standard for some medical emergencies and important events and then i decided to give first attempt to my CA exams, which i messed up and theres another attempt approaching in sept but i didnt study for it cz honestly i felt like this is not what i want to do. Im also feeling confused that what if im burned out bcs i dont have the right environment to study, i cant study at home . But i honestly asked myself this question that “if i had the right resources and environment “ would i suddenly develop a new interest in studies? Honestly it didnt excite me at all, pls tell me if these r the valid thoughts or not? 

As i said i was doing ca i was enrolled in very mediocre clg or evn worst since i just wanted a correspondence bcom degree so that implies i dont even have a very strong academic background in terms of bachelors. Id have considered switching to CAT but idt it matters if i wont get into top B schools in india. 99 percentile is no joke , and when u dont have a strong academics ur just cooked. Neither do i have enough money to study abroad.

It almost feels like i don’t have anything  left anymore. What makes me even sadder is wasting my one year for nothing and maybe this year will go the same, in confusion, in dilemma. I know its pointless to talk abt smth which cant be fixed but it does bothers me a lot. Im just average in academics i don’t feel like i can do any good im academics. “Then do smthing of your interest” i dont know what interests me. I always tried to be good in academics that i didnt try anything which is exactly what im regretting now . 

I have realised im not that perfect student who sits consistently for study. I ve seen my studious friends and im nothing like them. I dont enjoy studying at all. I feel like if i continue CA it might drain me out. Idk my interests maybe i like smthing creative, smthing which isnt monotonous, smth where i can actually put my brain to work, new ideas, smth that wont exhaust my brain , smthing where i can use my communication skills. I just dont know what . 

I dont know what im exactly looking for. Solutions . Or to be heard . Im honestly very much stuck. I know I can’t just magically know where i have to actually work hard . I know i might even sound too lazy or stupid in this whole post but this is all i had in my mind.

1n3tbw7,"Really stuck in life, could use some advice","I'm having a really tough time finding a job nowadays after I was let go in the beginning of the year. For context I am 31M, and due to a death of a sibling II ended up getting a late start on my college education. I graduated with a 3.5 GPA in September, getting my BS in IT from an online school that was pushed so hard on us during the pandemic. I also have two years of experience in Tier 1 Help Desk for the military as a contractor. 

I know there has been a lot of outsourcing to other countries as well as AI reducing the need for help desk agents but it really feels like I can't get anything, not even Tier 0. I'm personable and usually end up making friends at work, I work hard, and have always gotten good reviews during my 1 on 1s. I would work at a grocery store or a restaurant but I injured my back a couple years ago (before the help desk job) working for a grocery department and so carrying/lifting are a bit of a problem for me. I hate to admit it, but I think getting my degree was a mistake; I got my Help Desk position without it, and now I have 45k in student loans looming over my shoulder, savings are depleted, and I have nothing going for me. 

I have tried finding alternate sources of income online to no avail. Everyone seems to have some kind of side hustle online but I can't seem to figure it out, as much as I try. 

Should I pivot to another field? Should I just swim out to the middle of the ocean and let the storm wipe my existence from the face of the earth? I just want to survive on a reasonable paycheck, have enough to cook a decent meal, have my weekend to spend time gardening or reading, and have enough to put away for retirement, but it seems so far fetched nowadays. I can't help but feel like these mega-corporations are downsizing with AI but we know for sure the C-suite level execs salaries aren't.

I’m moving to NYC soon for work and deciding between three spots:

* **Alphabet City** — East 6th between C/D, 3b/1b, \~$1425 Rent (Smaller Room)
* **Lower Greenpoint** — 100 Calyer Street, 3b/1b, \~$1617 Rent
* **East Williamsburg** — 80 Beadel St, 2b/1b, \~$1500 Rent (Quite a few amenities)

Commute: I’ll be working out of **North Williamsburg (near Mindspace)**.

* From Alphabet City: \~35 min on the bus
* From Greenpoint: \~10 min walk, 5 min bus ride
* From East Williamsburg: \~25 min on the bus

About me: mid-20s, in **software sales**, very focused on **career growth, networking, and building my podcast**. Fitness and personal development are big parts of my life. Socially, I care about being around **ambitious people and having strong dating options (attractive women, good social energy, etc.)**.

My hesitation:

* Alphabet City = central, social, more nightlife, but longer commute.
* Greenpoint = incredible commute, room isn't as nice and is towards the higher end of my budget.
* Beadel St = nice rooms, but I’ve heard that area can be a bit boring. Not the easiest commute either

If you were me, which would you pick given these priorities?

I have been working in a company for past one year my manager has that cruel mother-law vibes and she literally taunts sometimes like that. She misuses her power a lot many times for her personal vendetta.

I tried to be nice with her and it worked for a few months but because of change in that equation this male employee got more personal with me using my things without my permission, commenting on me and sometimes they both bulley me together calling it fun. I had enough so I tried to create boundaries with this male employee and my equation with the manger remained same but now from last week because of this she started to behave rude pointing out mistakes in work and talking rudely not properly addressing work related questions.

1n3q8c6,Manager's shortcomings are blocking team (and my) growth,"TL;DR -- my manager has hit his ceiling, can't see that he's making our jobs harder, and I'm out of answers.  

He's kind, well-intending, hardworking, imaginative, and found success years ago when the company was in a different industry producing different products.  As such, he now he now has a large team, and (understandably) believes he should double down on the skills and approach that got him there.  His technical background and skills are slightly different vs. what we're responsible for now, but although we're in R&D and have niche domains, that doesn't have to preclude him from being a good leader. 

The thing is, he's a tornado.  He has bad instincts; sees issues that don't exist, prioritizes things that don't matter, and somehow doesn't understand how much time things take.  He's not actively solving pain points or simplifying things for us, but instead constantly churning up new ideas and directing us (typically me) to spin up new programs to operationalize them.  

""No big deal,"" you might think, ""Communicate constraints and manage up; we've all had to endure hapless leaders before.""  Sure, but his approach and instincts are hard-coded into his brain, and I can only come up with so many ways to gently tell him his ideas aren't worth pursuing.  And when combined with a strong work ethic, insulation from frontline realities, and confidence born of past successes, that makes for a ton of useless work.  I've been in meetings and on emails where his manager or peers have bluntly told him ""too much detail"", ""need to simplify"", and ""what are we solving for here?"", which is especially painful because I give him that exact feedback all the time (one example: ""Well, based on past interactions, Jane will probably have X reaction to this proposal; should we address that in the deck now, before we present to her?"").  My peers duck him or tune him out when he starts churning, and have told me they don't know how I manage working so closely with him.  His peers and higher have privately told me they avoid working with him given his inability to simplify, focus, and deliver, and that they rely on me to be his whisperer, of sorts.  Which feels like a lose-lose situation...if I somehow manage him well and he/we deliver, he'll get credit for it and a renewed confidence in his approach...but if I fail, our team has to work harder just to keep pace, and eventually I start to look like I, too, am focusing on all the wrong things (even I'm doing so against my own instincts, at his behest).

The government will always need the products we build, RIFs have literally never happened, and we have a pension (I know, we're lucky), so he, his boss, and my peers all have little incentive to rock the boat.  But it's very hard for me to watch him consistently make our jobs harder, hinder my growth/trajectory, and cost us credibility.  It's hard for me to pitch him a project, hear it's not a priority, finish it anyway to broad acclaim...and *still* have him not internalize that and change his ways.

Other than finding a new job or new ways to manage up (I've tried so many), any advice?  I've considered pitching me splitting out of his group and reporting to his boss, but that seems so dicey, and since folks aren't rocking the boat I doubt it would fly.  I've also considered just asking for enough money that I can just live with it all (a ""Tornado Tax"", of sorts).

1n3q2vr,Got a new job - feeling like a jerk for quitting my current job though,"I want to post this to Reddit, can you shorten it if there are redundancies or areas where we can reduce the length of sentences etc.

To cut to the chase. I quit and came back to the job I’m currently at. Worked there 5 years the first time and 3 years this time around. In my first stint, I had a shitty manager until about 3-4 months to the end. I think they could tell I was going to quit, and gave me a new manager and a raise (I was insanely underpaid prior). I quit anyways for another job. That other job went to shit, and due to visa restrictions, I basically had to go back to my old job. 

The last three years have been tough for the company. Strong headwinds, lots of layoffs (over 50% now). I stuck it out though when I could have quit at one or two instances. My manager got me a solid promotion and two nice raises in these last three years, and it finally felt like I’m starting to get paid fairly. Regardless - the company is doing so poorly and the revenue stream that p aid my salary is gone. I’m basically on pure overhead right now in a failing company. I spent the last 2 months since we lost our revenue stream applying to jobs and found a great one. 68% higher pay in this one and it’s fully remote and I get more vacation. I literally couldn’t pass this job opportunity.

I feel bad for quitting when everyone is down, we’re a great team and I feel like I’m leaving them behind. My manager also invested a lot  in promoting me… how do I stop feeling like a jerk? I’m going to give them 3 weeks notice instead of two so we get a smooth transition.

1n3pb45,Billions lost every year to invisible cold chain failures – here’s how we’re fixing it ColorCold®,"ColorCold®, a patented technology that addresses one of the most urgent and costly failures in global supply chains: invisible breaches in the cold chain.
Every year, billions of dollars are lost in the pharmaceutical and food industries because shipments that look intact have actually experienced thermal excursions. Vaccines, biologics, insulin, frozen foods, even high-value perishables — all are at risk when a single break in the cold chain goes undetected. The result is product loss, regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage, and ultimately risks to human health.
ColorCold® is our solution. It’s a smart label that works without electronics, batteries, or expensive sensors. The principle is simple but powerful:
·        Activation threshold: 2.3–2.8 °C (calibrated with PCM C13/C14).
·         Irreversible visual shift: beige (inactive) → green (cold, compliant) → red (breach, irreversible).
·        Coverage: from 5 L vaccine packs to 40 L pallets.
·        Unit economics: $0.003–0.016 per box — truly scalable.
·        Compliance: GDP, HACCP, FDA-ready.
·        Validation: 18 controlled lab trials, ±0.1 °C precision.
The label cannot be reset. It cannot be “tricked” by re-freezing. Once it turns red, it is forensic proof of a breach. Adhesives can be tamper-evident, and each batch can carry QR/lot codes to ensure traceability.
Why does this matter? Because global logistics and pharma companies are under immense pressure: regulators demand transparency, customers demand guarantees, and CFOs demand lower losses. Existing electronic trackers are expensive and impractical for mass deployment. Stickers that cost less than 2 cents per box — but provide irreversible proof — are the missing piece of the puzzle.
We are now opening licensing opportunities for strategic partners who want to be at the front of solving this global challenge.
The opportunity is clear:
·        Global cold chain logistics is a $300B+ industry.
·        Pharma cold chain alone is forecast to exceed $21B by 2026.
·        Food losses from cold chain failure are estimated at 20% worldwide.
·        Governments (FDA, USDA, DoD, VA) are increasing compliance requirements.
By licensing ColorCold®, a partner can:
·        Secure exclusivity in a region or sector.
·        Embed a patented, validated technology into existing supply chain offerings.
·        Offer customers not just compliance, but peace of mind.
·        Lead the narrative: “We are the company that solved the invisible cold chain problem.”
This is not open source. ColorCold® is patented and protected. But it is designed to scale through partnerships, joint ventures, and licensing models. We do not aim to compete with logistics giants, but to empower them.
We are already structuring partnerships in pharma, food, and logistics. Now, we are looking for visionary leaders who want to step forward.
Would you be open to reviewing our short dossier and exploring what a licensing partnership could look like?",TrustColorsBiotech,0,0.17000000178813934,2,1756517924,2025-08-30 01:38:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n3pb45/billions_lost_every_year_to_invisible_cold_chain/,8,2025

I never really knew what I wanted to do to begin with, but now I’m second guessing every decision I’ve made so far. I have limited choices as this is a small university, but I want to stay in the Business field because I don’t want to go back through college again, and I know Business degrees offer a broad opening to the workforce, which is a major reason I picked it to begin with. 

I was interested in Human Resources, but now that I know what it’s all about, I don’t know if I would be able to handle that everyday. I am pretty introverted, don’t like confrontation, get stressed out and overwhelmed EXTREMELY easily, but I really like the idea of learning about working with people and the psychology behind management.

I hate Accounting and Data Analytics and all that stuff, but I genuinely don’t know what to do with myself right now. I feel like I’m picking the wrong major, I just want a job that allows work-life balance, and where I’m not bombarded 24/7.

Do I need to just give up on the whole business thing and start all over and pick something else (idk what), or just stick it out and stay in Management, or pick something else like Marketing or General Business. HELP!

EDIT: Originally, I was interested in Psychology, Criminal Justice, and wanted to be a Teacher at some point; just stuff like that.

1n3mob1,"CEO is leaving, puts more responsibility on me, Job is easy, is it bad to want more?","TLDR: Job is easy even with added responsibility, is it bad to want more money?

So basically my current CEO (small company) is stepping down, in them planning their exit they are putting some additional responsibilities on me. My current job role is quite easy, with me finishing it in 4hrs or less a day most of the time. These new responsibilities are not really a burden as I have kinda of been assting them in it for awhile, just not direct responsibility. Now with them leaving and the full responsibility (and some additional tasks) being put on me I feel torn to ask for more. even with these added responsibilities, my time needed to complete work doesnt really change. I think my current boss knows that I have more space on my plate so I an unsure of how to ask for a raise, when there response could be  "" Its not like you do alot right now""  and for my original role I am being paid average. 

How can I ask and get more?

More info: I am salary. My current boss is generally very lienent on me. I show up late most of the time ( sometimes I stay late and work through lunch and i dont complain) If I need to take time for side hustles, or family they are very understanding, like taking an hour or so, and have even helped on some things.

I go with her to lunch and she’s always like, is that guy cute, is that guy cute. Oh he’s cute, do you think so? I just say no and move along because even if I did, I wouldn’t tell her. We have someone who is 4 levels above us and she’s trying to flirt with him even though he’s married. She keeps talking about how everyone at work is hitting on her, mind you she comes in once every two weeks and is in an office the entire day. I’m pretty sure she’s making it up because people there are super professional and I think she misconstrues flirting with being nice. This one guy was apparently flirting with her and she pointed him out and I already met him and he’s gay. Super nice guy but I guess she didn’t know because she hardly ever comes in. 

I was at a social gathering and I was talking to this guy who was doing work for this specific industry that just so happen to be related to my major in uni and I was asking him questions. She went up to us and I was asking about the wine he’s drinking because it was an interesting colour and she said “why are you after his drinking, do you want to marry him or something”. People heard it was so embarrassing I wanted to crawl out of my skin. I apologized to him and he seemed sympathetic but our conversation ended and I didn’t really get a chance to network. I feel like she fucked up my opportunity with him because his team is super interesting and I was hoping to pivot there after this project is over. 

My annoyance with her is I don’t want to associate with her weird fucking behaviour and I don’t want it to get back to me. She seems hellbent on ruining her career at this place and I don’t want her muck to get back to me. She’s also so useless. Always asking me to help her despite having less experience and her excuse is she has kids and she was to be available to them and pick them up and drop them off.  

I don’t know what to do here. This job is an amazing opportunity for me and will open so many doors for me. We both recently started at this area of our company after I was with a previous team and she’s very close to my immediate supervisor because they work other before my joining of the team so I can’t just complain to her plus I just started with this team.

I'm approaching 43, so not over the hill (hopefully), but I've an opportunity to move to a smaller competitor that the sales director went to, smaller team but a chance to get in 'earlier' and there's a bit more potential to move up the ladder further down the line (possibly 2 years or so).

Recently I put in my two weeks as I have been looking for other jobs on this one reason I was looking for other jobs because my boss is never online and you’re lucky if she responds to you, everyone on the team is related to my direct manager or her best friend There’s a lot of favoritism I’ve noticed.

1n3kwuk,Have an offer but I’m interviewing for something else that seems more interesting but could take a while. How do I handle this?,"Just for context I work in a sales type role with a fixed salary component.

Currently at Job A
Pay: 50% under market
Incentives increase that to only 25% under market.
Time in role is 2 years with 3 years at the company.
(First ever job)

Unhappy due to pay and increased expectations. But mostly pay. Variety of targets and products make it slightly difficult but balanced and have managed to build myself to where I’m improving.


Offer: Job 2
Slightly different role also sales based but more focused on a single product.
Pay: 15% under market. Lower than I had expected although the roles aligns with my career more.
Unsure about incentive structure or benefits.
Verbal offer. So nothing written yet.

Interview: Job 3
Still at the first interview stage. Something I’d be extremely interested in. But obviously not even sure I’d get past the first interview.

My current thought process:

Leverage the job offer to increase my salary at my current role and go through the interview stages at job 3. If I don’t get it then I still have a higher salary if I do then great!


My problem is it’s currently a verbal offer and they will only provide the written offer once I verbally accept. If I do receive an increase then great, if I don’t then I’ve already accepted the offer and I can move but that destroys chances for job 3.

I am working as an accounting executive at a start up. I report to my manager as well as the the director/owner of the firm.

The owner randomly asked me to do something I was not trained at. I said I will give it a try even though I didnt know how. He responded with “you can’t even a simple task like that.” Before I could even respond he started a email conversation with my manager, me and the other hire (alongside me) that we needed additional training. I did eventually figure out what to do and sent him the file yet idk it left such a sour taste in my mouth.

The worst part was that he included the other hire’s official email whilst he used my personal one. It felt like a big slight. 

I know he said we needed extra training but the month has ended and idk, he might as well fire me. I feel really bad. Idk what else to do.  I feel like I wasn’t even given a chance to perform.

1n3k20h,"New job, 6 weeks in, manager says I’m not catching on fast enough. Am I failing or just not trained well?","
I started a new job as an office coordinator about 6 weeks ago in a clinic. I came in with no prior experience in this role. There is a heck of a lot to learn. It’s a whole new world. 

For training, I had a trainer the first 3 weeks, but about a week in she put her two weeks in after a bad encounter with a patient. I honestly feel like she checked out mentally after that(understandable), so my training wasn’t very consistent or thorough. I was given a binder with written instructions,  which helps somewhat, but I learn best with hands on support. 

My manager has repeatedly told me he doesn’t think I’m “catching on as fast as past OCs” and “I’m not processing the things he says” for example, earlier this week, I was told I’d be leaving my office around 10:45-11 to go to another clinic. When my manager came in around 10:50, I asked him when I should start heading out and he told me to “wait till the clinic dies down” and since it was very busy and the phones were ringing I had to stay. Then came 11:30 and I checked in with him to let him know I’d be leaving. At that point he seemed confused and asked why I was still here. So I scurried out of there. 

The next morning, he confronted me about it and said they had told me multiple times to leave at 10:30 - 11. I know for sure he did not give me that time in the moment I asked when to leave, he just told me when the clinic died down. Just the vague instruction to leave when things slowed down. But he was adamant that I’d been told a time and made it sound like I ignored directions. He told me he’d just chalk it up to me not processing what he says to me. When I DO. I am TRYING. So hard. 


He also compared me to previous people in my role, saying they picked it up faster. In our weekly meetings, he has never once said anything positive, only critiques. Which is weird, because my coworkers tell me I’m doing amazing with what I’ve been given. 

When I tried to say his comment about me not processing felt rude, he insisted it wasn’t rude - just “professional talk.” He’s also said things like he’s “trying to give me the benefit of the doubt.” But like. This is my 6th week. What do you mean. All of this has left me feeling like I’m failing, and stupid and slow - even though I’ve been trying really hard, coming in early, and asking questions when I’m unsure.

1n3jo7f,"Stay at a job I love for less pay, or take a $25K raise?","I currently work as an Accounts Receivable Supervisor making $75K. I genuinely love my job and my boss — she’s incredibly supportive, always has my back, and goes out of her way to accommodate things like extended time off so I can visit family overseas. I feel valued, respected, and actually enjoy coming to work every day, which makes it easy to give 100%.

This year, my company implemented a standard 3% annual raise policy, but in my last review my boss went out of her way to get me approved for a 6% raise instead.

The dilemma: I just received another job offer for $100K — a full $25K more. The money would definitely make a difference for me financially but I worry about giving up a workplace I truly enjoy.

So here’s my question:
	•	Do I stay where I’m happy and supported, even though the financial growth is limited?
	•	Or do I take the big raise and risk losing the great environment I currently have?

For more context, I’m 28 years old, single, no debt, and really only financially responsible for myself.

Thank you very much!!

1n3ji1t,Looking for feedback from hiring managers or others who’ve taken the risk,I am in a manager role at this time (5 years in role) and seriously debating if I should apply for a director level role. I am comfortable in my current role but I’m really not learning anything new - my current role is operations based and works with other departments so I’ve built good relationships within the business. The new role is more on managing a program within the division - it’s a program I currently already have visibility in but now will be overseeing it instead. It would also include supervising another employee which I don’t have any experience in. It is a stretch opportunity for me from my perspective but it’s also a very exciting opportunity for me to grow in an area that I really like - I just don’t know how it will be received from a hiring manager’s perspective in terms of my experience. I’m reaching out to the actual manager that I would be potentially reporting to as this is an internal posting - to learn more about what the role really entails and what their vision for the role is but would love to hear from others who’s been in a similar situation where they’ve applied for a stretch position and regret/didn’t regret or how they’re doing now career wise.

1n3jfnw,Feeling guilty for leaving my current job,"So I have worked at my current role for almost 3 years and I truly love the company and the people. It is a pretty horizontal structure with not much in the way of upward mobility. I have been a team of one and have been a self starter on refreshing the company's branding, leading their social media, running influencer campaigns, content curation, etc. However I don't want to work in social media for much longer. I had social media internships, and then have done 4 years of social media management (1 year at an agency, and these past 3 years were in house). 

I got offered a role that is much more in line with what I want to do long term (I think) I want to move towards Creative project management, brand management, or creative operations. My current company doesnt have any roles like this except for the one I'm currently in (mostly social with a touch of brand) In this new role I'll be at an influencer marketing agency acting as the project manager between clients and the influencers helping keep them to the creative brief (I used to use creative briefs in graphic design classes and LOVE them). 

At my company I’m also one of very few people who goes into the office and everyone is in a very different stage of life than me (they’re all 40+ and live in the suburbs, I am 25 and JUST moved to the city) my new company is in the city and with many more young coworkers! So I’m hoping to make friends!

But I am very close with my boss (family friend) and co workers at my current company, many of them have been there for 20+ years and I think they were all shocked and disappointed I'm leaving and I don't want them to feel abandoned. How do I stop feeling guilty, will they hate me forever?

Hoping you might be able to give me some advice. I work freelance but am applying for jobs. Aim is to get a decent salary at a reputable organisation etc. 

I have a spreadsheet where I'm putting down jobs I see, reaching out to people I know etc. 

My issue is with sending in applications. I feel incredibly nervous and insecure, to the point I feel depressed and start to cry. I get overwhelmed with anxiety and feeling that I'm not good enough for the job, or panicking what if I do get it and it's not right for me. 

Now that I look back it's always been this way. 

I'm not sure if it's because I come from a family with long term unemployment + minimum wage work when a parent has had a job. I'm not sure if this could be one reason why.

A day later, I was invited to interview for position B in my current town that pays way better and I think would be a better fit for me. It is with a different department in the same state government.

Position B called after my final interview yesterday and said they intend to make an offer pending reference checks, which I know will be fine. But they have not made any offer, conditional or otherwise, in writing, and we're getting to the end of the week here.

Do I go in Tuesday and just tell them my situation? I could theoretically still fill position A for the month of September until position B starts; is that a reasonable offer to make? Or should I just call them this afternoon before the office closes and tell them I won't be starting?

P.S. I'm definitely taking position B if/when it is offered, so I'm just trying to figure out the most professional thing to do with position A since I don't have an actual offer yet.

1n3ik9y,I don’t have the personality type of other administrative assistants and I feel I get punished socially by my coworkers for it,"Most admins I’ve interacted with are very Type A and like for that to be visible. They’re also a little on the quieter side and like to focus on the more practical details of things. This is the personality type I’m referring to and it based off of my own work experiences. 

You guessed it - I’m the opposite. Super Type B and I have a very laidback vibe than most admins I’ve interacted with but this doesn’t keep me from being good at my job. I have reputation at the firm for being “on it and on top of it” their words, not mine) and my reviews are always glowing. I might not have the same sense of urgency that a Type A person would but I have the common sense to know people want things done well and quickly. 

But tbh I feel a bit of a weird vibe from the other admins I’ve worked/interacted with. Whenever a new person joins the team, I can tell they think I’m a huge fuck up and it takes 2-3 weeks of working with me for them to stop doing things like immediately following me and taking over organizational requests, or nervously assuring me they don’t need my help with their task but accepting it from another teammate, or blatantly ignoring advice I give them about how the firm works and who to contact. Usually this comes to an end because I will forcibly insert myself into a task of theirs so they can firsthand see that I’m not a dunce and after that, they always cool down and start to treat me like a capable teammate. They listen to what I say, leave me alone when I head back to organize the storage center, and ask me for help wayyyyy more than before. 

It helps once I do that but I do still feel the effects of it socially. For example, one of coworkers was talking about a YouTube series where said YouTuber visits a bunch of different locations and that they surprise their viewers with where they are during each video. I said something like “that’s super cool that it’s always a surprise” and they snapped back at me with “it’s so that they don’t get swarmed!!!” 
It seems minor but little quips like that happen all the time and I can see that it comes from the difference in personalities and how they feel about it - my coworker was instinctually inclined to look at the “how to” … and that’s not my first inclination. And that irritated her - Sure, I can figure out the “how to” quickly and execute it well/efficiently but … I don’t think about that first and I feel a bit of backlash from the team that I don’t have the same mindset. 

I’m not insecure about it - I do well at work, continue to grow in my role and responsibilities, and I’ve seen many EA’s and office managers that have a similar personality to mine. I know it’s not something that precludes me from admin work but damn I wish I fit in at work a little more. Is there anything I can do to make water cooler talk a little less painful?",outsidermcgeethrowaw,2,1.0,2,1756499873,2025-08-29 20:37:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n3ik9y/i_dont_have_the_personality_type_of_other/,8,2025

i worked a job for 4 years and had a terrible manager. Held on the the job for obvious reasons (wanted a promotion/money/didnt want to be a quitter) but I have been mentally burnt out so much by my manager and internal politics that I kind of checked out mentally from there. I am concerned about trying for another corporate job simply because i fear only the psychopaths eventually become managers which will lead to the same torture at a different place(also i feel it will require a lot of luck- to land a decent person). What do you think - am i being pessimistic ? Or am i too soft for this kind of politics/inhuman treatment ? Should i accept this and join the politics/play along? Its not in my nature to be that way but expecting people to be humane seems to be too much to ask for these days. Pls advise.

1n3enfa,"Career advice regarding a position in Hospitality, everyone is telling me to go for it, but my gut says no.","I've been working in my company since 2019. I work as a prep cook, and recently, my executive chef is temporarily moving to a higher position to cover someone leaving for Maternity leave.

I was informed of this earlier this year, and I expressed interest. I was told I'm the candidate that they are going for, but they will follow the proper hiring procedures so that their will not be any complications for my promotion. When I asked for further details, I was met with vague answers and corporate buzzwords like ""good for the resume"", ""promoting from within"", ""great potential"", etc. They also never mentioned my salary range, and dodged my questions regarding it.

The process finally started last week, and the job title changed. While they never mentioned a job title, I was under the impression that I would be temporarily inheriting my boss' current title of ""Executive Chef"" as I'm taking over his job. The position that they are now hiring for is ""Sous Chef"", which is the level below. When I asked about it, they mentioned that I will not be doing any of the ""management"" side of the job, just the food related responsibilities like menu planning and inventory, as any more respsonsibilities might pose as a conflict of interest. I'm currently part of a union, and sous chefs and above aren't part of it. When the coverage ends, I will go back to my current position as a prep cook in the union.

I'm kinda torn between, because I think the job is easy enough as I've covered my boss during emergencies before, but I'm certain that the company is using this opportunity to severely underpay me. Not to mention that I see no career advancement opportunities, as after my boss' coverage is over, I go back to being a prep cook. While I don't know the salary range even today, I was assured that it would be ""significantly higher"" than my current hourly rate. I could really use this money. 

Everyone around me is urging me to take the opportunity, but my gut is telling me that it's a bad idea.

I also had thoughts about term time apprenticeship or volunteer but it is not my dream career,just for the schedule.And pay is low than other jobs.
As I have a child and no help from relatives I want something fair pay after my apprenticeship and work life balance.

1n3dim3,First full-time job offer after part-time - how do I ask about salary?,"Hey everyone,

I'm 25 years old and at the beginning of this year I was looking to pivot from my last position. I had been self-employed running an online business, but I stopped after expenses caught up with me. I have a bachelor’s degree in something related to web development, so I still had some foundation in the field. Before applying, I spent a few months refreshing my memory by taking courses and building small projects.

That said, I had never worked an actual job related to my degree before this year. My past roles were being a library assistant and some marketing internships during college.

I spent about 6 months applying to jobs. After a bunch of applications and a couple of interviews, I landed an offer from a small company (\~20 employees + a few contractors). The job post listed a salary range of $50k–$60k/year. During the process they let me know that, due to budget issues, the role would start part-time but transition to full-time by the end of the summer. The part-time rate was $28/hr, 20–30 hours per week. I needed a job, so I accepted.

I started in mid-May and have been there for about 3 months now. I actually really enjoy it. It’s remote, flexible hours, friendly team, and no big stresses. This week, the owner told me the team likes working with me, I’ve been on top of things, and they want to offer me a full-time salaried position.

We had a quick talk about benefits (401k with 2% match, healthcare, PTO, etc.), and HR sent me the offer letter today. The base salary is $50k/year (With all the other things he mentioned)

Here’s where I’m stuck:

* My part-time pay ($28/hr at 40 hours/week) would be about $58k/year.
* The full-time offer is $50k/year.
* This is my first “real” job, so I’m not sure how to bring this up without sounding ungrateful. I’ve only been there 3 months, so it almost feels like I’m asking for a raise already.

How should I approach this conversation? Should I politely ask if there’s room to adjust closer to the $55–58k range since that’s what I was already making pro-rata part-time? Or would that come off wrong, given I’m new and this is my first full-time offer?

Any advice on wording or strategy would be hugely appreciated.",throwawaylogin56,1,1.0,3,1756488136,2025-08-29 17:22:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n3dim3/first_fulltime_job_offer_after_parttime_how_do_i/,8,2025
1n3d2mb,Remorse and the desire to prove myself.,"Hi everyone. My name is Nero. As you can understand im an artist who can still suffer from my own works. Im 19 years old. Im not a child or not a quite adult neither. This week i had a Fine art exams for university. And announced yesterday. I didnt win the university. At least this year. Next year i want to try again. I am still not proud from myself or my works. I drawing since im a kid. My teachers my family love my drawings but i am not. Everything I do seems inadequate to me. My family supports me every situtation and this is make me feel worse because i want to prove myself to them. Gaining some money or making a job. Because to my country, art is nonsense. And someone saw people who can draw, they say 'you are getting hungry if you still do that in the future.' because no one value art. First times my family did that too. They didn't send me a Fine arts (highschool version). And lately 2 years they changed their idea. They support me now. I dont want to say they are bad family. They just want to protect me even they dont care my dreams. I want to prove myself. 

They might tell you every day how beautiful your drawings are, but that's getting forgotten in 2 min. I want to prove myself in a tangible way. By making money or getting a job. I know I sound greedy, but I live with my family, and money has a stronger influence than flattery. But I don't have a network. I love drawing. Drawing is always feels like breath to me. But this year i noticed that my inspiration and passionate about art and drawing is slowly gone and im so scared. Studying for the Fine arts is worst. At least in this country. Animators, ceramic artists, designers and many other artists appliying the same exam. I don't think a realistic pencil drawing will be an effective exam for those who want to become an animator. I want to make my own manga or animation show. 

I know i talked a lot. I just want to prove myself to my family and making proud by my art works. I dont know what im going to do. There are a lot of scammers out there. Anyway. Thanks for reading.

1n3cmua,28 with a top degree but absolutely no desire to work in this field considering medicine/research,"Hi all, I ~~'m trying to keep this brief~~ tried to keep this brief, I didn't work out but I would still love your input :D 

***tl;dr: I (m, 28) got a Master in management with a minor in computer science but absolutely have no conviction let alone interest working in business. I have a study offer for medicine and am contemplating my choices.*** 

Disclaimer: I am aware that I am in an extremely privileged situation. I don't want to come off as unappreciative but even though I try to convince myself rationally that I just need to move forward with my path in business and earn money I cannot convince myself to do so. 

Long story: I always wanted to study medicine or psychology and help other people. My dad is a doctor and my mum a physiotherapist which is probably where I get that desire from. 

When I graduated high school they both strongly advised against studying medicine because how insane the job is, how much pressure it is and how it takes a toll on your life and your family lives. I applied anyways and didn't get a spot for neither psychology nor medicine back then.

For some reason, god knows why, I convinced myself to study management & computer science. Finished both B.Sc. & M.Sc with very good grades and had the chance to do stays abroad at top universities (think Stanford, Oxford). I worked a couple of internships from sales, product management, research to venture capital. 

I was miserables in basically all positions. It was usually a combination of the work feeling shallow, no one caring about deep insights and high-quality work, a work speed that was way too fast for me (I like going deep into topics and start-ups like to move fast and break things), combined with anxiety having to bullshit about topics, pretending everything is amazing and  interesting to me, office politics and building powerpoints & excel models. At the end my take was: Why put up with all of this if I am not even interested and convinced by what I do. 

I am really interested in the human body and want to help people improve their emotional, psychological or physical health. I have struggled myself with both mental and physical issues my whole life which is where this desire to help others comes from. 

Now I am 28, and dreading my business job entry. Because I couldn't push away my desire for medicine and psychology any longer I applied for both and got an offer for both. 

However, the more I am thinking about going to school for at least another 6 years + residency or a PhD (make it 9-12 years) I am like holy shit, what the fuck am I doing here. 

I absolutely know that I want to change my life in a meaningful way helping other people with their pain and health. I've considered a career change into physiotherapy (fast), psychotherapy (long & less paid than medicine), medicine (long, well paid but literally no time for patients), tranlational research in medicine (basically research - my true desire but grueling path because you're juggling medicine & research) as well as just working as a data analyst at a health-tech start-up and hoping this will fulfill me (think Oura Ring, Whoop etc - I don't think it will). 

Essentially I am realizing and starting to accept that I want to go very deep on topics around humans and health which is also pulling me towards research but real research seems to always include at least a Ph.D (think neuroscience, neurobiology, neuropsychology, biomedical engineering).

On top of that medicine is some kind of emotional child dream that I can't seem to close up with even though I am doubting more and more whether I acutally want to work a classic doctor career in a hospital. Going into medicine hoping I will come out on the other side in a very cool research position also sounds more than wishful thinking. Which then pushes me more towards classic research routes like biomedical engineering and such which is a whole different beast I've never really seriously thought about. 

I like that medicine gives me so many options: I can go into psychiatry & psychotherapy, neurology, physical and rehabilitative medicine. It basically includes all the options that interest me but sooner than later I'll have to pick + I am not really sure whether I am made for hospital work. It's stressful, fast paced and you.barely have time for patients (so you can't go that deep).

At the same time I've always been absolutely stressed out about everything in my life and very unhappy. I seeked out a psychiatrist finally recently to check potentially on ADHD or anxiety so we're working on that. That doesn't make me more confident to pursue such new and big decisions though. I'm absolutely contemplating if I want to fully throw myself into another degree and career change. 

Lastly, my parents support me in every decision. Of course not earning money or very little for the next x years is a scary thought. Regretting not acting on your interests and life and regretting also is. 

Do you guys have any takes, recommendations, anecdotes on how to find a path in such a situation that at least feels very messy (besides just taking a leap of faith and adjusting).

1n3ce04,"Passed over for promotion … constantly jaded/angry at work, weird power dynamic","I’ve been at this company for 3 years. I built up the program from scratch with my manager who honestly doesn’t do much. 2 years in I got a different job offer and declined because my manager convinced me to stay (a mistake I know) and promised me I was on a path to promotion. I created a plan with her/leadership for it and accomplished every single thing. They told me I would just have to wait until Q3. In Q3 they fired the head of our department and were buying another company. I was told no promotions were possible at this time—even though I’m seeing everyone around me get promoted. A new guy joined our team through the M&A with a senior title. I’m confused as to why he got senior and was told that was the title he inherited from his previous position and “doesn’t mean anything” because he reports directly to my managers manager. This guy basically learned everything he could from me. We managed to get pretty close and I guess our dynamic turned flirty with heavy banter. I started to have some confusing “feelings” for him. We were messaging outside of work hours every single day… I know there was something. We’re also both the same age, have the same exact experience and graduated college the same time. He’s never managed anyone before and I have the most work AND output on our entire time. He basically dictates stuff for his special project, never executes. Anyways, he positioned himself as advocating for me and “seeing I deserve a promotion more than anyone” and “he just got lucky”. He’s also the only man on the team besides our department head. Anyways, I noticed little instances where he was consistently getting credit for his special project despite them being things I accomplished. I noticed him taking over meetings even ones I initially owned. He’s also a serial bullshitter and I can tell sometimes he has no fucking clue what he’s talking about. I am attracted to him but I also cannot stand him. He also made a lot of comments about intimidating me, knowing how he made me feel and always commenting on personal things (like my anxiety I confided in him about… he always asks if I’m okay if I seemed “off” on a call). I tried to enforce boundaries and said I didn’t like how close we were getting and that some of his “jokes” were too personal/hurtful. Anyways, I put distance between us and talked to my therapist a lot about the unhealthy attachment i seemed to have formed to him… it’s like I like his validation but also am upset that he gets this special treatment. He gets celebrated for being creative when two years ago that was listed as a “negative” on my quarterly assessments. My manager also has taken credit for things I’ve done and purposefully shut me out. I let it be because I still got a lot of kudos from other teams (I have the most amount of public positive feedback). Anyways, for months my manager has been telling me she’s spoken SO highly of me to leadership and they’re all impressed and still… no promotion. She tells me to just wait but “things are looking good” and “keep it up”. Now here’s the thing… she’s quitting and her manager told me he’s picking that colleague I can’t stand to be the new lead and my manager. Supposedly, I will be getting his title (I’ll believe it when I see it). Again, more changes happening not during Q3 so clearly these are made up rules. I’ve been crashing out because he makes me viscerally uncomfortable with his past boundary pushing/flirting (I acknowledge I could have stopped it sooner), I got to know him personally under the pretense of a coworker to coworker relationship (sharing stuff about my life or goals I wouldn’t tell a manager) and he’s never managed anyone ever before in his life. He can’t give me any sort of guidance or help. I am applying to other jobs but it’s so unfair … why do I have to leave? I’m making 70k doing THREE times the work of everyone on this team (including him). Now I’m getting a slap on the wrist only because his job opened up. He’s also been supposedly engaged this entire time which I just found out about but has even joked about not making HR-inappropriate jokes to me anymore so lol. Idk if I sound like a jilted jealous person or whatever but I’m so angry and I can’t even hide it. I’m trying to be professional but I want to ice him out until he’s my manager and I did tell him I’m uncomfortable and he said he is too and this was also his concern and that “he’s sorry”. Like I feel like he used getting close to me as a way to get the leadership role? He’s been here six fucking months it’s ridiculous! He even said our lead thinks he’s the “least emotional one” and trusts him… feels like misogyny to me. I can’t afford to leave without anything lined up but I’m just angry, angry of him taking credit or monopolizing on my projects and that I don’t think he deserves it. I think I deserves senior and we deserved an actual experienced person to lead this program. 

I’m also very stressed with moving and other things right now. I’ve always been the nice person at work and today on call I just was closed off and not myself. I hate how I’m becoming but I don’t know what to do.

1n3as22,Can't find a career that would be interesting or enjoyable even in the slightest,"I'm willing to go to college, trade, school, etc whatever. It doesn't matter. I just want a career that would be even 1% enjoyable. The jobs that I have had so far have been miserable and boring.

I've come to the conclusion that it's very likely the only thing that will ever make a job ""fun"" for me is if I like hanging out with my coworkers, which is unlikely to ever happen, but I'm hoping that's not the case. I realize I'm not actually going to ever enjoy my job, but if I can even just have ""fun"" a tiny bit that would be amazing.

The one job that I can think of that would do that is being a pilot. Unfortunately I used to be suicidal (no longer suicidal though) so I'm not allowed to ever be a pilot in my lifetime. Other than that I can't think of anything.

My hobbies are running, strength training, studying languages, playing Minecraft, and playing sports. Of those hobbies, being a Spanish interpreter or a personal trainer are the only ""good"" options, but neither job makes a lot of money.

I think being a personal trainer would be somewhat fun, but I just started training a few months ago (a good reason to not be one because idk for sure if I'll stick to this) and I'm still very skinny so I don't think anyone would hire me. As for interpreting, that's going to be less and less in demand as they deport more and more people (I'm from the US) and also I don't like interpreting I just like learning languages and speaking in them.

Looking for some career advice here.

I’m still fairly early in my career and currently work at Bytedance. Lately, I’ve been debating whether I should switch companies now or stay and see how things play out. There are a few things on my mind:
	•	Some people internally think Bytedance might eventually go public, and if that happens, the stock could be a big deal.
	•	Bytedance/TikTok recently beat Meta in revenue per user in one of the quarters, so growth seems promising.
	•	On the flip side, my learning curve in my current role has plateaued — I don’t feel like I’m growing as much as I’d like.
	•	We don’t get our bonuses until March of next year, but I’ve heard that many companies do most of their hiring between November–January.

1n39jzc,Business Major with a Chem Minor?,"Hello! I am an undecided freshman who can’t choose a major but I really am enjoying my business class. Here’s the thing: I love chemistry… I don’t love all the courses that come along with a chem major. On top of this, majoring in business I could graduate in 3.5 years instead of 4, but chem is a guaranteed 4 years. I’d love to be at least one less semester in student debt, so the 3.5 option appeals to me. 

Here is where my question comes in: what jobs could I get with a business major and a chem minor? Would it make me earn more money or increase my appeal at all? Has anyone done this and can you tell me about your experience? 

For context, here are my schools business majors: accounting, economics, management, marketing, and just business. Another minor to consider is applied data science analytics, but I am more interested in chem than that. My main goal is money, though.

Any advice helps!!

1n38d57,Title: 3-year gap after 12th – will it ruin my career chances?,"
Hey everyone,
I really need some advice.

I passed my 12th in 2023. After that, I did a 1-year ADCA (computer diploma) course. In 2024, I even took admission in BCA, but due to financial issues I had to drop out.

Now it’s 2025, and if I look back – it feels like I’m already in my “3rd year of gap” after 12th. This honestly scares me.

Right now, I don’t want to go back to college. Instead, I’m planning to do a Data Analytics course (certification) and directly aim for jobs in that field.

But here’s my doubt:

1. Will companies reject me just because of this gap?

2. Is it realistic to get a job with only 12th pass + Data Analytics skills (no degree)?

3. Has anyone here actually built a career in analytics / tech through this non-traditional path?


I’d really appreciate genuine advice from people who have been in a similar situation. 🙏

1n37r1a,Any advice on how to align an experienced .NET/ERP Specialist profile with open roles in Portugal (Or remote vacancies)?,"Hello everyone,

When I first moved to Porto almost a year ago, I focused my job search on .NET development roles. But the market for developers here has been very crowded, and after many automated rejections, I decided to also apply for positions in the **SAP ERP field**.

I do have experience with SAP S/4HANA, mainly MM and SD modules, from retail ERP migration and integration projects where I worked closely on supply chain and POS systems. Still, I know my background in SAP is **narrower than in .NET**, and I’m positioning myself as a specialist bridging ERP processes with development rather than as a deep SAP consultant.

The problem is that, again, I’m not receiving feedback from companies. Without knowing whether the gap is in my CV, skills, or strategy, it’s difficult to adjust.

Has anyone in the local tech community faced a similar situation when switching fields? Do companies in Portugal value hybrid SAP/ERP + .NET experience, or should I take a different approach altogether?

Due to my varied experience and self development I have a unique skillset that is very valuable to my company, and to some ambitious goals that the company has - but which are quite niche to the company itself. I receive glowing performance reviews and recently promoted. However this did not happen with much of a salary raise. How do I leverage this into a raise next summer?


One example of how I’m useful: the company is investing in a startup that will open new avenues of data analysis in an emerging field ). I am one of maybe 2 people who have the skillset and drive to liaison with that team and am key to them developing that product. Other people who potentially share my skillset are managers who do not have the time to explore the avenues i go into. 


If I leave, it will be a setback and anyone they bring in to replace me may ask for the salary I want (above 100k). It would also take a long time to train someone. However in this economy I wouldn’t want to leave to go to another company since I enjoy the work and look forward to the goals

1n35eh7,Being replaced because I'm part-time. What do I tell potential new employers in interviews?,"I have worked incredibly hard for a business for 18 months, as a part-time employee. Always been told I was doing a great job by my manager and line manager. I am employed in the UK if that is useful context for my situation.

I was told last week, out of the blue, that they want to replace me with a full-time employee ""as it's no longer viable for my role to be part-time"". I can't be full-time (can't do more than 3 days a week) because I have other commitments, and they have always know that. So they told me they have to replace me. They've given me until October, then they will replace me with someone who can do full-time hours.

So it's not that I didn't anything wrong. It's not that my role is redundant either. They are just insisting on replacing me with someone full-time.

I didn't think this seemed particularly legal or fair but I spoke to our HR manager and she said as I've been working there for under 2 years, I can't do anything about it from a legal perspective under the unfair dismissal rules. She wasn't particularly helpful.

I am now applying for other part-time roles like mad, because I need income after October. But I'm worried about what to say to people in interviews when they ask me why I am leaving my old job/seeking new employment, which is a fair question to be asked.

I don't want to complain about it and seem mean, bitter and unprofessional to a potential new employer. I don't want to say anything that makes it seem like I was doing a bad job, because I wasn't. So how do I explain it?

Maybe just: 

'I am leaving my old job on good terms, but they decided recently that they needed someone to be full-time for them and I can only work part-time, so I couldn't continue in my role there'?

This whole situation has been so confusing and upsetting and I do know that my old job has let me down... But for now, I just need advice on how to explain it to my potential new employers.

1n34ss7,Career change into IT – need a clear roadmap,"Hi everyone,
I’m 21 years old and currently working a steady job that provides a fixed income but has nothing to do with IT or computers. The problem is that my current job doesn’t help me grow, doesn’t build skills I can use in the future, and honestly, I don’t see myself staying here long-term.

I’d like to make a career change into something IT-related. I don’t have a specific field in mind yet (web development, cybersecurity, data, etc.), but I do know I want to start learning in a structured way so I don’t get lost along the way.

A bit about my situation:
	•	I work 07:00–14:00, Monday to Friday → so I have a lot of free time in the afternoons.
	•	I have a steady income and very few expenses → meaning I can afford some learning resources, courses, or even certifications if needed.
	•	My background/education have nothing to do with IT, but I’m motivated and willing to put in the time to build real skills.

My questions:
	1.	What’s the best way to start learning IT if you don’t yet know which exact field to choose?
	2.	Should I go self-taught with online resources, or would you recommend formal education/certifications?
	3.	What would a realistic roadmap look like for someone in my position who wants to transition into IT within the next couple of years?

Any advice from people who have been through a similar career change would be hugely appreciated.

1n348jw,My boss left 2 months after I settled into a new job,"At the end of March, I accepted an offer to work for a company as a Data Analyst with IT support on the side. The role includes maintaining reports for areas of the business, ensuring they're refreshed and published within a reporting week cycle. Three important things to note for this role:

The first, the role had been advertised as they were losing their current Data Analyst. Their current had exactly 1 month left on their contract to train me up after I accepted the offer. The data team consisted of them and their boss

The second, during the interview process, I explained that I did not have the experience required in specific softwares that they had asked me about, but expressed that I'd be happy to learn if the appropriate training materials and supervision were supplied. Training and supervision was supplied, but only on a step-by-step process; I wasn't trained to be a Data Analyst, I was given specific instructions on how to 'Not mess it up.' This meant a lot of the difficulties would immediately be escalated, due to lack of coverage and training on them, to my line manager, who had multiple years within the company, having worked up the ladder into a management position.

The third, and the largest. About 3-4 weeks into my contract, my boss announced to me that he would be leaving the company 2-3 months from that time. 

In the time between their announcement of their departure and the day of, I would run into a number of issues that only someone with experience in the field and knowledge of where information was kept in the company's databases would be able to resolve. These issues would be promptly fixed and I would put together a solution in written word for them should they appear in the future.

I also requested training or to oversee them on certain requests, explaining that 'I don't yet feel confident enough to handle some of the larger, custom requests coming from some of my colleagues just yet.' To give them credit, they were in an extremely busy position in the company. People were constantly wandering over to their desk and asking questions that varied between quick 5-10m answers all the way up to blocking out half their calendar on a resolution.

My former boss would always state that documentation would be online, and that there are plenty of resources available if you look in the right locations. I believe this was a way to delegate the training responsibility of their role back onto me given the time span they had to ensure the company wouldn't collapse on their departure, as I received this answer as early as 1 week after their announcement.

To serve as a replacement for my former boss, the company enlisted the help of an external IT Helpdesk and installed software on all company devices that would allow for seamless contact should IT Software issues present themselves. This has actually worked quite well, but the experience that they had in Data has not so easily been replaced;

Fast forward to several weeks after they officially left, almost to date - My contract has yet to be formally updated to assign me a new boss, but I 'unofficially' have one who has no experience with Data or IT. The company has encountered several issues, with what would have been simplistic resolutions only taking 5-10m of time, with some persisting through the entire week until a proper resolution is found, and to this date, 2 major outstanding issues backdating upwards of 4-5 weeks ago have affected when reports can go out. 

These larger scale issues have been presented to my 'informal' boss to which I have received 'Can't you do it all again and see if it works then?' I explained that the process(s) involved take upwards of 3-4 hours to ensure everything is in the correct place, providing an eta for when I would be done. This would have been fine if it were the only time it was suggested, but given the lack of experience in both Data and IT, it is almost exclusively the only suggestion I receive when I encounter issues that are really meant for escalation (3-4 attempts at redo-ing the process and I'd receive the same feedback only with an even more puzzled expression; Hands on head, glasses come off and a frustrated groan).

My informal boss is currently on leave, which has taken the pressure off me a little as I have strict instructions not to contact those who are on leave, even down to removing them from cc's in emails. Plus, I can appreciate that the last thing they want to receive whilst on holiday is an email saying everything's broken.

Once they return, my plan is to have a catch up with them about sustainable solutions. As of current, it's completely unsustainable - Continuing on without additional support or a proper escalation point in the data department will only ensure that reports are delayed and issues go unsolved, as I did not receive the proper training required to address and resolve the issues that are becoming more and more consistent

Some additional contact before I ask for suggestions and insight, I have only had 2 full time roles before this. One lasting 6 months and another a year. The former I left due to an offer 'written with golden ink' that ended up being the exact opposite of what was promised.

Additionally, after signing my contract at my current role, I have seen somewhere between 5-10 people, all from different teams, leave on their own decision. Not all these roles have been (entirely) replaced.

With all that said, what should I do? I'm anxious that starting to look for work elsewhere would reflect poorly on my ability to hold down a job even though circumstances at my previous areas of employment were less than desirable, micro-managing hell at best and at worst, file in sick leave to recover from stress-induced anxiety..

1n30u9d,Help -need insights,"I apologize in advance for the lengthy message and for any faulty english i use (not my native language).

It's about my personal story, for which I need a bit of mentorship moving forward.



I'm 24 years old, located in Crete, Greece. I passed  CFA Level 1 on my first attempt and an aspiring wealth manager.



So,



I hold a 4-year BSc in Finance and Banking Management from the University of Piraeus (graduated with honors)



I had multiple offers for summer internships and selected the one most likely to lead to a full-time offer (EY – Consulting, Financial Services Risk Management).



I was quickly promoted from Intern to Consultant in just 6 months (my cohort typically stayed interns for a full year). But just one month after my promotion—while patiently waiting for a major project to finalize—I resigned to prepare myself for graduate studies abroad. At that point, I was aiming for an MSc in Finance, without really knowing where I wanted to be in the industry.

I only knew I didn’t like what I was doing there. 

In Greece, we currently have a poor and very closed finance industry. People are often recruited through closed networks. I quickly realized that, in order for someone like me to become an integral part of the finance/asset management industry here, I’d have to be some kind of poor man’s Einstein.



So in May 2024, I quit, aiming to go abroad and chase a career dream.



But in June 2024, I had a medical incident that held me back from making any step forward. 

That gave me a lot of time to assess, reflect, and structure my life from the ground up.

(This medical incident is about to hold me back in my hometown for another 2 - 3 years. So i need to be more down to earth about my career and life prospects.)

I quickly realized that I didn't want to become a monkey behind a keyboard, judged on how well I know Excel, PowerPoint, and Word shortcuts.



I always liked thinking deeply about socio-economic issues—something I thought finance couldn’t fulfill.

I currently am about to pursue a BSc in Applied Mathematics.

I currently work part-time as a private tutor in statistics to support myself. I live in my hometown and try to save some money over these 4 years (duration of the bsc), so that I can go abroad —this time with a more strategic plan.

I also plan to leverage my university experience from the first year to build academic connections.

In my second year I seriously plan to converse my full time Bsc to a part time one in order for me to get a job - supporting myself. The realistic part is that any job offerings in Crete, Greece is about audit, tax and bookkeeping. 

24:  one year full time maths

25 - 30 : audit + part time maths

31: ready to reassess again!

  
I think the most important thing in today's age is to be adaptable, and that's what i opt for.

By the time im 30 ill be a certified auditor (hopefully), a Finance & Banking and Applied Mathematics bachelors holder

My plan in life?

To be free.

So I’ve designed a career path in my mind. If I keep learning consistently—finance, math, probabilities, audit—by the time I’m 31, I believe I’ll be more than ready for grad school if that's what i 'd want then.



I don’t yet know which field: Economics? Econometrics? Statistics? Finance? Computational Finance?



I don’t know!!



The freest profession I can think of is that of the wealth manager.



Go, equip yourself with all the tools, all the techniques, somewhere in Central Europe , where wealth managers bloom.

Manage other people’s wealth. Do what you love: follow, interpret, and predict the markets—then allocate assets accordingly.



I truly believe this is the career for me. I don’t want something conventional, where in 5 years every skill you learned is obsolete...



I don’t know.



Please—someone have a talk with me, share your opinion. I’m desperately trying to find and define my goals, but in an environment like the one I live in, it's so hard to express non-conventional ideas.",PercentageBusy7632,1,1.0,0,1756452277,2025-08-29 07:24:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n30u9d/help_need_insights/,8,2025

1n306fz,Should I tell HR and my boss that I have another job offer before I sign an extension?,"I am in a temporary contract at a competitive company but was offered a full time + benefits position elsewhere. The pay will be 5k less, but the stability in this economy would do wonders to my mental health. I was just offered an extension to my current contract but haven’t signed. Should I try to use this offer to ask for a longer my contract length? 

I know there has been talks about layoffs this upcoming fiscal year for my company, and I am the newest employee in my team. I have a great relationship with my manager, and she was able to strong arm an extension for my contract by 6 months. Everyone in my department likes me and would like me to stay, but my boss (middle management) folds easily for upper leadership. The workplace is toxic so toxic due to leadership that my department is the reason our union was created. 

All is to say, I like my coworkers deeply, I am proud of my work, but I feel miserable and stifled by upper management’s aggression and decisions. I feel that I really want to stay, but the temp situation is really straining my capacity to take on higher end projects and is subsequently tanking my mental and morale. I want to try and hope HR and upper leadership has changed, but should I even try to ask or will there be retaliation?

He told me that the company knows if there is a need for a pay fix and if it does they will fix it, he also told me I would be in the design stage of the new project, if and when it will come.

I have been stuck in entry level healthcare administration for over 9 years. Yesterday, I submitted my 5500th application only to be quickly rejected in about 2 hours.

I am a seasoned healthcare professional starting from the age of 15. I am college educated and possess almost a decade of clinic supervision experience, revenue cycle management, patient care experience, and hosptal Marketing experience.

I’ve had my resume (which is actually damn good) re done professionally a dozen times. Written over 5000 cover letters and still to this day I’ve only had 6 total interviews, 3 of which resulted in the jobs that encompass my Resume for a total of 9 years of experience.

My apologies if this post is all over the place, this is my first reddit post. I'm a recent high school graduate and am a bit confused on my future career and got recommended to write a post on here. 

So a bit background on me. I'm someone who's pretty good with technology and computers, but I also want to work in healthcare. I'm looking to obtain a bachelor degree in one of these fields and then using it for Law School. 

So currently I am debating between a BsN or getting a BSCS at BCIT and then using it for UBC Law. But I'm not sure if these degrees or institution are the best for me. My goal with the BsN is either to use it for Law School or I was going to specialize in Anesthesia and become an CRNA, however I've recently realized that CRNA's aren't really recognized in Canada. For the BSCS my goal is to work in with Google or Microsoft, however my fear is that I won't be able to get a job in this field. 

Someone close to me recently told me about getting a degree in Healthcare Technology, since it relates to both healthcare and technology, however, I'm not sure what degree would be best for this. Could anybody who has experience in any of the degrees or careers mentioned in this post share your experiences and suggest what degree would be best? I also am hoping to obtain a career that is well-paying with a starting around 90K+. Also, I am open to different degree options at any institution in Canada.

Management told me those assignments would pay $23/hr ($16.05base + $7/hr incentive), which they said was to cover travel/mileage since mileage wouldn’t be reimbursed separately.

Here’s the timeline: •	I started those shifts on June 25, 2025. •	I did not receive the official incentive letter until July 9, though payroll and management acknowledged the rate existed. •	I emailed management several times for clarification on conditions in the incentive letter. They responded that only the owner of the company could discuss it, but she was out of the office. •	When the owner of the company returned, she told me I would not be paid the incentive, saying she “couldn’t go back on payroll.” •	Since then, all paychecks have only reflected my base $16.50/hr. •	I also asked to be taken off those clients, as I was traveling out of state without fair compensation.

1n2xjmn,Counter offer,"I recently accepted a new job offer that was $1.5k less a year than my current employer. I accepted because it was fully remote with less scope. After I gave notice, my current employer countered with a raise that would put me about $10k higher than the new job with some wfh. 

Here’s my dilemma:
The new job offers more stability and is fully remote with a few exceptions of going in office. I've been frustrated at my current job, which is a big reason why I looked for a new one, but it's a smaller company and is more laid back. The higher pay and PTO cushion at my current job would help with debt. The new job is at a much larger organization, where I might feel less comfortable but will provide more professional resources and experience.


So my choice feels like:
Stay: More money and security, but keep the same environment that has frustrated me.
Go: Less money, lose PTO, but gain structure, remote flexibility, and a fresh start.

I’m an AI developer, and no, I don’t run an agency or marketing company. But I know how to build a few things with AI: frontends, backends, CRMs, ad tools, and I’m always willing to learn new stuff.

What I’m wondering is: how can I monetize this and make some money on the side *without* selling myself as just another “AI agency” or “marketing guy”?

1n2tyze,Unemployed software engineer,"I'm a software engineer with four years of experience. I was laid off in December and I haven't been able to find a job since. I had mixed feelings about the layoff. A couple months before I was laid off the CEO sent out an email celebrating the growth of their software department in India and all the new hires and savings. I suspected there might be layoffs after this.

Even with the suspicion it still stung to be laid off because I always put high effort into my workday and I loved my team and manager. I had already survived two waves of layoffs, I was one of the only remaining members of the team I started with and I provided a lot of value for my company. My manager told me she had nothing to do with the layoffs that it came from higher up and she was so sorry.

Everyone has heard about AI causing software layoffs. I think most of these tech layoffs are actually due to offshoring jobs not due to AI. AI will reshape the entire economy over the next decade not just software.

After the layoff I have been struggling. I can't find a job and life is getting expensive fast. I don't want to lose everything I worked for. My plan is to keep applying and developing my skills.

I have kept in contact with a few other people in different teams who were laid off at the same time as me. So far nobody has been able to find work in the industry. One person took a lower paying job in a different industry and he had to move back in with his parents. I also have a friend from school who has been out of work and experiencing the same thing for over a year now.

I don't get very many responses or interviews. It also seems like a lot of the people who do interview me don't even understand the questions they're asking. I've heard similar things from my old coworkers.

I had a woman interview me and ask about my experience with Node.js. I explained the process in which I've created several APIs from scratch based in node and had four years of professional typescript and javascript experience which uses the same syntax as Node.js. She didn't understand what I meant when I explained the syntax is interchangeable. I assumed this was just a test to see how I would respond but it eventually became clear she was serious. I'm not sure how these interviewers are supposed to judge you technically when they don't understand the technical questions they're reading.

I also wonder if the entire job search market has been gamified to drag it out as long as possible and milk money off of unemployed people paying subscriptions to LinkedIn and other services in the hopes of getting a job. I wonder if it is almost like a dating app not wanting to give you a good match, and just drag you along with a subscription fee.

Any advice for what to do? I will keep trying but what am I supposed to do if I can't get work.

1n2say9,Should I quit my job after 3 months of working in it?,"I’m a fresh graduate with a total of one year of experience as a call center agent since I was a working student back then. Currently, I’m working as an admin in a newly established company. The job offered me a lot of opportunities and even a seat at the executives’ table, but along with that I’m also extremely overwhelmed with my workload since I’m practically carrying almost all of the company’s responsibilities. It’s a newly built company and there really aren’t any staff yet—basically, it’s just the President and me working together.

What makes it hard for me is that I don’t have experience doing this kind of job, and I honestly have no idea how to do it. I mostly took this job because of the opportunities it could open up for me and also because it was the first one that offered me a position (I was absorbed by the sister company where I did my internship), so after graduation I already had a job waiting for me.

But it’s sad because I realized clerical work isn’t really my calling—I’m truly into performing arts. I can’t seem to find the motivation to keep working on this, even though my mind keeps telling me to push through. But every time I get fed with new information that I need to learn, I get drained right away. I also can’t find a creative outlet because I’m so exhausted from work, sometimes we even work beyond office hours so whenever I don’t have responsibilities I just end up sleeping.

I know it’s only been three months, but this has already been quite a journey for me, and I thought at first I would be able to adjust. Instead, it feels like I just keep messing things up. I also don’t want to put the company at a disadvantage just because I’m unmotivated, which leads to some unproductiveness on my part.

But I’m asking here partly to rant and partly to ask—am I just overreacting by feeling this way, or what do I really need to do? My life isn’t secured yet if I quit this job, but I’m really having such a hard time.",not_Shen,3,0.8100000023841858,6,1756425355,2025-08-28 23:55:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n2say9/should_i_quit_my_job_after_3_months_of_working_in/,8,2025

1n2rr65,Two job offers - Which would you choose?,"I’m 24 and trying to decide between two amazing job offers. I also run a small AI consulting business with my brother which I hope to grow into something substantial over the next 5 years and be my main thing eventually. 

**Option 1: Director role at a growing SaaS company (AI/construction space)**

* \~$90–100k salary - I live with my parents, this would be ideal save fast and help them out with retirement.
* Real responsibilities: building a marketing department under me and leading campaigns with big budgets. The nature of the business and what they do excites me, I could be an asset on their team.
* Strong credibility for my side business (aligned industry, useful title). Could potentially make good connections here.
* Working with much senior professionals who I could learn from
* Cons: long commute (30-45 minutes one way), high workload, only evenings/weekends available for my side hustle. Would have to buy a car immediately which would bring my total disposable income down. NO EQUITY. MBA would be delayed, and the friction of getting it later would be much higher.

**Option 2: “Director” role at a smaller AI fintech startup + MBA in the same building**

* \~$75k salary - but equity included as one of the first 10 employees, solid financial backing by universities with plans to expand cross country in the next 2 years so equity could become liquid eventually.
* Title is more fluff than substance, but freedom to make my job into whatever projects interests me, could really influence the direction of the company and make my own leadership experience through trial and error collaborating with peers.
* Lots of flexibility — I could realistically take calls for my side business during the day.
* The office is in the university and they can get me into the MBA program where I could walk to classes and come back in the middle of the work day. If I grind, I could complete a part-time MBA in 3 years whilst still having a full time salary. It's a logistical unicorn (low-friction, big regret-avoider). MBA program networking could potentially help my own business in the future. 
* Cons: weaker brand credibility, lower pay, slower immediate career ramp, less budget to make ideas come true, working with my friend and people my age who could not give me mentorship, less excited about the nature of the business

**The dilemma:**

* The SaaS job excites me more — prestige, pay, real growth, industry alignment. Could learn a lot for my own business but at the same time could really take away time from working on my own business if I get swept away in it. 
* The fintech + MBA job is convenient and could be a logistical “unicorn” chance to get a post-grad without having to put my career on pause later in life. Could learn a lot about how an early stage start-up works with time to work on my own business and make a lot of connections in the MBA program, but not aligned in nature to my business and less opportunity to connect with senior professionals in the industry that could become potential clients in the future

If you were 24, running a side business, and wanted to be at \~$20k/month in 5 years, what would you pick? 

**TL;DR**

* **Job 1:** \~$90–100k SaaS Director role — real leadership, strong credibility, senior mentorship, more exciting work, but long commute, high workload, no equity, MBA delayed for TBD time.
* **Job 2:** \~$75k fintech Director role — lighter responsibilities, flexible schedule to work on my own stuff, equity + easy MBA access, but weaker brand, less mentorship, lower immediate pay and less exciting work.

**The dilemma:** Do I optimize for **prestige + salary now** (but risk less time for my side business + MBA), or for **MBA + flexibility** (but with lower pay/credibility)?

* The SaaS role excites me more, but could drain me and delay the MBA.
* The fintech + MBA is a regret-avoider and much lower stress, but less inspiring day-to-day.
* One path maximizes **prestige + learning**, the other maximizes **flexibility + future-proofing**.

1n2olkn,Another offer right after starting a new job,"TL;DR - got a better job offer right after starting a new job in the same industry, any advice on whether and how to tell the new company that I had started a new role would be appreciated. 

I started a new job in late June at a pharma company. It’s fine, but not amazing, and I took it mostly because other interviews at the time didn’t pan out.

2 weeks after I started, another company in the same industry reached out about a role I had applied to in April. The role is more senior, pays meaningfully more, and seems like a better fit overall. I thought, why not take the interview and just see. 
	
The interviews were a bit odd—less formal, more like they already liked me. One interview even went 90 minutes instead of 30, and the person said “hopefully we’ll get a chance to work together.” But then they went radio silent for ~3 weeks.

Today they told me I’m a finalist and basically said they’re preparing an offer. They also asked me to confirm what I’d be giving up (bonus, stock, etc.) so they can factor that into compensation and “buy me out” if needed.

Here’s my dilemma: the application and resume they have on file are from April, before I started my current job. I never updated them because I had literally just started and didn’t think it would matter. Also I didn’t bring it up in the interviews bc I was like I don’t want them to not interview me. Now I’m unsure if I should “come clean” that I started a new role in late June.

If I want to get paid out for the sign-on bonus and a small partial annual bonus, I’d have to mention that I had started a new job. That said, I don’t care about this as much as the new job offer.  

If I don’t tell them, it might look odd when they run a background check or ask for documentation. I do think I would be able to opt out of the automated services though and provide documentation separately, but there’s a possibility that the people at my current company would find out (and vice versa) down the road. 

So my question is: how risky is it if I disclose this now vs. if I don’t? Would it hurt me to say, “I had just started a role when we reconnected, but this one is a much better fit so I’d be excited to move forward”? Or is it cleaner to just keep it simple and only bring it up if asked?",feelingfeelingsfeel,1,1.0,0,1756415907,2025-08-28 21:18:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n2olkn/another_offer_right_after_starting_a_new_job/,8,2025

1n2oe1h,"Accepted a job offer, but my boss surprised me with a big raise. Need advice on how to back out gracefully","I recently accepted a job offer and was planning to put in my two weeks’ notice. The day I was going to resign, my boss scheduled a meeting that morning. I thought, “Perfect timing, I’ll do it then.” Instead, the meeting turned out to be them giving me a 30% raise. That completely threw me off, so I didn’t bring up the new offer.

Here’s the context:

* Current job: Director-level role, one work-from-home day per week (Fridays). I wasn’t actively job hunting, but a friend asked me to interview at his company, and I figured why not.
* New job: Product management at a startup, in-office full time, over all less responsibilities which seemed nice. After negotiating, it came out to a slight raise over my previous salary.
* Now: With the unexpected raise, my current job’s compensation is about 40k more than the new one. I’m leaning heavily toward staying put, since I wasn’t looking to leave in the first place.

My question: how do I communicate this to the new company in a way that doesn’t burn bridges? I worry they won’t believe that I wasn’t shopping their offer around, and I’d like to end things on good terms.",itzIconic,1034,0.949999988079071,281,1756415415,2025-08-28 21:10:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n2oe1h/accepted_a_job_offer_but_my_boss_surprised_me/,8,2025
1n2o2yt,Resigning tomorrow… Feel Horrible,"So I am putting in my notice tomorrow.  I have been here for less than a year and thought it would be something I would be at for a while.  

It’s a small firm, less than 15 employees. Told I could make partner and take over things when the  time comes.  The owner has been 100% upfront with things. Run the business how he wants and it does well. 

Reasons for me leaving: 

The commute is brutal. Complete opposite side of town. Thought I would get used to it and I can’t 

Not a ton of flexibility for schedule, no work from home, no commissions (bonus at end of year, no idea what it could be). 

Working directly under the owner means I do all the work he doesn’t want to do (not hating on that). But I am way over qualified to be doing admin work. 

I thought after a few months I would be client facing, now I being told thats far off and that they need me to be the Swiss Army knife doing a bit of everything.  

No work from home - not a lot of vacation. Looking for more work life balance and flexibility. Won’t happen here. 


New firm - gives me everything I’m looking for, 5 min from my house and room to grow. I’ll make more money in the short term and potentially long term (if everything is what it’s supposed to be), more flexibility, more time off, commissions, solid base, employer funded retirement and pension.  


Why I feel bad - 

They brought me in when I was laid off quickly 

Lean on me for a lot of stuff

I work closely with the owner and he is a good guy, no complaints about him and he truly does mean well.  

I was only here a short period of time. 

I’m thinking they will offer more money, and honestly I don’t think there’s a price tag you could put on it. 

I feel like I owe the owner for starting me right away after getting laid off. 


I know I don’t owe them anything but I feel like I do. In my industry you typically get walked out when you resign.  

How should I approach this. Should I feel bad?

1n2nvpw,Should I chill on the productivity at work?,"So I started my new job a month ago. I admit, I have very little experience in this field and when I started everything was overwhelming, I was probably getting 5 items done a day because everything was so hard. When I started, my team had 1000+ items in our work list that were all past the due dates. It seems like things have been like that for a while because when I interviewed the manager stressed how behind they were on meeting deadlines. 


So fast forward a month later, I’m barely asking questions now. Things are just so easy now, I’m managing to do 50+ items a day. The work list I talked about earlier is now only down to 200. It sounds awesome, however, i’m kind of noticing that ever since I started working here, we’re finally able to surpass deadlines and productivity has skyrocketed. Not saying that my other coworkers are bad at their job because they’re the ones who trained me, but i’m kind of getting scared that they will resent me… I don’t want management to wonder how this person with 0 years of experience is suddenly surpassing everyone. I spoke to my family about it and even they think i’m doing way too much for someone who just started. So far management hasn’t said anything to me other than keep up the good work. Maybe i’m just overthinking, do you guys think I should chill out a bit? I do tend to get excited when I have my mind set on a goal and I do tend to go overboard.

1n2njzf,"Former manager from 5 years ago reached out for a coffee chat, but I’m not sure how to navigate the conversation after I was recently fired from the company they were asking about","My former manager from my first tech corporate job reached out to me on LinkedIn. They left during the pandemic and I really haven't thought about them since. I was an intern on their team and after my internship they converted me to full-time. I learned SO MUCH from them and that whole experience, basically a crash course education on how the real corporate world works, and I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for them and the risk they took on me. Unfortunately, around the start of 2021, I was one of the 10% that was laid off within the company.

  
They saw on LinkedIn that I was working at a different company as a program manager and wanted to set up some time for a coffee chat to know how it was going at that company. This is after not talking to each other at all in five years.

  
The problem is I no longer work at that company either. I was fired five months ago (pip or severance and I took the latter) and I haven't gotten around to updating my LinkedIn. I'm worried about two things coming up during the coffee chat that I'm not sure how to approach:

1) they're reaching out to see if I can refer them to the company I no longer work at, which then I'll have a lot of fun explaining to them how we parted ways in a year and a half

or 2) they're reaching out to see if I'm interested in a position they have available, which then I'm worried they'll resend their offer if they find out I was terminated in such short time or if I say I am looking at jobs on the other side of the country to move in with my SO (which is true, but the job market is rough and I'd be open to staying longer in my city if the pay is good)

  
I know they could just be genuinely reaching out to catch up over coffee, but I also know that the company they're working at full-time is hiring, and the startup they work at part-time just published their first app too so I want to be prepared for either possibility.

1n2lnui,Long rant on being in a family business,Am I wrong for all of this I feel like everytime I bring something like this up I’m not doing my job correctly or I’m told it’s because it’s out of my comfort zone and I have to deal with it. I work at an office with my family my dad is my boss he’s the owner/president whatever I handle finances and just in general administration type things. I was thrown into this job three years ago with no experience nothing. My mom who was the one handling everything explained everything she knew onto me. I was 18 at the time did not finish high school and was looking for something to do with my life. It was very overwhelming having to keep track of all these companies and who was who everything was very disorganized and messy in general. From physical copies to digital it was all over the place. We specialize in very technical low voltage stuff but it felt as if my parents were very behind digitally. They are very behind and with English not being their first language it was very difficult for me to explain some new changes to them. My main issue is with my boss aka my dad not only does he struggle to divide work with family but he is very bi polar not medically but he has mood swings. My family and I would joke about it but because we had no other way to deal with it. There was many instances where we would go head to head either me or my sister who btw is 7 years older than me. But again it would be just more arguing sometimes and it’s not like he would turn  over a leaf forever after that. 2 years and half into this job I’ve gotten the hang of it more but I struggle to communicate to my dad that it does not seem professional or idk maybe I am wrong but he wants me to discuss payment deals with project managers of other companies. It’s not that I’m too shy to call other people I take out permits from cities constantly or call others when something is overdue but this just seemed out of my expertise. Having to discuss higher level people to discuss a big project it does not seem right to me. Another thing he does is when I call him is he always ALWAYS puts me in speaker he called me upset one time because I called him to discuss a projects progress payment and I was saying the contracts total of a couple projects. Telling me to not discuss number with him when he’s with people mind you he did not tell me I was on speaker or that there was 5 people with him in the car. Another moment which I admit I was out of line is calling him and again I’m on speaker which I don’t know and I’m discussing about an invoice. What happened is he told me to not charge the guy for the second week some techs went and worked for him. On that call he told me to charge the guy for one guy who went. I told him frustrated HE told me to not do that. I also brought up he should call the guy and explain the situation a little bit or our PM should not only me as he was asking me to do. And yes my attitude was showing and it has on phone calls. He later told me i embarrassed him in-front of his employee for the way I spoke to him. We got into a heated argument where I exploded on him on how HE told me not to send the invoice again and now he’s back paddling withought the knowledge of the other guy. It was very confusing. He got so upset he jumped on the car and left idk where. And because this is a family business the house was tense and quiet my mom grilled me for what happened and we never spoke about it again. So now I don’t call my dad only messages. I’m in the small office we have it’s always only me here and sometimes him. My sister only does ONE thing which is to do organize the employees weekly hours for me so I can properly start sending invoices. Even then I have to take over HER job because it’s incomplete or not done on time. It is a tedious job sometimes but it should take 1 day to do and it would take her 3 days to do sometimes. So because she’s behind I was behind and I would get the heat for not sending invoices on time. I don’t know I feel so trapped in my own body and house because I see them every single day. My dear mother who was the only one I could rely on is now not working since my purpose was to replace her so I genuinely feel so alone. I have no one to relate to about this or discuss I can only rant but I feel so bad doing that to my friends because they know my family and I don’t want them to see a different image of them. So yeah can anyone else relate to this because I do need some very much needed advice.,IntentionAmazing951,1,1.0,0,1756409079,2025-08-28 19:24:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n2lnui/long_rant_on_being_in_a_family_business/,8,2025

1n2kouq,Am I unprofessional for activating transcription during a meeting?,"Hi all,

I’m looking for an outside perspective on a work situation. I’m a manager in a pretty demanding industry, working for an international company where English is the main language, but it’s not my native one.

A couple of days ago, I had an online meeting with two senior managers. My own manager was supposed to join but dropped out just a few hours before. The meeting was about changes to a project I was leading. Given past communication issues on this project, I suggested turning on transcription, what both participants have agreed to. My reasoning was that it would help with note-taking and allow me to really focus on the discussion, rather than scrambling to write things down. After the meeting, I sent a follow-up as usual.

Fast forward to today, and my manager tells me that what I did was considered a breach of etiquette, that turning on transcription in a meeting with top managers could come across as showing a lack of trust. For context, one of the senior managers in question has been pretty disrespectful with me in in-person meetings before, so honestly, I wouldn’t have been shocked if some of his remarks had also been questionable in a virtual setting and don't really care about that kind of behavior. 

As this is the first time in my career that I've been caught out on this, am I unprofessionnal for turning on transcription in a meeting with senior leadership?

For what it’s worth, my view is that people usually aren’t worried about being transcribed, to me it’s just a professional tool to make sure nothing gets lost... Do you consider the use of transcription, especially in important meetings, as unprofessional? I am genuinely curious, as I wonder if this perception comes from a cultural difference and I would like to avoid repeating the mistake in another context.

Thank you!",OriginalPumpkin5994,21,0.8399999737739563,49,1756406849,2025-08-28 18:47:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n2kouq/am_i_unprofessional_for_activating_transcription/,8,2025

This is only my second time posting and I’m doing it from my phone so apologies if the formatting is messed up. Also apologies if this isn’t the best place to post.

I don’t expect to be able to work full time during school, and I’d rather not do school part time if possible to avoid. 

However, my husband will hopefully also be starting school (CRNA) in 1-2 years if he’s accepted, and he won’t be able to work at all for 3 years. My question is how do you financially survive when both partners are in school/unable to work full time? I would think living with his parents, but we have a dog and they wouldn’t allow that. Do you just have to rely on loans?

1n2hgwd,Can I study at work if my team doesn’t really need me?,"I’ve been in my current management role for about three months. The team has been leading themselves for so long that most of what I do is administrative. I’ve offered hands-on help plenty of times, but honestly we’re staffed well enough that they don’t really need it. I also do frequent check-ins and morale is pretty good.

Occasionally I get pulled in for advanced troubleshooting, but I’ve been doing this long enough that it’s nothing I haven’t seen before, and I can usually resolve it pretty quickly. That leaves me with a lot of downtime during the day.

I’m also in school right now to qualify for senior management roles, so I was wondering, is it okay to use that extra time to study at work? Or would that look bad even if all my responsibilities are covered? I want to support my team and be the best leader I can. I don’t want them to think that I’m not doing anything.

1n2h63p,Boss wants me to take an assistant I don't need,"I started a job recently (kitchen manager, not working with kids most days) at a private school wherein there's someone else doing the same work I do on the floor below. The manager downstairs has an assistant who comes in a few hours a day to help with cleaning, dishes, and other organizational tasks. It's clear none of the admin staff have ever worked in a kitchen so they think I'm a miracle worker given how tidy and efficient I am. And the teachers love me to boot. They have asked me several times if I want an assistant like the manager downstairs, insisting I do, that eventually I'll fall behind. I truly cannot imagine what an assistant would do for me (I have some good spare time as it is, which I'm not mad about!), but it recently hit me that I feel like I could be paid for both jobs. I know they won't just add the two salaries and hand it over, but I'm currently paid the same as the other manager but doing the work of two staff members. I don't want an assistant because I'm enjoying working alone and think it would actually mess up the flow, but don't necessarily want to be doing extra work for a place I don't really love. 

tldr: What type of language would I use, once it is really proven that I don't and won't fall behind, to ask for a raise consideration to cover the assistant work I'm already doing when company policy says raises aren't considered before 9 months of employment?

1n2gn8v,Took a Career Break Before Starting Legal Practice (Canada) – Looking for Perspectives,"Hi everyone,

I’m in my mid-20s and recently graduated law school. I had a secured a full time law firm position, but earlier this year I decided to defer my start date by a year.

The reason: my father was diagnosed with stage 3 pancreatic cancer, and I also had my own health emergency during law school. It became clear that pushing straight into full time would risk both my ability to be present with him and my long-term stability. The firm was understanding and allowed me to defer.

Now, I’m in this “career break year.” I’ll be writing the Ontario Bar exams this fall and spending extended time in Korea with my family. I’m also exploring tutoring/teaching and a few side projects to stay engaged.

I’ll admit: some days I feel anxious about being “behind” my peers who are already in practice. Other days, I know I’ll never regret prioritizing my dad and my health during this window. It’s a strange tension — relief at making the humane choice, but insecurity about pausing the professional track. FYI, I have an undergrad degree from UToronto and an Oxbridge Master's Degree (no full time work experience, just summers) 

I’d love to hear from anyone who has taken a career break early in their career:

* Was this a mistake? How do I stop feeling like I am behind? 

Thanks in advance — I know this year is ultimately an investment, but it helps to hear how others have navigated the same space.

1n2gi7v,Bespoke Jeweler with very little work.,"Hi everyone, I need guidance. 
I work for a small company making heirloom quality jewelry. I am one of two jewelers & have worked here for 4 years. 
The other jeweler is my boss & owner of this company & she comes to the studio seldomly. 

About ~1.5 years ago, I was offered a salaried position which was rescinded as their “financial advisor” said that only administrative staff should be salaried but that I absolutely didn’t do anything wrong. 

When I asked about it most recently she said that she felt that I “abused the salaried position by being late,” which wasn’t originally addressed. 

Anyways, my boss is a bit flippant and out of touch. I have no work and I’m forced to sit in the studio 9-5 with nothing to do. I actually mean nothing though- I’ve already done maintenance to the machines, cleaned, everything. 

So, I’m feeling a bit bitter. There aren’t any other jobs in my field in my city that pay what I’m making now or anywhere close to it. 

How should I address this? If they’re not paying enough attention to know that I am just sitting here despite asking for more work- why do I have to lose money by leaving early if practically everyone else in the company is salaried and could leave with no financial repercussions. 

Ugh, I’m frustrated and feeling stuck. ",Aggravating-Tie4477,1,1.0,4,1756397443,2025-08-28 16:10:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n2gi7v/bespoke_jeweler_with_very_little_work/,8,2025

1n2f9kc,Almost a year unemployed,"Hurricane Helene hit September 27, 2024, my last day as a vacation rental cleaner was a few days prior. I had a decent savings back then, as we were about to move out, but when you're panicking and not sure when you're going to be able to get out again, you buy as much shelf stable food as possible, and what didn't go to food, went to gas for the generator.

I did work spark for a short bit between May and June, but first week of June I got into a wreck that left my car a ""total loss"" I was trying to get a salvage title and figured I'd go back out and try to spark again while I waited for it to come in, sure enough, first day, I get into another accident, this time the lady has no insurance, so even though I have footage, it's not a covered wreck unfortunately. The car is still only cosmetically damaged, but we decided to replace it anyway seeing there was already a ton of rust damage, etc.

Since June I have applied to 40 jobs on just indeed, that's not including all the jobs I applied to on their company sites. I have had 2 job interviews, one for Bojangles, which can I say, wow, underpaid, but I didn't care, having a job gives me leverage for finding a better job. I got the job through bojangles, went out to buy jeans, called the manager about start and pay on my way home, completely forgot that service drops in one spot on the way. We'll service dropped and she shot me a quite nasty text, I responded to her, and told her my call dropped, but I was still up for discussing pay and hours if she was, otherwise, best of luck finding someone else to fill the position. 

My next interview was at a nursing home, it felt like they weren't prepared, the interview was done in a hallway while they actively had medics, families visiting, etc. Said they'd get back to me, that's been over a week, when I called earlier this week to check in, they said they'd get back to me, hadn't had a chance to look at my application yet, which I thought was odd, as why interview me before looking at my application? But whatever.. 

Anyway, that leads me to where I am now. I have applied to every job I can work in the county. My only other two options are factory jobs, the one I can't do due to carpal tunnel (I would fail their medical exams required for the job, I've met people who have confirmed they have carpal and were turned down) and the other is known for getting people fired for them not fitting in the clique (this happened to a few people I personally know and know to be trustworthy, not to mention I've applied and got rejected)

Any jobs I haven't applied to literally pay under $13 an hour, and after doing rental cleaning where some days I was looking at $30/hr when I broke it down, I will not work myself to death for $10/hr and barely 30hrs a week.

I'm aware I only have a Highschool diploma, I know people see the long bout of unemployment and wonder why? But to have the audacity to set yourself as urgently hiring, and not give me the chance to explain is beyond me. 

That being said, if anyone knows of any jobs near Weaverville or Burnsville, NC that pay preferably $15/hr or more, please let me know. I'm looking for first shift, which seems to be a death sentence when looking for work..

I’m in my 3rd semester of CSE and honestly, I really need some advice regarding my career path.

My college classes get canceled a lot, so I usually have a ton of free time. I *really* want to use that time to learn something useful, but the problem is I can’t figure out what exactly to focus on.

Here’s where I stand:

* I know some **HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS**.
* Currently learning **DSA in C++** and **OOPs in Python**.
* Tried web dev, but I honestly didn’t enjoy it (especially JavaScript). Ever since then I just dropped it.
* My cousin keeps telling me to “mandatorily” learn MERN or MEAN stack, but I don’t feel comfortable with JS and don’t see myself liking it.

What I *do* find interesting is hardware-related subjects like **Computer Organization & Architecture**. Not electronics, but more on the computing side. I’ve always imagined myself working in places like **ISRO or DRDO** someday, maybe something research-oriented.

The problem is:

* I can’t figure out which **domain** I should really commit to.
* I also want to build my **soft skills** (communication, confidence, etc.) but have no idea where to start.
* I don’t want to waste my college years doing nothing, but right now I feel stuck without direction.

So I’m looking for advice:

* What are the main domains in CS I should look into?
* What kind of **skills (both technical + soft skills)** should I focus on?
* Any **resources, workshops, or activities** that might help me explore and discover my path?

Would love to hear from people who’ve been through this phase or have some clarity. Any guidance would mean a lot.",OkYam2915,1,1.0,4,1756390174,2025-08-28 14:09:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n2d96m/advice_3rd_sem_cse_student_struggling_to_pick_a/,8,2025

1n2aou1,Asking for raise after 6 years,"Hello!

I was hoping to get anyone's opinion on how much raise is acceptable to ask. I work in a warehouse+local trucking company. I've been an admin for years which slowly had added responsibilities over the years but i never got extra compensation. since the company is small, ive been doing a little bit if everything. From managing supplies, inventory, storage, and a chunk of client management. We have outsourced IT services for both software and hardware. But since I was the youngest for years, i was happily doing little IT tasks such as making sure printers are working, etc. But due to that, ive been the bridge between office and the IT companies we outsourced. It had been taxing for a time now. But i haven't said anything to management. Which I know is my fault. I've just always had issues asking for help or talking to anyone with authority. But now our boss has presented me with a proposition. My coworker who I've helped covered whenever out sick is leaving. Manager says maybe its best the admin part of his role to go to me and my rate can go up. Since I've been silently tired, ive been set on leaving the company at the end of the year. I've been wanting to for awhile and almost did earlier this year when we had such a difficult day. My parents had been supportive and told me not to worry as they'll help me with rent. Tbh i really wanted to quit then, but in this economy, i couldn't risk being burdensome to my parents for a long time since they're close to retirement and are actively saving up as much as they can for it. I've been working on certicates and portfolio to change industries all together in hopes on getting a new job at a bigger company with morw growth. Layoffs are always a risk with bigger companies so I've been scared of that factor though

Since the opportunity is being presented to me, is it wrong to ask for 30% increase? It has been 6 years since they last gave me one. And with rent increasing again by January, I feel this will help me a lot both witj bills and savings. I was planning to let management give me a number which i assume will be at least 20% since that's what they gave me 6 years ago. Is there a good way to ask for more? I'll get whatever they give of course but i also dont want to seem difficult by asking for a number theyll think would be too high. I'm already overwhelmed as it is so i am also worried they'll add more responsibilities (more than this offer) if they say yes to a 30%",mcfly_baguette,1,1.0,2,1756383549,2025-08-28 12:19:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n2aou1/asking_for_raise_after_6_years/,8,2025

I’ve always been hesitant about leadership roles because they come with so much responsibility, and I’ve noticed that some people in these positions can lose themselves in the process and become less kind or considerate. I want to lead effectively without compromising my values.

I’d love advice on:

1. How to balance being assertive and making tough decisions while remaining kind and considerate.
2. Tips for someone stepping into a director-level role for the first time.

Any insight, personal experience, or resources would be so appreciated!

1n2a3hw,AI Headshots and Resume Screening: Helping or Hiding Bias?,"AI is great and all, but let’s talk about bias. 🧐

We’ve got AI resume screening models favoring white male applicants in 85% of cases. That’s a little sus, don’t you think? And AI-generated headshots? Well, they’re often missing the mark on racial and gender representation. Not exactly a fair start for job seekers who don’t fit the stereotypical mold.

Here’s what i think- AI is awesome for streamlining things. But if it’s reinforcing bias and inequality, what’s the point? Headshots for your LinkedIn? Great. But if the AI behind it isn’t representing you the right way, is it really helping or just giving a polished, fake version of who you are?

How do we make AI fair and inclusive? Can it be done without just going full “ideal image” mode?

1n28acl,Work will always take 8 hours. Don't let it steal the other 8.,"I used to think my 9-to-5 job was the problem. Like, if I changed jobs or found a cooler role, I'd stop feeling like a dead person. (I'm alive but dead). But no... I discovered that it wasn't just the 8 hours of work that were killing me, it was the way I came home with no energy to actually live or do anything I love. I hated how my whole day was: wake up - work - zone out - repeat. Nodding my head in meetings and not retaining anything, then regretting it later, and also no ""me"" time, no real life. Just existing.

You know that feeling when you walk into your room, throw down your bag, and suddenly you find yourself scrolling, watching Netflix, maybe heating something up, and boom, it's 12 AM? That was me for years. Then one day, I realized my job wasn't stealing my time... I was kind of just handing it over on the same schedule.

Honestly, I'm trying to figure out how not to be completely zoned out after work, and a few small things have really helped (sharing them in case they help someone else too):

My commute became my recharge time. I used to doomscroll or be stressed on the way back, but recently I've started treating it as transition/chill time. Sometimes I play a podcast, sometimes I just stare out the window. Weirdly, I get home with a little mental battery left instead of being completely dead inside.

The meeting hack. Not every damn meeting needs to be a meeting. Half the time, I ask straight up, can't this be an email or a Slack message? And writing helps sometimes, even if the ideas are many and need to be organized. But I'm still figuring it out.

The after-work ritual. I don't do anything fancy, just change into comfy clothes, light a candle, maybe go for a short walk. It's like I'm telling my brain, dude, work is over. And it makes a bigger difference than I expected.

One non-negotiable fun thing. Even if I'm fucking tired, I try to do one thing I genuinely enjoy, like continuing my novel, making myself some ramen, or talking to one of my friends. Otherwise, life starts to feel like a closed loop of work, sleep, and then repeat.

I'm not saying this fixes burnout or anything, but these small changes have made my evenings less miserable.",Friendly_Change9137,424,0.9800000190734863,23,1756375857,2025-08-28 10:10:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n28acl/work_will_always_take_8_hours_dont_let_it_steal/,8,2025

I like to raise a question with the people. Who has posted their comment on X/Twitter? It was posted by a former Microsoft employee from Singapore. The article has been published in M/s. Hindustan Times. As if there was poor work-life balance.

I need to raise a question with the recruiters. Do they have access to a research article published in the M/s. New India Express? It states that quality of productivity had its own impact with climatic conditions.

The intention of this pen-down is to erase your predetermined mindset before screening any candidate whom you find any career break. Raise your question and understand his strength. There are people with breaks who will never pass any negative comments. And they have innovative ideas within them. They may have implemented it in their former organization, and they may quit because of certain things that are against their principle of this life.

Unfortunately I found the job not fulfilling and had many health issues while working at site. During my time at that company I got exposure to many fields and found Finance and Accounting particularly interesting. Researching more I have a dream of working in health care finance. But since my background is in engineering and I don't have any credibility in Finance I am not sure how I can proceed further. I want to do some courses but at the same time I want to build practical experience too. What is the best way to proceed further?

1n267nq,Struggling to Choose Between Data Engineering and Cybersecurity - Need Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 20 y/o final-year BS Data Science student, and I’m currently at a crossroads in deciding my career path. I’ve narrowed down my interests to **Data Engineering** and **Cybersecurity**, since I enjoy building and fixing things.

Outside of academics, I have **3+ years of experience in business development and web project management**, so I’m not new to working in professional environments or handling technical projects. That said, I’m looking to transition into a more technical role that aligns better with my degree and long-term goals.

The challenge is, I don’t have the luxury of diving deep into every domain to figure out what resonates with me the most. I’d like to approach this decision more efficiently so I can focus on building the right skills and not waste time going down paths that don’t fit.

One important detail, I’m **not particularly strong in math**. From what I understand, that may affect how I’d fare in some areas of data-related work. With that in mind:

* If I go into **Cybersecurity**, what specific domains or roles would be a good fit for someone with my background?
* If I go into **Data Engineering**, how much advanced math would I realistically need to succeed?

Would it make sense to just start learning in one direction and see if it clicks, or should I be more deliberate before committing?

P.S. - This is all I could muster. I'm not even sure if I've asked all the right questions. So, any insights, experiences, or guidance would be hugely appreciated.

I had an interview with one of the top three companies in my field in another country. They are used to relocating employees, had great benefits, an amazing opportunity for me to grow. Interview went really good. They even responded to my thank you message after the interview but yesterday I got the rejection email and I am devastated. 

They sent me a personalised email saying that I was I really strong candidate. They said my profile impressed them in many ways, but considering all the candidates for the role, they made the difficult decision. 

I know my mistake. I put all my hopes into this role. I’m suffering from depression and really needed a fresh start and this was going to give me just that. It was one of the few roles in Germany which didn’t require German language in the beginning. So I think I don’t have a lot of chances anymore over there. 

It’s like grieving a dream opportunity. I am already unhappy at my current job, and I don’t think I will have many chances to promote within. So I stuck in a job I don’t like.

1n251cj,Choosing Between TCS Digital Offer with Joining Delay vs Fintech Startup Internship with PPO Chance — What Would You Do?,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently facing a tough decision and would love to hear thoughts from this community. I have a confirmed offer from TCS Digital, but they have not released my joining letter yet. My offer letter was issued back in Dec 2024, and the joining timeline is quite uncertain as many peers have reported delays extending several months, with no clear indication of when onboarding will happen.

At the same time, I have an internship offer from a fintech startup, valued at around $500 million and having raised over $70 million in funding. The internship is for 6 months, specifically for a software role, where I get to work on real projects and have a chance to convert to a full-time role based on my performance.

I’m torn between:

* Waiting indefinitely for TCS to onboard me and risk having a gap in experience or career momentum
* Taking the fintech startup internship, gaining hands-on experience immediately, but facing uncertainty about conversion

I’m also wondering, if I don’t convert at the fintech startup, what have others done in similar situations? How did you leverage your internship experience, and how difficult was the transition to a full-time job elsewhere?

Would really appreciate any insights, especially if you’ve been in a similar scenario with either TCS joining delays or intern conversions at growing fintech startups. How did your career pan out? What would you recommend I prioritize?

1n23dxb,Where do I take my career from here? [IT/AU],"For background context: I am 31 years old and living in metropolitan Australia. I currently solo manage and operate the IT department for a small-to-medium sized business, a role that I worked my way up to over a relatively short period of time from an entry level position in another department. I am technically skilled and have developed a lot of specialised knowledge, but I do not have any supporting certificates or degrees.

I enjoy certain aspects of my job, but I have also very obviously fallen victim to many of the trappings of small business. I am effectively overseeing three peoples' worth of work and wearing far too many different hats for a salary that is 30-40% below the state average; an arrangement I agreed to, as I felt I had no choice. I have since realised that this was a mistake. 

I can get into further specifics if necessary, but the main reason I'm posting this here is that I want to know what my options are. Clearly I need to leave and seek employment elsewhere if I want to be paid fairly for my work. I'd like to stay in IT as it appeals a lot to my personal interests and I am proficient enough at this stage to adapt to the needs of a different business. My more pressing concern is that I'm not sure that my level of experience is going to be enough to land a different job without having to take a significant pay cut, which is not really something I can afford to do right now.

Contextual data: I have been in my managerial role for a year. Prior to that, I was in a junior IT role in the same business for two and a half years, and an unrelated role in the same business a year before that. Most of my experience prior to this is irrelevant to the kind of work I want to do and will only serve to prevent gaps in my resume.

I am currently paid roughly $82k AUD with no chance of career progression; this puts me in the same bracket as a L1 or *maybe* L2 technician. To contrast, I am effectively the company's infrastructure manager, project manager, and entire helpdesk. My wife and I are wanting to have children; I either need more money or some of my time back.

My current game plan is to try for a role a bit lower down the ladder than my current one (something like mid-level support desk or infrastructure) and work my way up from there. I believe this will give me a better opportunity to learn and grow my skillset than trying to jump straight into another administrative role. Given the salary averages I've been able to see for my city, it also seems like I could do so without needing to take too much of a pay cut, if any. 

My questions are mostly related to tempering my expectations.

* How likely am I to be seen as under or over qualified for such a position in the context of a larger business?
* As mentioned before, I have no qualifications in this field. Is my level of experience going to be enough to make me a compelling candidate?
* I would ultimately love to build towards a managerial role, which I am well aware requires a completely different set of skills to a standard infrastructural or technical role. How should I best start setting myself up for success now to make that happen?
* If I need to get a piece of paper to make myself look more appealing, where would you recommend I start? I'm not sure what is typically considered desirable in the context of the Australian job market.

I'm not in a massive rush to quit my job and speed into the sunset, but I need to stop being complacent about my career trajectory, and this is my way of holding myself accountable.

1n239ux,Help! Notice period question,"I am currently in a permanent role in my current company. Even though it is permanent, the company is going through layoffs and permanent staff are being let go. In terms of my role and career prospects, I wish to leave. I interviewed for a contract role with another company-(meaning i would be on the permanent payroll of recruitment agency & work in client office) The salary is higher and other benefits comparable with my current company.
After the interview the feedback from the recruitment company (my to-be employer) is positive and the client expressed their desire to hire me, however the concern of the client is my 2 months notice period with current employer- They would like me to join immediately or with max 1 months notice period.

The recruiter has asked me if I can negotiate with my current employer- my feedback was to let them know I can only bring up this topic with my current employer after receiving a signed offer letter from my to-be employer. (How can I bring this topic with my current line manager or current HR , without any offer in hand ?)

I have also told the recruiter, there is a buyout option mentioned in my current company contract, and at present the recruiter is checking with the client if it is possible for this option. (As mentioned above I don’t have any offer letter yet.)

1n239oi,Advice about going back to school for a career change,"To make it long story short, I got a bachelors in sociology and quickly realized how hard finding a job is post grad. I never wanted a career in social work or anything and basically just picked a major that piqued my interest and now two years post grad I've been working as a dental assistant living paycheck to paycheck and hate it. The environment is beyond toxic but even if it wasn't I never saw this as a life long career and more just something to get by until I figure out what my passion is.

The silver lining is I realized how much I do like the medical field and thought nursing would be a good option for me. I'm open to anything and everything when it comes to jobs but I'm really trying to find a masters program that will help me make decent money quicker than the pace I'm going at now. Nursing just checked a lot of boxes for me because of how flexible the career options are and like I said I enjoy the medical field (caring for people etc plus nothing grosses me out). Now I'm having doubts though because I loathe science and have a ton of science pre recs to take and after starting one of them it's like listening to someone speak another language.

I'm debating whether I keep moving forward with trying to get a 'masters of science in entry to nursing' or if I switch gears altogether. I know I want to do some type of schooling in order to achieve this but not sure what path to go. I really want a legit career though if that makes sense, something I can do long term and make a decent living and somewhat enjoy. If anyone enjoys their job in the slightest please let me know what it is that you do and what the schooling is like or just any advice in general is appreciated.

1n22fs6,Advice/resources for a junior electrical engineer (system protection) struggling with remote work learning,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 24 year-old electrical engineer, about 2 years out of school and into my career. I work fully remote, and honestly, I feel like I’m not learning at the rate I’d like. A big part of it seems to be the remote setup. I often wish I had started hybrid or in-person to build a stronger foundation before transitioning to remote.

My company has noticed this gap for newer engineers (especially those hired post-COVID), so they set up weekly meetings with senior engineers to go over technical concepts. While helpful, they feel more like lectures than interactive sessions, and personally I don’t retain much that way since I learn best through application.

In my first year, I focused on studying for the FE, which I passed in summer 2024. I’ll likely start preparing for the PE in the next 1–2 years. In the meantime, I’d like to get more sound technically, especially in system protection. The field feels pretty niche, and while I learned some fundamentals in school (per-unit conversions, symmetrical components, etc.), many of the concepts I’m seeing now are brand new to me.

So I’m wondering:
	•	Do you have any advice for junior engineers in protection who want to build a stronger technical foundation?
	•	Are there any specific resources (books, online courses, practice problems, communities, etc.) that helped you?
	•	Anything you wish you had done early in your career to accelerate your learning?

Thanks in advance, I really appreciate any guidance. ",Fine-Spare-4326,1,1.0,0,1756353987,2025-08-28 04:06:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n22fs6/adviceresources_for_a_junior_electrical_engineer/,8,2025

I'm applying to university and thinking about supply chain or finance. I do not know which to do, although i am more interested in finance but worried about the competitive part in the program. And yes, I have done tons of research because I was interested in being a financial analyst and the growth I could make in that career, but my brother-in-law is a supply chain manager in logistics, so he explained the job and all that. I was quite interested, but then i watched multiple videos on supply chains and was intrigued by the teaching of supply chains. So my question is, why supply chain?

1n21jkq,Was put into Stretch and Interim Role but same title & same salary. Help?,"Hello everyone, I’m in a weird spot right now and I wonder how you would go about this:

Context: I am in digital marketing team

I have been with the company for about 5 years now and our company did some layoffs last year. I have been one of the lucky few who didn’t get terminated. 

Now, here comes the fun part. My skip level manager asked me to step in and do a stretch role for 1 product to help out the business. Mind you, this is an area that I know nothing about and although there are some overlaps, my area of expertise is not in this role. I accepted as I wanted to be a good team member. This also meant that now I had two managers. 

After 1 month, i was then asked to stretch my already stretch role to other products, meaning more responsibilities. And that my primary role will now be split into 50/50. I ask if this is a role change, they said no.

Fast forward to now, I am now permanently in my “stretch role” and my old role is still under me. There is nothing in writing. My title is still my old title. My salary is still my old salary. My performance is still based on my old role’s goals. 

Here’s a recent development, my boss from my old original role was let go and now his position was available and I was the clear next in line. I had the experience, knowledge, etc. I raised my hand to take on his role fully and get the promotion. 

The leadership accepted but not really. They asked me to step in as interim for my boss’ old role on top of all my current responsibilities and they said that unfortunately the role is frozen for hiring at the moment. 

Now, I’m stuck with 3 roles - no title change, no salary change, no promotion. 

Help? Please?

1n20lnl,"Massive Private Student Loan Debt (In Forbearance, payments start Jan 2026). Debating career paths.","Hey all, I posted here before about my student loan situation, but now I’m facing another career decision and wanted to get some feedback. I’m 26, currently in tech sales as an SDR at HubSpot. Here is the pay progression:

|Role|Base|Variable|OTE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||
|BDR Level 1|$52,220|$22,380|$74,600|
|BDR Level 2|$54,400|$26,800|$81,200|
|BDR Level 3|$56,620|$30,480|$87,100|
|Account Executive (L1)|$65,410|$58,190|$123,600|

I’ve been here about 4 months, and I’m on track to hit BDR Level 2 by December. (It only takes 15-18 months from BDR Level 1 to reach Account Executive L1). The tech sales path is appealing because if I stick with it, I could be making really good money fast (moving SDR → AE → beyond). But the downside is the stress and instability of being in sales—it feels like it could be feast or famine long term.

On the other hand, I’ve been considering pivoting to Fidelity for a Financial Services Representative role. The Fidelity track seems a lot more stable, but slower financially:  
Financial Services Rep → Financial Rep → Relationship Manager → Planning Consultant → Financial Consultant. From what I’ve learned, it would probably take 4–5 years before I’d reach that FC level and see the bigger paychecks.

Now this is the issue, I’ve got heavy private student loan debt with Sallie Mae (250k high interest private debt), currently in forbearance and my next payment starts back up in January 2026. Payments as high as $2700, need to refinance with another company because I dont know how ill be able to pay that. Living at home right now helps since I don’t pay rent (just food and gas), but I really want to start building a future where I can get out of this hole.

So, my dilemma is:

* **Stay in tech sales**: higher earning potential in the short term, but more risk and stress.
* **Switch to Fidelity**: slower financial growth, but stability and long-term structure.

Also, I’m starting to think about dating again after spending a lot of time improving myself physically and mentally, but I can’t help worrying about bringing this financial burden into a relationship.

Would love to hear people’s thoughts or experiences on balancing big private loans with career paths like these.",Good_Ranger_1199,1,1.0,0,1756348388,2025-08-28 02:33:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n20lnl/massive_private_student_loan_debt_in_forbearance/,8,2025
1n2012f,Is it a good idea to continue working at this job?,"



I’ve been working remotely for this college almost a year & this past week was the yearly conference everyone has to attend on site. I’m a very socially anxious person but interacted fine with mgmt and staff remotely so assumed I would be able to handle the interactions in person. I was wrong, this past week was one of the hardest things I’ve done in a while. I broke down in private multiple times, had to vent with my mom (even though I’m normally pretty private) and wonder how I should continue moving forward. Almost everyone was warm and friendly towards me, no one gave me a bad vibe to my face but clearly I didn’t interact with every single person. Today was the gala and I had to find an out, my boss said it was required but I found an excuse and she didn’t really give me slack for it. It’s possible this will come up later, I feel I need to share a few things before anyone says it’s time to find a new job:

- I’m at a level one role since I’m new but my supervisor always points out I’m at a level 3 based on metrics
- Aside from my supervisor, both mgrs have pointed out my work. One trained me and said I was a natural, quick learner etc while the other pointed out I have the potential to work in leadership (supervisor also said this). 
- Everyone got some kind of raise, I got almost an 8% raise as the yearly increase and wonder if it was a reflection of my work. My supervisor kept msging me on the side & said she was happy for me
- I had some kind of warning, it wasn’t a performance plan. Verbal? Mgmt thinks I have potential but need to work on confidence/stop 2nd guessing after the semester recap
- I tend to get most of my “praise” in private with mgmt, as it seems everyone’s praise tends to be public in team meetings etc. Does that say something?
- Yesterday they were giving out awards and someone on my team who’s newer got an award for a metric that I’m told is my strength. Supervisor says I have one of the highest scores on the team so why didn’t I get the award? 
- The company culture and benefits are the best I’ve had, I don’t think this is easy to find anywhere ",Dsg1695,1,1.0,3,1756346733,2025-08-28 02:05:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n2012f/is_it_a_good_idea_to_continue_working_at_this_job/,8,2025

1n1xvhv,Has anyone negotiated their salary after getting another job offer?,"Interviewing for a job offering 30k+ more than my current base salary. Love my current company, job function, and the people BUT that’s a lot of money to be left on the table.

Has anyone been in a similar situation where they tried to negotiate a higher salary at their current job? How did that conversation go, who did you talk to, and what was the outcome?

1n1xie9,Have not gotten a raise after 1yr3months but new hire starts off at a higher pay,"

Hello so for context I have been at my job for about 1 year and 3 months and have not gotten any sort of raise after working in the office for that long. Our company let someone go about 2 months ago and I decided to check the post out on LinkedIn on monday night 08/25. I come to find out that the starting pay that is being advertised is currently more than what I make. 

I was super pissed and sent my boss an email the next morning on 08/26 stating that I needed to speak about my compensation by the end of this week. We had a meeting today 08/27 and my boss tells me that at the current moment they can not offer a raise and that they can not match the pay on what theyre offering the new hire because I ""accepted their offer"" when they hired me which was about 1 year ago. I tell him what I bring to the company and compare how much better we are than any other location but all he says Is that at the moment they can not give me a raise. 

This is impossible as I work for a fortune 500 company and within the last 3 months there has been change In upper management and it seems to look like they always have more money for them 🤷🏻‍♂️ I like working here it is a very great place to work at, but that does not pay the bills. I live well below my means and very smart with my money but that does not mean I am going to let a company exploit me when I have gone above and beyond with things that other employees wont even do.

I walked through it with him, explaining why I chose the criteria that I would have to meet to go up from “associate marketing person” to “marketing person”.

He liked what I put together and said, if you keep doing what your doing and meet these criteria, in 4 or 5 years when your up for your promotion, you’ll get it guaranteed.

This will be my third year working in marketing and first with my current company. I am already taking on work one level up and want the title and compensation to go with it. I was hoping that this conversation would lead to a path to that, but it appears not.

1n1v4zp,Figuring It Out: Career Path Exploration as a 25F,"🎓 Background
* BA in Psychology (2022).
* Originally planned to be a therapist (marriage/family, adolescent, school).
* Realized post-graduation that while empathy, sensitivity, and intuition would make me a good therapist, I’d likely burn out due to absorbing others’ emotions + my own anxiety/depression.

🚫 Paths Considered & Ruled Out
* PMHNP (Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner): Appealing for balance of talk therapy + medication management, less emotionally taxing, and higher pay than therapist, but couldn’t see myself “pushing through” a few years of being a nurse after my CNA experience.
* School Psychologist: Appealing mix of assessments + one-on-one work, but too much bureaucracy, rigid systems, and low autonomy.
* After eliminating these options, felt lost → “analysis paralysis.” (I’m the biggest over-thinker I know)

🔍 What I’ve Learned Through Assessments, Research & Reflection

Top Career Values (must-haves):
* Low stress, calm/focused pace
* Predictability, structure, clear expectations
* Work-life balance, time freedom, consistent hours
* Remote/hybrid flexibility, autonomy
* Meaningful work, purpose/impact
* Ethical leadership & integrity
* Good pay with low potential for burnout (potential for $100k+)
* Opportunities for planning, organization, and deep focus
* Respect, psychological safety, diversity/inclusion
* Solo & small-team work
* Good benefits (health insurance, PTO, etc.)

Low Priority / Draining Values:
* Competition, high pressure, fast pace
* Constant multitasking 
* Public speaking, large teams, constant social interaction
* Majority of the time client-facing 
* Managerial responsibility, client-facing roles, sales/persuasion
* Chaotic startup culture, on-call or irregular hours
* Metrics-driven environments, “always on” social roles, constantly needing to adapt
* Math-heavy roles
* Jobs where I feel pressured to hide my sensitivity or emotional depth
* Always outdoors/physical work

Strengths: Empathy, insight, organization, planning, research, writing/editing, emotional intelligence, thoroughness, compassion, patience, warmth, make people feel seen & heard, diligence, emotional intelligence, funny, helpful, humble, good listener, perceptive, strategic.

Weaknesses: Anxiety, overthinking, indecision, perfectionism, social anxiety, avoidance of conflict, slow pace, low tolerance for chaos, math, depression, comparison, public speaking, ambiguity, discomfort being in charge, self-doubt, highly sensitive, trouble being assertive.

Core Values: Balance, freedom, stability, autonomy, empathy, authenticity, meaning, belonging, rest, structure, exploration, kindness, personal growth.

Likes: Travel, planning, psychology, nature, cozy aesthetics, journaling, photography, mental health, music, family/friends, fashion, hiking.

Dislikes: Confrontation & unnecessary conflict, being rushed or under pressure, feeling judged, dismissed, or misunderstood, lack of structure or unclear expectations, always having to be “on” socially, fake, arrogant, or inconsiderate people, chaotic environments (clutter, overstimulation, unpredictability, loud interruptions), humidity & physical discomfort, math, plans changing suddenly

🎯 Current Direction
* My most consistent career “match” across assessments and research: UX Researcher.
* It appeals because it blends psychology, research, planning, empathy, and storytelling — without requiring constant high-pressure client-facing interaction.
* I’m aware the UX job market is extremely tough (especially for UXRs), which is discouraging, but I don’t want that to be the reason I walk away. I’m willing to put in the work (further study, portfolio, grad school if needed).

❓ What I’m Looking For
* Recommendations for career paths aligned with these values/strengths.
* Advice on adjacent or stepping-stone roles that could lead toward UX Research or similarly aligned work.
* Recommendations from those who’ve navigated similar pivots.

I am a recent graduate with an undergraduate degree in Economics and Finance. My career aspirations are to eventually attain high-level positions in the finance industry, such as Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

I am currently at a juncture in my career and am seeking guidance on my next steps. While I have already applied for finance jobs, I am also eager to pursue further education. I am relatively early in my career, with only 1.5 years of experience.

My decision is between pursuing a postgraduate degree, such as an MSc in Financial Economics, or obtaining the Chartered Accountant of Canada (ACCA) exemptions and subsequently enrolling in an MBA later in life. It is important to note that ACCA is widely regarded as a prerequisite for most finance positions in my current location.

1n1usfz,Should I just leave?,"I just started a job. I am 2 months in.  My coworker comes up to me and asks me ""hey girl have you ever taken mood stabilizers?""  I figured she saw me crying again( i just found out my dad had cancer via a text) and decided to suggest a solution for me. I got flustered and went off on her. I told her "" I don't want to talk about that right now. I don't need anyone's f**cking opinion on my mental health and I don't want to share why I'm upset today."" She starts bawling and i said ""I'm sorry. I'm not mad at you i just don't want to talk about it.""

I walk away and cool off. I see her again and i apologized. I  told her I'm just upset and its not her. She explains she just wanted to know because she's having an allergic reaction to a mood stabilizer and wanted to know if its normal. I tell her its not and to see a doctor. I give her a hug and we are cool. Misunderstandings happen right?  No. 

My boss hears about it from the very rule-happy little 22- year-old assistant manager (who was in the room )and instead of just writing me up or letting two grown adults handle the already resolved conflict - she decides to bypass all of it and give me a final warning. I explained the situation in full to her and asked to have the final warning lifted, turned into a write up or lifted for good behavior over time. Nope. She won't hear it. I was so upset I actually went home and somehow I let my boss talk me into coming back the next day. I really liked this job up until my bosses final warning. But now I don't feel supported anymore.  I feel like I'm going to be fired at any given moment.  I went above and beyond for this job. Coming in early and staying late and volunteering to try to impress my boss and for nothing.  I'm also very experienced in my field. It really shocked me that my boss blew up like this. 



Will this blow over or should I just look for a different job? Its incredibly awkward at work now. I asked my boss if she still wanted me there and she straight up dodged the question.

1n1u8m0,Embedded systems to Cloud,"I’m currently an engineering student specializing in embedded systems. By the time I graduate I’ll have 3 years of work experience through an apprenticeship/work-study program, mainly working on FPGA (VHDL), PCB design (KiCad), low-level programming (C/Python), and some exposure to PyTorch for spiking neural networks. Also did 2 internships abroad mainly programming C language and PCB Design.

Even though I enjoy embedded systems, I’m realizing that the career ceiling in embedded engineering seems much lower compared to other fields (in terms of salary and opportunities abroad). After doing some research, I’m considering a career switch into cloud computing.

I want to work internationally (Europe, Middle East, or Asia), maximize my salary potential in the long run and especially avoid being stuck with a low “glass ceiling” in my career

But what I’d like to ask is, given my embedded background, would I actually stand out in the cloud market, or would I just compete with thousands of generic CS graduates?

Nice rep though but I don’t find it much exciting here. I am like I want to take the world forward in the grandest way possible not like by joining NGO and help like 100 people in my life but impact life of thousands. Initially I thought of going to military when there were like people wondering about WW3. So I thought I could jump in and save the day . Then I thought of some crazy super secret govt program and do some great contribution like Alan Turing or Batman. But you also gotta have I think the timing, luck and expert and PhD type background. Then I pivoted to Elon Musk type .. like impacting with tech
Now this is the conundrum :
I am part of Entrepreneurship cell at my college .. great club. I have been trying to build it somewhat from the floor. I am in this crazy branch (Physics) where I have like 5 labs a week and 6 courses where i am performing kind of ill academically. I want to go to foreign for an intern to gain experience, meet people and learn from what and how people outside this country are thinking . Trying to bag one but no luck there. I do Machine Learning . I started it because it is easy to get into any group of people and is the hot topic so everyone connects to it in one or other way. I know NLP and Computer Vision and Tabular Data . Not any out of the box projects. Decent ones . I have One intern. Side by side I am also working on this startup opportunity which I am sure shot will work. Unable to find co-founders or team though with the same drive. On the side I am also looking into say a chemical manufacturing plant (my father’s instruction)
Managing all these have become tough and I have to prioritise. What do you suggest ? Academics is a major part of concern as I have CGPA around 7.5 only. I am not interested in placements.



TL;DR;
I do ML. Looking for foreign interns. Working on a startup idea. Crazy hectic academics and no relax in that. I just want to do 1 good foreign intern. Helps me in every way. How to best do it while optimising work ?

I’m finishing my business studies and I’ve always worked in B2C sales (retail, fashion, accessories). What I love most is the client relationship – adapting to different personalities, building trust, making people feel understood. I’d say I’m a real chameleon when it comes to customers.

Now I want to move into B2B because I’m looking for longer-term relationships, bigger deals, and the chance to sell products or services I truly believe in. I also have dual nationality (France/Mauritius). My plan is to stay based in France but do regular trips to Mauritius to build business opportunities there.

For those who’ve made the transition: what’s the best way to break into B2B with a B2C background? And do you think this kind of “two-country” setup is realistic in sales, or should I focus on one market first?

1n1rnj9,Am i getting fire?,"I have been working at this company as a motion graphic animator for a year and a half. I had a heat argument with my current boss before I became his employee (I was in a different department at the time).

As the months have gone by, I have been working as usual and trying to improve myself. I believe I have been doing fine so far.

However, in recent weeks, I have noticed that my boss hasn't been giving me as much work. In our group chat with 50 peoples including other departments, I am never mentioned or assigned anything. I haven't had any tasks for two weeks, and he passes works to another guy instead of me. The other person is actually my favorite peer; he has taught me a lot and is far better than my boss.

I am receiving no work at all, and my performance report is suffering. I'm getting confused. Perhaps the company wants to get rid of me. Alternative reasons could be some other internal conflicts. At this point, I'm just going to go to work for the attendance and the money.

1n1rduv,[Career Advice] Dull and boring AI job. Need advice.,"Hi, wanted to get opinions on my current work situation. I currently work at a small AI startup as an Analyst. My job primarily involves data collection and data entry. Creating validation data sets, sometimes testing AI models and agents. I dont get to do any coding or actually work on anything remotely technical. The work is extremely dull and boring. My background is fairly technical with a masters in applied maths from a top Russell group uni in the UK with a decent amount of coding and statistics (with good grades and a great dissertation). Post graduation, I was hoping for a data science role and did get to a few final round interviews. I joined my current company through a referral and because it was easy to get but regretting it now. I have been here over 8 months now and work has pretty much been the same. I feel shitty on a daily basis. The positives are that it is work from home and my colleagues including the managers are nice. However, the work is dreadful and makes me wonder if my career would go downhill because of this. This is my first job and I have a few data analysis type internships. My questions are the following,

1. Should I be planning to leave the company immediately or have a chat with my managers first about any other prospects I can have within the company? Note: the company managers and seniors are very cagey about the technical side, I barely have any info about that side. They are also very non communicative. Communication is pretty much restricted to ""this is the task, task updates etc.."", nothing beyond that. Also, my manager and the founders have a business background.
2. I would like to apply for data science roles or data analyst at the very least. Given that this job has not provided me with any hands on technical experience, what are my chances of a getting a data science role and how can I increase them?

If you have been in a similar scenario of have any advice regarding this scenario, how to cope etc would love to hear you thoughts.

This got me a bit pissed off and so  I reached out to the system engineers who have the approval of who gets to go to the work trip and complained about potentially being sidelined. The systems engineer apparently did something in the background that almost caused the last minute add to not be able to go and it was pretty obvious to my manager I was the one who may of sparked that fuse. I ended up getting treated like shit at  site and now that I’m back from it I’ve noticed things have changed a bit at the work place. There’s no mention of me traveling anymore and I recently I started reaching out to different departments about any job openings.

1n1r15j,what careers should i be going for in the future?,"For context, I am 20 years old currently going to a community college and getting my associates degree in Psychology (my major) and Sociology. I currently plan to (and hopefully will) transfer to Fordham LC to continue my Psych degree and getting my minor in marketing, and possibly sociology as well (I think it’s very interesting). I want to go into the marketing field (preferably something in a creative and social environment) post grad. I also have always intended on going to grad school, but don’t know if I want to go for IO psych or criminal/clinical psych (my original life plan).  

I really like the creative side to marketing (campaigns, creative directors, or just being an idea person in general) and have wanted to find a job in that while I save money to go back to school (if i do). I would preferably want something that pays kind of well and that I can use my degrees/skills on.

I will be living in NYC so I’m sure I’ll be able to make plenty of connections, but I’m still confused/searching for what options there are for me out there as I am young and not aware of many types of jobs outside of basic ones.

1n1pf41,"Nonprofit job offer: Program manager role, JD reads like a Director role, worth it?","I was offered a Program Manager position at a nonprofit (with a Lead Instructor role baked in) to oversee a new education program. At first glance it seems solid, but the more I read over and think about the JD, the more red flags I see:

*  Duties include teaching, program management, accreditation, expansion, and national representation at conferences, basically two jobs in one.
* The salary would be $65k (this seems negotiable), but the scope reads like a director-level role, as the JD emphasizes leadership experience, being responsible for accreditation, and helping expand to (and oversight of) multiple sites.
* They’ve had recent turnover in marketing and legal, and it looks like some of those responsibilities would bleed into my role. I'm still waiting to hear if I would have support from other departments for these tasks.
* Realistically, this job looks like 60 hours a week.

For context: I already run a social media business in the same space that does a lot of what the nonprofit does: content creation, marketing strategy, classes, partnerships. We've also done a lot of advertising for them. My worry is that taking this role would blur the lines, pull me away from my own business, and potentially box me in.

Some pros and cons I've considered:

* Pros: this would be a guaranteed paycheck, this would have some national visibility, as well as connect me with institutional resources I currently don't have.
* Cons: loss of independence, slower growth for my business, over-scoped and under-paid, internal political risk, blurred lines between my potential employer and my current business, potential subsumption

Options I see:

1. Negotiate for a substantially higher total comp: if they want me to do Director-level work, they need to pay accordingly.
2. Push them to rescope the role to be more in line with the current compensation.
3. Walk away to continue building my business and continue to collaborate with them as an IC.

1n1orkx,I’m applying for both JD programs and single subject credential programs,"20f My degree can only really yield two career paths: law or education. I originally planned on going to law school, and I am currently studying for the LSAT. But as I think about it more, I don’t think law is going to be conducive to the life I want, at least not right now. I’ve heard a lot of great things about teaching as a “starter career” (in CA at least) and I’m honestly leaning more towards education because, you guessed it, I want a family! I am engaged to my partner, and we would prefer to start a family before age 30. 

I still feel very passionately about the type of law I want to practice, but maybe… it can wait? At least five years? Attorneys don’t get very good maternity leave, it’ll be three months tops, and likely unpaid. My worry is that I’ll have barely begun my career before I want to have children, and risk losing a job I just barely got because I’ll want to take maternity leave.

Where I’m located, education solves all of these problems. Teachers are tenured after 2 years, get dental/health insurance, have a union, and get major holidays + summers off. I think this job would be more conducive to my desire to have a family, and I see many women starting with teaching for the sole purpose of the stability it provides for having children. Female teachers can take 4-6 months maternity leave, paid, and still have their job when they come back, so long as they’re tenured. Having a family is more important to me right now than having a career as an attorney. 

I’ve also volunteered to coach academic extracurriculars at a local high school, and it really is rewarding to interact with and guide some of these young brilliant minds. I think for the most part, I would enjoy teaching high school, even if they’re brats sometimes! 

I’m going to sit on this for a few months, while I continue my gap year, and weigh my options once I start getting acceptances. I guess my question is for women, in both law and education: how is your work/family life balance?

1n1nbet,Transferred to a different team and I'm absolutely miserable,"Hi all! Not really sure what this is supposed to be. Maybe I just need to vent. Maybe others can offer some advice.

Anyway, I work in journalism and have been with the same company and team for nearly a decade. A little over a month ago I was suddenly transferred to a new team (I didn’t have a say in it…was just told that it could possibly be happening and then all of a sudden it was happening…they basically wanted me on this other team to help grow a specific lane that I work heavily in on my former team). It’s supposed to be a temporary transfer, but they’ve said that about other co-workers of mine who have been transferred to different teams and just never moved back.

I’m essentially doing the same thing in my new position as I did previously, but it is much more in-depth and the processes in place on this team are so much more time consuming. In order to get everything I need to get done in the day, I have to start working at least an hour before my official start time and work through the majority of my lunch. I also don’t get holidays off, while I did get that on my former team. This transfer did not come with a raise. I also just feel extremely isolated on this new team (it’s a remote position, just like my former role, but there’s next to no communication between co-workers other than a weekly meeting).

Ever since transferring teams I have been miserable in every sense of the word. I’ve cried more times than I can count. Every minute that I’m not working is spent dreading work, to the point that I’ve started dreaming about work and wake up on the verge of a panic attack. I am extremely overwhelmed, stressed, exhausted, depressed, and pretty much every other bad feeling you can experience. It’s just taking a huge mental, physical, and emotional toll, and I’m starting to see that reflect in my work, both in quality and quantity.

I genuinely enjoyed my former team and former role. I’d planned to stay there for many more years. And I just miss it all so much.

I’m just not sure what to do right now. I’ve considered reaching out to see if there’s at least a timeframe for my (hopeful) return to my former team, but I’m really not even sure what to say. Work has never made me feel like this, and I really don’t know how much longer I can do this.",Al115,2,1.0,0,1756315509,2025-08-27 17:25:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n1nbet/transferred_to_a_different_team_and_im_absolutely/,8,2025

I recently completed my Bachelor of Science degree and I am returning to receive my higher, Bachelor of Honours degree in Architecture(equal to Master’s degree in Ireland).

The thing is, the role requires me to be at work as early as 4 a.m in the morning and I am not sure whether it is a wise move to try to negotiate a higher pay.

My question is: since the national minimum pay is 13.50€ per hour and they are offering me only 16€ per hour, is it reasonable to try to negotiate higher pay? I already hold a BSc degree in Architecture, and have prior related work experience, also the role requires me to start sometimes at 4 am in the morning which in some countries is compensated double because it is counted as night work.

1n1kdfh,Lost my confidence in ever finding a career again,"

31/autism/ADHD- at my last straw with work

I’m a 31 year old man from Canada. From the age of 22 when I left university I have floundered significantly in work. I have had more jobs than I can count. From customer service to marketing to government to retail I’ve had and lost many many jobs. 

I’m 2023 my now wife brought to my attention that I have adhd. I’ve since been medicated and as a person I’m improved. I get things done around the house and I’m more regulated on top of. Things

One thing it hasn’t done is make any headway on a career. Since 2024 I’ve had 4 jobs. All of which I lost being told it wasn’t my fault, some were toxic bosses, some where just lack of business. 

I’m at a point now where I have no idea if work is even meant for me. I need to find something that can stick because my wife and I can’t take anymore stress from job loss. She does very well so we make our life work but I feel like a useless plug if I can’t contribute financially as a man. My wife is incredible and kind and just wants me to be stable. 

She’s now told me she wants me to find accessible work for those with disabilities. I’m not even sure if those jobs exist but I am looking into community programs to 
match me.

After hitting 30 I’ve really started to take stock of the failures of my life. I had all the opportunities in the world like school gor into good jobs but I blew them all because of my condition and just who I am as a person. It makes me so angry with myself that my classmates are building careers and doing great things and I can’t even keep entry level work.

It makes me incredibly sad to know i have no potential. That the best I can do is probably a low stake min wage job. I have no skills beyond talking to people and It makes me feel like i have no real value as a man. It makes me deeply despise myself

1n1k03d,Failing Business Advice,"NO BRAND NAME OR PROMO MENTIONED

Hi everyone! This is a bit of a different post but I’d love some advice so I can help my best friend out. I’m posting this on a few Haircare threads so I can gather up advice and a plan.

My best friend’s mom has been a hair dresser for over 20 years and over the last few (at least 5) she has been producing a Haircare brand. Now I’m not a hair dresser but from what I have seen the main product is an alternative to keratin/ nanoplasty but instead the base is hyaluronic and the product has no harsh regrowth but it kind of washes out over a period of 4-6 months. I’ve seen our mutual friends get it done (as models to showcase the product) and it genuinely looks great! As someone who’s mom has done keratin/ nanoplasty I feel like they took all the “negative” aspects and turned it into a positive. Like there’s minimal smoke, smell and it’s genuinely so quick lol
She also sells retail lines and those I have tried and they’re honestly amazing. The product smells amazing, feels amazing on the hair and it’s done so much for my curls. I’m very picky but I do genuinely love these.
However even tho the brand is amazing and the product is amazing they’re struggling to make sales and I can see how it’s affecting my best friend and her family as it’s a small business. I just wanted to know as Haircare consumers, what pulls YOU in to buy products? What makes you go from maybe to “I need this right now”? I know times are tough but overconsumption is at an all time high and the products are genuinely all very affordable and amazing quality. If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it as I want to be there for her and her mom and support their business but I don’t know how to and I don’t want their business to go under and fail as they’ve worked so hard to just get it going and are very deserving people.

1n1j7ic,"1 year unemployed after BA role, Trying to transition into SDE but stuck.","Hi everyone,

I really need some outside perspective because I’m stuck in this loop and it’s eating me alive.

I worked as a Business Analyst for about a year, and then decided to pursue my real interest — Software Development. I left my job thinking I’d use the time to upskill, build projects, practice DSA, and eventually transition into an SDE role.

Fast forward: It’s been a full year of unemployment now.

Here’s what I’ve been doing:

Built multiple full-stack projects (MERN, AI integrations, etc.) to show my dev skills.

Practiced DSA/Leetcode regularly.

Polished my resume, tailored it, and applied to hundreds of jobs.

Asked for referrals wherever possible.

And yet, the cycle is the same: applications → maybe a couple of interviews → rejection/ghosting. It feels endless. Recruiters still see me as “a BA, not a dev,” no matter what I do.

Now I’m at a crossroad and I honestly don’t know what’s best for me:

1. Pursue a further degree (MS in CS):

Pros: resets my profile, gives me formal CS credentials, opens more doors (maybe abroad).

Cons: expensive, time-consuming, feels like starting over.

2. Keep pushing via referrals + applying:

Pros: zero extra cost, might eventually break through.

Cons: I’ve already been stuck in this loop for a year with no success. How much longer do I keep going before it breaks me mentally?

3. Join a job-guaranteed bootcamp:

Pros: structured program, some promise placement support, might help me bridge the credibility gap.

Cons: super skeptical — are they actually worth it, or just cash-grabs that prey on desperation?

I feel like I’ve given my best shot this past year, but the longer this drags on, the harder it gets to stay motivated. Every rejection chips away at my confidence, and I don’t want to waste more time heading in the wrong direction.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?

Stick to the grind (referrals, projects, interviews)?

Go all-in on a bootcamp?

Invest in a degree for a fresh start?

Or is there some other approach I’m completely missing?

Would really appreciate any advice, personal experiences, or even brutal honesty. At this point, I just want clarity.",CodePathSeeker,1,1.0,2,1756306346,2025-08-27 14:52:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n1j7ic/1_year_unemployed_after_ba_role_trying_to/,8,2025

1n1iybq,Advice as a soon to be Computer Science undergraduate,"[Advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/?f=flair_name%3A%22Advice%22)

Just a quick rundown on myself:

I am graduating in December with a bachelor's in computer science with an emphasis in management. I also am getting a masters, but not sure yet. (Thank you to the military for free education)

At one point, I genuinely enjoyed everything programming related. However, working closely with the development team at a corporate office, I found out that this is something I don't think I would want to do forever. I started to get an interest in Data Science/Data Analytics. It just seems like something I would be interested in I think.

I work at a great company. They are more willing to give people a chance who hasn't had experience. I came in, zero experience, but the IT department was willing to at least give me a job in helpdesk almost a year and a half ago. Now, since I'm getting closer to graduation, I'm just thinking of more things I may be interested in.

We have a data analytics team, but we also have category analysts who do similar thingsbut it's more consumer based. Both sound interesting. I've talked to data analytics and unfortunately, right now, there aren't any positions open but they've said I've made a great impression with the company and they were willing to work some things out if I decide on that path. I found out about category analysts the other day, and the job seems very similar to data analytics but caught my attention a little bit more. They actually have positions open now.

I also didn't want to fully give up on programming yet but with the development team, they aren't sure if they will be needing another developer and I won't know until probably next year. I'm just a bit tired of waiting and want to expand my horizons.

1n1hvp1,Torn about current job,"Torn about current job. Currently working a government job, making 60k a year with a guaranteed minimum 3% increase per year depending on the budget. I love the job itself, it has great benefits (free health insurance and it’s a good plan too, vision and dental for $3 per check, pension & they contribute 8%, I 20 hours of PTO a month, 13 paid holidays and 2 floating holidays, flexible schedule and hybrid). 

I am struggling because about 8 months ago I was laid off from my previous role as a Director due to budget cuts and my role didn’t generate revenue. I was making nearly 6 figures and took a 30k pay cut to work at this job. The role itself is very similar and I had a week's notice about my layoff so not many options were available on the job market. So I basically took a demotion and pay cut.

For the industry I work in, I have both of the professional certifications (most people only have one or the other- I decided to get both). Those are basically the gold standard of and if you have those you should be making good money. At my last employer, they paid for me to get both and it was a condition of my promotion. I was promoted from generalist to director and got a raise once I got them. I found out that my current job doesn’t give any sort of raise or promotion due to merit. I am very overqualified working a mid level role with 2 certifications while my manager only has 1 certification and makes more than me. If I were to pursue my education any further, it wouldn’t matter because they only budget in a 3% Cost of Living increase yearly. There is no incentive for me to try to further my education or be better when I am basically stuck where I am. Since it is a government job, they don't change the title or give promotions. The position remains the same basically unless the Board votes to change it. For example, if I was hired on as a Secretary, I would remain in that position until I leave or apply for a new position within the organization despite how well I am doing. At any of my previous private companies, I was basically promoted within 6 months, given raises, title changes, etc. I think that's where I'm struggling because I don't feel like I'm getting the recognition I deserve nor paid appropriately. Any other job I have always been incentivized- ""if you hit these quarterly goals, you'll get a raise"", ""if you get this cert, you'll get a promotion"" ""if you do X, you'll get a cash bonus"" etc and here they don't do that because they favor ""internal fairness"" which means OP can't get a raise despite her qualifications because so and so has been here 5 years longer and only got 1 raise, therefore OP shouldn't be eligible for a raise first.

Also, the culture here is bad. I went from working in construction to working at a nonprofit govt job. I am younger than everyone by 15 years and have nothing in common with anyone. I am used to working in a blue collar, construction environment with mostly men. Here everyone is very liberal and politically correct. I just hide in my office and avoid the break room area when I see people in there. At other jobs, I always had friends and spent a great portion of my day socializing with people and even hanging out outside of work. I feel sort of isolated here.

The pros of my current job is that it is super laid back, I do maybe 15 hours of work a week and work from home 2-3 days a week. If I’m feeling sick but not sick enough, I just WFH so I don’t have to use my sick time. My vacation time accrues so fast and never expires + we get 15 holidays so really if I wanted, I could take 1.5 months off. They are not allowed to deny time off requests. I really like the pension plan (it’s the 2nd best pension in our state and 96% funded) and I think the benefits are really good. We also have paid leave (basically internal policy but it’s akin to paid FMLA) so if I ever needed to be gone for some extended period I wouldn’t lose income. This makes me feel like it’s actually not so bad because I have worked some pretty high stress jobs before with shitty benefits. 

Another thing to note is that my fiance and I live together but I had a house prior to meeting him, so we decided to rent that out. Therefore, I don’t really have any expenses because my rental income offsets most things and he pays for the majority of the bills. He is an electrician and makes like 2.5x times my salary so then it gets me thinking does it even really matter if I’m making 60k or 100k? He also has a pension and we planned on that as our retirement. Idk I’m just thinking out loud at this point but that does factor into my decision.

Been seeing mixed opinions on job hopping, not sure if it’s entirely relevant to sales but wanted to get the managers, VPs, hiring ppl, etc. opinion on my circumstances. I’m 25 and truly been in the adult world working for about 2.5ish years.

Job history
#1 start up out of college (feb 2023-July 2023). No idea what I’m doing as a Ad Ops Specialist entry level job, doing programmatic stuff. 
- they don’t hit half one revenue goals i get canned among others. 

#2 (August 23-Oct 24) scramble to find a job since i just signed a lease and moving out of my parents house, land account management role at a small publisher/ad agency (for those that don’t know this is the model all media outlets and publishers are going) 
- pays shit for my area ($60k) , I’m actually stepping out of my role to cold call and close sales and getting 1.5% commission while the senior reps I’m helping eat my food. 
- small time local and occasional regional clients for general advertising 

#3 Oct 24-present, got recruited to a bigger media outlet in the area
- massive pay bump (on target to hit $110k gross, $54k base), cooler clients, still mainly regional/local

The reason i ask is cause a guy in a peer sales group I’m in sent me a job app for his company that’s a startup in adtech (what I’ve been wanting to get back into this whole time since i got laid off from my first job). I’ve met some of the people at the company and they’re very cool, the pay increase is big, good benefits, etc.

I guess my question is, if you were the hiring manager (for this job or any other job) would this be a red flag? Do i get the benefit of the doubt being young and figuring it out? I’ve performed at each job, just trying to find what i really like.

I'm really ashamed to admit I'm 27F in  Australia with no future, no achievements and not much work experience. From a young age I've suffered from depression and couldn't fathom or imagine living past 25 so I ultimately never had goals or made any plans to work towards my future. I dropped out of university, live at home, have very little savings and need some advice on some guidance on what to do or how I can get back up on my feet and live a life I can be happy with. 

In the past year I've thought about where I do want to be and now have an end goal of working in tech, ideally as a Product Owner or UX Designer but to be honest I'm happy with ANYTHING as long as there's growth and I can get my foot in the door quickly to catch up. I don't really know if I should go back to university but I don't want to accumulate more debt and would rather start working soon so I don't really want to do that. 

Is this viable or realistic? What other steps should I take? I'd also love to have a deposit in the future as soon as possible but I'm really lost and overwhelmed with what I should do. I feel like life is over for me already and I am ashamed of myself but I do want to do something now so I stop dooming myself to a reality where I'm forever in a pit.

1n1geir,Got an internship at prop trading firm – worried about career risk if I don’t convert to full time. Need advice.,"Hi i am 22M I’m currently in my final year of Mechanical Engineering (B.Tech) and just got a 6-month internship offer at  prop trading firm. The setup is basically:

I’ll be trading during the internship, and to convert into a full-time role I need to make profits consistently.

Even after conversion, the career is pretty high risk – if I don’t perform, I could get fired after a few months. As my college senior told me about 80-90% people are fired within first 12 months .


My concern is that since I come from a non-finance background, if things don’t work out after 6–8 months, getting an off-campus job in core or even in finance will be very, very hard. I’m not from IIT/IIM, so I don’t have a huge safety net.

So I’d really appreciate advice on two fronts:

1. Internship conversion: What are the best ways to maximize my chances of turning this into a full-time offer? Any specific habits, strategies, or preparation I should focus on in the first 6 months?


2. Sustaining long-term (first 2–3 years): Once I (hopefully) get converted, how do I survive and grow in such a high-pressure prop trading environment? What should I avoid doing that causes most freshers to wash out?

I cancelled the request since I was made to feel weak for requesting in the first place.

1n1ff4s,Finance grad stuck in customer service role… should I pivot to CS or stay in finance?,"I graduated with a Bachelor’s in Finance in 2023. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to secure any internships during my undergrad that gave me real finance exposure. After graduating, the only role I could land was in banking—but it turned out to be more of a glorified customer service job than anything technical or analytical.

At first, I thought that just getting into a bank would open doors to transfer internally into a finance-related role. But I’ve realized my current position is extremely repetitive, doesn’t build technical skills, and doesn’t offer much of a path forward.

Now I’m stuck trying to decide between two options:

1) Master’s in Finance: could give me credibility and maybe help me land a more technical finance role. But the program is known for being very theoretical, and honestly, I’m not even sure I want to stay in finance since I’ve never truly worked in it.

2) Bachelor’s in Computer Science: I’ve always found CS and software engineering interesting, and part of me thinks it could be a better long-term fit. But it’s another full degree, the job market seems competitive, and I’m worried about investing years of study only to still struggle finding opportunities.

I feel stuck between doubling down on finance or pivoting to something new like CS. Has anyone else faced a similar decision or switched paths like this? Any advice on which option might make more sense long-term?",CBF321,1,1.0,1,1756297031,2025-08-27 12:17:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n1ff4s/finance_grad_stuck_in_customer_service_role/,8,2025
1n1fd1s,"“Passed over for promotion, now I have to train the person who got it”","I’ve been with a big tech company for over 3 years. I came in with experience and the hope of moving into a lead role. I did everything I was “supposed to”,  volunteered for projects, mentored teammates (many with less experience than me), trained others, juggled multiple projects, and became the go-to person for troubleshooting because of my wide range of knowledge. I don’t complain, I focus on solutions, and I’ve completed major projects that added real value. My performance reviews were always great. 

The space I work in is niche, complex, and full of moving parts. A new lead role opened up, and I applied along with other team members. I was told I did excellent in interviews and that it felt like a natural next step. But the promotion went to a coworker with a much lower skillset, little experience in my area, and who I’ve even had to mentor (sometimes redoing her mistakes). To make it worse, some of “her” listed accomplishments in the announcement were actually mine, or things I trained her on. She also has a very close relationship with the hiring manager. And now, I’m expected to train her in this new role.

I’m honestly at my wits’ end. My manager’s response was basically, “this will give you more visibility as you will get to work on more projects"" which just means more work with no pay increase. Meanwhile, I’ll be lucky to see a 3% raise.

I’ve been freelancing part-time on the side and am considering going full-time, but the instability scares me, as does the current market. I’m disappointed, angry, and questioning how to deal with this kind of corporate backstabbing.

How do you push through this kind of environment? Is it event worth staying? Should I cut my losses and look elsewhere, or hold steady while I build out freelancing?

It’s relatively new compared to some of the established ones, but the portfolio strategy and allocation made me curious.

Here are a few things I found while analyzing it:

* How it balances **large, mid, and small cap exposure**
* The **top sectors & companies** it’s betting on
* Expense ratio vs. other Flexi Cap funds
* Risk profile and whether it’s suitable for long-term SIPs
* Performance so far (though limited, since it’s new)

👉 I put together a **detailed breakdown video** where I go through the numbers, charts, and comparisons step by step. Dropping the link in the comments if anyone wants to check it out.

* Do you think Prag Parikh Flexi Cap can compete with the more popular funds?

I’m in my mid-20s, currently in a payroll job. I’ve finished AAT Level 2 via apprenticeship and just started AAT Level 3 (self-study).

Long-term, I want to move abroad (ideally Japan), but I know I’ll need real bookkeeping/accounting experience alongside the qualifications. The issue is: every role I see is either full-time or asks for 2–3 years’ experience already.

I’d love to reduce my current role to 3 days a week and do bookkeeping 2 days a week, but that seems unrealistic. Should I:
	•	
Keep focusing on qualifications for now and not stress about experience yet, or

Take the leap into an entry-level full-time accounting role (though I really value remote work, which is tough to find

Do not need to struggle with finding a job

Do not have to waste more money ""investing"" in oneself by going for another qualificaion to get a job

Do not need to endure low salary due to low degree classification

Do not need to suffer the pain of living everyday knowing one did not achieve his best potential (or that his best potential was actually really low)


Cons
Not being able to live the remaining years of life

If I move into management, my scheduling becomes dictated by work. I would have to work odd hours and a rotation, with overtime often being necessary. Retirement and health stay the same. I would get an 8% raise. The company is pretty easy going, losing union membership doesn’t really matter in this scenario. 

I figure between the raise and overtime, I’d make 20% more, 100k to probably 120k. But, I’d also lose a lot of freedom due to scheduling changes. I pretty much get whatever vacation days I want approved as is, this would change with a promotion. Flipping between nights and days would also suck, as well as having to manage people. 

The money sounds nice, but if I ever have a family of my own, I feel like it would be rough. I would be home everyday, but sometimes my free time would be evenings, other times mornings/afternoons.

1n1b5g6,Should I prioritize lifestyle (32h remote) or a bigger career name?,"Hi all,

I’m in my 20’s, finishing my Master’s in Computer Science, and I already have about 3 years of experience in tech (low-code, automation, some AI/ML background).

I currently have three job options:
	
1.	Option A: Small internal digitalization team. Very flexible: 100% remote, 32h/week possible, sabbatical programs, even working abroad part of the year. Manager seems super relaxed, focus is just on delivering results. Downside: small team, not a “big name,” and I worry the work might get repetitive after 1–2 years.

2.	Option B: Large international corporation. Big name for the CV, solid benefits, career stability. But the role seems more junior/process-focused (less technical than what I already do), and it’s a classic 40h/week corporate setup. Flexibility like 32h or sabbaticals is unclear. I’m worried about getting stuck in the grind.

3.	Option C: Tech consulting. Much more technical variety (cloud, APIs, AI, automation). Best salary package (even with 32h/week, it’s still solid). But it comes with client-facing stress, project pressure, and possibly less lifestyle freedom.

Here’s the thing: I’ve realized I don’t want the standard 40h corporate life. I’d much rather work ~32h, ideally remote, with time for hobbies, the option to live partly abroad, and space for sabbaticals. My long-term dream is to buy a place in Southern Europe and have the freedom to enjoy life.

But I also sometimes pressure myself by looking at LinkedIn, seeing people my age at “big names,” and feeling like I should go that route too. I don’t want to burn out just for prestige.

I’m writing this because I’m nearly 25 (M) and I have no idea what to do with my life.

I’m Swiss and I graduated in Italy with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Business management. I regret it so much because the university wasn’t target (Cattolica of Milan) and my gpa was low (gpa 3.0). It also took me 6 months more to finish it.

1n19fol,Confused about MCA (Online vs Regular) + GATE or MBA after BSc PCM. Need advice.,"
Hi everyone,
I really need some guidance.

I did my BSc PCM (3 years) and then had a 1-year drop, so basically 4 years are already gone. Now I want to move into the tech field, but I’m very confused about the path.

Right now I’m thinking:

1. Online MCA + Skills + GATE CSE prep

Online MCA just to stay eligible for MTech.

Parallelly I can focus on coding, projects, internships, and GATE.

If I crack GATE → MTech from IIT/NIT.

If I don’t crack GATE → I’ll still have MCA + skills for jobs.

But I’m worried: will an online MCA affect my career badly if GATE doesn’t work out?



2. Regular MCA from a private college

Safer degree (regular).

But attendance + academics may reduce my time for GATE prep and skill building.

Also placements are not that strong.



3. Drop 1 year → NIMCET → NIT MCA

Best option if I get in.

But it will again take 4 years (1 year prep + 3 years MCA).

Risky if I don’t crack it.



4. CAT → MBA

CAT seems easier to crack than GATE, but getting into top IIMs depends on interview/admissions.

Main goal is to earn well quickly, but I’m not sure if MBA is the right move.




My main doubts:

Is Online MCA + Skills + GATE a good option or will it backfire if I don’t clear GATE?

Should I go for a Regular MCA just for safety?

Am I overthinking the “lost years” and should just focus on skills/jobs instead?

Anyone here who took a similar path (BSc → MCA/MTech or MBA)?


Any advice would mean a lot 🙏.",Purple_life1602,1,1.0,1,1756275543,2025-08-27 06:19:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n19fol/confused_about_mca_online_vs_regular_gate_or_mba/,8,2025
1n194uv,Confused between Consulting Career vs. Trading + Entrepreneurship (Need Advice),"Hi everyone,  
I’m a 2024 graduate currently working as a Paid Media Marketer. While I’ve gained good exposure in digital marketing, I’ve realized it doesn’t align with my long-term goals.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

* **Path 1: Management Consulting** I want to transition into Business Analyst roles at consulting firms (even boutique ones). The appeal for me is exposure to core business problems, high learning curve, and long-term exit options. But my fear is the notorious work-life balance—if consulting eats up all my time, I won’t be able to pursue anything outside of work.
* **Path 2: Trading & Investments** I’m also deeply interested in trading—not for quick wins, but with a patient horizon of 3–5 years. The plan is to grow my capital through trading and funnel it into safer investments (SIPs, mutual funds, etc.). Eventually, I’d like to bootstrap my own **e-commerce brand** (I’ve done it before, with \~half a million in sales, and I have friends in the industry, so I understand the ecosystem well).

My dilemma is:  
If I go into consulting, I might gain credibility and great experience, but I’ll risk having zero time to focus on trading/investing. If I choose trading + entrepreneurship, I’m betting on a path that is less structured but possibly more aligned with financial independence and my entrepreneurial goals.

Right now, I feel stuck in overthinking mode. I want to commit to a path and give it years until I see results - but I need clarity on what makes more sense long-term.

1n18q0x,First Job and already overwhelmed and burnt out,"Prefacing this with English is not my first language so I apologize if there are any grammatical errors.

I (F24) landed my first ever job after graduating college. I am an architectural apprentice for a firm that specializes in hospitality and some high-end and large residential projects. When I was hired, I was chosen specifically as I have knowledge on how to operate a different software than the one they are using. They were planning to start a new project using the new software, and for that, they have hired 2 of us. However, the coworker that was supposed to be my partner for the project (who has more experience) left 2 weeks after I started due to personal reasons. This left me basically managing the entire project, using the software no one else knew how to use, by myself- doing essentially the job of 2 people. Working on this project gives me so much anxiety as I am basically supposed to be entry-level, yet I'm making an entire structure by myself. It's also a fast paced environment- they give tasks in one go, and always have a lot of revisions (which is to be expected in the industry). All of these just puts a massive weight on my shoulders, and it scares me that if this is what I feel on my first job, then it would only get worse in the future. I dread going to work everyday, feeling my heart beat faster when going to work and still overthinking about it going home. I even had a panic/ anxiety attack in the bathroom at work a few days ago.

1n18g0l,"Burned out, overwhelmed, and feeling judged at work","25F looking for some advice. I work full-time while doing a part-time Master’s, and I’m almost a year into my job. It started off okay, but the last few months I’ve been struggling — I’ve lost motivation, started procrastinating, and have let some responsibilities slip.
One big issue was dropping communication with an external partner I’m supposed to manage. I was recently called out for it, I acknowledge that there could be some improvement in an email to a lot of them so they’d know I was trying but since then, things at work feel tense. The atmosphere shifted — my supervisor makes sarcastic comments (e.g. asking if I’ve picked up hobbies during work time), and I get confused looks or subtle digs when I speak in meetings.
I feel totally unsupported and disliked. My supervisor only answers direct questions without offering real guidance — but I often don’t even know the right questions to ask. It’s my first time in this kind of role, and it requires a lot of external engagement, which doesn’t suit me as an introvert.
I’m also one of only two women on my team, relatively young compared to my colleagues and the only Black person I interact with in or outside my organization. 

I came in determined to do well knowing I'd be in a white male-dominated space, and I’d have to earn that respect but I feel like I’ve slipped up and confirmed negative assumptions. It’s been taking a real toll on my mental health — I feel sick even logging on some days.
I’m torn between quitting (and dealing with the stress of job hunting while studying), or trying to stick it out another year until I graduate. I’m not sure what’s best long-term, and I just feel exhausted, embarrassed, and stuck.

Some of the areas I’m currently considering are:

* **Cybersecurity** (since my background is in networking, it seems like a natural progression)
* **IT Management or an MBA with a tech focus** (if I want to move into leadership/management roles)

**An important factor for me is transferability**: I want a degree that will still be recognized and valuable **if I move abroad—places like Dubai, other parts of the Middle East, or Africa.**

1n16ko5,"Seeking advice - this will be a long post, apologies in advance","I started a new job about five months ago at this point. It's with the same company, so I haven't changed employers. The past three months I've been on FMLA leave due to attending an IOP/PHP program. I am due to return to work on September 15th. 

I am having some trouble and wanting to know others' opinions. 

My current job pays $120k, but the commute is 1.5 hour one way twice a week. This job caused me so much stress that I had to go on FMLA due to my OCD symptoms increasing to the point where I can't work. I can't take more time off work without risking my job and I haven't started receiving my disability payments yet because it's taking them forever to process. 

I've had a lot of job hopping. Basically, I've been at this job for about 3.5 years. Out of college, I was at a job for 10 months, at a job for 2.5 years, then 2.25 years (I was planning to be at this job long-term). I got super sick during COVID and had to return home. I pretty much took any job I could and only worked at that job for 8 months due to improper work/life balance. Then, I've had my current position.   
  
I moved in with my fiancee who lives about 1 hour away. I've recently started applying for remote positions. I've had several interviews, but they pay way less. Most of them average between $65-95k. 

My fiancee and I are planning to marry next spring. Because of his job, we have the opportunity to go to the UK. So, I could get a remote job, then possibly need to quit to go to the UK in a year. However, nothing is guaranteed. It's all dependent on funding. 

My concern is, I don't want to look like I'm job hopping too much, but I also want to get my CPA. If I need to commute 3 hours two times a week and have the added stress of the position, I don't think I would be able to handle studying for the CPA on top of the stress from my job and other life responsibilities. The UK doesn't offer testing. Essentially, I'd have to put my life on pause for two years. Plus, if I were to get my CPA, it would be easier to get a job in the UK while my husband is there. Because of the visa I would receive, I could work for any UK company while he's on exchange.

So my dilemma is, I don't want to look like I'm job hopping too much, but I also want to find time to due my CPA. The job I have now also stressed me out so much I essentially relapsed having to go on FMLA. I'm feeling a bit better but not 100%. I have had a handful of interviews and about half of them have mentioned the number of jobs I've had in the 10 years I've been out of college. 

Would it be better to leave the shorter jobs off my resume all together or show the job hopping? I was thinking it could look like I got fired.

All of these are recent examples and are not one-time incidents:

1. We talk about something for 30 mins earlier in the day. Then after 3 hours, he calls me and ask me the same thing, so I have to brief him again. 

2. No clue about any of his projects. I try to keep him regularly updated but realized that I would update him and he would forget the next day and ask me about the same thing. 

3. Ask me to create a file. I create a file, he said he doesn't understand it. I recreate to exactly how he wants it with the formatting and everything. The next month when I send him the file, he tells me he doesn't understand the file. Cue, the same thing every month

created  
4. He never remembers any links. He would constantly ask me for items and I would send him links to where he would be able to find it, then he would be frustrated that he has to search for it rather than me providing him with something he wanted

5. I walked him through how to fill out a form. Asked him to fill it out again next month. He does not remember. Cannot find the link and got frustrated at me for assuming he remembers 

6. Do not remember any of his own due dates, then calls me the day off that he needs X TODAY because the higher-ups noticed his deliverables are late. 

The issue? I am behind on my actual job duties because of these requests. 

 I brought this up with my actual manager and was told ""its not too much work to do them"".

Not to mention tomorrow I am expected to stay late to double check all the managers numbers for him because he isn't too sure where to pull the numbers from....

I loathe job hunting, resumes, cover letters, etc, and I've been out of this game for a while, so I need to re-learn the ropes. I know it's a brutal scene. Plenty of people/articles say that LinkedIn is the best place to find work. I have a profile, but it's fairly dormant. LinkedIn kind of feels like the worst of Facebook to me. Trying to cleanse my feed by following more interesting industries & companies, unfollow toxicity, etc. I don't like the feel that everyone needs to be a LI influencer or content creator to get hired. If the goal is a marketing or advertising position, fine, but that's not me. Does anyone else get that vibe when scrolling LinkedIn?

I've never known what I want to do, I just know that I need a remote job, and it seems logical that it would need to be similar to what I'm doing now. My skills are very transferable, so finding a company that offers upskilling to branch into something else would be a dream, but I need to be pragmatic. I've read that your LI job title should list the job you *want*, not the job you have. A: I don't know, B: that's lying, and C: I don't yet have experience in the desired transition industry. I have yet to find clearly defined, industry-specific certification that is widely accepted. Are people just lying on resumes and LinkedIn? Do they actually have all these skills? What happens when they fake it, then can't perform the job they were hired for? Can we trust anything anymore? Genuinely confused here. Some  say that meeting ~80% of job requirements is sufficient, as long as you're willing to learn the rest. Has anyone found that to be true?

Most people can't afford to go back to school, and that's a very expensive chance to take without a clear goal.

1n14vs8,Coping with feeling demoralized and overstimulated at work?,"I am about 2 years into my corporate job (first corporate job out of college, as you can imagine a lot of bottom of the ladder stuff). I get really discouraged by some particular coworkers when they give feedback because they make me feel small and stupid, though I don’t think that’s their intention. I feel like I’m making stuff less for my clients and more trying to please these people above me with their random preferences while juggling everything.

I feel like more and more stuff is being added to my plate, and I can’t take time to sit and think and when I do, it just means I have so much shit to do. And I get the feeling my coworkers don’t have time either so sometimes I’m apprehensive of poking an already stressed bear.

I don’t know if I’m particularly fast at my job either, granted I have a lot of writing to do or research so it can be tedious. But I think what takes me longest is trying to remember my particular coworker’s preferences and random nuances of things and feedback of random stuff I can’t all smash together in my head. And sometimes it feels so… pointless or wasteful. 

I got a harsh email from one of the coworkers above me who works on a few teams with me saying that some list I did was incomplete, but she didn’t say what was missing specifically so I could go find it, she said I shouldn’t have asked an intern to assist with the research (I wasn’t under the impression this wasn’t allowed as for other accounts they are there) and that I gave it to her later than expected (which fair, I just felt so out of my depth and busy I guess that I just tried to do things that I felt like I could do). I feel like I don’t know what exactly I’m doing for this client but I feel too stupid to even go and ask now. I just got randomly added to this client. I can tell she’s stressed out too but I just feel like her feedback was less instructive and more like showing her own anger. I’ve only done this task like 2 times. She also tagged my manager in the email… so I just look like an idiot. 

How do you… not internalize this all?

1n14i35,What should I study or build next to become a stronger programmer?,"Hi everyone,

I have been learning full-stack development for about a 2 years almost now and I m looking for guidance on what to focus on next.

Here’s my background so far:

Comfortable with frontend (React/Next.js, Tailwind).

Built my own APIs with Node/Express and Nest.js, used services like Supabase, and done database design for mid-sized apps familiar with crud operations and rest...

Tried real-time features (Socket.IO) once or twice, not very experienced but doable.

Worked on several projects, followed good folder structures and architecture practices, and built a portfolio.


Now, I’m not sure what direction to take to level up: (i know my only focus was the wev and to be honest i hate building mobile  apps)

Should I keep building more apps in my current stack, or try a new backend language (Django, Go, Spring Boot  Java)?

Are there any specific projects that would really help me grow as a programmer? (Please don’t just say “build something that solves your problems” — I’d like concrete examples).

Any courses that are worth taking at this stage?

I also considered studying CCNA or Cloud certs, but my main goal is to become a better programmer, not just chase certificates.


If you have been in this stage before, I'd really appreciate your guidance on what to study, what to build, or what path to follow next.

1n13u9n,Did I say too much,"Recently interviewed for a promotion. Got it, accepted it verbally today. My manager said “you should probably tell [supervisors name]"". To which I responded ""yes I was trying to keep this under wraps because she is close with [very senior level staff member] who has expressed negative opinions about the institution funding these types of positions.""

Is this super bad??? I was truly just trying to be honest, and didn't want to seem like a bitch for not telling my supervisor I was applying for a promotion. He sort of responded with something to the effect of : no worries you don't have to explain. But now l'm over thinking if I came across as catty and dramatic. My supervisor is also a micro manager who needs me to tell her everything, so I was feeling guilty for not telling her I applied for the promotion.

1n13mk7,Horrible interview at startup,"I have been working as a Golang developer for 6 years, the last 4 years in the same company, where I am currently a team lead. About a year ago, my colleague and friend moved to a startup — just by chance.

Last week, I was asked if I wanted to join that same startup. For me, it seemed like the perfect opportunity for growth as a programmer — more interesting, intense, and challenging work.

I was scheduled for an interview with the CTO. My friend and an HR (with whom I had worked before) both recommended me. During the interview we discussed my experience, and I felt it went really well — the CTO seemed to like me. However, a couple of hours later, I was invited to a second interview with a “multi-tool” guy to assess my DevOps skills. The CTO mentioned that they only hire through recommendations.

The next day, at that second interview, I was asked about skills I never claimed to have. I tried to explain that I had only done separate tasks and didn’t have deep knowledge or experience with their exact technologies, but he didn’t listen and ended the interview early. It was Saturday after a very tough week, so I hadn’t had time to prepare properly.

My friend later told me that the second interview went so badly that the CTO now thinks I lied on my resume.

A couple of days later, HR told me they can’t make me an offer and that they want someone with stronger DevOps skills. I asked HR to speak with the CTO and suggested giving me a month to prove myself on the job, but I haven’t received a positive response.

I’m quite frustrated with the situation. From my perspective, I was a perfect fit, but the second interview completely changed their opinion.

Should I try to convince the CTO through HR to give me another chance, or should I just forget about this startup? And finally — am I overthinking this situation?",dekatran,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1756257130,2025-08-27 01:12:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n13mk7/horrible_interview_at_startup/,8,2025

1n13bo8,Offer rescinded after CIBC background check,"I really need some advice.

I had a great offer that was just rescinded because I failed part of CIBC’s background check. I passed Sterling’s no problem, but CIBC’s own background check was hung up on the Code M on my Record of Employment. 

During my interviews, when asked why I left my previous company, I said I had a serious health issue, couldn’t work anymore and had to leave. I also said the health issue was resolved and wouldn’t recur. I didn’t mention being fired for poor performance due to that health issue (benign brain tumour in a bad spot) because I didn’t think it was relevant. I figured if they needed further info, they’d contact me during the background check stage. They seemed to have the impression that I quit, even though I never said that.

Extra context: At my old job, I knew my performance was tanking but also knew I wasn’t capable of finding a new job, so I wanted to wait until I was fired and take the severance. I also didn’t know what was wrong with me at the time, and wasn’t diagnosed until several months later.

How do I approach this in a way that won’t deter recruiters but also won’t lead to failed background checks? I worked so hard to get this offer (been searching for a year), so to have it fall through in this way is deeply disappointing.

1n11klw,At a crossroads,"I've been out of college for 7 years working in the public health field. I've worked my way up to a management position, and I have believed in the mission of all of the positions I've held, but I've gotten burnt out at every job I had. I chalked the first 2 up to being entry level and grinding to get ahead in my career. But most recently, I started a gov job (my dream job) in September 2024.... only to be affected by the RIF 5 months in and lose my job. I got a new job 5 months ago, and I thought it was a perfect fit, but I quickly became miserable. I came to the realization that I may not want to work in the chaos of public health anymore. I work most weekends, the team I supervise is such a headache, and I find myself really unmotivated to do the work I am assigned (writing budgets, grants, policy, community outreach etc). 

I've always wanted to get into something more structured, like healthcare billing, credentialing, or insurance processing, but have never been able to get any role that was not entry level. I just got a job offer for utilization management support role. It is entry level and it would be a pay cut of more than half what I make right now. But it would be WFH and I believe it would offer job growth. 

I'm doing good not great financially, just got married, and we're thinking of starting a family. I'm looking for work life balance and could make it work money-wise. My partner does well. I want to be able to turn off my work brain at the end of the day. 

Am I crazy to leave a management position for an entry level, even if there is long-term job growth? ",Jolly_Hand3515,1,1.0,0,1756251481,2025-08-26 23:38:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n11klw/at_a_crossroads/,8,2025
1n11ecm,I feel dirty. Replaced by someone internal who has been wanting to relocate.,"Will try to be as brief as possible. I work for a big food company and I have been with them for almost two years. 

I was fired at the end of July, I felt something was off when CEO sent email to all employees on Wednesday of that week informing not to expect 100% bonus this year as company is not doing as good as we hoped to be. 

Thursday - HR sent meeting invitation 4PM including me and my boss, I knew something was up right away and was let go first thing on Friday morning. 

My reason for being let go was 'poor performance', which was kind of funny because... 

1) I was praised for my performance until May - I gave two presentations during a town hall meeting in March and April talking about my success and sharing the best practices. 

2) Lost sales in certain sales channel - but my boss has been saying from very beginning do not worry about it because it is not my fault as I was never trained properly ( my ex- boss never really trained me on this area and he knew - ex boss was forced to move into different position or being let go.) 

3) He even told me in May please not to leave the company and even asked my teammate if I am doing okay because I was blaming myself for the sales loss and he didn't want me to leave. 

It was also weird because they mentioned during meeting that they gave me both verbal and written warning in May, but I never received any warning or even proper PIP. All we had was business review on which area to improve and it was all about constructive criticism. 

I requested written complaint regarding my performance and employee handbook during my HR meeting, they never followed up with those even though I requested a couple times after I was let go. 

Then, I found out I was replaced by another employee in the other state who has been wanting to relocate to where I live. She also won the biggest award last year and before my boss's boss got promoted, she worked directly under him for years.  Then I remembered it was kind of odd when she reached out to me early July asking if there would be any work events that she could help in August because she would like to also travel here to visit family. 

My unemployment benefit still has not been approved yet and right now market I am in is not very good.. I feel done very wrong, so wanted to ask if this is a common practice.  I know it was fire at will state, but just doesn't feel like I was let go in the right way which bothers me a lot. 

New boss also always talked about how he wants to be a CEO in 10 years and has talked about to other people (not me) how he fired this many people before in the previous role with same company.  I feel he wants to build his own team because he also promoted someone who worked under him at his previous role to relocate to work under him.

Everything else is the same between the 2. I want to make sure im taking everything into proper consideration here what do you all think? 

40hrs * 52weeks= 2080

$60/hr
 Total Annual Income: 2,080 hours \times $60/hour = $124,800

$117,600 for 1,960 hours of work, plus the $7,200 of time off. 

$65/hr
2080 hours - 48 hours (8hours * 6days) = 2032 hours
2032* $65= $132,080

I’ve had a very large gap in work due to health issues (five years) which has now been resolved. I have a strict set of values that I don’t like compromising.

I’ve addressed the gap in work and owned it.

Where I currently live, the job market is very bad. Entry level roles have 500+ applicants and I haven’t secured any interviews in over 1000 jobs applications.

As a result I filled the gap with a lie. It is absolutely killing me. I’ve secured my first interview for a company that is frankly unethical and predatory in its services.

I also have a learning disability. I’ve tried higher learning twice and failed badly. I tried a trade but had a lot trouble understanding building plans and as a result got let go.

I’m a Data Engineer at a big Tech company, and on the side I built a conversational AI for small businesses that’s already generating sales. People tell me it’s impressive and that I clearly think like an engineer/founder.

But here’s my insecurity: I don’t really code. I know SQL/DAX/Python (pandas)/JSON I can tweak scripts, and I use Stack Overflow or OpenAI to bridge the gaps. My strength is solving problems, designing systems, and actually making them work.

And yet… I can’t shake the thought that for another job, if they put me in front of a coding test, I’ll look “less,” no matter how strong my portfolio is.

So my question is: Does a Data/AI engineer truly need to be a strong programmer? Or is proving you can deliver working systems and results what actually matters?

1n0ybqh,"It’s been a week until I was let go, and I am wrecking my brain, trying to figure out why.","I have been with this company for 8 months and I really enjoyed doing the work. I was a good employee that was praised for his hard work and dedication.

Two months ago, we had someone rejoin our company for a different team. I remember my boss was saying that he was a funny guy. For some reason that really bothered me. I always tried to fit in and I thought, maybe I should try to be funny as well.

We had a company retreat and three things that happened that really caught not only my boss’s attention, but also others in the company. We are a small company, about 60 people.
- I had to leave twice during group activities, because I had to use the toilet. Now it was more than just number 2 and I felt like I had to answer myself when I was asked where I went. I ended up being very detailed.
- Secondly, I suck at names. I always did. I kept on mixing up or forgetting names of people. But I have the habit of laughing when I get nervous, so I ended up laughing when I got the names mixed up. Some of them were senior managers.
- Thirdly, in order to be funny, when I was in a room with some managers and directors, I got a call from my mom. Instead of just walking out, I told everyone to sush. I definitely took this too far and I didn’t realize it after wards.

Anyways, even after all this, my boss was supportive. But I kind of felt like people started paying too much attention towards me. My boss told me he can help me pay for some courses, so I can do better. The course came up when we were talking about possible promotion. I was the one who brought it up. That was right after the retreat 2 months ago. He told me I was not ready for it and also higher up in the company would turn their heads immediately if they see me get promoted. So I decided to keep my head down.

Fast forward a month later. I made a huge mistake at work, for which I was written up. I was not only written up, I started getting heavily micromanaged. I was asked to provide what I worked on, or if I am coming in 5 or 10 minutes late or taking a late lunch, I should let my boss know. This made me feel pressured, and I end up making more smaller mistakes. Anyways, two weeks ago, I was told to come in to the office because there will be shareholders in office the following week. I suspected something, but I came in anyways. When I came in, I was ushered in to the boardroom an was let go without cause.

So I am sitting here, wrecking my brain. I am wondering was it what I did during the retreat or the big mistake I made or the small mistakes I made that let to my dismissal? Also, should I go back ask for my job back and try to tell them that I cared a lot and would definitely appreciate a second chance. Can someone please shed some light because I really loved what I was doing.

1n0xplv,About to graduate but still lost on career direction and stuck in a poor area.,"I’m 25 and have been in and out of college for the past six years trying to finish my associate’s degree in General Studies. I’ve faced a lot of setbacks, such as the pandemic, losing my financial aid, and missing registration deadlines due to moving out of state, so I hope there’s some understanding as to why it’s taken me so long to complete this.

I live in a dumpy little town that wouldn’t exist if not for the military base nearby. The closest university is about two hours away. My only option was to attend a trade school, and I’ll finally be graduating after this semester. My only problem is that I’m still not sure what to pursue afterwards. I do very well in Humanities classes, but I’m aware of the limited career prospects in this field and would like some other suggestions.

I’m not strong in STEM whatsoever, but Engineering is often recommended to me by people on Reddit, my parents, and others, and while I think I could probably do it, it would be extremely difficult. Anything I’m naturally good at, or even somewhat interested in, doesn’t seem to pay very well, and it’s frustrating.

I live with my parents and we’ve been moving around the US non-stop for the past eight years. We’ve recently hit a dead-end with this new area and it looks like we aren’t going anywhere for some time. There’s just no opportunities for almost anything and I desperately want to leave.

1n0xklh,Stay in tech or go back to school for Physical Therapy?,"I originally wennt to college for kinesiology. I couldn't find any jobs with that degree, so I changed careers to tech. I got certifications in Comptia, Azure, CCNA, and Google. I work in cloud computing now and have been in tech for 5 years.

My current job pays 100k and is remote, but I have a manager that set a bunch of extra goals like doing presentations, extra provisioning tickets, watching 80 hours of linkedin learning courses, and getting a certification in addition to the 3 to 8 migration projects we may do at one time throughout the year. 

At times, I think of going back to PT school. However, I'd most likely have to redo all of my prereqs since I graduated in 2016. What dissuaded me from PT is the debt to salary ratio doesn't make sense. I would have to go 3 years of not working and not making any money to go to school full time as well. The degree would be around 80 to 100k of debt, along with 3 years of not working. All for a 90 to maybe 110k salary max. 

Would I be better off staying in tech even if I had to take a pay cut for a 60 to 80k job instead of taking on all the debt and time of not working to go to PT school?

1n0xi2x,Lost on what next steps to take with my life after quitting job early this year due to life events.,"I’m 27, and honestly feeling really behind in life. I have a BA in Public Health, and I was lucky enough to land an internship and then a year-long role as a Technical Support Engineer. It took me forever to get that job because I’ve struggled with depression and mental health issues most of my life.

The work ended up overwhelming me since it was very customer-facing — I started having panic attacks and eventually quit earlier this year, also due to some difficult life events that happened around the same time. Since then, it’s been hard to climb out of that depression phase, but I’ve at least started doing things like working out every day.

Right now, I live with my parents and feel like a loser. I’m also about 70% done with an online bachelor’s in Software Engineering. But I feel completely lost. I’m getting rejected from almost every job I apply to, the market feels so oversaturated, and I’m unsure what direction to even focus on.

Do I double down on finishing software engineering and keep trying for tech? Do I accept that I might need to work retail/low-wage jobs for a while? I feel so alone, and I’m also trying to build a social life since I’ve had almost no friends.

Has anyone been through something similar? How did you figure out your path forward when it felt like every door was closed?

1n0xemb,How transparent should I be with my recruiter? (Perspective from recruiter's also appreciated!),"Hello everyone, 

I’m in a bit of a tricky spot and could use some advice.

I just got an offer from one of the Big 5 tech companies for a 9-month contract role through a recruitment agency. I need to let them know by Thursday morning if I’m accepting. The start date would not be immediate and I'd likely start the actual work in about two weeks.

Here’s the complication: I’m also in the middle of interviewing for another role, which is permanent and honestly my preferred option. The pay is slightly better, and I like the role more. Realistically I know the job market is tough and odds are low I’ll get that offer, but if I did get it, I would probably take it over the contract. Unfortunately, that interview process is likely to take an additional two-ish weeks.

So here's my question...when I talk to the recruiter on Thursday, should I be upfront and say something like, “I’m ready to move forward with the contract, but just to be transparent, I’m also still in process for one other permanent role”? They’ve been great to work with, and I’d like to be honest. But I also don’t want to shoot myself in the foot. Would accepting a role and then backing out cause me to be blacklisted by a Big 5?

Has anyone navigated something similar? Is light transparency the way to go, or should I just accept and keep my cards closer to the chest until I know for sure?

I am a backend developer in a product based company located in Bengaluru(India) with 2 years of experience. Now that I feel confident and think I can get a better paying job for my skills , I tried applying for jobs but got rejected just because I have a core mechanical degree . My resume doesn't get through ATS just because of my specialisation in degree. So now, i decided to get masters degree with work integrated system(BITS WILP) . Is masters degree worth in my situation or should I just make fake CV i.e applying as BE in Computer science and then tell the HR that I am actually a mechanical engineer after I clear interview rounds? I know this a very niche topic and any help is appreciated.

It's to the point I'm afraid to ask manager or co-workers questions in case they think I am incompetent. Which I am not. 

I have a very heavy caseload and attention to detail is important. I get that but there was very little training, and most of it was trial and error.  The two other caseworkers hired after me have already left for other jobs.

1n0uisl,Struggling with bias from my CEO – how do I handle this?,"I’m one of the C-level leaders at a small nonprofit organization. I’ve been losing motivation lately because of the way my boss shows favoritism.

There’s one staff member who gets constant recognition every achievement is publicly praised, every post reacted to, while the rest of us (including entire departments) get little to no acknowledgment. Sometimes, other teams even get blamed publicly for mistakes while that one person is continuously uplifted.

For example, last month I had to travel alone to another country for work. I took the last train at 11 PM, arrived in a strange town at midnight with no taxis around, and had to walk to my hotel in the dark, exhausted. When I updated my boss, there was no acknowledgment. The same day, another staff member traveled for personal reasons, posted a photo, and immediately got a reaction. It made me feel invisible.

It doesn’t stop there. My boss often takes advice mainly from one younger colleague (same level as me), who tends to report misleading information. Since we work remotely, communication is everything but it feels like my boss trusts this colleague’s perspective almost exclusively. HR knows but stays silent.

What stings is that my boss seems to base trust and connection on personal affinity rather than contribution. It feels like who you are matters more than what you actually deliver. I’ve had situations where I was labeled “shy” before we even met in person, despite a strong track record in managing partnerships and representing organizations.

I try to shield my team from these dynamics because they’re talented and hardworking, but I feel like I’m fighting a battle that might not be worth it.

My question is: **when your boss consistently shows favoritism and bias, and HR isn’t stepping in, is it better to keep pushing forward or to step back and consider moving on?**",Hot_Revolution2008,3,1.0,4,1756234620,2025-08-26 18:57:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n0uisl/struggling_with_bias_from_my_ceo_how_do_i_handle/,8,2025

1n0t7ts,New offer vs asking for a counter-offer,"I got an offer with 8% more than my current role. I am not sure what to do, so I would like to seek some advice. Here are some details

Current company  
\- I like my team and the direct manager  
\- Booming industry, with big potential as well as big risks  
\- Working here from the very beginning, one of the oldest members of the team.  
\- Constant new roadmaps, lack of transparency, a bit chaotic and too bureaucratic, hard to get things done, too many generals in the army  
\-Work sometimes can get exciting and a lot of opportunities if I push hard, which I am not doing currently

New company  
\- The team and the people look great. The potential manager also left a very good impression  
\- Not very exciting, but a stable industry.  
\- Work seems lame, not a dream niche to work with.   
\- Fresh environment, new people, and it will possibly push me to do some better work for some time in the beginning. 

So the new offer is around 8% more than what I get at my current place. I would love a 12% but this package seems like the top of the new offer. 

I will already push back with the new offer to reach that 12% but should I also go back to my current company and ask for 12% raise by presenting the offer? If I had the 12% I would prefer to stay at my current place.

I went to my boss yesterday ready to put in my two weeks and he completely came back on me and told me they could move me into sales and counter offer because they definitely don’t want to see me go to a competitor. I know a lot of people say counter offers aren’t the best but would it be stupid to pass up on the opportunity to do sales at the better company? I am just so stressed and never thought they would have offered me that and would allow me to go from engineering to sales with less than 5 years of engineering experience. And I also wouldn’t have to go through a training program it would be a more mentor and learn which honestly might be better since I do know how to do the engineering side of the sales processes.

1n0p38a,Is my employer taking advantage of me?,"I’ve been with a small business & economic consulting firm (owned by “Owner X”) for over 10 years. I started with a bachelor’s in English Education—totally unqualified at first—but I learned the industry inside out. Now I’m VP, and many of our repeat clients prefer working with me directly.

For the last 5+ years, I’ve handled *everything*: proposal writing, project planning, stakeholder engagement, research, grant writing, even the website redesign. I’ve personally secured **$1.3 million in grants** for the company during this time. Owner X openly tells clients that I run 90% of the company’s operations while he does very little. Seriously. He does nothing.

Here’s the situation:

* I’ve *always* been hourly.
* He refuses to give me a salary or part ownership.
* If there’s no project work (we rely on grants), I make $0.
* He still expects me to edit proposals for his other companies or pitch new gigs—but I only get my hourly rate, no profit share.

His “offer” for the future: when he’s about 62 (he’s late 50s now), I’d collect 80% of gross profits but still pay him and his wife 20% until both of them pass away. Meanwhile, I still have no legal partnership in the firm. Only when they pass away would the company be fully mine. There’s **no recurring revenue**, and he could replace me with someone cheaper any time.

I like my job. I’m good at my job. My hourly rate is fair but on the low end. It’s remote and flexible. I travel several times a year.

In this economy I’ll take it over not having a job but I’m quite concerned.

I thought about becoming a fullstack but as a junior in this economy I’m better off with my current job.

I thought about actually becoming good at QA and learning automation but I don’t know if that’s actually a solid path.

Maybe should I change my occupation?

I’ve been in **public health communications** for about 5 years now). I’ve got an MPH and most of my work has been around digital health, strategy, and messaging. Basically I know how to **get complex health stuff across to the public, manage projects, and wrangle stakeholders**.

Lately though, I’ve been wanting to pivot. I love health but I don’t want to be stuck in low-paying, unstable nonprofit/fed jobs forever. I’m looking at **tech, pharma, or biotech comms/marketing/strategy** roles that actually pay well and are more future-proof.   
  
Long term, I’d like to live in Latin America (DR, Colombia, Mexico, etc.), so ideally something I can do remotely or transfer globally.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

* My résumé screams *public health*. Will the private sector even take me seriously for marketing/product/analyst roles?
* I’m not a “math person,” so I’m wary of going into something super quant-heavy. I can handle data if the computer does the heavy lifting, but I’m not about to be solving calculus problems by hand lol.
* Do I really need another degree (MBA, MS in Health Informatics, DrPH), or can I just build a portfolio + get certifications (PMP, product management, etc.) and network my way in?
* I want to break into roles that pay **$160K+** with growth to $200K+, not cap out at $90–120K.

So my questions:

* Anyone here successfully jumped from public health/govt into **tech/pharma/private-sector**? How?
* Would an MBA or MS in Health Informatics actually be worth it, or nah?
* Are there roles I’m not even thinking about that fit my skills but have better salary upside?

1n0p0f7,Going back to old job,"Hi! I was hoping for some advice.

I left a job in December to pursue another career and better opportunities. In my last job, I went through 2 separate redundancy processes. I was tired of the job insecurity and the pay cuts. 

I moved to a new city for another opportunity. This offered more pay and a chance for progression. I thought my life would finally go in the direction I wanted.

It didn't work out - I hated the culture of the organisation and had a really difficult relationship with my supervisor. It really impacted my mental health - to the extent that I resigned and went off sick during my notice period. 

I have been unemployed for a couple of months now. I still want to pursue a new career, but I am starting to get depressed again due to the lack of routine in my life. 

My old job is advertising albeit in a part time capacity. I don't mind this as I can use this to continue with my counselling. 

However, I'm worried I'll get stuck there and not be able to escape. I'm worried I'll never be able to make it in my new career - will other organisations look down on this?

1n0only,What do you do when you’re being squeezed out?,"I just joined this team, although I’m relatively new, I have been here the longest in the company amongst the newcomers in the team given that I was under a different team previously. 

Upon joining, I was being thrown to do work and was doing two persons worth of work in a day on top of surviving a surge of 7x worth of volume (my work consists of two people). This caused a backlog because my role takes more time to do THN partner A as his takes 1/3 of my time taken. 

Unbeknownst to me, there was an existing partnership and my manager did not support this issue as A claimed to be supporting a very big role, despite the fact that he is always playing games, chatting and on his phone. I told my manager that I could not work with a team member who could not support the team during surge periods. So I got partner B. A would be covering either me and B when one of us is on leave, however, he would either be on half day leave, or WFH — we are a paper based company, WFH is not productive and our roles are not eligible to WFH unless there’s an emergency exercise. Not sure why the special treatment. when A and B is away (should never be the case), I would do two persons worth of work, and the work will be given to C whose name I would use for track record purposes. When I am on leave, B is doing my role and theirs and it usually creates a backlog, and she only uses name D for track record purposes. Somehow, my manager doesn’t mind the negligence and would team up with and A by presenting B and I as problematic and incapable in front of our higher management. My manager did not support in clearing the backlog until our higher management stepped in 9 months into the backlog as they noticed that I have been working tirelessly While her favourites go off on time.

In any discussions, my manager always includes A but never B or myself Eventhough we are the first touchpoints. We hardly have any say in projects or workflow discussions as it will only be presented after they have discussed it. Anytime I have highlighted risks, I have always been shut out. So, I would always make my manager to take up their own mess if there was any issues given that I have already anticipated it first. They did not like that I am upfront about things, but predominantly they don’t like me. Recently A has highlighted that I have not included him in some personal emails when I don’t see a point in including him especially when he’s not supporting the team. But somehow it’s acceptable that he conducts conversations about my work without my team. after discussions, A would only inform B, and not me. A has also been icing me out since I did not include him in a meeting. He was not included because he does not have the access and therefore won’t be able to support the work. my manager has told me to not attend the meeting if all of us are not included. The irony. B and I was included in the meeting because it’s part of our job scope and the topic of some Investigation. My manager was not in the meeting as they have already tendered almost a month ago and were handing over tasks. Prior to my management leaving, they have previously assigned A to overlook the teams Eventhough 1) we ALl hold the same rank, 2) his MAIN task is as simple as maintaining number of requests received in a day 3) does not contribute to anything else. And now that my manager is about to leave and has handed over all things, A has been erasing my team even more.

I'll lose my god damn mind if someone here tells me to network and provides advice on networking. I worked with a career counselor and have plenty of networking strategies, thank you very much.

Relocated from US to Netherlands a month ago. Most recent profession was in US university finance, administration, and proposals for the last 6 years. Proposal work was mostly paper pushing and data entry, not as sexy as it sounds. Prior experience was managing a sleep physiology and then a quantum materials lab after. Was a team leader at whole foods before that. I've been diagnosed with bipolar, and my cognitive functioning is rapidly declining due to the meds and the disorder itself. My attention to detail is... poor... these days. My mental faculties are a big consideration for all of this as well.

I want nothing to do with a career in university policy or finances, what a dreadful career and environment. Scientific and technical work aren't ideal either, my mind just isn't up to it these days. I have no idea what real accountants do outside of university finances, although spending time in balance sheets and pennying and diming isn't my bag. Also, the issue of attention to detail and mental faculties... I was most talented and fulfilled in leadership and management.

So many people have told me that they feel immediate trust and acceptance. Not only professionally, but also on a personal level. Honestly this feedback has been the most accomplished I've felt and feel this is where I could provide a real service to the world. I have a natural talent in compassion and leadership. So... What the hell do I do with that? ""Being a good person"" doesn't exactly make money. 

How do I make a career by creating trusting and healthy cultures? Project management? Back to retail?? Therapist???  

I absolutely love bikes and biking and would pursue a career as a mechanic, although that's not exactly a lucrative career.

I'm not particularly money motivated, and my partner supports me in trying whatever I want. She makes good money and would rather see me happy. I logically know I'm in an amazing situation, and I can't help but feel dread in deciding what to do with my time. So any advice is welcome",boysclub-llc,1,0.6000000238418579,6,1756213808,2025-08-26 13:10:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n0lfib/another_dude_probably_in_a_midlife_crisis/,8,2025
1n0l2vg,36 and STILL don’t have a clue what I want to do…,"After finishing school at 18, my career path was basically mapped out by my mum, who had connections in banking. I didn’t really know what I wanted to do, so I just went along with it. I worked my way up, eventually managing two branches and over 20 staff. But by 2022, I’d had enough. Life’s too short to stay stuck doing something I didn’t love. I quit—not just because my manager was a nightmare, but because I knew if I didn’t, I’d keep running the same hamster wheel day in, day out.

Now, I’m moving to London with six months to learn something completely new. I’ve got the tools, hopefully the brains, and the drive to make it happen. The sky’s the limit—but I need guidance. I want a career that’s mine, something that excites me, doesn’t tie me down on weekends, and ideally offers a decent income.

What I hated about banking? Weekend work, mediocre pay, managing people, dealing with customers. I’ve done it all, and I wrung it dry. Now I’m ready for something different. Something exciting. Something I can actually feel proud of.

1n0kzuz,Don’t really know what to do anymore,"For context, I am career firefighter and have been for the past 15 years. With the state of this job and the uncertain future, I just don’t know what to do anymore or how to feel. I’d love some insight from those outside of the fire service. Are these concerns valid? How in good conscience can I continue down a career field that has so obviously neglected its mission with no change in sight. 


It’s painful to say this out loud, but I’m steadily losing faith in the fire service here at home. A system that once stood for pride, service, and strength has slowly become a shadow of what it used to be, and what it should be.
We are watching a profession built on grit, honor, and sacrifice fall behind the times. Where innovation should be driving progress, we instead see outdated systems, resistant leadership, and a shocking unwillingness to evolve. New challenges arise daily, but the same tired solutions are pushed by those unwilling or unable to lead effectively.
Promotions are handed out based on politics and popularity rather than merit, experience, or vision. Incompetent leadership has become normalized, and those who truly care about the future of the fire service are sidelined. Meanwhile, firefighter morale is quietly deteriorating behind station doors.
Towns that once stood behind us with pride now treat us as an afterthought — cutting budgets, ignoring warnings, and expecting more with less. Every department now is responding to fewer actual emergencies, yet our responsibilities keep expanding. Medicals, lift assists, alarms. We’re being stretched thin in all the wrong places while our training, equipment, and support fall further behind.
Volunteer departments are struggling to put trucks on the road. Calls go unanswered because the help just isn’t there. Career departments are handcuffed by internal politics, bureaucracy, and decision-makers who haven’t seen the inside of a truck in decades.
Worse still, the applicant pool is shrinking. Fewer people want to do this job — not because it’s hard, but because the passion that once lit this career path has been dimmed by dysfunction, burnout, and a system that no longer values its people the way it should.
It’s heartbreaking. It’s frustrating. And it’s dangerous.
This isn't about nostalgia. It's not about the “good old days.” It’s about survival. It’s about the future of the fire service and whether or not we’re brave enough to fix what’s broken before it breaks completely.
To those still fighting the good fight: you're not alone. And to those in leadership: it’s time to wake up. Reform isn't optional anymore, it’s overdue.",CaseStraight1244,1,1.0,1,1756212709,2025-08-26 12:51:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n0kzuz/dont_really_know_what_to_do_anymore/,8,2025
1n0kuwn,Weird to have three internships from the same place?,"Hello all, still a student (junior)

I have had the luck of finding a really nice company that sees a lot of potential in the young that are ambitious, because of this I have started (since sophomore year) as an intern for them and have walked through various roles. The map I have gone through is:

(1) Network Software Developer -> (2) Endpoint Security Engineer -> (3) DevSecOps Engineer

\*Keep in mind all of these are internships that each had their own duration:  
Network Software Developer (9 months), endpoint (3-4 months), devSec (3-4 months)

In each I have VERY quantifiable achievements that I am proud to both showcase and talk about that I feel would make me a bit competitive on the market and all this stuff totals almost 2 years of IT exp which will only grow as I am not graduating yet.

But what I am scared about is that this was all done at the same company, the tldr reason for this, is that I just really love their mission and how they treat me allowing me to jump to stuff full-timers were doing

On the resume it is going to looks like

I ve done job change twice and have had my fair share of politics in roles. I ve got offers twice in last 6 months. First when I got an offer after some frustration, the next day I got a promotion. Then last month, I ve been working with a team ( based in another location) who through me under the bus constantly give me mental problems. I ve a supportive boss and senior boss who connected with my team and understood the issue. They couldnt change anything and have asked me to ignore and continue to concentrate on my work and not stretch. Meanwhile during this frustration I got another offer in a senior role with great scope but like before during this offer time my work load was distributed and got support. This created more dilemma for me when I was about to drop papers and the new company are not accepting my decline as they feel they can wait for me to take time and decide and are ready to negotiate my pay, give joining bonus and are ready for a buy out too. I am not able to decide on anything. This creates more mental pressure and I am back to square one. Right now I feel less pressure but still the occasional irritation with my work and at the same time guilty of resigning due to support I get and also feeling bad to let go of. New opportunity.

1n0kg88,Considering Director Role at Bayer – Culture & Stability?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently interviewing for a Director-level role in Bayer’s pharma R&D division. The position would be based either in Cambridge, MA or Whippany, New Jersey, and they’ve mentioned they’d support relocation. I’m currently in another state, where there aren’t many pharma roles in my area.

I wanted to reach out to see if anyone here has worked at Bayer or is currently working there and could share some insights:
	•	How’s the company culture, especially within R&D?
	•	I’ve heard there have been layoffs over the last year, so I’m curious how that’s affected morale, workload, and long-term outlook.
	•	Also, I noticed Bayer’s stock is near an all-time low, which makes me a little cautious about making the jump.

For context: my current company is also restructuring, and while I feel safe for the next ~6 months, I know it’s not a matter of if but when my role might be affected.

So I’m weighing: is this a good opportunity to step into a big pharma R&D leadership role despite the uncertainty, or should I hold off?

Would love to hear any honest feedback from current/former Bayer folks about what it’s really like to work there right now.

Thanks in advance!

1n0j5l7,Secondment/international travelling clause in offer letter - Should I be worried?,"Hi Redditors, I've just received an offer for a contract role (<1 year duration) and the expectation is that it is based in the head office. The written offer letter included a clause of secondment/travelling overseas if necessary (including how wages are being paid/accommodation and travelling expenses etc). Upon seeking clarification, the employer returned an email response saying that clause is standard on all offer letters but it is not applicable to me since my role is a short term engagement. From this, I doubt they're providing an amendment on offer letter and probably assume the email confirmation provides enough weight to label the clause as not applicable.

Has anyone gone through similar situation and do you think it is safe enough for me to return an email (confirming mutual understanding of the clause being out of scope) with the signed offer letter? The bit I worry the most is they can/might use the offer letter against me as breach of employment contract when I refuse to travel overseas at some point when they asked (even if there's an email backing) hence I could be subject to damages claim. I understand that everyone's situation could be different and on a case by case basis. I'm not particularly seeking for legal advice (but appreciate if there is) but I hope some form of insights from fellow Redditors that have encountered this could help me assess my situation better. I am hoping I am not overly paranoid.

1n0j2rr,Can AI Actually Make Headshots That Don’t Look Totally Fake?,"Last week I had to update my LinkedIn profile and didn’t want to spend hours with a photographer. So, I tried 5 different AI headshot tools. Some gave me faces that looked like wax statues, others felt like cheap Instagram filters.

Then I noticed something interesting: tools that use diffusion models and realistic lighting (like HeadshotPhoto.io or Photographe.ai) are starting to get eerily good. In fact, a 2024 survey by AI in Photography found that **65% of early-career professionals using AI headshots reported their photos looked “professional enough for LinkedIn”**, compared to just 12% in 2022.

AI headshots are cheap, fast, and scalable but do they really help your personal brand, or do they make everyone look a little… generic?

I’m curious has anyone actually used an AI headshot for real-world professional purposes? Did it get you noticed or did it just look like a filter?

1n0ixtc,How I Learned the Secret to Getting Overdue Invoices Paid — Without Going to Court,"In my earlier career, I worked for a large mining company, where multi-million dollar transactions were standard, and suppliers relied on prompt payment to keep operations moving.

One day, we received a delivery of materials valued at **$140,000** — a critical order that arrived exactly as requested. The supplier had fulfilled their side of the deal, and as per our **30-day payment terms**, they were expecting payment shortly after.

But a month later, instead of a follow-up call or friendly reminder, we received something different: a **legal letter** from the vendor demanding immediate payment.

I watched as my supervisor, with no hesitation, reached into a towering stack of invoices, pulled out the invoice in question, logged into the system, and processed the payment *on the spot*.

That was the moment I learned a simple truth: **Some clients will never pay unless they’re given a serious reason to.**

It’s unfortunate, but in the business world, overdue invoices are often ignored until the pressure is on. And sometimes, it takes more than polite reminders to motivate action.

**Want to Get Your Overdue Invoice Paid Promptly?**

I’ve seen firsthand what kind of language and approach can push a stubborn client into action — without escalating the matter to court. I know exactly how to word a legal-style letter that gets noticed and gets results.

I am close to my 1 year at the company and since the start, I've only received a bonus once due to a busy month.

My question would be - since I never had a talk regarding salary increase, who should I ask about it? Should I contact my HR or manager?

2. How’s the demand right now in India/Japan for people with tech + Japanese?

1n0g5ph,I’ve been offered a promotion - but don’t know whether to take it,"So I’ve been offered a promotion at work which is an amazing opportunity as these positions don’t come around often in my organisation - there are only 4 people that do this role and I’ve been offered it as one of those 4 is retiring. 

The problem is that I’m currently on an international posting and with that comes an expat package which includes accommodation and car paid for as well as private healthcare. 

The promotion is back in the UK and I’ve ran the numbers. If I take my current salary, plus the benefits (accommodation, car and healthcare) I would need to have a significant salary increase at home to offset the stuff I’ll lose. Add in the fact the job is a much bigger responsibility and the fact the UK has a higher cost of living than where I am at the moment I would then need much more than what I’m currently on to make it “worth” it for me. 

On the flip side, I can’t expect to be on the expat package forever, and there really isn’t the same opportunities in the country I’m in as there is in the UK. 

Another factor is I absolutely love where I’m living at the moment. The city and country I’ve just fallen in love with and the new role would mean moving to London.

My thought process at the moment is see where I get to with negotiations for the new role, do it for 2 years and move back to the country I’m posted in at the moment with that new experience under my belt… 

Any advice? ",mythoughts_1991,1,1.0,0,1756196481,2025-08-26 08:21:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n0g5ph/ive_been_offered_a_promotion_but_dont_know/,8,2025

1n0f8ae,Performance reviewing coming up- how much should I ask for,"For context: I am working as an Influencer Marketing Coordinator for a brand on a 3-month contract with a performance review at the two-month mark. If it goes well, they’ll hire me full-time and increase my salary. Currently, I am getting paid $3k/month and living in Los Angeles... So basically barely getting by :D

It is likely that I will be hired full time as I am currently the only person on my team generating sales and creating tangible impact for the brand. I have numbers that can back this up, and my manager will support me behind that.

The only thing I am unsure about is how much should I be asking for in the first place… I just graduated this past May and I am super proud of myself for doing well, but also not sure how to value myself. Throughout my two months at the company, I have run two influencer campaigns completely on my own and worked with both paid and affiliate creators. I have also conceptualized and strategized for our campaigns, and will now be training 2 new interns that have been added to the team.

1n0eqq4,Question mark on professional ethics in this era?,"I am a professional, and I had my education in the 80s and 90s, in which my parents and teachers spoke the truth. I don't understand why people like us are not fit to live in this era. This is a basic moral value in all customs and belief systems. Now in the current era, we have an idiot called social media. Where we were, we were taught to write an essay on ""Television: An Idiot Box."" But today, with a virus in social media, where we have a cheap code to boost the post by an influencer, it gets a huge hype.

I come across an article on a news channel about a candidate who has created a fake profile on social media exclusively for professional networking. 

I have made a tweet to the particular media and to their chief editor of the media. There are people with real degrees and with relevant professional experience who struggle to find a proper opening to restart their careers post-covid pandemic.

I can understand the post-pandemic mindset of people being more into croaked. And they had a standard formula in life, which was to, like, share and comment. For which they can move to any extreme, where we have seen husbands kill wives and mothers kill children in this society.

1n0e6oe,"I have reviewed 5,000+ resumes. Here's how you can stand out.","I am a founder, and I have reviewed over 5,000 resumes.

Here's how you can stand out:

**1. Actually show the skills we're looking for.**

If you have the skills we're looking for, I should see them at the top of your resume. Content dictates the format, so whether it's a professional experience, education or skills, place it at the top of the resume so it's the first thing we see.

In my most recent hiring case for a Junior Web Content Editor role... I only had 2 requirements for this role: high level of English skills and not needing sponsorship to work in the country. Despite this, many candidates submitted CVs and applications ridden with grammatical errors and messed up formatting.

**2. Remove those percentage bars from skills section.**

ATS has trouble parsing through those, and it means nothing to human reviewers.

What does 60% of Canva mean? What does 40% of French mean? Nothing. It's completely subjective as there's no linear progress when it comes to skill. And even if there was, why would you self-report that you're only half-confident in your French skills? Maybe that 40% is enough for the role.

Just list out the skills and leave it to the interviewer to figure out if your skills are a good fit for the role.

**3. Apply to new applications (1-2 week old max).**

Unfortunately, part of the hiring process relies on luck. If I already picked 5-6 interesting candidates and started interviewing them, I might miss those that just submitted an application. To ensure your application actually gets seen, apply for fresh jobs only.

**4. Keep the summary section short.**

Most recruiters and hiring managers only glance at this section, so you should keep it short and punchy. I recommend 1-3 sentences (so, 2-3 lines) MAX.

Some people like to treat it as a biography, with 10 lines of text. This approach not only makes me not want to read it at all, but it also wastes valuable real estate on the paper which you could be using in your experience, education or skills section.

**5. Create a LinkedIn, add people and ask them to refer you.**

You probably already know about networking, so I'm not gonna talk about that. Instead, I wanted to share something you may not know: many companies have internal policies that require the HM to consider or even interview a referral candidate. My company for example, has a policy where a referral should at least be considered, while internal applicants have to be interviewed. This lets you skip the line and 'force' your application in front of the hiring manager.

**6. If you're particularly interested in working for a company, follow up your application with an email a week later.**

It will help us see that you're engaged and interested, which will make us look at your application (if we haven't already).

However, if you don't get a respone to your follow-up, I wouldn't go keep my hopes up. If they don't reach out after a follow up, they probably found someone else already and are just wakting for them to sign a contract.

A few other notes:

* Many people think that HMs always hire senior-level applicants for entry-level roles. While that might happen sometimes, from my experience, most managers wouldn't do that. We usually have a set budget for the role (which is given to us), which is lower for junior roles than senior ones. A senior will not be happy with a junior salary, so they will be looking for any opportunity to leave as soon as possible. That means that I, as a HM, will have to do another round of hiring very soon, which is a waste of time. So, any manager worth their salt will not be doing this.
* Please submit your resume in the specified language. We always mention that we only accept applications in English, yet a few dozen candidates still send a resume in Swedish or another language. This will automatically disqualify your application. If no language is specified, submit the CV in the language of the job posting.
* Edit your cover letter - don't just submit an AI written one. Over 75% of CLs candidates submitted were just copied straight from ChatGPT. Remember, hiring managers read hundreds of applications. We can see the patterns in words and phrases being used in GenAI outputs. I don't have a problem with candidates using AI (I use it myself), but you NEED to manually edit it and make it interesting. The competition is too fierce to be relying on the HM not paying attention.
* If you get to the interview stage, do some research on the company and the role. If you're applying to work for an enterprise in a specialized role, don't tell the interviewer that you're looking for a startup environment where you'd be wearing several hats. (I know it may seem obvious, but this literally happened in one of my interviews last week, so I thought I'd add it in here).
* In most companies, your applications aren't filtered out by ATS. People are the ones reviewing your applications. There are some things that can be filtered out by ATS via additional questions employers can set. But most companies (small-midsized) manually check CVs.
* If you're still in college, do some internships or participate in school organizations (like for newspapers or events). This experience will make you stand out compared to students or recent grads who haven't done anything beyond classroom work.

1n0dlrb,Should I accept job offer A and rescind if I get approved for job offer B?,"Should I accept Job A offer despite waiting on Job B which is what I actually want?

Hi all, looking to see opinions and if someone has been in a similar situation before

I have Job A that has sent me an offer. It’s pretty good and I want to accept, but I am also in the middle of interviewing with Job B, and based on the job and my friend referral and how the past interview rounds went, I feel confident I have a good chance of getting an offer.

I want to hedge my bets, and not put all my eggs into one basket. Job A would start next month, and Job B would start two months from now. I’m thinking of accepting Job A, and reneging the offer if Job B hires me AND I pass the drug test (will be using quick fix). Only then would I renege the offer at Job A. I would also consider working job A for that extra month to see if I really love it or not and possibly stay there, but I want it for now as my safety until I finish the drug test for Job B assuming I get an offer.

Has anyone else does the same or similar? Does this seem like a good idea? I’m aware this may burn a bridge with Job A but that isn’t my concern.

1n0cktg,Now what…? Feeling lost...,"Hi everyone! I’m 26F and I’m currently a ux designer at a company I’ve worked for about five years (a year as an intern and four years as a full time employee). I can’t say what field I am in right now because it's a unique, niche industry, and it was my dream company since I was in middle school. It was difficult to find a job in UX in the beginning because my portfolio seems too “visual” or “graphic” for tech companies yet my portfolio is too UX focused & technical in agencies and studios. I've managed to present myself as UX designer with strong visual design skills. My company is nearly perfect for me because the company really values typography, visual design, and art direction. Also, I’ve stayed in the same team for a long time because the company culture is amazing, all my managers are supportive, and there is a strong mentorship program. I was also lucky to get promoted two times in the last five years. The job security is pretty good, and work life balance is great too; I have a lot of time and energy to invest in my hobbies and do freelance, personal projects on the side.

I would say the company pay is okay, but it’s not near close to the amount I get from tech companies. Recently, I felt like I needed some change in my career to see if I can expand my skills and **challenge myself**. I applied for an internal role that felt like a perfect opportunity to learn more about ux, research, and strategy. My managers actually discouraged me to apply at first since they said the team might not be the place to find what I'm looking for. It did seem like the team was feeling lost about the future, but I thought maybe this could be an opportunity to (again) challenge myself. However, things don’t always work out like you hoped for… another candidate ended up getting the role. I delivered the news to my managers, and they told me they will help me grow more in gaining more skills in strategy and put in projects where I can learn more about negotiating and talking to higher ups. Overall, I think it was a great learning experience to know what I could improve more on.

I’m a little scared right now because I feel like my experience (visual design, UI) is getting too specific and it would be harder as I get more senior in the role and companies will only find me for specific skills. There’s also this whole AI boom going on, so I feel anxious about having to follow what everyone else is doing and jump into the AI industry and tech. I do want to stay at the same company for a long time, but I also saw so many reddit posts that the company doesn’t value you as an employee if you stay there for so long. I don’t care so much about climbing up the corporate ladder, but at the same time, I feel like maybe I should be trying harder to be a hardcore UX designer. In the future, I would eventually love to invest more into my projects and run my own business with the money I’ve saved up from my corporate job.

* Should I be exploring other companies, industries, and work cultures in my 20s even if I like my job? My friend recommended healthcare tech, but I’m not too sure if this is the right move. I see my friends working in tech getting burnt out, miserable, cynical about life. People have also told me 20s is the only time to overwork and burn out… Am I being too comfortable and not challenging myself?
* Has anyone left a company even if they loved the job? Did it get better or worse?

I'm just feeling so lost in my career... any advice will be helpful. Thank you!",PracticeThen866,3,1.0,3,1756182953,2025-08-26 04:35:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n0cktg/now_what_feeling_lost/,8,2025

1n0c80k,Quitting Immediately after cutting hours?,"I recently expressed my two week notice.  Managers said there wanted to work out a more comfortable working schedule to fit with other factors in my life causing my notice to start with, which i agreed to. But it’s just somewhere I don’t want to work anymore; somewhere I don’t really want to even walk into anymore (basically extreme company burnout that cutting back hour’s hasn’t fixed). another work opportunity came up that I like a lot better that has me scheduled for the same day that my weekly shift at ‘job 1’ is on as well. 

This definitely may lead to a burnt bridge, but since I already tried to quit but settled for less hours, i’m *HIGHLY* considering doing an “effective immediately” exit strategy and therefore ‘ghosting’ the rest of my shifts.

1n099ql,"I was given 3 options: resign, move to a different state, continue work through a third party agency","I have been working remotely for this organization for slightly over a year.

Today my boss notified me that they were made aware that I'm living in a state that our org had not set up all the tax and regulations for remote work. 

I now have 3 options: resign, relocate to a state that is compliance, or work with an agency that will be my contract/employer for the same position, same wage, with benefits from the agency instead of my current org's benefits. 

This supposedly came as a shock to my boss as they had assumed it would have been checked and verified when I was interviewed over a year ago. Added all the hassle of paperwork, background checks, and extensive onboarding process. 

I'm leaning heavily towards the 3rd option with the agency to buy time while I continue searching for a more permanent position. 

Has this happened to any of you? Any recommendations or things I should be asking, made aware of? To add additional context, my family is on this current org's healthcare plan and we most likely just max out our deductible for the year. If switching to the agency, am I correct to assume with new health insurance, this would be reset for the year?

1n08hkz,Job Terminated in NYC,So after 3 almost 4 great years at my company I had a not so great H1. In my review last review my boss stated areas that I needed to make improvements and I’ve addressed each point. However today without any notice I was terminated effective immediately without any severance. My company usually puts people on Pips or gives them severance at dismissal. They said they considered my review as a pip. This was never stated to me. Another employee terminated at the same time was given two weeks notice with a severance. I just received my exit letter stating they are going to pay me out for my last week of work plus unused vacation. Don’t they legally have to do this in NYC? I read that vacation days must be paid out in NYC unless the policy states otherwise.  They are making it seem like they are doing me a favor but this whole thing smells fishy. The company isn’t doing well and it feels like an excuse. I also feel like I’m being treated differently than other people who have been situation.  I wrote a letter with bullet points on the actions I have taken to improve. The way they are handling it just seems unnecessary shitty given that I’ve worked there for a long time. I feel I’m being treated unfairly. I don’t mind getting terminated I’ve been working for over 20 years and could use a break. I’m married and I don’t have to work. I just don’t like feeling that I’m being taken advantage or treated unfairly. I don’t think I should sign anything if they are only giving me a payout they are legally obligated too.

1n08gdu,Career Advice: How Long Do I Have to Stay at my 2nd (Sorta 1st) Aerospace Engineering Job?,"Posting this from a new account. I’m conflicted and looking for career advice about how long I need to stay at my current job. 

Some background, I ultimately want to work in the space/rocket industry. I love space, and things like the moon landing, or the Voyager probe, or Interstellar, is the whole reason I decided to do engineering. I should also mention that I am pretty heavily morally opposed to working in defense. 

I graduated in May of 2024 with mech and aero degrees, and from March 2024 to September 2024, I applied to over 300 relevant positions in space, aerospace, automotive, or anywhere else I could find. Out of that I had maybe 5 roles that I got interviews for, that ranged from rejections after the first interview to rejections at the final stage. My resume was airtight, had a good GPA, two previous internships, tons of rocketry, space and design related engineering extracurriculars, and not horrible at interviewing - just incase you were thinking any of those things. 

After 300 applications over 6 months not working out, I decided to compromise on my morals and expand my search to include defense roles, and switch to space from defense after I gained a little bit of experience, if I ended up in a defense role.

In October I finally got hired as a project engineer with a state agency. God bless the engineers that keep our state running because god I hated that job. I wasn’t doing any engineering, I was pretty much just filling out paperwork all day. I was gaining zero experience relevant to design, testing, R&D, or Manufacturing roles I’d be interested in, and no experience relevant to any other industry I’d be interested in. 

I pretty quickly started back up applying. By March I’d gone from 300 to about 550 total applications. By April, I finally landed a job as a Mechanical Design Engineer (I love doing CAD) at an aerospace company; the only catch was they were very much so a defense company. I took the job because I had to get out of what I was doing day to day with the state agency, and had to start gaining transferable experience to the space industry. 

Fast forward about 4 months to now. I feel like I’m gaining a ton of experience, and very much enjoy my day to day work, when I’m not thinking about what the end result supports, but I still have the shadow of going against my morals looming over me. 

Finally that brings us to my question: what’s the shortest amount of time that’s considered acceptable for someone in my situation to stay at a role? I think I’m committed to staying at minimum 1 year, but I’m going back and forth on if 2 years is really what's needed to look good to future employers. I’ve seen people say leaving your first job after 1 year for somewhere you’re really interested in is alright, but my circumstances are different as this is technically my 2nd engineering job out of college, and I’d be leaving for a 3rd job, after 6 months in my 1st role and 1 year in my 2nd role. I could leave the 1st role off my resume as the experience isn’t super relevant, but then that leaves a year gap in my resume between graduating and starting work. It’s important to me morally that I don’t stay in this role longer than I need to, but also with how insanely difficult the engineering job market has shown me to be, I’m terrified of doing anything that could hurt my prospects in the future without realizing it. Not as important, but my lease also does expire soon, and I’m trying to figure out the length to resign it for, which is why I’m stressing about these questions so far in advance. Could really use some advice from people more experienced than myself with a better understanding of how the industry works! Thanks for any advice!

1n08e0l,Torn Between Two Worlds,"I’m currently torn on a decision I have just stumbled upon. 

I have been working at my first job post-college, a corporate desk job, for the past month, having just finished two weeks of training and two weeks of shadowing. The benefits are good and so is the commute. However, I just don’t feel like it’s the type of job for me. I do not enjoy the intense deadlines, and I feel like too much has been thrown on me too soon. I’m just getting the ropes of my own callbook, and they threw someone else’s callbook on me today because they called out. The two weeks of shadowing were very chaotic and it felt like the two people I sat with for each week were being pulled themselves in 50 different directions. Each single customer or case feels like it has different rules or procedures applied to it, leaving me without a structured SOP to go off of, so I’m sometimes having to guess and wonder whether each decision will come back to bite me in the ass. 

Naturally, the frustration of it all left me scrolling on Indeed and I came across a job to work on a farm, which is something I’ve always had a passion for; working outside, working with animals, and working with my body rather than my mind. I’ve found physical labor gives me a lot more sense of purpose than working with my mind sometimes. 

This job is the same pay, maybe more, and the same commuting distance. They also offer decent benefits from what I can tell. 

Should I take the risk to apply (and of course keep my current job given the job market and the economy)? Is it even worth the risk of being picked for an interview and then getting all excited? I’ve already poured a lot of time and effort into my current job, and so have they into me. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated! 💖",AstraVexus,1,1.0,2,1756170445,2025-08-26 01:07:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n08e0l/torn_between_two_worlds/,8,2025
1n088oc,Terrified to tell my boss I’m leaving,"Hi all! Looking for some advice.

I’ve been at my current job for 6 months. It has been quite the whirlwind with multiple people quitting since I’ve joined due to workload and management issues. 

I have actually had the opposite problem of most people in that I haven’t had much to do at all and it’s been driving me crazy, so I’ve been looking elsewhere. Also, there are some intense restrictions around PTO that I wasn’t told before I was hired, which is a contributing factor. I just accepted a job offer that I think will be a really good fit.

I am terrified to tell my boss I’m leaving. He’s gotten visibly mad in a meeting before (not at me). This is going to shock him, as he very much thinks I am on his side in the him vs the rest of my coworkers thing. 

Any advice? I know I don’t owe a company anything and they’ll replace me in a second, but I’m so scared to have this conversation.

1n07lg9,leaving a job after 6 months,"hi, my spouse recently got promoted and we’ll have to move across country at the beginning of the year (March). Thing is, I just started a new job with a super small firm (6 people) where everyone is super close and worked there for 8+ years. Obviously they’re expecting a long term type of thing. My coworkers have been doing a lot for me and put in a lot of energy and time to train me as well. 

I started this job a month ago & now am just freaking out because I’m super bummed (and ofc excited) about me having to leave. I’m so overwhelmed on having to have this conversation, it’s like I’ve wasted their time and I just feel terrible. Everyone is so close and they’re so nice to include me in on their personal lives, getting to know me, just being good people. If it was a bigger team or corporation, maybe I’d feel differently but with everyone being so close and them expecting me to be there long term, I feel guilty and anxious about the entire situation.

I know shit happens, life moves on, a job can’t expect someone to stay forever but, I wish I didn’t even take the job. I’d hate to see disappointment or anger on anyone’s face. ** I also had an inkling that my spouse was going to get this promotion so I tried to apply to entry-level jobs instead (reception, barista, customer service) but my background is in legal work so this is what I landed first. Maybe that’s why I feel even worse, I didn’t want a “high responsibility” job because I knew I could be leaving soon anyways and “wasting someone’s time” .. if this makes sense? 

Any similar situations? Thoughts? Thanks everyone. ",Holiday-Contact-8424,7,1.0,2,1756168293,2025-08-26 00:31:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n07lg9/leaving_a_job_after_6_months/,8,2025
1n06ylx,I am HR Manager but I am being made feel like I am nothing in the company.,"I joined a new company where I am the hr manager since 2 months in a startup where I am the only HR person. My ceo is nice but weird at the same time. 

Whenever I raise an issue, he thinks I am overthinking. He keeps telling me that I need to be more confident etc. 

Now thing is there is a operation department where there is one more person working who's primary role is to be reporting manager and to get the work/tasks running with the rest of the team. 

Problem is if I share any company related issue which I faced with any employee he will directly go to them and will tell them upfront that HR said you were rude to her etc. when I literally just shared something with him. So I am planning to think 100 times before sharing. 

But every policy or any hr work i would do she is always involved in everything even though she has no role in it. 

If I create policies, it would go for reviews through her, if any discussion related to processes happen she will be on the call. Onboarding/off-boarding checklist, she will be making it along with me. Employee documentation, she will be having access to all of it. 

There is nothing which I have done as an HR and she does not have access to. It makes me feel like I am nothing over here. Not that I feel replaceable but I feel worthless. I have tried talking about it to my CEO but he says that he needs everything to be known to her incase I am not available she will be managing it. 

We don't have payroll system yet. It's managed by the ceo. So idk what's the need of involving her in the remaining things. Even for employee birthday she wants be on a conference where I'll be asking the employee what do they want for birthday gift. 

I am really tired. Tomorrow there is going to be policy briefing which I have created a 22 pages policy.. I'll be briefing it to every employee on call and even in that the ceo asked us to do it together and today on call she said that she will keep adding whenever I take pauses in between. Not as a warning or threat but to be involved.
 
My ceo constantly supports her by involving her in every HR related thing. Where I am nowhere in her work. Not that I want to buy ceo never even says once that you both figure this out together - for any operation work. 

She gets to work independently. But I am working always in a dependent mode. I am losing my confidence over here. The pay is decent. But idk if I'll be able to long last this way. It makes me extremely sad. 

I am just crying rn while typing it.

I joined the police academy back last year and I made it 60% of the way through the academy and ended up failing a test, so they kicked me out. I have the option of going back if I want to. Only problem was is that I had to file a petition in order to register for classes. I ended up forgetting to withdraw from classes when I failed my test (thought it was an automatic thing), so they made me do a petition too request a drop with refund. They took like 5 months to process this petition. It was finally approved after the 5 months, and in the petition process, you don't get any updates. You're pretty much in the dark unless they request evidence or something. In the meantime I ended up signing up for the LPN program at a local community college. I ended up going for my first day, today. I know its kind of early to tell if I will truly like the class, but I just don't know if I'm really feeling it.

1n02ghi,Breaking into hardware wasn’t easy for me — curious what would have made it easier for others pivoting careers?,"Hi everyone,

I have a career in robotics and hardware now, but it wasn’t an easy path to get here. When I was learning, I often wished there was a more approachable, hands-on way to build confidence with the basics of electronics.

My husband (a robotics professor) and I have been working on an all-in-one kit to make that process less intimidating for beginners and career changers. The idea is to give people practical, project-based experience in building circuits — things like a heartbeat monitor, a simple video game, or a microphone. 

The goal is to help people build real, transferable skills that matter in today’s job market, especially as hardware roles are growing alongside AI infrastructure.

We’re still super early in shaping this and really want to understand if this resonates with people who are pivoting careers. So I’d love your thoughts:

* If you’ve ever thought about switching into hardware/electronics, what would have helped make the learning curve less steep?
* Do you think more hands-on, project-based learning would have helped you feel ready?
* What barriers (time, cost, confidence, resources) feel most real to you?

If anyone’s curious, we’ve also been experimenting with different teaching approaches and I’d be happy to share a “before/after” example in the comments.

How has that turned out for you? Did you find ways to use your skills elsewhere, whether in another job, sector or as self-employed?

1n00my0,Struggling with direction in life,"I’ve been very fortunate so far in my life. I’m 24, I work a job that I don’t love and isn’t very fulfilling, but it pays pretty well. I’m a business major, which I would call the only major regret in my life so far. It feels like I’m a layoff away from being in a competitive market with essentially no hard skills. 

I’ve been lucky enough to save up a pretty good nest egg but now I’m not sure what to do with it. I live in a very high cost of living city but so I’ve been feeling the pull to buy a cheap condo and start building equity.

I’m struggling between the prospects of doing nothing, trying to buy now before it becomes unaffordable, or going back to school to develop some real skills.

1n00ipb,Should I let my boss know I am looking for job? (Only employee),"What the title says, but some brief backstory - I have been with my current employer for 4.5 years, 2.5 of which I have been her only employee. I am the face of her business as she is also working from another state and is only in person a week per month. I am desperately needing a new role for better growth opportunity, pay, benefits and overall fulfillment. Given how much I do for her I know my absence will impact the business in some way, and I already plan on giving her 3-4 weeks notice as courtesy, but wanted to ask if it would be better to let her know that I have started looking ahead of my notice? Given my timeline with another company I interviewed for - I would essentially tell her that I am looking just to give my notice a week or two after disclosing that I am job searching. Not that it matters, but it would seem I actually started looking before letting her know with such a quick turnaround.

1n00dn7,Feeling stuck,"Hello! I’m seeking some advice on what to do next. I have, of course, solicited my family and friends but wondering if there is anyone out there who can relate to this and that may have some thoughts/advice that I haven’t heard yet. 

I have been with my company for over 5 years. I am well-established within the company. People like me, they know I’m reliable, and they know I get things done and done well. I have work friends. I started in a more creative job (my experience and abilities are a mix of non-profit work, marketing, and creative things like design - I also have managed big projects and am good with efficiency and problem-solving). Slowly, as I have changed roles/advanced, I have lost room for creativity. 

My role now is boring and is something that I don’t think I would ever be excited to have. I think younger me would be very bummed to know I’m in such a boring, uncreative, black-and-white, background job. I am pretty much on  a computer at a desk in a windowless basement all day. 

I am not sure where to go from here. I make good money and have to maintain a stable income as my husband is going back to school currently. I consider side businesses but get discouraged. I feel like I have no motivation in or outside of work right now. I don’t create as much as I’d like outside of work. I just feel drained by it. I also worry I can’t commit to a side business. 

I feel stuck in a perpetual loop of: I hate this > I want a different job > There are no other jobs I want > I want to work for myself and not a company > I need money > I’ll  just stay in this job. And repeat. 

Any thoughts? Advice for getting started? Advice for surviving a job for the money?

That old saying “keep your head down, stay quiet, and let your work speak” honestly doesn’t work anymore. You’ve got to market yourself, put your name out there, and make sure people know you exist.

First impressions are the launchpad. They give you the room to dream bigger. And to create that impression, your “packaging” has to be solid  because at the end of the day, you are the product. Your skills, your presence (online and offline), and the way you position yourself that’s what draws people in.

1mzzbc5,Program Director vs. Coordinator: Which role should I take?,"I recently cleared the reference check stage for a Program Director role and was told I’d be moving forward to the offer. But the process has been really discouraging. They’ve essentially made me jump through hoops, asking for very specific references I wasn’t told about upfront, and now the hiring manager says they can’t provide an offer letter, because HR is the one responsible for creating and sending it. What’s most frustrating is that they also said the role was supposed to be filled “yesterday,” yet there doesn't seem to be an urgency.

On the other hand, I’ve been offered a Coordinator role elsewhere. The pay is about $4K less, but I’m hoping they might be able to match the other offer. I haven’t submitted a counter-offer yet; would you recommend waiting until I receive the official offer letter via email, or requesting it ahead of time? This role also aligns much more closely with my long-term interests, and unlike the other organization, they’re ready to start me right away.

The tricky part is the commute. The Director role is much closer to my per-diem position, while the Coordinator role would likely be a 40+ minute commute. This could be especially frustrating if I try to balance both. Fortunately, I have good rapport in the per-diem role and could probably ask to shift to weekends only. Another option would be finding a place to live in between the two main roles to offset the distance.

My dilemma is this: the Program Director title would likely look stronger on my resume, but the organization has been unbelievably disorganized and slow. The Coordinator position aligns more closely with my long-term career goals and seems much more efficient and ready to move forward. That said, I’m not entirely sure if they will match the pay, I’m hopeful, but it’s not guaranteed.

I honestly don’t know what to do: Go for the title that looks better, or the role that feels better and is moving faster?",Ok-Ship5106,1,1.0,0,1756148301,2025-08-25 18:58:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mzzbc5/program_director_vs_coordinator_which_role_should/,8,2025
1mzyubz,New career crossroads,"Hi all

Just started a new job post grad about a month ago. I been currently in an account shadow period just listening in on meetings and doing random tasks assigned by my shadow manager. 

Today I had a call with my account shadow manager where he told me someone on another team within the account had to take leave and he’s offering me his spot. So I’d be taking over and basically leading and be very client facing. I’m shocked as for the past month I’ve been very passive to now an opportunity to completely fast track my progression. 

Now here’s the issue. 

From what I’ve seen this team is very disorganized, about 90% of the team is based in another country (time zone issues) and no one in my office is on this team so I’d be completely alone. Basically thrown into the lions den and got to learn as I go. 

If I say no to this I’d stay on my current progression timeline where after my shadow I join a team that is very organized, the team lead is my direct manager and most of my office is on this team. I’d have tons of support. But the progression would be a lot slower. 

Part of me wants to say yes cause I want the challenge but obviously part of me is scared cause I’m new to the company, just graduated and have been very passive so far in my current experience. 

What should I do? Safe route or jump right in route? Any advice is appreciated!

1mzyt58,Finally landed a job I was working towards for years and I hate it. What next?,"I finished up my degree after roughly 8 years of on and off education paying for school as I went. I have a bachelor’s in business administration with a minor in marketing. When I started school I had a different plan but for the sake of just getting it done I got my admin degree. Throughout school I worked in construction, wildland fire, restaurant and property management, delivery, and finally retail sales right towards the end. 

I have now landed my first sales job that required the degree to get in and I honestly hate it. It’s full cycle sales (so SDR & AE) in an industry that’s been around for a long time and in the area for 50 years. My expected hours are five 12’s 7-7 and I’m on draw for about $3000 a month with a $500 a month salary. I’ve worked some difficult jobs but this one has taken the cake for whooping my ass. 

I took the job because I’m both in a tight financial spot right now but also because the experience from this could lead into something much better down the line….I think? 

Where this is all flipped on its head is I’m questioning if I even want to work in sales anymore. In retail I did well enough but I certainly didn’t enjoy pushing people into making decisions that weren’t right for them. But good lord am I terrible at this job so far. To start the job includes 60-100 cold calls a day as well as 15-20 business door knocks. 3 weeks in and I’ve booked a whopping one meeting and I feel like an annoying ass mosquito. At this point I genuinely don’t know what to do but I feel like shit.

Any suggestions/thoughts from others who have been in a similar position or who made a career pivot would be greatly appreciated.

Should I stick it out and see if things get better? Find a different sales job for a different company? I don’t even really know what other jobs I could get with my degree an experience but I’ve looked at some coordinator roles.

1mzy20h,Should i play,"Howdy, I am a college football player. I played for a Division I program for a few years and also played Juco for a powerhouse program.

Last fall, I stepped away because I was thinking about taking my life, and I thought it was the best thing to do at the moment. I wasn’t loving football, I was hurting, and I wasn’t getting my opportunities to play.

I entered the transfer portal and got about 15 offers. I sat on it in the spring, I sat on it in the summer, I visited a few places, but I didn’t love them. I think I was looking for that D1-type atmosphere that I had before—it wasn’t a huge school, but it was a really nice place to play football. The new offers were more upper D2 and really low FCS level. I just kept putting it off. I didn’t know what I wanted to do, and I was riddled with anxiety.

Now I have the opportunity to play, which is crazy because camp is over and teams are starting. A few schools lost their tight ends due to injury, and they’re going to put me on scholarship. They believe I could be ready to play in the next two weeks and be a big part of their offense.

I’m just lost on whether or not to play. I already have a degree, and they’d be paying for part of a master’s degree. It’s the Division II level, and I’d have to pay for my housing, but that’s only because I’m an older guy and would want to live off campus.

I’m confused and wondering if I should give it up now or not. I have this year and maybe another year of eligibility because I’m a COVID kid. I love football, and I know part of me will regret it if I don’t play. But another part of me feels like I’d be happy to move on and start working.

At the same time, I know this window of life is so small. Even though it’s D2 and not super glitzy or glamorous, if I have one or two years left, there could be another shot to work my way back up to the D1 level. If I quit now, I’ll never know.

If I continue, I don’t know if I’d be satisfied playing mid-D2 ball. Would that really scratch the itch? Am I being ungrateful? Am I blinded? I’m just not sure.

Any advice would be appreciated. I’ve put so much work into football that it would be nice to finally get my flowers—but maybe I’m being egotistical.",dirtydanglerr,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1756145452,2025-08-25 18:10:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mzy20h/should_i_play/,8,2025

1mzxdvq,Cintas ride along + VP interview?,"Hey everyone,

I’m in the late stages with Cintas (Facility Services sales rep role) and wanted to see if anyone here has been through the exact process. Over the past two weeks I’ve gone through 5 interviews — recruiter, hiring manager, my potential boss, and the Director of Sales. Every step moved fast; each person passed me along immediately. Both the recruiter and director even mentioned they were impressed with me, which I took as a good sign.

Now I’m down to what looks like the final two steps: •	A ride-along tomorrow afternoon with a rep who’s been there ~7 months. •	A VP of Sales interview scheduled for Thursday morning.

From what I gather, the ride-along is more about seeing the day-to-day and making sure I understand the grind, but I’m curious — how much weight does Cintas actually put on feedback from the rep I’m shadowing? Do I just need to be engaged, ask a couple smart questions, and not overthink it?

And for the VP interview — is that any different from the Director interview? My Director conversation was more casual, personality-focused, and honestly felt like he was already ready to advance me before we even got into details. Should I expect the VP to drill more into metrics and situational questions, or is it more of a culture fit/final blessing type of meeting?",Best-Lingonberry4884,1,1.0,0,1756144000,2025-08-25 17:46:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mzxdvq/cintas_ride_along_vp_interview/,8,2025

1mzw4ft,Manager says I'm Not Ready,"Hey everyone, 

I am looking for advice as I am looking to leave my current workspace and do another role within my company.  I want to first discuss how I have been feeling in my branch of work. Honestly, its unsupportive, toxic and frankly privileged based at this point (our supervisor is the CEO's daughter in law and just had a baby - so our manager prioritizes her every need for vacation time, etc.) I wanted to apply to a training position a few months ago, and was told I wasn't ready in our feedback meeting because I still ask questions and I should wait for a marketing position to open since I like being creative and that's a field I want to be in. We then had a new position open at my location and my coworker applied and was denied for ""not being ready"" and it was given to an external hire. Well, they rescinded their acceptance and the job needed to be posted again. They got no bites, so they hired my coworker as she ""started to show initiative"". BS, she deserved it from the beginning.

  
Anyway, a supervisor role opened at another location and a few of my coworkers from other locations (including the supervisor of that location who got promoted elsewhere) told me I should apply, as did my partner. 

  
I messaged my manager saying ""Good morning, I wanted to make you aware that I am going to apply for the xxlocationxx supervisor position, so you may see that come through on your end. Thank you'

  
She replied ""Ok I would like to speak with you first, because honestly, you are not ready for that position.""

  
I responded ""I'm more than happy to discuss any feedback once again but after much consideration and conversation with my family, I am mostly set in my decision and feel I would be underestimating myself not to apply."" 

  
She set up a meeting for us to talk about it at 3pm today, and I still really want to apply but she has to approve it to get sent to HR. What should I say during our meeting?

1mzv396,The 9.2% Salary Hike Illusion: Why Your Raise Feels Like a Pay Cut,"**Thread: That moment when your 15% hike still feels like you're going backwards financially 🧵**

Remember when a 10% salary increase felt like hitting the jackpot? Those days are dead and buried. Here's the brutal math that nobody in corporate wants to discuss openly.

# The Numbers Game Everyone's Playing Wrong

**Official narrative:** ""Salaries in India to rise 9.2% in 2025"" - every business publication is parroting this line.

**Reality check:** Your rent went up 18%, groceries jumped 22%, and that Swiggy addiction now costs what your entire food budget used to be.

Let me break this down with actual numbers that'll make you question everything:

# Your ""Impressive"" Hike vs. Real Inflation

* **Your salary increase:** ₹8.5L to ₹9.8L (15% hike - you're celebrating!)
* **Your rent:** ₹25K to ₹32K (28% increase - ouch)
* **Monthly groceries:** ₹12K to ₹15.5K (29% increase - double ouch)
* **Fuel/Transport:** ₹8K to ₹11K (37% increase - financial assault)

**Net result:** You're actually 8-12% poorer than last year, despite that ""generous"" raise.

# The Tier-1 City Trap: When Success Becomes a Liability

That viral Reddit post calling corporate life a ""giant casino"" wasn't wrong. Here's what nobody talks about in those LinkedIn success stories:

# The Hidden Costs of ""Making It""

* **Status inflation:** Your peer group expects you to upgrade everything - clothes, restaurants, gadgets
* **Lifestyle creep:** What felt luxurious at ₹6L feels basic at ₹12L
* **Social pressure:** Try explaining why you're taking a bus when you earn ""so much""

# The Real Kicker: Taxes

Your ₹15L package? Here's what you actually get:

* **Gross:** ₹15,00,000
* **Tax + PF:** ₹2,85,000
* **Take home:** ₹12,15,000 (₹1,01,250/month)

Meanwhile, your cousin in Indore earning ₹8L lives better than you because his ₹15K rent gets him a 3BHK, not a shared 1BHK.

# The Psychological Warfare of Salary Benchmarking

Companies are master manipulators. They'll show you industry averages while conveniently ignoring:

1. **Geographic cost differences:** ₹12L in Bangalore ≠ ₹12L in Bhopal
2. **Hidden costs:** That ""free"" office cab? You're paying for it through 12-hour days
3. **Future opportunity cost:** While you're grinding for increments, entrepreneurs are building exits

# The Benchmarking Lie

HR shows you Glassdoor data: ""Software engineers in your experience band earn ₹8-15L""

What they don't show:

* 40% of those surveyed have stock options worth 2-3x their salary
* 30% work remotely from lower-cost cities
* The top earners often have side hustles or freelance income

# Breaking Free: The Strategies That Actually Work

After 25 years of watching people trapped in this cycle, here's what separates those who win from those who just survive:

# The 40-30-30 Rule (Not What You Think)

* **40% of your energy** on your primary skill that pays the bills
* **30% on building** a complementary skill that could become income stream #2
* **30% on understanding money** itself - investing, taxes, business structures

# The Location Arbitrage Play

Smart professionals are realizing: Why earn ₹15L in Mumbai when you can earn ₹12L remotely from Nashik and live like a king?

**Mumbai math:**

* Salary: ₹15L, Expenses: ₹13L, Savings: ₹2L

**Remote from Tier-2 math:**

* Salary: ₹12L, Expenses: ₹7L, Savings: ₹5L

You save 2.5x more while having a better quality of life. This isn't rocket science.

# The Uncomfortable Truth About ""Career Growth""

Most people optimize for the wrong metrics:

* **Salary increases:** 10-15% annually (if you're lucky)
* **Skills market value:** Can increase 50-200% with right positioning
* **Geographic arbitrage:** Instant 30-40% cost reduction
* **Tax optimization:** Legal ways to save 15-25% on taxes

# The Real Growth Strategy

Stop chasing job titles. Start chasing:

1. **Skills that translate globally** (remote work ready)
2. **Multiple income sources** (consultancy, products, investments)
3. **Geographic flexibility** (work from anywhere capability)
4. **Tax-efficient structures** (section 80C is kindergarten level)

# The Bottom Line: Stop Playing Their Game

That 9.2% average salary increase? It's statistical manipulation designed to make you feel grateful for breadcrumbs while the cost of everything else skyrockets at 20-30%.

The real winners aren't climbing corporate ladders. They're building escape routes.

**Your homework:** Calculate your real inflation rate using your actual expenses from last year vs. this year. Compare it to your salary increase. The number will shock you.

Then ask yourself: Am I optimizing for salary increases or wealth creation?

Because there's a massive difference, and only one of them leads to actual financial freedom.

*What's your real inflation rate vs. salary increase? Drop the brutal math in the comments. Let's stop pretending everything is fine when the numbers clearly aren't.*

1mztwog,"Masters degree, ample experience, still lost","Hi all, as the title says, I feel like I have done so much to establish a solid foundation but still feel so lost.  

A little bit about me: To start, I have a masters in marketing from a small business school in my area. I have 12 years of professional experience in a few different roles that include relationship banker/operations manager at a large retail bank, retail marketing manager and general retail manager for a large cannabis dispensary chain, and I sold mortgages as a loan officer for a few years. I love sales, I love retail, I do not want to work on commission and do not want to work in a retail store anymore. I don’t know where I go next, but the anxiety of not having a professional title is absolutely destroying me mentally and I don’t know what I want to do “forever.” I am not artsy fartsy, but I am data-driven, love general business operation, and can learn just about anything I put my mind to. I just recently finished Google Analytics certification and realized that I have a general understanding of most of what I’ve learned, but I  do not want to become a full time data analyst. I ultimately want to work for myself, but do not know what direction to take, whether it be marketing my own products and selling them online, creating a marketing company and 3rd partying my marketing services to local businesses, or just finding a well paying 9-5 job that involves marketing analytics or something of the sort. I make a decent salary now, but I feel like the walls are closing in and i can feel myself mentally burning out and quiet quitting. 

Any guidance or confidence boosters are much appreciated.  If there are any more questions that can provide more detail, I’d be happy to answer!

1mztj9b,The 3 questions that helped me walk away from my “dream” music industry job,"In 2018 I walked away from an amazing job in the UK music industry.  
On paper, it was the dream position, but I felt deeply unfulfilled.  
I was anxious about moving on, as I’d spent the best part of 9 years focusing entirely on this life project. I was trapped in constant toing and froing — should I, shouldn’t I? I wanted to travel, meet different people, and experience life outside of the creative bubble, but how on earth could I walk away from the dream job and the identity that went with it?

Answering three key questions finally enabled me to make the move.

**Is this the person you want to be in 10 years?**  
I looked at my life in the music industry — club nights, festivals, travelling, and burning the candle at both ends physically and mentally. Was this something I wanted to be doing as a 37-year-old? Or a 50-year-old? The answer was definitely no. Once I was clear on this and accepted that the current path wasn’t sustainable, I was able to think outside the bubble.

**What’s my Plan B?**  
I didn’t just want to go backpacking and then crawl back to the creative industry with an empty bank balance. So during my final year at the record label, I got TEFL-qualified so I could teach English abroad to keep my funds steady and stay productive. Having this was a MASSIVE weight off my mind. The process felt like a transition rather than just pulling the plug on something great.

**Can you live with not knowing?**  
I was desperate to travel and understand who I was outside of the music industry bubble. My entire identity had been built in that world. Who was I outside of it? Would I enjoy living in another part of the world? Would I like a non-music-based job? Finally, I decided that it would haunt me forever if I didn’t take a punt on this and find out. This was the tipping point.

Fast forward 7.5 years, I’m still living and teaching in Colombia.  
I’m married, fluent in Spanish, and have bought an apartment here.  
Totally in love with teaching and this part of the world.

If anyone else is feeling the need to break away from the music scene (or similar), I would recommend starting with these three questions.

1mzt730,Positioning Myself in Today's,"Hello Everyone - I'm sliding into a dark place and am hoping I can get advice to help me break out of this job searching hell. Like many/most, my applications are getting few responses. There's a chance that my mindset (confused, embarrassed, desperate) is my greatest challenge, but hearing from others often helps.

My career includes executive leadership of marketing agencies and lead advisory roles in large consulting agencies. I'm currently applying for Marketing and Digital Management positions.

The Marketing side of my career is straightforward and easy to define - I've held VP, SVP, EVP roles and have been responsible for building and managing teams.

The last 7 years I was in the Consulting Sector seeking to broaden my revenue growth focus beyond strategy and campaigns to include price, promotion and demand forecasting. I've also been deep into data, analytics and technology. It was great experience, but it made my background less consistent at a time where applications that don't have the right job titles, companies, etc., are dropped immediately. 

The result is that I have a track record of building and leading teams, working with top global brands, developing solutions across data, technology and people, but I feel like I'm not the square peg most jobs seem to be. 

Any input is very much appreciated.

1mzsbss,How to move the ball forward -> Manager not leading the group,"Hello all, I work for an engineering organization, 15+ years of experience and am a Principal engineer in a department for the past few years.  I transferred over some years ago to make a career change internally and was put in charge of some technical area on a new project.  In general, Principal engineers set the technical direction but not in charge of managerial tasks from the group point of view.  

About a year in, my boss got let go due to them getting caught being dishonest about some of their work arrangements ( I won't go into detail not relevant for my question).  Before this, the manager was quite good at their job and was good at keeping things in line.  I will mention this group was mostly remote as well (including myself) and the boss being let go kind of let the wind out of everyones sails.  Another senior engineer left in that time as well (huge skillset) and to say it was a big let down doesn't do it justice. 

As the company I am working for was going through re-organization at that time, they did not immediately put in a permanent boss but instead a placeholder manager who ended up taking a buyout later that year and basically coasting.   In that time, I was asked to take over some duties in addition to my job.  First mistake, I didn't question too much or ask about additional compensation but just ""took it on"" to get through the rough time, essentially doing the team schedule, running the daily and weekly meetings and escalating issues in cross functional teams.  Well, the issue became that this interim ""non-manager"" was in for about 8 months, we got moved to another department with a GM basically dual capping and keeping us on autopilot until a new manager was put in place 1.5 years after my boss was let go.  A couple months back, we finally got a ""permanent"" manager and I laid out the concerns and gray areas in place that were not addressed in the previous year.  I have brought up things like ""junior members not having sufficient work output or not leveling up skills sufficiently"", ""needing to fill gaps for manpower"" as well as how to re-balance the work load to cover the gaps.  In every case I will get a ""maybe you should take 2-3 hours out of your day to train junior members"" or ""I don't think we need to fill those gaps"" or ""Everyone has a voice here, you can correct team members too"".  However, any attempt to give some ""honest advice"" has been contradicted by him later on with the TM's so I feel like I'm just rowing upstream without a paddle there.  

I know this particular manager has a bunch of other projects on his plate and likes I am able to handle managerial tasks but I have been adamant to not take that on as well as expressing many times that I prefer technical track as well as not wanting to pursue management track for personal reasons.  

Am I approaching the situation wrong or is there a better way to lay out that I need these structural issues addressed?  This project is extremely complex and I have brought up concern points to not meeting deliverables but I feel like it's all on deaf ears and it's caused quite a bit of life stress.  Outside of moving orgs, I'm just lost on how to move the ball forward.

1mzrx56,"16 years in finance, but stuck after relocation – feeling undervalued. Anyone experienced similar?","Hi all,

I’d appreciate some advice from people who may have been in a similar situation.

Quick background:
	•	16 years in finance
	•	13 years at a large international company, and 2–3 years in a bank before that
	•	Worked across multiple finance functions, most recently as Deputy CFO of a smaller country organization
	•	Moved to southern Germany 3 years ago with my company for a large transformation project, which I delivered successfully
	•	Went to a German high school, and I’m fluent in German

The issue:
	•	Applied for 3 different senior finance roles internally
	•	Two went through succession planning and weren’t really open
	•	For the last one, I made it to the final two. In the end, it was given to someone with only accounting experience, while I was told they “need a more strategic profile” – which doesn’t match the feedback I had received earlier
	•	In the markets I came from (emerging markets), things were much more dynamic and I advanced much faster. Here, I feel stuck

Facts:
	•	In my late 30s. The people who got the roles I applied for are closer to their 50s
	•	Compensation is fine – I don’t need to earn more
	•	My current role is basically the “hypercare” phase of the project, I work maybe an hour a day
	•	My wife is pregnant and we just moved into a beautiful home in southern Germany, and we are really happy here personally
	•	Professionally, I feel undervalued, ignored, and like I’ve been treated unfairly. That feeling sometimes hits really hard and overshadows the positives

Has anyone been through something similar – being sidelined after a big project or losing out on roles in unclear succession processes?
How did you handle it mentally and career-wise?

Any advice would mean a lot.

He’s been in that role for 10 years, I’ve been in mine for 3 and we have a close working relationship. 

When I started reporting to him, I brought up the topic of growing into a larger role in future. He was receptive of the idea and eventually I took on bits and pieces of his role but nothing that was too risky and I always referred to him on major decisions.

I like working with him and he has supported me thru a difficult time in my personal life. Support as in monetary and emotional support (allowing flexibility in work arrangements). He was also supportive of me taking up my current role and giving time for me to grow into it. 

Here comes my dilemma. I desire to step up, I think I can do it. Sure there’s a lot of regulatory stuff to catch up but I can take it one step at a time. My desire aside, I have doubts about my competency to manage a company’s P&L & manage my future managers who are in different locations. I’m not sure if the same guidance could be given. 

I’m really not sure what to do. Desire alone isn’t enough. How can I position myself as THE  candidate? ",thortilla27,30,0.9599999785423279,1,1756130679,2025-08-25 14:04:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mzrea2/unsure_about_stepping_up/,8,2025
1mzr31l,Boss won’t promote me because of my anxiety,"ll try to keep this short.

An assistant manager position was recently created for the team I work on. I applied, did the project that was asked of me to complete, and did 2 interviews.

(The project was to come up with ideas for improvement and action plans)

My coworker Sam also applied and interviewed. I’ll give Sam credit for being here longer and having more experience in that regard but I shocked to find that when she interviewed she didn’t even do the project and got the job over me.

I can see that maybe my manager just has a better relationship with Sam because they’ve worked together longer, but Sam not even completing the project and still getting promoted is wild to me. (Sam told me she just “winged it” in the interview and didn’t prepare or do the project). Maybe her interview was stellar, I don’t know.

My biggest gripe is that my manager told me the reason I didn’t get the job is because of my anxiety. She said she “wants to work on it together” and I can “learn how to manage stress better”. This rubs me the wrong way because I’ve made enormous strides in this area with my psychiatrist and therapist. Yes I used to panic when unexpected things popped up, but I have improved. She even noted it as a positive on my recent performance review.

Now that Sam has this new position my manager still wants to use my ideas that I came up with in my project. I know I don’t “own” the ideas but I feel irritated that I didn’t get the position and she still wants to use my ideas.

I don’t know if I’m asking for advice or just venting. Thanks anyway",pumpkinspicefrog,52,0.8999999761581421,38,1756129941,2025-08-25 13:52:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mzr31l/boss_wont_promote_me_because_of_my_anxiety/,8,2025

The problem? I don’t feel prepared at all. I keep thinking I’m not good enough and that I might get fired for not meeting expectations.

	•	How do you navigate the transition into a senior position when you don’t feel ready?

1mzp6xk,Should I switch from UI/UX to Cloud or AI?,"***Hello everyone,***

I'm from India & I hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s in IT with AI as my major, along with two research papers and one book published in international journals. In theory, I know AI and IT fundamentals well, I’ve studied Python, web, data science, networking, android, Linux, hardware, AI/ML, and data visualization. But practically, I don’t have strong IT skills. **I’ve just built a foundation in everything but mastered nothing, and honestly, I don’t enjoy coding enough to do it for life.**

After my postgrad, I applied extensively for IT roles but couldn’t land even an internship. So, I shifted to UI/UX & Graphic Design - something I always enjoyed. Truth be told, I even got my current job by exaggerating my skill set. Till date, they doon't know but I’ve been designing everything only in Figma: no Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, or CorelDraw. I don’t even feel the need to learn them, because people love my Figma designs; they find them highly converting and appealing. I’m not even an advanced Figma user, yet I get praised for my work every day.

This break landed me in my dream role: US-based, remote, $450/month(as a fresher), 8-hour shifts, weekends off. In India, I doubt I’d even get 15k rupees($170) for the same work, since I lack those ""traditional"" design tool skills.

It’s been 6 months now, and I genuinely love designing and I'm happy with work. **But I chose IT to build a high-paying career, and while design comes naturally to me and I get appreciated for it daily, I keep questioning: Can I really reach 36 LPA just with design? Am I even growing at all?**

*On the other hand, roles like Cloud Architect in IT clearly can*. I enjoy working on Linux systems, Docker, love AWS, and truly aspire to become a Cloud Engineer. So while design gave me the break I needed, I now feel it’s time to break out of my comfort zone and realign with my long-term goal.

**So, should I really switch from designing to IT or master designing and become professional in it? If I should switch, then how do I switch back to IT?**",enpisidude,1,1.0,0,1756125097,2025-08-25 12:31:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mzp6xk/should_i_switch_from_uiux_to_cloud_or_ai/,8,2025

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Social Sciences (Political Science, Sociology, Social Psychology), wrote my Bachelor's thesis in Organizational Psychology and then went on to study my Master's in International Relations and Development Policy. Thesis is on state theory and human rights.

I am a quick learner with a good work attitude. I am reliable, hardworking and (would dare to say) smart.

I am a senior marketing manager at an enterprise tech company (“enterprise” meaning we make  software that we sell to big companies to help them run their data centers and applications better …. BORING). Anyway, I was a journalist for years but moved to marketing because it pays A LOT better. I’ve been in marketing now 10 years (plus my 10+ years as a journalist covering enterprise tech … also a very BORING beat but that’s another story.) I started at the senior manager level 10 years ago and I’m still a senior manager, though not for the same company. The company I’m at now I’ve been here for nearly 4 years. Every year I get passed over for promotion despite being told I do great work. I think the main reason I get passed over is I can barely hide my contempt for these people I work with and my bosses. Ok, that’s a slight exaggeration. I do hate the job and the people, but I am always professional. Though admittedly I am not great at the corporate politics. And there is A LOT of politics at my company. I can’t pretend to be “thrilled” about a project or “so excited” to work on this or that with my “amazing” colleagues. I just can’t stand the faux enthusiasm in Slack messages and the ass kissing in meetings and the endless productivity theater and “killing it” etc etc. I suspect this is why I can’t get promoted despite the quality of my work. I’m just not one of these people. As I said, I try to play the game as best I can but I suspect people can tell that I don’t respect them or this company or this industry. I’m doing this strictly for the money, which is very good btw. But I want to get to the next level, Director level, for the obvious reason … more money. I’m in my late 40s and my only goal is to make enough money to help pay for my kids’ college and then retire as quickly as I can so I can stop doing this bullshit. Any suggestions on how to break through to the next level? And/or any advice for making the day-to-day work less tortuous? As I said, I loathe these people and if I’m being honest some this o hate myself for selling out my dream to be a journalist just for the money.

1mznuof,Thinking of quitting my job after just a month,"
I think I’m over this job. I got the offer in July, started earlier this month, but still haven’t received my contract. Honestly, I’m not happy.

At first, I was excited since it seemed like a good way to finally gain professional digital marketing experience. I’ve struggled to land a job because my mother moved us out of London, where there are no opportunities. This role isn’t local. I commute 2 hours each way by tram and bus, 3 days a week, which is exhausting.

I accepted quickly since it was my first job in the field, but training has shown it’s more of an admin/personal assistant role than marketing. It’s just me and the director in a coworking space. My tasks are mostly emails, stakeholder communication, filing, receipts, etc. He says marketing duties will come later, but he already works with a marketing agency, so I don’t see how I fit in. He mentioned taking me to trade shows, which could be valuable, but I’m unsure I’ll stay long enough to even go.

On top of that, he’s constantly late. I always make the effort to get there early, even with my 2-hour commute. There’s only been one time I was late. Last week highlighted the issue: we were supposed to start work at 12:30pm, but I didn’t even know I’d be working until he messaged me the night before at 11pm. The next day, I arrived on time, only for him to show up at 1:40pm, over an hour late, with no apology, leaving me sitting there with nothing to do. This happens regularly.. he’s always 15-30 mins late and makes me feel like there’s no respect for my time and energy.

The job is part-time, 18 hours a week, £12.50 an hour, and the lack of contract is now holding up my supported housing application. (I’m desperately trying to leave a toxic environment) My housing officer even called him directly and asked when my contract would be ready and when I’d get paid. His response was, “I guess the end of the month,” and he admitted he hadn’t even written up my contract yet and needed to check with his accountant. I found this unprofessional and disorganised, especially since I received my offer in July and he should’ve had this sorted from the start.

I have a first-class marketing degree and have worked hard to upskill in digital marketing, design, and web development. I’ve freelanced, done internships, and built passion projects. I know I deserve better than this, but I feel stuck.

To make matters worse, ever since the housing officer contacted him, his communication with me has dropped off. We usually message on WhatsApp, even at weekends, but when I asked for a short health-related leave last week after a minor surgery, he never responded at all and hasn’t even opened my message.

I’m tempted to resign. If it’s this bad after just two months, what’s the point? If I resigned I’d be able to move into supported housing right away. I really wanted to stick it out for the experience, but all I’m gaining is admin work, and he doesn’t respect my time at all.

1mzn7zp,I accepted a job and then was told 2 alarming policies - should I leave?,"So for context, I'm based in the UK and I joined a company in June this year after being unemployed since February.

Before I joined, I was told that the role would be fully remote and that there are 28 days of annual leave, but you don't automatically get public holidays off (so essentially 20 days if I chose to take off public holidays).

After joining, I was told that the company operates a Christmas shutdown for 2 weeks, meaning I'd need to use 10 days of annual leave to get that off. If I also take off all public holidays (which I'd ideally want to do because everyone else has them off), then I'd be left with: only 10 days of annual leave. Most other companies give you 25 + 8 public holidays.

Secondly, the company found out that I'm relocating to a city that is 1.5 hours away from their office and are now citing a policy that I need to be in the office once a week. I've been told it's in the employee handbook but I've never been shown it and when I asked for a copy, I was told that it's being drafted.

The problem is, I’m not happy with my pay and also worried about AI replacing my job in the future. Because of this, I’m seriously considering either changing my career or upskilling.
For now I'm starting to do 24 hour Prompt engineering for ai course from udemy. (Which helps in writing prompts for ai and getting output)

I'm open to new fields too as long as they are future-oriented and has better pay. (I've been considering Generative AI, digital marketing, etc. , but I’m open to suggestions as im unaware of market situation of these)

Here’s my situation:
I don’t want to relocate (Mumbai based).
Budget for courses: under 2–3 lakhs.
Duration: max 1 year (preferably something I can do online) I’m working full-time and also have household responsibilities, so I need something manageable.
Long-term: I want to work independently (freelance/business)

Last time I chose passion over money and it didn’t pay off financially. This time I want to be practical. Any guidance on what path/skillset could be the best investment for me would be really appreciated.

1mzmpsh,How to land your first Cybersecurity job in the USA (Beginner → Job Ready in 8 Weeks),"Hi everyone 👋,

I see many beginners in the USA asking the same question:
👉 “How do I get into cybersecurity without years of experience or a degree?”

Here’s what I’ve been doing with my students:
✅ Start from zero (no IT background needed)
✅ Learn real-world penetration testing, SOC, and security solutions using the same tools companies use
✅ Work on hands-on labs & simulated job projects (so you can show real skills, not just certificates)
✅ End the program with a job-ready portfolio + resume guidance

📌 Result:  By the end of 8 weeks (3 classes per week), students are able to crack entry-level Web Pentesting / SOC jobs and stand out in interviews.

I’m running live online classes (small group, job-focused). If you’d like the full course outline + roadmap PDF, drop me a DM and I’ll send it to you for free.

1mzmjt0,Switching to a less stable role with a newborn,"I am a registered dietitian with over 5 years of experience in hospitals and community settings.

Anyone in healthcare might tell you the job is demanding, and in my country if you work in healthcare, the job is extremely stable (nobody gets fired, the older employees are mostly cruising). The culture is traditional, with paid leaves and time off being extremely difficult to ask for if not given months' notice, mainly due to manpower shortage.

I recently had the opportunity to consider switching to a role that is 100% remote - it's a similar role but for a tech start up.

I'm keen on the role as I'm a newly minted mum and would very much appreciate work from home arrangements.

However, I've switched roles quite a few times now, and have worked at 3 places in my short career of 5 years. I'm afraid jumping to a new role now would make me look like a job hopper, or worse, an insincere employee. I've been at my current role for about 2 years.

Furthermore the potential remote role also seems less stable... given that they have previously laid off some dietitians 3 years ago. The company assured me that they are more prudent in their hiring due to that, so I appreciate this transparency and the way they are not afraid to admit mistakes.

I need some objective pros and cons and advice from people who have been in similar situations - I don't feel like I'm in the right state of mind as my priorities seem to have shifted.",Sweetamf,1,1.0,3,1756116800,2025-08-25 10:13:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mzmjt0/switching_to_a_less_stable_role_with_a_newborn/,8,2025

1mzm5wi,I'm stuck.,"Hey.
I don't know how to really start this..
Or summarise this thing in short so that people won't ignore it and help me for real.
So..
I'm 16 , a commerce with maths student.
Who's currently preparing for the 2026 boards.
So basically this feeling , the feeling of confusion, restlessness everything started when I had to choose my stream.
From my childhood I was never good at maths but in class 11th I chose commerce with maths..
Just thinking about my future and my dream to support my single mom who's living just for me..
I thought I have to take the hard way if I want to do something in life and make her proud..
And live a life where we won't be dependent on anyone.
In all this chaos of thinking and figuring out life I've lost myself and honestly.. no I have not figured out anything instead I'm just drowing in this ""whatever this is called""
Everyday is a new start? But it's all so exhausting..
My health is suffering my mental health is suffering I don't know 
Why do people have so much expectations from me.. that I'm unable to meet.

I'm unaware of what I want to do in future after 12th but the thought of disappointing my mom or living the life my mom lived or not being able to provide her with everything she deserves makes me even more sad and restless.

So tbh I don't know what my interests are
I'm not good at maths..
I don't know what to do next..
I'm disappointing everyone...
I don't have any goal 
And I'm full of fear of failure..


So basically..
I'm confused about what I want to do after 12th.
I'm not good at maths but I really want to do something which is high paying so that I can support my family. And not be dependent on anyone.
Something which I love doing...

If u had to restart your life what would u have done?

I sent my manager a message as to why i haven't had the chance or ability to apply and that i was becoming increasingly frustrated by the lack of opportunities i had been given and hinted at my experience and that i had essentially been trained up in that position by the previous manager.

They responded stating that i shouldnt be frustrated, that i haven't even applied etcetera and that it's all on me. The training apparently has no weight or bearing on the role, yet the training i received IS that step into the Assistant Management role. The experience? I have none according to them.

So, how am i supposed to apply for a position when im not even made aware of said position even being remotely open?

Me assisting with managing the store for 2 years and actually helping build the site up from where it was sitting, isn't worthy experience?

Yet an 18 year old, fresh out of school and only been at KFC for under a year is ""great experience""  and worthy of the position ans they're excited to have them on the team. 

For context, im 29 years old, worked my absolute arse off, proven time and time again what i am capable of, my co-workers all telling me i should have been Manager / Assistant Manager. Some are even beginning to question why i haven't been given that opportunity.

I’m currently a Senior Executive in Compliance with 4+ years of experience, though not much in internal audit apart from some audits I’ve done within my current company. I just received an offer from a top 10 audit firm for an Internal Audit & Risk Advisory role. The basic salary is only $40 more than what I’m earning now, but it does come with a $250 allowance.

The upside is that they have promotion opportunities every 6 months, and based on what I’ve read on Glassdoor, it seems to be true. I was really hoping for at least a 20% salary increase since I have quite a lot of financial commitments, so the offer feels a little underwhelming.

The idea is to turn “theory” into “experience.” Instead of just watching YouTube videos or reading guides, you get to actually live a day in that world.

Do you think people would be interested in this? Would you personally want to “rent a day” with someone in a profession you admire or are curious about?",nogut9,0,0.5,8,1756102795,2025-08-25 06:19:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mzix69/airbnb_for_experiences_but_with_careers/,8,2025

1mzhvt8,Quit now or risk being fired?,"I am currently a trainee in a federal job and have recently obtained my clearance. Before leaving to training school for advanced concepts, I need to memorize and complete several chapters of required material. I am struggling with one chapter and am a few chapters behind. With the school date approaching, I am concerned I will not pass if I leave for school.

If I do not finish the material before school, I think I have a risk being let go. If I choose stay and leave for school, failing more than two exams or practicals would also result in automatic termination. I worry that being fired for not passing could result in a record of poor performance, which may affect me later. 

With the current federal hiring freeze, quitting may not improve my situation.

1mzh97y,"I am over 35 and have experience in customer service, retail and 2 years in data entry...what can I do?","I have a bachelor degree in digital media, butd my portfolio was just not good enough to get a job in illustration. Also, tried getting into marketing, but since my course only taught photoshop, indesign for 2 months out of the 3 years, my knowledge was lacking. I was stupid and didn't practice on my own and now I can't really afford the programs to practice them in anyways. Plus, it is very competitive, I am over 35 and have nothing in my portfolio as I started working in retail as soon as I graduated.

Years passed and jobs changed, I worked in retail, customer service mainly since I was good at it and working on stuff on the side that just never picked up.

I was working for my last job in data entry but since that is going away with AI and technology, I don't see much future with it.

I don't have a driver's licence as I do have some personal reasons due to this, I tried getting one but nobody has the patience to teach me and my last driving instructor said he had to drop me. Also, lessons are very expensive nowadays I can't afford it.

I have some savings at the moment, but just want a part-time job at the moment that is not as stressful as I tried an opportunity a few months back but that failed unfortunately and it was too stressful for my mental disability.

I don't want to go onto disability unless I am really desperate, which I'm not and I can just work in something part-time to survive. The problem is, I can't get much; I tried coles and supermarkets and retail again but I think I'm just too old or not much opportunity out there.

I do have talent still in using some photoshop, tried upwork and fiverr to maybe do some photographic editing but nobody has gotten back to me, guessing it's just very competitive there as well.

I am great with talking to people and customer service but bad at sales as I am too truthful and if I don't believe in the product, I never make sales to people.",Turquoisedragonwow,2,1.0,5,1756096837,2025-08-25 04:40:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mzh97y/i_am_over_35_and_have_experience_in_customer/,8,2025

1mzgfdz,7 contract & PDPA pitfalls I keep seeing in SG SMEs (from an in-house counsel),"I work with small teams that move fast. The same issues slow deals or create risk—most are easy fixes. Sharing a compact checklist that founders/ops folks can run before sending a draft. Add your own tips—keen to learn what’s worked for you.

**Contracts (commercial)**

* **Scope & acceptance:** Is deliverable, testing/acceptance, and change control written clearly enough for non-lawyers?
* **Payment reality-check:** milestones, late fees, currency/withholding; can fees change mid-term?
* **Termination:** for cause vs convenience; exit plan for data/assets; refunds on prepaids.
* **Liability cap** (e.g., 12 months’ fees) + carve-outs; avoid unlimited “catch-all” liability.
* **IP & branding:** who owns new IP; what licence do you actually need (territory, sublicensing)?
* **Confidentiality/NDA:** duration, carve-outs, secure return/delete on exit.
* **Governing law/venue:** pick something you can live with (and enforce).

**PDPA quick wins**

* **Notice & consent** in plain language where you collect data (web forms/onboarding).
* **Processor clauses** when vendors touch customer/employee data; **breach notice** window.
* **Cross-border transfers:** contract for comparable protection.
* **Access/Correction** process and **retention** periods written down.
* **Name a DPO** (can be internal) and keep a simple data-processing inventory.

**Bilingual docs (EN/中文)**

* Align meaning line-by-line; specify which language prevails on conflict.
* Keep a **tracked-changes redline** with a 1-page risk note so non-lawyers can follow the why.

**When an “outsourced in-house counsel” model helps**

* Multiple contracts a month and you need **48–72h** turnarounds.
* Prefer **predictable spend** to ad-hoc bills.
* Need **EN/中文** drafting/review plus occasional HR/PDPA/policy updates.

Happy to DM a **one-page “Contract Risk Note” template** or a **PDPA notice sample** if useful. This is general info (not legal advice); curious what pitfalls others see most often.

1mzgbgp,Embarrassing? Career switch,"Hi all,

I’m a 20 year old university student in the USA. I’ve been going to college for 2 years now with the intention of going to med school. But honestly, my heart isn’t in it at all. I haven’t gotten an A in one science class outside of labs, and I truly think it’s because I just don’t care about the material. What I really want to do is be a flight attendant. I love flying, and have looked into this extensively - I feel confident I have the support system to live a fulfilling life as a FA.

But internally, I have to ask - am I a quitter? I have two cousins who are doctors, my sister wants to be a dermatologist, and my other cousin is on the road to becoming an architect. And here I am about to drop the dream of being a doctor to try to be a measly FA. I feel like a failure and a disappointment. I know my parents will be disappointed. My grades are just getting worse though, and I feel like I need to stop taking these classes that I don’t care about and are damaging my GPA, but truthfully, I’m terrified of talking to my parents about this. I’m spiraling and I don’t know what to do.

Thank you for reading, and I appreciate any advice anyone can give me.",Phanawg,3,1.0,14,1756093710,2025-08-25 03:48:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mzgbgp/embarrassing_career_switch/,8,2025
1mzg9q1,"Unhappy in Biopharma, Want to Jump Into Medicine at 32 – Advice Needed","TL;DR: Looking for advice/job recommendations for a 32F who wants to start over in the medical field. I have a B.S. in Biology, considering the Physician Assistant route, but open to other ideas.

Sorry for the long post, and TIA to anyone who takes the time to read it all!

I’m turning 32 this year and feeling really unsatisfied with my current career in biopharmaceuticals. The constant downtime, hiring freezes, threats of layoffs, lack of career growth (without a Master’s or PhD), and the oversaturation of scientist/QC roles in my area has made me seriously regret this path. At this point the only draw is the paycheck — and that’s not enough when I’m this unhappy.

I’ve always wanted to go into the medical field and regret not staying on that track in my 20s. I have a B.S. in Biology and originally planned on medical school. Back then, I was working as a medical scribe, studying for the MCAT, and building relationships for LORs — until my family talked me into switching to engineering. Long story short, it didn’t go well: I failed a few classes, mostly got C’s/B’s (after being a solid A/B student), and my cGPA dropped from 3.6 to just above 3.0. That tanked my confidence, and with COVID hitting, I left school and went into biopharma.

But honestly? I’ve never stopped thinking about the medical field or regretting that decision. Now I want to break back in — but I’m not sure how. Med school feels out of reach at this stage, but I’m heavily considering PA school. I know it’s competitive (especially with my GPA), but I’m open to other suggestions. I’m thinking about GPA repair through post-bacc classes, but I’d also need to build PCE hours. I’ve got maybe 600–800 HCE hours from scribing back in 2017–2018, but I know that’s old.

So, for anyone who’s been in a similar spot:

- Is PA school realistic, or should I look at alternative medical careers?

- What are good entry-level jobs for PCE hours that also pay decently?

- Any other career paths in medicine I should explore that balance stability + meaningful work without requiring med school?

I don’t mind starting over, but I do need to be mindful of cost. Any advice, encouragement, or direction would be really appreciated.",ESO_Aliya,2,1.0,2,1756093547,2025-08-25 03:45:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mzg9q1/unhappy_in_biopharma_want_to_jump_into_medicine/,8,2025

1mzfk0t,How I Got Promoted to Staff Engineer (And How You Can Too),"Look, I spent way too many years thinking that being the best coder in the room would automatically get me promoted. Spoiler alert: it doesn’t. Here’s what actually works for getting promoted to senior/staff/principal levels:

Stop being just a code monkey. I know that sounds harsh, but hear me out. The engineers getting promoted aren’t necessarily the ones writing the most elegant algorithms. They’re the ones who understand the business impact of what they’re building. Start asking “why are we building this?” instead of just “how should we build this?”

Learn to communicate up. Your manager doesn’t care about your clever implementation details. They care about how your work moves the company forward. Practice explaining your technical decisions in business terms. “This refactor will reduce our monthly AWS costs by $10K” hits different than “I optimized the database queries.”

Become the person who connects dots. Senior+ engineers see the big picture. They spot problems before they become fires. They suggest solutions that other people didn’t even know were possible. This means understanding adjacent teams, business goals, and technical debt across the entire system.

Build allies, not just features. The promotion decision isn’t made by your code. It’s made by people. Help other teams solve their problems. Mentor junior devs. Be the person others want to work with, not just the person who ships fast.

Document your impact. Keep a running list of everything you’ve accomplished and its business impact. Most engineers suck at this and then wonder why their manager doesn’t know about all their great work during review time. The truth is, the higher you go, the less time you spend coding and the more time you spend thinking strategically, communicating, and leading. If that scares you, you’re not alone. But if you want to stay relevant (especially with AI eating up more coding tasks), you need to develop these skills now.

I actually wrote a whole book about this called “The Last Human Software Engineer: How to Stay Relevant When AI Takes Over the Code” because I kept seeing talented engineers get stuck at the same level for years. It’s available on Amazon Kindle, paperback, Google Books audiobook, and Apple Books ebook.

The book goes deep on building the strategic thinking, communication, and leadership skills that separate senior engineers from code generators. Because honestly, if you’re just writing code, AI is coming for your job. But if you can think strategically and lead through uncertainty, you become more valuable every year.

Your technical skills got you in the door. Your ability to think beyond the code will get you promoted.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

My current employer does not know that I’ve even considered looking for other jobs, and think they’re “helping me” because they changed management to hourly recently.

My mom is their oldest sibling and they have their own kids so I know for a fact and don’t expect to get anything from the company in the long run. I’ve been there for going on 6 years total, I have left twice to go work in places I wanted to see but I ended up wanting to come home in the long run, anyways because I have grown up in the company I’ve learned how to do basically every type of work we do and I’ve gotten good at all of them as well, I’ve been told by very many people inside and outside of the company I’m an amazing hand and very talented, now just saying that makes me uncomfortable because I don’t like bragging about myself or when people talk me up but I need to get my point across. So the other night I was having beers with a friend who works there as well, we have a strict policy on talking about wages but a lot of us don’t really care what the other makes, well he made a remark about how i probably make a ton of money and I laughed, long story short we told each other our wages. Now this guy is a hard worker for sure but he’s capable of about half of what I can do and that’s no disrespect to him he just hasn’t had the time or opportunities like I have. Well come to find out he makes 3 dollars and hour more than me and I’ve also found there is a lot of guys in his same situation who make more. Now I’m not mad that they make more I’m just more disappointed in my own family because I’ve gone all over the state on last minute done jobs no one else wants to do, learned things no one else will and I put up with a ton of shit all the time and never complain yet I’ve maid the same wage for the last 2 and a half years. I refuse to ask for a raise as that’s just not how I was raised, but at the same time idk what to do in this situation, should I leave and go on my own or should I look for other jobs or just stay.

1mzcpgh,"A job wants to hire me, but they insist on talking to my toxic former boss i haven’t spoken to in a year","I’m a medical assistant, a job reached out to me through Indeed saying they came across my resume and, based on my experience and certifications, I seemed like a great fit for their team. I interviewed with them, and it went really well — they told me I’m exactly what they’re looking for. I provided four references, but they’re specifically asking to speak to the provider I worked under at a job I left about a year ago. The problem is I’m not comfortable with that at all.

I worked at that job for three years and loved it at first, but over time the provider became extremely toxic and started verbally abusing me almost daily. It wasn’t just me — she also upset other employees and even patients with her behavior. Her treatment was the main reason I left.

Since then, I’ve had three other jobs, including the one I’m at now. The first two didn’t work out long-term (I was at one for 3 months and the other for 7), and I’ve only been at my current job for about 2 months. I took this job mostly out of necessity and honestly, I’m not happy here.

I haven’t updated my resume to reflect these recent jobs because I know it doesn’t look great to have three jobs in one year. But I’ve still been able to get interviews — for my last two jobs, they never asked to speak to my old provider. I just listed a former co-worker for reference and it wasn’t an issue.

Now, though, this new job really wants to talk to her — and I haven’t spoken to her since I quit. I really don’t feel comfortable reaching out to her. But I also don’t want to say, “She just doesn’t want to give me a reference,” because I feel like that makes me look bad.

The job is serious about hiring me and they want an answer soon — like by tomorrow. So what should I do?

1mzccgw,I am incompetent and lost. Please help me,"# 

Before going ahead to read this post, I humbly ask each of you to be kind and considerate in your replies. I genuinely need help and guidance and I truly believe that I would be able to get it on this forum - hence the post. This is going to be a long post:

I am a 35YO woman and a senior consultant at a big 4 with 3 years of experience in consulting in the US. I came to the US to do my MBA from a very good school (top 15) and had about 7 years of experience before that. I am married but came here alone to follow my dream of building a great career - my spouse is slated to come here soon.

I came to the US and started from scratch because my career in India hit a ceiling and I wanted to take my career global

I have been very ambitious from my school days and have always worked very very hard. Did everything sincerely and worked very hard. But somehow, I was always above average (read good) in everything and never excellent or in the top 1%. Be it the boards, my graduation, post graduation, career - and this haunts me. It has been haunting me from the last 20 years. I am always struggling, have always been, but never quite got the results I want. The pattern has always been the same. Whatever I want, I never exactly got that but did end up getting something that is good - not great and not whatever I wanted. A few examples:

1. I worked hard for GMAT - day after day - for 3 years and attempted it 8 times and my score has only improved by 10 points - from 700 to 710. I gave my everything to prep for the exam. Was always nervous and anxious when writing the test. While I got 50/51 every time in Quant, I always tanked verbal - somehow always struggled with reading comprehension (even though I have decent language and communication skills) - when I would read to connect dots and understand, would forget details, and sometimes my eyes would just glance at the complex text under time pressure and not able to process the text. This whole episode left me feeling very incompetent
2. Same during my bschool when I worked day and night on my cases for McK - Did not make it. The time pressure gave me a lot of anxiety and I was unable to reason effectively
3. During my graduation, I was preparing for the IIT JEE but a very bad break with my first boyfriend (who was abusive) left me mentally and emotionally scared for 3-4 years. I lost my long standing dream of making it to the IITs and lost my prep years. Ended up making it to a decent private institution
4. After graduation, I wanted to make up for not making into the top engineering institute by making it into the top management institute in India but pattern repeats - got into a good institute but not the best (carrying the emotional burden of it till now). Could not get the %tile that I wanted in the competitive exam
5. I do not have a lot of friends at all and have always been a loner - somehow never had too many friends. I was always bullied in school by nasty girls (on my looks). I had 3 friends (so called) during graduation and all they did was find ways and means to tell me that I was not good enough because I did not look great.
6. It has been 3 years and I am yet to be promoted to a manager. My firm has had a reorg every 6 months and I struggled to find a sponsor that would vouch for me. I had great reviews but could never work with one person long enough for them to vouch - never really understood which partner to invest time with given the fluid nature of consulting. When I joined consulting, I was told utilization is imp and as the economic climate was bad, I took up whatever project I could lay my hands on - worked with diff people. When I tried to put my case up for promotion, I was told I needed more visibility in my practice.

I have started working towards that by taking up more BD work but the practice I am in now (which is a new one by the way) is very design heavy and all the partners have an agency background. What has started happening is that when I pitch an idea in a certain manner (good choice of words) versus when someone else with a design background (read native speaker) pitches it using flashy language, they their delivery better. I am struggling to build a connection and establish relatability with the partners. Is it because I am a non native? because there is a bias? or because I suck at delivery?

How do I know what words to choose to resonate with them?

This is taking away my peace as my life has become completely about how to resonate with partners and be relatable to them

I also struggle with over explaining and being concise and I am working on it. I have ADHD too and struggle with focus (although it has not been debilitating). I zone out a lot and have struggled with reasoning on the fly. Am I never going to be in the top 1% because I have ADHD? I feel lost and incompetent and have also contemplated ending my life many times. I feel I have lost half of my working life and have no hope for the second half

Please guide me. How can I regain my life? How can I for once get exactly what I want in my career which is fast growth. Will I ever be able to at all?",Solid_Razzmatazz_813,1,0.5699999928474426,1,1756081963,2025-08-25 00:32:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mzccgw/i_am_incompetent_and_lost_please_help_me/,8,2025
1mzc82w,"What do I prioritise, enjoyment or money?","I am just writing this post to get a few different pieces of advice. 

So to give some context, I (26m) am an extremely introverted, anxious person, I have worked 15+ jobs, most for a number of weeks. I leave jobs frequently because of my social anxiety and also i think it’s due to ADHD (undiagnosed). 

In July last year I joined my current workplace. I really put my head down and excelled in this role, and have gotten many really good opportunities since then which mean people constantly use me for advice and technical help. 

This has resulted in me making a lot of really good friends. Without sounding big headed, I feel like somewhat of a celebrity in the workplace, I can’t walk more than 10 steps without someone saying hello and talking to me, it literally feels amazing and is more than I could of hoped for. 

Without going into detail I had a really frustrating situation recently where a person higher up than me passed me up for a role that I was promised just so he give it to his friend. 

I got really angry and ended up applying to a few other jobs. I applied for a job in the civil service which would be a 7k pay rise if I get it. 

I could certainly do with more money but I know that if I stick out the current role, I will likely get a promotion within the next year or two (not guaranteed). 

What do I do? If I get offered the new job do I take it for the pay rise and hope I get on with people in there, or do I stay and continue building on the foundation I’ve already created, and hopefully get a promotion and pay rise in my current workplace?

1mzbu5r,Accepted promotion but worried about burning a bridge if I back out…,"Back in March, I earned a promotion into a new role with my current company. The problem is, the role kept getting delayed. Leadership changed in the meantime, and I was told it wouldn’t start until Q1 of next year. Then, out of nowhere a couple of days ago, I was told it’s starting in 3 weeks.

I was also told that if I didn’t take it, I’d have to re-interview next year when other roles open up. With new leadership in place, it feels like passing now could burn a bridge, especially since I’ve been positioned as “the guy everyone vouched for.”

On paper, it’s a great step forward: slight raise, new boss, more responsibility, and the chance to build my own team. The catch is the location adds about 15–20 minutes each way to my commute and my wife and I have a newborn on the way. Paternity leave is approved literally right when the promotion starts, but the timing makes me question whether I made the right move accepting.

The extra money isn’t the deal breaker for me — it’s being with my wife and kid. An extra hour away each day might not sound like much, but for us it feels big. This whole process has been a lot, and I don’t want to miss out on being present for my family.

The part that weighs on me is if I had said no, with the new leadership in place, I feel like it would have burned a bridge — and I don’t want to risk my future growth by doing that either. I jumped the gun and signed the offer letter but have had doubts since and keep second guessing myself.

1mzbhg2,"Does it make sense to get two degrees, one in engineering, and one in field biology, and plan to pursue field biology with engineering as a backup? -Sophomore in college.","I'm really struggling with deciding what I want to do in the future, but I'm worried that the job market for what I'm passionate about will dry up completely, and unless I have a backup plan, I'll be stuck serving tables. The thing is, I'm lowkey also interested in engineering, so I'd rather do that if my primary passion fails, as opposed to something more adjacent to field biology like data science. It helps that engineers make a lot of money, and engineering is generally a relatively good job market. However, getting an engineering degree is no walk in the park, and it feels like it'll be a waste of time if I just go into field biology. Additionally, unless I'm doing internships for companies over the summer, I'm unlikely to find work as an engineer, so it's not just about taking the classes. Since I have to do internships for field biology, these two degrees come into conflict. Field biology is just such a risky, high-work/low-pay career, requiring a strong will and dedication, and if I don't have a backup, I might be in trouble at some point. In general, though, I'm *very* passionate about field biology, and I'm pretty passionate about engineering, and I'm also willing to put in the pain and stress to get two degrees. But it also feels kind of dumb. Any potential employer on either side might also see my involvement in another field and decide that it's not good that I'm split between two specialties.

1mzb3vc,Need an opinion on if I should change my major/career path from someone please,"I am 21 years old (F) and will be finishing my Associate's of Applied Science this year. I had planned on applying to a specific radiography program for a while, but recently I have had doubts. I would like to give context and would be extremely grateful if anyone who has experience or thoughts, as I do not have someone in real life.

  
When I began college and before that, the only career I had ever felt truly drawn to was becoming a therapist or mental health counselor. I had tried many other things, but this always stuck. I began college as a social work major with plans to get an MSW and one day open my own practice. I am aware it is a long road, I do not mind. I remember when I told people what I wanted to do, they always made a sour face. Looking back, I wonder if I had been 18 and in denial about how I wanted reassurance from the adults in my life. When I changed, it was not because I didn't want to be a therapist, but because I was scared of how little money I would make until I got there and took the advice of others to heart about finding a faster path that paid better. This eventually led me to radiography.

I wanted to go into mammography eventually after I got my foot in the door and some experience under my belt. My program will be two years, I have the grades and extra research experience to cushion my application, and I like the idea of working with female anatomy/women and helping them in a way. I will not have student loans if I apply and do not get waitlisted for this program. However, if I do not get in, the only other option near me is 27k a year for two years before grants or scholarships, less money than a bachelor's and master's but still money. I recently had my first ever ER visit and discovered just how much I panic with IV's and the thought of working with them frequently as an X-ray tech worries me because if I cannot get over my feelings with them, I will make my patients feel scared or uneasy. I want to be trustworthy and make them feel welcome. I have also always been queasy in medical situations but maybe I am delusional to think that would go away if I was exposed to them more.

  
Radiography is a skilled profession that I have pretty much only basic knowledge of what happens. Therapy is yes. another very skilled profession, and there are some aspects of the type of person it takes to be a good therapist that I have been told my whole life I have. I was always told to pick a career doing something you are good at and by far my entire life the most outstanding qualities about myself that people tell me are relating to this profession. I do think it is the one thing about myself I truly feel confident enough in. I want to help others badly, and I do not want to end up in a career I can't do well considering others will be in my care. Their comfort is most important to me and I just am trying to evaluate who I am and what my limits are in order to provide this care for them. 

  
Please, any advice or stories are so appreciated. You may also ask any questions. Thank you. ",Born-Orange-9627,1,1.0,5,1756078566,2025-08-24 23:36:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mzb3vc/need_an_opinion_on_if_i_should_change_my/,8,2025
1mzaw56,"Store manager - laid off, looking to get out of CS","I was in retail for 25 years, 17 in management and 6.5 of that as a store manager. Laid off in an absolutely brutal job market and I am struggling to find something else. I have a PT job lined up just to supplement the severance, but I can't do that long term. I really want to get out of customer service (or at least where it's not the primary function) and I have the feeling I might be stuck with it for another several years.

I have a ton of transferable skills, but where I'm getting stuck is that so many of the positions posted require some kind of certification or a very specific kind of experience. Human resources, supply chain, etc - things that I've done and would have a leg up on learning, but not meeting the requirements is probably blocking my resume from getting past the first stage reviews.

I'm almost 50, and I am well aware ageism is a factor, so I've adjusted my resume to only reflect the 17+ years of management instead of 25 years total. I also don't have a degree, nor do I drive, which ramps up the difficulty.

1mza89e,i feel like a lost lamb. just what am i supposed to do??,"context: i'm a 19 y/o starting uni next month for biomed.

this is a course i had no desire of pursuing but I didn't meet my offer for law for university (england).

i've been thinking that i want to do law since i was in year 10 (so around the age of 14). but i keep trying and trying and somehow though my practice exam papers come out with A/A*, my results in the real world are far below it. i lost my law offer on results day and in my haste, i abandoned the idea of doing law since it's a career that heavily relies its progression on grades and uni prestige. 

i looked at other courses but the university was either across the country + i felt suffocated just thinking about that course (it was a course aimed for a career in healthcare).

i thought about what i wanted to do and what my options were with my grades and the subjects i did. but i just kept hitting dead ends. either i didn't meet the subject requirement. or the course was full. or my grade wasn't high enough. i just felt lost.

so i ended up doing biomed. this brings me to my next point. alongside law, medicine was also an interest of mine but i didn't do the required subjects so couldn't apply for it undergrad. so i'm now doing biomed in hopes of getting into graduate entry medicine but a part of me can't help but think if i'm throwing away 3 years of my life for a useless degree.

i don't know what to do. i see my peers and they all somewhat of an idea for what they want to and a few are already into the workforce already through apprenticeships. i feel like such a failure compared to them honestly.

i don't know what to expect of myself anymore. i keep working hard and i just never yield the results. at this point, i'm just believing that god has a plan but, i, as the person who has to take the action, have no idea what to do about my future.

do i want do medicine? why?
do i want to do law? why?

i've considered accounting since i've heard it's a stable career but i just don't know anymore.

i feel like a spread out bat who has a leg in one place, head in another and wing in another.

i'm also, to an extent, dissociative with my reality so i don't know what i truly have passion for. i have no goal in life at the moment. graduate entry medicine is kind of a goal but i feel so behind everyone. i just don't know what to do anymore.",blueishsky00,2,1.0,2,1756076292,2025-08-24 22:58:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mza89e/i_feel_like_a_lost_lamb_just_what_am_i_supposed/,8,2025

1mz8bnw,This job is draining me of my whimsy.,"So I'm 21m and I've been in this same food service job as a service manager since I was 19. I've grown to be absolutely miserable there. The shift hours aren't terrible, typically I work 3-11pm, but between call-outs, short staffing, how busy we get and how much work the morning shift typically leaves for us, it makes the shift 10x harder than it should be. Most nights we don't leave until 11:30pm, upwards of 1am. My general manager knows about these problems but becomes defensive if you try to talk to her about them, her and I have gotten into heated discussions about why night shifts don't run the way they could if I was left in a good enough spot to run it properly. They rely on me to handle most of the shift change work like counting drawers when I get there, and most nights I have to prep more food because we'll run out as the day goes by even if all the food should be prepped in the morning. There is always some kind of drama happening, I do my best to stay out of it but even my GM will be comfortable enough to gossip to me about whatever it is that week. I've been screamed at, left to handle everything on my own from paperwork to training (even both at the same time in some cases), not given breaks if I am the only manager on shift (There needs to be one on the floor at all times), I've cried countless times on shifts because of stress and gone right back to work, and I feel this has given me a reputation of being overly sensitive and I've been told before that I cry because 'I'm not getting my way'. My GM will slam my phone with calls of more things she needs me to do on top of all my other responsibilities.

I'm transgender, and even in the past 2.5 years my GM and some coworkers still uses the wrong pronouns even if the company preaches acceptance. Most of the time I just sigh and move on, because It's not worth my energy anymore. Most of the time I am exhausted and stressed, just waiting for my next shift and not enjoying my life outside of work. I'm a creative, my goal is to become an author, comic writer and tattoo artist, and I find no joy in those things and have little to no energy to put toward them because of this job. I'm miserable at home, noticeably unhappy and on edge because I feel like I've forgotten how to relax. I quit this job before, back in October 2024 with another job lined up. It didn't work out, and I found myself missing the people I worked with at this job and needed money, so I ended up coming back a month later. I don't regret that decision, mostly because I get paid well and I've met my now partner through it. But I need to decide if the money is worth my mental health. 

I'm on a week paid vacation right now just to let myself breathe and relax, but it's been in the back of my mind this entire week that I'll have to go back. I had another job interview at a college during this week that I think went really well, I'm very qualified for it, but they told me It'd be about a week before I heard back from them. I'm supposed to go back tomorrow, but it makes me anxious to think about going back, and it makes me anxious to think about not going back. Financially, I'd be okay on my bills for about 3 months, but I have been trying to save for a new car before February (Rusted frame, it won't pass inspection). 3 months would be worse case scenario, I'm not trying to be out of work that long and besides the interview I had I've had a few other offers. I've just been trying to decide what would be best for me. I still live at home, and my mom keeps telling me I should go back for closure and until I know for sure about that other job, but I also find her judgement questionable. My partner tells me to listen to what my heart wants and he'll support me no matter what, but every time I think about not going back I get super anxious, mostly about money.

I need an advice and a bit of guidance from you people , I am a SAP Consultant holding 5years of experience and I have currently resigned from my current organisation after working for 10months as I have got a better opportunity else where.

Now I having a self doubt of labling myself as a job hopper. I don't know whether I have done this correct or not ( I'm thinking out of ethics as I haven't completed a yea.r so far). But in my previous employment I was there in the organisation for 3years. Now I got a good opportunity financially and better working environment as per outsiders review.

My current manager doesn't want me to leave but he can't even meet the offer that I got and even can't make sure that my pain points will be looked after.

1mz6rpy,"Resigned due to family emergency, but company wants full 2-month notice. What can I do?","I joined a new company as a Frontend Developer about four months ago and had relocated to Bangalore since it’s a full-time office role. Recently, my mom’s health took a bad turn, so I had to come back to my hometown to take care of her. The doctors have advised strict bed rest for the next few months, and she really wants me to stay with her during this time. Honestly, she wasn’t comfortable with me relocating in the first place.

I did think about requesting WFH, but with everything that’s going on at home, I don’t think I’ll be able to focus properly on work. So after thinking it through, I decided to resign and sent a mail explaining the situation and asking to be relieved immediately, since I won’t be able to continue working.

My manager gave me a call and said I need to serve a 2-month notice period. That really surprised me because I thought I was still in the 6-month probation period, where the notice is just 1 month (or 1-month salary buyout). He mentioned that my probation has already been cleared and I’m now a confirmed employee, so the 2-month notice applies.

1mz6mek,I have quitted without a new job and I am spiraling,"I 29F worked in this company for over a year. I live in Europe, and in the country I live in, fixed term employment contracts cannot be terminated unilaterally. I had 2 fixed term contracts, and was being offered to sign the 3rd fixed term one for 12 months.

The company was a sinking ship: Multiple rounds of layoffs, people quitting everyday, no new hires, lots of extra jobs. In the last year, my team went from 15 people to 5 people. I was hired to replace someone, then took over 2 more people's work after they left. These people had a higher salary than me. So I talked to my manager to have that title in my new contract, and she fully supported me. However, in our company, these decisions are exclusively approved by the CEO. This has been going on for months, with him not responding. 

During this period, HR has been pushing me to sign with the same terms (without increased title/salary) and I have been rejecting it. Because I would be signing for 12 more months and would not have the right to terminate. 

At the same time, 3 more people have left the job and their tasks were also assigned to me. However, these tasks were completely out of my expertise and my previous role. I asked them whether they would hire anyone to help, and the answer was no. I then reminded my updated contract, as these 3 people also had that title that I want to have, and probably salaries way higher than mine.


This has been dragged until the last day of my employment agreement. Meanwhile, I was already doing these people's work and was feeling miserable everyday with this increased  workload. On the last day of my previous contract (which was last Friday) at 4 pm my manager calls me and tells me that the CEO does not approve me having that title, but they can make me a senior in my current title, and give me 10% salary increase. This was completely unexpected, and the reasons for not giving me that title was nonsense. They asked me to sign immediately in 15 minutes.

If I had signed, I would be stuck for another 12 months. If I had found a better opportunity, I would have to come to a settlement agreement with my current employer, and in the past they rejected similar requests from other people and forced them to work until the end of their fixed term contracts.

I was feeling miserable in the job everyday, and a senior title and 10% increase was not going to make it any better for me. I did not want to commit to working in that shitty company for another 12 months. Since I did not sign in 15 minutes, they cut off my access immediately.

I have been going through lots of emotions. A part of me is so relieved because last 3-4 months of the year are the busiest and most chaotic months. I was going to be forced to do 5-6 people's jobs and was going to be unhappy everyday. So I have a sense of freedom and relief now.

On the other hand, I don't have anything lined up and I am an immigrant in this country. I am on a partnership visa and have an extremely supportive and loving partner. However, as an immigrant, it may realistically take 3-6 months for me to have a new job. We have my partner's income which is enough for all necessities like rent, utilities, groceries. I personally have money saved up that I can live with for one year. However, I feel bad about not having an income and maybe have a gap in my resume for maybe 6 months or longer.

I have a call with my (now previous) manager tomorrow as she wanted to give me support and offer referrals. She was frustrated and disappointed that the CEO did not approve what I deserved, and gave me less. But she had no power. I also have a job interview on Wednesday.

I really did not want to lose other opportunities for this job where I have no future at. However, I have already been applying to jobs in the last few months with not much luck. This interview I will have came through a referral. It may or may not work out, but I really want to have a job that does not make me as miserable as my previous job did. 

My brain does not stop with anxious thoughts and regret. The salary they offered was still pretty nice (although not as high as I deserve) and the work was fully remote. But I was working from 9 to at least 6-7 with constant stress, firedrills, and a new mess everyday. I am thinking if I could have just said yes, take the increased salary, be careless and keep going until I find a good job, then try to convince them for my exit. But it was seriously so hard to even apply for jobs under those conditions.

1mz563w,Is this a red flag for HR/background check?,"Hey,

I intend to send this note to HR, as I’ve just received an offer before we proceed to the background check. I want to be transparent, but I’m concerned about how it might come across (or if they think I'm bullshitting). Here’s my draft for your thoughts:


.... 
One three-month assignment on my CV—supporting another XXXX member firm in the Middle East—is subject to a strict non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for a transaction that is not yet public. To comply with my legal obligations, I cannot authorize third-party outreach (to the client, that XXXX member firm, or others) until the transaction is announced.

For your HR’s internal review, I propose we proceed on a documents-only basis for this specific three-month entry. I can readily provide neutral, supporting evidence such as my employment visa, residency permit, and work permit, with any details redacted that would be considered confidential under the terms of my NDA.

Once the transaction is public [though it may never went public if the deal fails], or if I am granted written consent [I'll try to get one but I don't think they'll ever allow me before it went public], I can immediately authorize a dates-of-employment confirmation with the member firm. All other roles in my four-year career, including my primary employer YYYY, are fully and immediately verifiable. I am happy to follow your standard process and agree on a compliant path forward.

Please find attached my updated CV, which is redacted to comply with my NDA and supersedes any prior versions.

1mz3zeb,Am I being used or just entitled?,"Hey everyone. I’m just looking for some honest feedback because I’m new to the full-time working world and I’m trying to figure out if how I’m feeling is fair—or if I’m just expecting too much.

I’m 18F and I’ve been working full-time at this job for about 8 months now. Since I started, I’ve taken on a lot of responsibility. I train new employees, help with processing, deep cleaning, checking out customers during busy rushes, loading cars with heavy purchases, you name it, open and close the store, stay late , come in early, etc. And while I don’t mind staying busy—actually, I prefer it—it’s starting to feel like I’m carrying way more than I’m being compensated for.

I make $13/hour. I have no benefits: no insurance, no PTO, no sick days, no vacation time, no tuition reimbursement, no workers comp, not even real employee perks—just a so-called “employee discount” that honestly barely qualifies as one.

Meanwhile, I watch coworkers—older guys, making more than me—spend their shifts on their phones, listening to music, talking to babygirls, and putting in half the effort I do. It’s frustrating. I’m literally an 18-year-old girl with scoliosis doing all the heavy lifting, while they barely move. I don’t mind working hard, but it feels like I’m being taken advantage of.

My boss tells how much he appreciates me and sees potential in me. And I do like him. I believe in the vision of the company (it’s still young, only a few years old), and I could see myself growing with it long-term and eventually making bank! He’s even talked about wanting to step away eventually and has encouraged me to take initiative. That part honestly excites me—I want to grow in a company, I want to build something meaningful. But then I look at my paycheck and my lack of benefits and I start to feel… used. And I see what my boss grosses, and like holy shit. Like wtf? He’s rolling in it. 🤑💰

I a huge part of me sees potential here, and I do believe I could move up and succeed. But at the same time, I’m struggling to justify the workload and stress for such low pay and zero support. I could go work at a place like Chipotle, make more per hour starting, and get insurance, paid time off, tuition help, and all the basics that I feel any full-time employee should be getting.

And not that I’m looking into leaving necessarily, but I’d be stupid not to wonder if the grass is greener on the other side. Humans should never really ever be “satisfied”. It’s just human nature unfortunately. My parents just say “there are plenty of people older than you making half that you are making, working outside, and that have a heavier work load, be glad that you have a job.” And I’m very grateful, just curious I guess. It feels weird that I don’t even get pto. I have no criminal history, great references, and good work history.

I’m fine with sticking it out somewhere that has long-term potential, even if the short-term situation isn’t ideal but I don’t want to be taken advantage of.

So I guess my question is: are my concerns valid? Is it fair to expect more at this stage, or should I just accept that this is how things go when you’re starting out? I don’t want to come off as entitled or ungrateful, but I also don’t want to settle for less than I deserve.

Long term I want to move into a revenue-generating role such as sales and trading or brokerage.

1mz2knr,Is it career sabotage to go from Director to Executive Assistant?,"Hi all! I recently left my job as a Director of a grant at a small private institution of higher education. I’ve been job searching for a number of months with a handful of interviews here and there. Not feeling desperate at this point but I was recently offered a job as an executive assistant at a large state university. It pays about $7k more per year than my former director role and seems like a good place to work for a variety of reasons. I am very tempted to take it because I live in a HCOL area and the extra pay would be very helpful.

For context, I’ve applied for positions that would be anywhere from a slight pay cut from my Director pay to a $25k raise, but the only ones I’ve been given interviews for are either slight pay cuts or slight raises. This Executive Assistant role is the best offer I’ve gotten yet in terms of pay and benefits.

Helpful additional context: I do not have huge career ambitions and don’t desire to climb some corporate ladder. I only want pay that aligns with my lifestyle, generous time off, and a relatively low stress job. My main concern is how this potential new role would look on a resume for jobs down the line. I don’t want to ruin future opportunities by accepting a “lower” role in the eyes of hiring managers (even though I don’t view it that way).

Im M(21) recently completed my BCA (2025 batch) and I’m at a major crossroad in my career. I wrote PGCET and scored a rank around 500, which means I have options for some of the best colleges like MSRIT, BMS, Christ, and others.

Here’s my confusion:
	•	I want to build a career as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist.
	•	I’m considering a Master’s degree an MBA with IT or Business Analytics specialization so I can stay in the tech field while adding a business edge.
	•	But the fear is real: even with a master’s, placements are not guaranteed, and I don’t want to end up spending 2 years and then still have to start grinding from scratch.

On the other hand, I’m looking at industry-focused courses (like data analytics, data science, or business analytics programs) where you can learn from home, work on projects, and even get placement opportunities if you perform well.

So, my question to you all is:
	•	Should I go for a college program and bank on the brand name + exposure?
	•	Or should I invest in a solid online/industry course that helps me build real skills and a portfolio while applying for jobs?
	•	Has anyone here taken a similar path and can share how it worked out for you?

Any advice, insights, or even personal stories would really help me make a confident decision.

Thanks in advance! 🙏

Take the Offer If: ✅ You need financial stability immediately ✅ You want structured learning environment ✅ You're okay with gradual career progression ✅ You value job security over high risk-reward

Consider Alternatives If: ❌ You're highly entrepreneurial ❌ You need immediate high compensation ❌ You can't handle corporate bureaucracy ❌ You have better startup/product company offers

# 🔥 FINAL REALITY CHECK

This role is perfect for: Steady career builders, risk-averse personalities, people from tier-2/3 cities seeking metro exposure

This role isn't ideal for: High achievers seeking rapid growth, creative types, those wanting immediate high compensation

Bottom Line: It's a marathon, not a sprint. Use it as a launching pad, not a destination.

1myxiww,"I keep getting rejected for being ""overqualified""","Hey everyone,

I could really use some advice because I'm running into an unusual problem that is making it difficult for me to find a job. For context, I went to school and studied computer science and mathematics, and got a bachelor's degree in both. After graduating, I initially had a resume which listed my degrees along with research, publications, RA/TA experience, and personal projects. 

I was applying to jobs in my area, pretty much trying to find anything I could. I wasn't looking for anything fancy because applying for high-paying white collar jobs is too much of a headache and I just wanted to pay my bills. So, I applied to warehouses, gas stations, retail jobs, and other similar positions. After getting nothing but rejection, I did a little research and read that sometimes it's possible to be ""overqualified"" for a job.

After learning this, I removed most of my college-related stuff from my resume and simplified it a lot. I removed my computer science degree so it looked like I only got a degree in math, and I briefly listed my small amount of work experience, which was some paid TA and RA work at my university along with driving Uber on the side.

After doing this, I was actually getting responses from people and I had a few interviews lined up. I managed to get a job at Domino's, but it wasn't really working out for me because I was making the minimum wage of $7.50/hr and struggling to pay all my bills. I was looking for something that paid a little more. Eventually I got to the interviewing stage with a couple other companies.

The first was this factory about 20 mins away from my home that paid $19/hr and was full-time. I really wanted this job because the job description made it sound super fun. I would've gotten to do measurements and operate equipment all day and it seemed like a really cool, hands-on job. But when I got to the interview, they started grilling me about my math degree and said something like ""I bet you're just looking for a temporary job until you find something in your field."" I told them it wasn't true and I just studied math for fun but it seemed like they didn't believe me or something? They even told me at the end of the interview that if I could get a degree in math I wouldn't have any difficulty doing this job. I took this as a positive sign, but the next week they still rejected me.

The second was this part-time job at a farm nearby that paid $16/hr. I also really wanted this job because I like being outside and doing hands-on work. But when I got on the phone with them, they did the same thing and started grilling me about my math degree, and seemed really suspicious about why I'd be applying for their job. The day after the phone interview, I got rejected again.

Anyway, a similar thing happened to me a couple other times too for jobs I didn't care about as much. It seems like I'm in a bit of a dilemma. I only have a few options:

1. Be honest about the fact that I went to college when applying for entry-level jobs. This has not been working for me so far.

2. Apply for jobs I'm actually qualified for. I've tried doing this a little bit when I was applying for internships in college, and it's basically a dead-end too. I applied for literally over 100 and got nothing but rejections.

3. Lie about ever having gone to college. Then, I have nothing to show on my resume since I have very little work experience, and there's nothing on my resume to make me stand out.

So what should I do? It seems like I'm screwed no matter what. I'm living in my parents' basement right now and I'm trying to move to a new state and find work, since we live in a small town with few employment opportunities.

Any advice you have, I would really appreciate. Thank for you reading.",not_a_swedish_vegan,0,0.5,5,1756046876,2025-08-24 14:47:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1myxiww/i_keep_getting_rejected_for_being_overqualified/,8,2025

Also, I am someone who is willing to self fund training and/or move to new city or even abroad. But my creative thinking is just held back by procrastinating fear.

Some sort of questions that are running through my head that any feedback to help my train of thought would be welcome/appreciated:

1) if you had a complete change, what made you decide to go for it and pick what you are doing now? Was it fuelled by money earning potential / job satisfaction / travel opportunities etc??? 

2) what did you do before and now?

3) what age/stage in your career were you at?

4) what was your process that helped you decide on taking the plunge your new career path? Research ideas? 

5) Did it work out positively or on reflection any regrets? I.e stick with what you know Vs taking a chance on being more positive in a new role/Industry

1myt8cv,Companies and corporations don't care about you. Please put your health and well-being before them.,"I've never understood why people skip their break or lunch to work more. I understand you want the promotion, but no promotion is worth your health and well-being. Take your breaks, eat your lunch, and do your job well. When you're not at work... then you're not at work. You don't have to answer your phone or talk to anyone (unless that was a clear and explicit agreement before you took the job).

Companies and corporations don't care about you. They only care about what you do, and how much you can do. They will work you to the bone if you let them. They will replace you in a second. You are more valuable than them, so there's nothing wrong with resigning or putting in your 2 weeks' notice to find a job with better pay (and treatment). And if that job turns out to do the same thing, rinse and repeat. Ignore them if they try to make you do more than what you agreed to.

You are not a hard worker if you start working before your shift and continue after it ends. You are not a hard worker if you work during your lunch time. You are not a hard worker if you work during your break. You are not a hard worker if you go to work on your days off because they asked you to. You are not a hard worker if you work from home outside your work hours because they asked you to. All this does is make you a complete fool.

But let's be honest, 80% of the people (reading this) will agree with every word, and then they'll go back to doing the same things they always do (the examples I just mentioned above).

And what about those who won't agree? The only reason they would object is that they're trying to ease their conscience and find justifications for what they're doing for the sake of a company or an institution that doesn't even care about their existence.

Or worse, they actually think these companies care.

Your physical and mental health are important, always put them before your work.

1mystaa,"I like my job, but I often feel underwhelmed. Should I start a side hustle?","After completing my PhD in electrical engineering, I found a research position in industry that, at least on paper, suits me perfectly. I like my job and my manager, I feel appreciated at work, I get to do interesting projects, the salary is decent, and I’ve received raises in both years since I started.

The downside is that it’s a large organization where things often move painfully slowly. I live in Europe, where job security is extremely high, almost no one ever gets fired from our company. On one hand that feeling of safety is good, but on the other hand, it creates a culture of complacency.

My workload fluctuates. Sometimes I’m busy and work a full 40 hours (or more). Other times, I can get through the week with just 5–10 hours of truly effective work. Even when I want to do more, I can’t move faster than the organization allows, I’m dependent on other people and internal processes.

The obvious suggestion might be to switch to a smaller company or a startup, but in my highly specialized field, such opportunities are rare here. Moving abroad isn’t an option either due to family reasons.

I’m in my early 30s, with a lot of energy and motivation to work and advance in my career. But staying where I am feels like slow growth. So, what should I do with my spare time and energy?

1mys9ra,How do smaller companies handle job evaluation without expensive consultants?,"I’ve been digging into how companies handle **job evaluation** — the process of assessing roles by impact, knowledge, decision-making authority, etc.

At large enterprises, it’s usually handled with structured frameworks from firms like Mercer or Hay. But these are **really expensive** and often out of reach for smaller companies.

So I’m curious:

* For SMEs or startups, what’s the *real-world* approach to job evaluation?
* Do most just set salaries based on market searches (Glassdoor, LinkedIn, etc.)?
* Or do some still try to create structured frameworks in-house?
* At what stage (10 employees, 100 employees, 500 employees?) do companies start taking job evaluation seriously?

I worked for a year and then I left that job in 2022 to pursue masters in Mathematics with computer application, but I think it was a mistake because I pursued my masters from a 3rd tier college in India where they did not even consider any placements. I recently graduated from that college and now work as a backend developer with a bare minimum salary. I want to pursue a career in either game development or AI/ML and I don't know which one to choose. I am searching for some European university that have these courses. The reason for the confusion is that for game development masters some universities need a portfolio, and I don't have that currently, for AI/ML I think everyone's taking up AI/ML as it is a booming field, but I am afraid it might just end being another saturated field like software development in the upcoming years. I would love to hear everyone's thoughts and advice about it.  
I am feeling a bit stuck.

Also is it too late for me to pursue master's degree? By the time I get admission into a university I'll be 27.",venom110299,3,1.0,1,1756031565,2025-08-24 10:32:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mys60w/i_am_confused_between_aiml_and_game_development/,8,2025

1myrnbt,HR Professional With Self-Taught Tech Skills — Where Should I Focus Next?,"**TL;DR:**  
I’m turning 40, currently in HR but have carved out a niche doing data/automation/reporting work. I’ve learned Python, SQL, Power Query, and Power Automate on my own to solve problems, but I’m not formally trained. I want to spend the next 25–30 years becoming more technical — ideally moving toward data/automation/software development while still leveraging my HR background. What skills, tools, or learning path would you recommend to make me stronger both in HR and outside of it?

**Posting in both** r/careeradvice **and** r/careerchange**, since I think it applies to both. I’d love advice on what I should focus on over the next couple of years. This is a long one, but I hope some of you stick with it and share your thoughts.**

**Context**

I studied Business Management and I’m turning 40 soon. Most of my career has been in Human Resources, with some time in customer service earlier on.

HR has been tough to move up in. I’ve mostly worked as a generalist, usually brought in to balance out team skills. I’m analytical and good with numbers/tech, but also strong with people. I try to do right by both employees and the company, which has earned me trust and good results.

That said, I’m often “boxed in” to the technical side of HR — reporting, data management, automation, etc. I don’t dislike this; in fact, I enjoy it more than some other HR work. But I’ve realized that this specialization might also be my opportunity to pivot.

**The Problem**

HR departments *say* they want better use of data, automation, and tech… but rarely invest properly in it. When I build solutions that save significant time, leadership often minimizes the impact (“Oh, it’s just a report”), forgetting the manual effort it used to take.

I’m usually the only one in a region doing this kind of work, juggling both tech and general HR tasks. Bigger companies may have dedicated teams for this, but my experience has been more improvised.

The issue is that I’ve learned everything empirically and out of necessity. For example:

* Power Query for reports
* Power Automate for workflows
* If licenses are missing, I’ll script something in Python and schedule it with Task Scheduler

This gets the job done, but I know there are more robust ways. I’m more technical than most HR peers, but nowhere near IT or data professionals.

**What I Want**

I want to dedicate the next 25–30 years of my career to becoming a true subject matter expert in the technical side of work — automation, data, and problem-solving. I like creating solutions and making processes better.

I see two possible paths:

1. Stay in HR, but focus on being the rare professional with deep technical and HR expertise (though I’m not sure HR as a field values this yet).
2. Transition into a more technical field (data analysis, IT, or building solutions for businesses).

To prepare, I want to build a tech stack that improves my current HR processes and also gives me transferable skills. My most frequent challenges are:

* Gathering data from multiple people/sources → unified reports (e.g., performance reviews, comp reviews, employee surveys)
* Dashboard creation and data analysis (especially with salary data, where HR lacks expertise compared to Finance/IT)
* Integrations between HR systems

**My Current Plan**

* Take Harvard’s **CS50** online course to strengthen my fundamentals.
* Keep practicing with **Python** (I can solve problems, but I don’t think like a developer yet).
* Refresh my **SQL** knowledge.

**My Ask**

For those of you in tech, data, or software development:

* What else should I add to my learning path?
* Which skills/tools would best complement Python + SQL for someone in my position?
* How would you structure a learning plan if you were in my shoes?

Ultimately, I want to become more technical and versatile — whether that keeps me in HR or opens doors elsewhere.",ZMCoast,1,1.0,3,1756029707,2025-08-24 10:01:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1myrnbt/hr_professional_with_selftaught_tech_skills_where/,8,2025

1myn1h4,1 week notice vs 2 week notice,"I've  been at a grocery store for about 3 months and I’m about to resign. I already have another job lined up that starts the day after my last scheduled shift, which is one week from now.

I know 2 weeks’ notice is the standard. I hated this job, but management has been mostly fair, so I’d rather not leave on bad terms. The problem is, I already told my new job I could start next week, and I don’t want to backtrack and make a bad first impression.

On top of that, my sister works at the same grocery store and she’s worried they’ll give her grief if I don’t give 2 weeks’ notice. Plus, my department is the most understaffed in the store. They just hired two new people, but once I’m gone it’ll basically be three kids who don’t know the job yet, and my manager hates training.

So what’s the smarter move?

Stick with 1 week’s notice, risk leaving my old job on bad terms, but start the new one smoothly?

Or give 2 weeks’ notice, risk starting off wrong with the new job that I really need to work out?


TL;DR: New job starts in a week, but 2 weeks’ notice is standard. Should I risk leaving my grocery job on bad terms with only 1 week’s notice, or risk making a bad impression on the new job by asking for a later start?

1mymzrn,Top 6 apps for anyone starting a new job,"Hey r/careeradvice,

I started a new job six months ago and wow… nobody warned me how chaotic those first few weeks would be 😅. Between onboarding, learning new systems, meeting a ton of people, and trying not to look completely clueless, I felt extremely overwhelmed.

I found a few apps along the way that made the transition so much smoother. These are not the obvious ones like Slack or Google Calendar. They are underrated tools that now I use daily to stay organized and productive.

If you’re starting a new job soon, a few of these might save you a lot of stress.

# 1. ContactsMate

First week on the job, you'll get slammed with introductions: team members, cross-department managers, vendors, clients. When I joined, my inbox was full of names and numbers I couldn’t keep track of. I used to literally screenshotting business cards, saving numbers randomly, and losing half of them.

[ContactsMate](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/contactsmate/id1236603338?mt=12) fixes that. It combines everything into one clean, organized dashboard. It syncs contacts from Google, Outlook, iCloud, LinkedIn, and even Twitter. It automatically spotted duplicates, let you merge them, and helps tag people by department or project.

|**Feature**|**How I Used It**|
|:-|:-|
|**Sync From Everywhere**|Pulled contacts from Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, and LinkedIn into one place.|
|**Duplicate Finder**|Cleaned up multiple entries automatically.|
|**Groups and Tags**|Created groups like “Team Leads” and “Clients” for quick access.|
|**Smart Search**|Found people instantly without digging through old emails.|
|**Backup and Export**|Exported my full contacts list to CSV for safekeeping.|

# 2. Notion

Most companies share a lot of documents, policies, and training resources when you start. It is easy to lose track of them. I used Notion to create a private dashboard where I stored everything in one place.

I organized policies, process notes, meeting takeaways, and tool instructions. Notion lets you set up pages, link documents, embed files, and use templates to speed up setup.

|**Feature**|**How I Used It**|
|:-|:-|
|**Pages & Databases**|Built a personal onboarding dashboard.|
|**Templates**|Used ready-made onboarding templates to save setup time.|
|**Linked Notes**|Connected related files like briefs, reports, and timelines.|
|**Team Sharing**|Shared selected pages with teammates when needed.|
|**Cross-Device Sync**|Took notes on my laptop and reviewed them later on my phone.|

# 3. Clockify

In a new role, you'll not even realize where your time is going. Between emails, training sessions, and meetings, I often wondered why I couldn’t finish tasks on time. Clockify helped me see exactly how I was spending my hours.

Within the 1st week, I realized nearly 40% of my time was going into meetings. That insight helped me adjust my schedule, cut back on unnecessary calls, and focus more on real work.

|**Feature**|**How I Used It**|
|:-|:-|
|**Automatic Timer**|Tracked how long each onboarding task took.|
|**Project Categories**|Grouped time spent on different projects.|
|**Reports**|Spotted where I was wasting too much time.|
|**Reminders**|Received pings when I forgot to start or stop tracking.|
|**Cross-Platform**|Tracked hours on both desktop and mobile.|

# 4. Loom

During onboarding, people explain a lot of processes, but it is impossible to remember everything. Loom lets you record your screen, along with audio and camera, so you can replay instructions whenever you need.

My manager used Loom to record a CRM walkthrough, which saved me from asking the same questions multiple times. I also recorded my own solutions to common tasks and shared them with another new hire later. It saved both of us time.

|**Feature**|**How I Used It**|
|:-|:-|
|**Screen Recording**|Captured tutorials to watch later.|
|**Shareable Links**|Sent quick video links instead of writing long emails.|
|**Cam + Screen**|Recorded short introductions for remote teammates.|
|**Video Library**|Built a personal library of onboarding videos.|
|**Transcriptions**|Searched inside video transcripts quickly.|

# 5. BrainFM

If you are working remotely or in an open office, staying focused during your first few weeks will be very difficult due to high workload. BrainFM uses sound designed to improve focus, and for me, it worked better than regular playlists.

I used it during deep work sessions and while preparing reports. It also has relaxation and sleep modes, which helped me recover after long onboarding days.

|**Feature**|**How I Used It**|
|:-|:-|
|**Focus Mode**|Helped me concentrate on detailed onboarding tasks.|
|**Different Sessions**|Switched to Relax mode during short breaks.|
|**Offline Playback**|Downloaded tracks for travel.|
|**Sleep Mode**|Used it to wind down after hectic workdays.|
|**Science-Backed Audio**|Helped me stay in deep focus without distractions.|

# 6. CleanShot X

You’d think screenshots are simple, but at work? Nope. Suddenly you’re capturing error messages, reporting bugs, sharing feedback. CleanShot X made it painless.

|**Feature**|**How I Used It**|
|:-|:-|
|**Scrolling Capture**|Took full-page screenshots of dashboards.|
|**Annotations**|Marked up bugs before sending them to devs.|
|**Instant Share Links**|Sent one-click links to screenshots in Slack.|
|**Screen Recording**|Recorded tutorials for new hires joining after me.|
|**Cloud Storage**|Kept everything organized in one place.|

If you’re about to start a new role, I’d recommend trying at least one or two of these. Even just ContactsMate + Notion will save you hours of chaos.

1mymb7k,Not sure what to do from here,"I'm leaving for Guatemala in a week and I'll be there for 2.5 months. It's been my dream to live in a Spanish-speaking environment for several years now and I'm finally doing it. I was planning to go back to school in January; however, I'm doubting if I actually want to do that.

My other idea is to go to Puerto Rico for the month of December (I will still have enough money to do this and the reason for this is because I hate the cold and I want to visit it anyway some day) and then when I get home find a job and save up until the end of September. I should have $16k USD by then.

With that money I would bike from northern Argentina to southern Argentina. That would take about 3 months, so it would be early January. I would have at least $10k unless either my economy (American) or the Argentine economy goes to absolute shit. After that I would go to Brazil for 3 months and potentially do an immersion school (depending on how much they cost) and maybe go to Mexico or Peru for one month before returning to the US and starting school again in May 2027 (I will have just turned 23 at that point).

However obviously this is not helping me career-wise at all. I'll be 23 and still only have one year of college under my belt. The reasons I would do it anyway is because YOLO (bad reason I know) and because once I commit to college or trade school or whatever, other than potentially studying abroad for a semester or two, I'll likely never be able to do this sort of thing again. Of course I'll be able to go on 1-2 week vacations, but I have no idea if I'll ever be able to find a job that would allow me to take off 3 months at a time (unpaid of course). Teaching is the only job I can think of, but I do not want to be a teacher even with that perk.

The other thing is I'm not even sure what to study. I know I'm never going to actually enjoy my job so I just need to pick something that allows me to live as close to the life I want to live as possible, but I really have no idea. My top two ideas right now are nursing and going into the trades, but I don't know if those would be good ideas or not and I can't think of anything else.",joshua0005,1,1.0,0,1756009988,2025-08-24 04:33:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mymb7k/not_sure_what_to_do_from_here/,8,2025

1myl6gt,Should I drop out of my college/change careers or am I psyching myself out?,"I’m a 19 (F) and so far have had a successful time in my local community college’s advanced RN program. By “successful” I mean I have been getting A’s and progressing normally. 

I have been able to hold a part time job while in school this whole time, and have no current living expenses since I live at home. I just won a $2,000 scholarship that will pay for my next semester of classes. 

However, I have been struggling with intense career doubt and mental illness. I am already in therapy (in-person, meeting regularly), taking medication, and doing every other self care task I can possibly handle. I’ve even cut down my work hours just to help my mental health. 

But it seems nothing is working. I’ve been having insomnia, chronic nightmares, anxiety/mood swings, suicidal thoughts, self harm relapses, and more for the past few years. They have only intensified in these past few weeks. 

It would be one thing if these symptoms only occurred before classes, but they continue to persist even in the classes, and after the classes. It’s like I seriously can’t catch a break. 

I am constantly researching other careers for a “back up plan” in case I lose my shit and literally just give up, which I feel closer and closer to every day. I keep trying to tell myself that suicide isn’t the answer, that it’s just a career, but it’s been getting very difficult. 

I don’t think I would hate being a nurse, but the idea of continuing my studies in nursing fills me with existential dread, if that makes sense. I do not enjoy the classes in the slightest. I do not feel like I’m doing the right thing. 

But then again, will I feel like I am “doing the right thing” in literally any other career? My therapist thinks I should look into changing careers, but I just don’t know. 

I feel like if I were to quit nursing today, I would not feel a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. Instead, I would feel a slight sense of “Oh, cool” and then proceed to panic about my future and how different it all will be. 

I’ve also been feeling an intense amount of pressure from my parents to “not even think about” changing careers, and I really am trying. But I feel like I might be at the point where I don’t have a choice, because my brain keeps trying to hurt itself out of stress.

1myj6xf,Should I quit?,"I work two full-time jobs—one in corporate and one in hospitality—not because I want to, but because I genuinely need two incomes to support myself.
I love hospitality and I’m fairly skilled at it, which makes the work come naturally and feel rewarding. But after more than 10 years in the industry, I’ve realized there’s no real upward path for me. Being in my 40s and still working in hospitality feels scary, mostly because of social pressure and the lack of long-term prospects.
I finally got a junior corporate job after a long period of applying. Not having a university degree made it much harder, but I got the job and really enjoyed it for the first year. Now, though, I hate it. My manager has become increasingly absent from the team, and after my failure on one of the projects, I started feeling a growing tension and resentment that no one is addressing. Comments began to feel targeted and emotionally charged. Some emails even exaggerate or misrepresent facts.
I’ve tried many times to improve my performance, but the feedback I get is always generic—more of a “figure it out yourself” approach. This has slowly started affecting my health and mental well-being, to the point where my doctor prescribed a few weeks off work.
So now I’m wondering: am I the problem and just not suited for this kind of work, or is my reaction a reasonable response to poor working conditions?

I’ve been actively searching for Data Scientist / Generative AI Engineer opportunities for the past 3 months, but I’m struggling to get results. Despite:

* Applying to \~50 roles daily (mix of easy apply and long applications)
* Actively networking on LinkedIn and building connections
* Reaching out directly with personalized cold emails/connection requests

…I haven’t seen much progress in terms of interviews or offers.

A bit about my background:

* **4+ years of experience** in Data Science, Analytics, and Generative AI.
* Hands-on expertise in **LLMs, RAG pipelines, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning** with tools like LangChain, Hugging Face, and OpenAI APIs.
* Strong MLOps skills: **FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions CI/CD**.
* Past roles:
   * **Data Scientist @ Simform (current)** – deploying GenAI pipelines, automating CI/CD, building microservices.
   * **Data Analyst @ HCL & BigBasket** – ETL automation, customer segmentation, forecasting, and visualization.
   * **Graduate TA @ FAU** – teaching stats and analytics to 100+ students.
* Projects include a **Healthcare Chatbot (RAG + LangChain)**, **Forecasting models (85% accuracy)**, and **YOLO-based computer vision optimization**.

I’d love to get your advice on:

* How to make networking more effective — beyond just connecting and sending follow-ups.
* Any proven strategies that helped you crack into data science/AI roles recently.
* Recommended resources, communities, or referrals where my skill set could be a fit.

1myh41u,Did I make the right decision accepting this position?,"Hello everyone,   
so I recently graduated in graphic design in December, and I've been really trying to look for a graphic design related job, mostly in web design. I finally got a job offer to be a design assistant for this software company, however I don't know if this was the right choice. You see I don't really do any designing at this job. I just put in the content clients give us into a CMS platform so it can be viewed on the website the company makes for them. I also test the custom website on different browsers and devices and report back any errors to the actual web designers. I do other things but that is mostly what I do. 

I don't hate this job. The people are super nice, there are great benefits, and its a small company that has been growing, but I really wanted a more design focused job. They told me during the interview that this is an entry level position and that I can be promoted to a web designer or another position down the line ( I have a friend that works for the company she told me that they are really good about promoting people internally), however the thing is that the web design position rarely opens. Most of the designers they have have been there for 5 or 10 plus years. The company is growing and they are trying the get a variety of clients in different sectors, and if the company continues to grow then they will need another designer at some point and they would most likely hire me, but I don't want to wait forever you know. 

Also it is important to note that I don't know how to code. I just do stuff in figma and framer, however with my current position they are teaching me how to code which is really nice, and I have exposure to the front end and back end of website building since my position allows me to communicate with both web designers and developers.

1myfv6m,In a tricky spot and would appreciate input on school and changing companies,"Hi All,

Im a director at a biopharma company overall have made big strides in my career the last few years, propelled by my role on a blockbuster product launch (which I leveraged to get a better role and pay at my current company). 

I’ve been at my company for about a year and a half now and I decided to go back to grad school part time for my second masters ((84:5 was an MBA and this will be for a more technical degree that I feel strongly will differentiate me in the future). Even better, I got into an Ivey League and I’m proud of it. 


All that sounds great but the last few months have been rough for my company under this new administration, such that our outlook is new a lot more uncertain. Fortunately I’m pretty good at networking through my business school and have strong internet from another company that is doing really well. The kicker is that the school that I am about to start is on the east coast while the potential new company is on the west coast (I live in the west but commute regularly to the office currently). 

A role just opened up that I’m 90% sure I can have if it want, but I don’t think they’ll be okay with me taking a couple hours in the middle of the day for online class a few time a week. 

Option 1: drop out of the Ivey league school and take th me new job. Between salary and LTI this would mean an ~$80k raise at minimum (TC around 300). also it’s in office 3 days a week

Option 2: ride it out at my current company while going to school. No idea if they will restructure next year but it’s definitely a possibility. TC stays at 220 but it’s remote other than a few days a month that I fly back east for meetings ",KingOfTheQuails,23,0.8999999761581421,9,1755990322,2025-08-23 23:05:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1myfv6m/in_a_tricky_spot_and_would_appreciate_input_on/,8,2025
1myevnf,Manager dismissing my burnout - Advice?,"I started this job May 12th and everything was fine with my schedule until June, when our assistant manager left and one of my coworkers took over making the schedule. Since then I’ve been stuck with the majority of closing shifts & doing most of our daily tasks by myself. For example, last month I closed 16 times, this month I close 14. I don't get 2 consistent days off either. 

I brought it up to my coworker three times, asking for the closing shifts to be split more evenly (it’s just me, her FT, and a part-timer), but nothing changed. So I went to my manager and explained I was getting burnt out. She said she’d “keep an eye on the schedule.”

When the September schedule came out, I was still closing the most. I went back to my manager and she basically said: *“Your coworkers aren’t part of the equation because they have different tasks, we have a new person starting Sept 3rd, and I don’t want to hear about this again.”* The different tasks being: Part timer will be doing our marketing and my other full time coworker does insurance payments - which you can do during closing shifts. This was my only 2nd time approaching her about this.

I texted her today to say I was thinking of taking a week or two off in October because I’m burnt out. She told me that “wouldn’t work” because of the new hire starting, and asked what was going on. I repeated that I’m burnt out from always closing, and she said “we talked about this last week.” Then she asked if there was something else going on, which felt dismissive — like burnout isn’t a valid enough reason, so I repeated myself again.

I asked about November instead and she said she wasn’t sure, just told me to “hang in there.”

At this point I’m starting to hate my job. I feel completely dismissed and disrespected by my manager when I’ve been clear that I’m burnt out, which is what I was trying to avoid by getting the closing shifts divided. I actually loved this job at first and still kind of do, but now I’m seriously questioning if it’s worth staying",MsArtio,2,0.75,10,1755987749,2025-08-23 22:22:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1myevnf/manager_dismissing_my_burnout_advice/,8,2025

1mydug9,How long to stick out a stressful job? And am I stupid to make a risky change?,"(Throwaway account) This will be long. If you read it all, thank you!

Background: I'm fairly young (F nearing 30), and somewhat recently established a surprise career for myself. I've been rising in the ranks at a healthcare company for nearly four years now: started in reception with no experience in healthcare when I just needed a job, then moved into admin, and now I've been a high-level manager for about a year. I have experience with insurance craziness, project management, I get along well with my team and bosses, and for the most part I don't mind the work itself. Sometimes it's even enjoyable.

However, the company is disorganized to say the least. The culture is difficult, overturn is insanely high, and the stress has gotten out of control. I've been backfilling empty roles ever since I started managing (and even before that on occasion), I have several people on my team with performance issues that I'm doing my best to coach them through, and the latest push to contract with an outside company to help with some of our day-to-day operations is not going well (so much so that we're now doing a project that usually takes about a month in less than a week). I'm working 10-12 hour days multiple times a week to try and keep things moving. If it tells you anything, we've gone through at least one fairly large ""restructure"" almost every year I've worked here.

I consider myself capable and committed, with a can-do attitude and general ""show must go on"" vibe (I have an arts background so stress is not necessarily new to me), but I've hit a new level. I'm up at night, I've developed food intolerances that come and go, and my already tense body is in overdrive. My husband is begging me to leave. My therapist has been asking every session if I've found something else yet. My career-faithful parents think it's time. But I'm terrified of losing the stability I have.

I don't make great money, but it's more than I ever thought I'd make (parents have always been low-income so my expectations of ""well-off"" were like $30K before I started this job). I have great, if expensive, health insurance. I work 100% remotely and have decent flexibility. My partner has a solid job for now (local government), so we're comfortable.

The reason I am posting here is: I recently stumbled across what might be a great opportunity for me. In-person job, pays an hourly rate that's equivalent to what I make now. Similar industry, with a bit of a learning curve in terms of specifics, but, hey, I started at zero at my current office, I feel confident that I will pick things up quickly. Smaller, hopefully quieter. They don't offer health insurance, but I can get that through my husband's job. My final interview is next week, and I'm cautiously optimistic. Regardless of if I get an offer for it, I'm trying to apply for things that look like they might be better, slowly but surely.

The question: I know it seems insane to list all these reasons to leave and then ask, but...is it a stupid move to leave? Where do you draw the line? One the one hand, I feel like I'm going crazy, and I've cried multiple times over the past month out of frustration and exhaustion. On the other, they love me, I get great feedback, and I like my coworkers and managers. When times aren't crazy, the work isn't hard. It's just...times are usually crazy. Another layer: I want to have kids soon (in the next two years). My current job would be flexible with that. But will I be able to handle the toll of taking care of an infant and the constant stress of my job? I'm struggling to figure out if any job with less certainty (personalities I don't know, unsure about flexibility/benefits) better at this point?

1my8ma0,is changing from applied microbio to quality control in pharma and food industry even possible?,"I’ve been exploring a career in the pharmaceutical field, but I keep encountering the same things: certificates, ISO training, and GMP courses that all seem to cost hundreds of dollars. I’m not currently in pharma or engineering, but I did some fermentation and production technique classes during my Master’s, so I do have some background in production processes.

From what I’ve read, some of the cheaper online options, like Coursera pharma certificates, don’t seem to carry much weight. That makes me wonder: do I even have a realistic chance of breaking into the field without spending a lot of money (400- 800 per certificate) on stuff that may turn out to be useless to me...

1my7qqo,Considering a career change,"Hey so I've been in a service based industry for 12 years. 

Income will be anywhere from 80-120k take home. 

The work is demanding ish.

I'm in the gym business so largely it's constantly getting and maintaining memberships.

Good thing I can have flexibility with my schedule but there are also many seasons of high stress nonstop grind. 

Even with systems in place when business is good it feels like it's a never ending loop of maintenance. 

Clients, staff, leases. 

Marketing you name it. 

Yes you can outsource marketing but even that turns into a part time job making sure they stay on track. 

Generally I work I'd guess 40-80 hours a week. 

Yes I know that's a big difference. 

I sell high end gym memberships. 250 - 500 dollars a month. So I have experience selling a luxury item in essence. 

I've been considering just getting into a sales career. Utilize my sales skills without supplying the backend of the business as well.

Could also just be moving into a different market. 

I have a highschool degree and I've taken some college classes. 

Is there a career I could move into that would make a similar income within a couple years or is that a pipe dream?

1my61dj,Should I consider a career change?,"Hello,

this is gonna be a long and depressing read but its a last ditch effort as im not in a good place atm/dont have a support system to discuss this with. So thank you if you choose to read and help out.

I started my first full time design job in april, its a corporate marketing job. I was very excited to start but fearful as I only had college part time experience and two years of customer service/social media before starting. I also would have to move to a new city and leave everything/one i know behind. It seemed like a good career move and I would be able to better support my parents as they dont work and we were struggling with my previous job. 

I got hired immediatly after I finished a design assignment for them, they asked me to resign from my job and start two weeks after the first interview. At first I was commuting until I found a place I could afford to stay, I started the job and immediatly got thrown in, no on-boarding. I mentioned that I've never worked as a designer in corporate before and would have some time adjusting. 

Difficulties started in my first week then slowly taken off without any discussions, I would be asked to design ads and print with no directives or briefs. Literally just ""design an ad for this"" I would ask for more clues and would still get nothing so I would just come up with drafts and show the team but I would still never get their approval. In my first two months I've only had my work approved when it didnt involve my boss signing off on it. My boss definitely has a professionalism/attitude problem (Has made a coworker cry multiple times by screaming/barrating them in front of everyone.) And is just generally unpleasant to deal with/ difficult when it comes to design. I would get emails/text that are impossible to decipher for design requests, immediate deadlines (few hours) for a big design project even if the client deadline is a month in advance, never ending revisions, no work/life balance (im expected to always answer emails/texts/design requests at all hours of the day, sometimes weekends and stay longer to finish projects (no overtime). I discussed this with my boss and how it was becoming difficult in the second month of working there and in return got a meeting with hr about my attitude problem. I was asked to stop sending emails to communicate/keep record for projects because it makes people feel bad and that i stop telling them I cant revise work at 12am on a friday becuase its a media job and thats expected of me. I said okay and tried to do what they asked of me as best i can even if i disagreed with it. I finished projects before the deadline, I offered endless revisions, I stayed in the office longer, I always offered multiple options with multiple ideas to pick from. I aligned more with their style preferences (AI slop/objectively bad taste). Still, my boss hates my work and I still feel horrible at this job. There are also some moral/ office enviroment things that make me hate every minute of this job.

  
I never intended to be a graphic designer. I have a BFA in animation because it was the only remotly close major being offered at the college I could get to and I spent most of my time there doing visual art anyway which I enjoyed more, however, fine art/visual art jobs are hard to come by. Especially where I live and especially if I'm not particularly gifted/ skilled or connected. Graphic design is the closest i can get to doing something I enjoy while being able to survive and support my family. At this point in my first job I have lost all motivation, skill, affinity and passion for art. I never pick up a pencil to draw when I dont have to. I've also struggled with mental health issues my entire life but I'm in a particularly horrible period of depression, directionlessness and Isolation atm. I don't know If I can do anything else and quitting this job with no safety net would mean that I would struggle to survive and support my family for a while because I've been trying and interviewing for other jobs but nothing has worked. I genuinly feel like a failure and I'm aware that my work is not good, I never thought my design was my strongest skill but the work I've produced at this job is nothing I ever want to show anyone. I should also mention that I'm still living paycheck to paycheck with this job as it immediatly goes to bills and family.   
I have no purpose in life, no motivation to get out of bed or see people, I've taken almost a week off from work because I couldnt get up in the morning. I dont know if I can continue trying in this industry but I dont know what else to do. 

Last week I walked into HR and discussed ending my contract and was told they'd be sorry to see me go and ""how can we make it better for the next person"" I only need to send an email and give two weeks notice but I dont know if I'm making a horrible life ending mistake.

1my45i5,How do I approach being passed over for promotion to colleagues I have had to takeover work from in the past?,"In a project management role and am early 30's which is quite young in the field. Currently managing one of the largest project in the company. Went for promotion a few months back which had 2 spots going. Have heard nothing back but am hearing down the grapevine that those spots have now been filled (two individuals changed their titles which confirms what I have heard) and everyone else who applied for it got a rejection letter. But I havnt heard anything whatsoever. I did ask last week what was going before I knew what I do now and was told HR have messed up and they will be letting people know in the next few weeks. 

Where my frustration lies is the two colleagues who got the job, I have either had to step in and take over their project after they have run it into the ground, or just outright do their projects (aswell as my own) because they refused to do it. 

1st guy has only been in charge of two projects in the past 3 years, on one, me and another colleague where brought in to help as nothing was being done, second one my own project was dependent on, so again had to step in because they were 3 months late and the stuff didn't work so we had to think of alternatives just to meet our own deadline. 

2nd guy, who is close to retirement, just outright refused to do projects that fell under his jurisdiction, and because I had experience with it, I got lumped with that project aswell as my own. 

So now I'm sitting here wondering why am I staying up to 9pm every night working, trying to make sure I don't fail to deliver and getting no recognition for it, but those I havnt delivered yet are rewarded. Keep being told by my parents to stick it out and my time will come. 

I like my company and used to enjoy it and is in a great location for me. But am now at the stage where absolutely no recognition for outperforming my colleagues isn't sitting right with me. Would like to know why I havnt heard anything compared to everyone else and would love to air my frustration but don't really know what is an appropriate method. Although I don't really want to leave my company, I think the first course of action is creating a LinkedIn and see what other options are out there

1my43gp,How do I get over a rejection for a job I was so invested in?,"I just don't know how to get over this. I feel completely heartbroken. 

Found a job posting with a company I love and the role was perfect for me. Literally, I was qualified to a T. I happened to have a contact in the org so they submitted my resume thru their referral program. I went through 3 rounds of interviews, feeling pretty good about each one. I prepared for hours and studied everything I could about the company. 
Mid week, I got my rejection letter. The HR rep went out of her way to tell me I interviewed extremely well and the interviewers had no notes to give. The only deciding factor was another person had more 'direct experience with X.' 

I do have direct experience with X though, and I spoke about it within each interview. So I feel like I must not have spoken ENOUGH about it now and I'm just so disappointed in myself. This should have been a slam dunk for me and I messed it up. Ileven worse, I'm in a bad work situation that's only going to get worse and I was relieved to think this could be my escape route to better things. HR enthusiastically encouraged me to get in contact with them directly if another role comes up within the org, which is better than a simple 'thanks but no thanks' I suppose. But I've been watching this job board for quite some time (a couple years) and roles like this don't seem to go external very often. 

I just feel like a failure and now I'm doubting I'll get hired anywhere if I couldnt pull this off. I've worked at the same company for so long and now I fear I'll be stuck here forever. The market for my skills is so dry right now, this was my shot and I blew it. 

Sorry to ramble, I'm just so upset. How do I move on from this? Everytime I think about it (which is often), I just want to cry.

1my0hp3,Node.js vs Spring Boot – which one actually has better job chances?,"Hi all,
I’m confused between Node.js and Spring Boot for backend development and hoping to hear from people who are actually working in these stacks.

What I’ve noticed so far:

Node.js – Very popular, especially with startups. But the competition seems insane. Everyone knows MERN, and I’ve even seen posts where Node.js devs say they aren’t getting callbacks despite applying everywhere. Is backend-only Node.js enough, or is MERN pretty much mandatory now?

Spring Boot (Java) – Feels harder to learn and build proper end-to-end projects, but people say it’s more stable in the long run. The problem is, I don’t see many MNC openings — most postings are from startups. I also hear many are switching from Spring Boot to .NET since MNCs seem to hire more in .NET compared to Spring.

I’m fine if learning takes time, but I just don’t want to waste 1–2 years on the wrong stack and then get stuck. My only goal is to land a stable backend job (South India: Chennai/Hyderabad/Bangalore).

So for those of you working in Node.js or Spring Boot:

Is Node.js worth entering despite the huge competition?

Do MNCs actually hire Spring Boot devs, or is it mostly startups?

Between the two, which one realistically has better job opportunities?

Would really value insights from people with real experience 🙏

1mxzyqq,Zero applications for the rest of my life seems to be the move.,"
Applying for entry level roles: 3 years of experience required + degree + random certifications that no one even knows of. I'm not even looking for anything above 50k anymore.

Being told to network by ask family and friends if they have any opportunities: dead family, no friends

And the longer I go without a good job, the less and less chance I have of getting one. I'm already at, or nearing zero. And if I ever get one, by then inflation will have eroded so much spending power. Wages don't rise to match inflation. Not in the past decades. I won't ever be able to afford a house. Sorry for not having a trust fund of $400k ready for me when I was 18 or 3 years of full time experience before my first job. That's my fault.

I just want to throw my hands in the air and give up. Shelf stocking is a dreary job, and it doesn't pay my bills. I don't have the energy to even think of doing anything but applying. 

I thought I did everything right. Internships, good gpa, projects, good resume. But no.

 I'm a hard worker, and I pick things up quickly. I'd show up and go above and beyond. But if I don't have a chance to show up, why even try? I might as well just forget trying to survive and end it all, when I'll be homeless in a few months regardless. I'll be dead before I even think of reaching my mid 20s. Forget trying to make a life for myself. I don't deserve it.",Ecstatic-Animal359,2,0.75,10,1755951597,2025-08-23 12:19:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mxzyqq/zero_applications_for_the_rest_of_my_life_seems/,8,2025
1mxzm2v,Advice on civil engineering vs accounting,"I'm 16 and just finished my GCSEs. I'm currently exploring possible career paths and two fields that have caught my attention are **civil engineering** and **accounting**. They’re very different, I know—but I want to make an informed decision based on real exposure to each area, not just school subjects or what people say.

I'm hoping some of you might be able to recommend:

* **Podcasts** or **YouTube channels**
* **Blogs** or **newsletters**
* Even personal **anecdotes** or insights if you've worked in either field
* **Books** (introductory or accessible to someone without a university background yet)

Recently, I got an offer from a company in the entertainment industry here in the Philippines.

The ₱30k being offered for the full-time role from that company is basically the same as what I already earn from just one of my part-time roles.

1mxygs6,Fresh Graduate – Torn Between Automation Technician Career and Web/IoT Path. Advice?,"Hey everyone,

I just graduated with a diploma in automation technology and I’m working as an automation technician right now to support myself. I have about 6 months of internship experience + some real-world exposure to PLCs, VFDs, sensors, and wiring.

At the same time, I’ve been studying web development (through The Odin Project) because I’m also really interested in frontend and full-stack development. My long-term vision is to somehow combine these two areas into IoT development / Industry 4.0, since that feels like the future — connecting machines to the web.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

Should I stay focused on automation and try to work my way up to PLC programmer/automation engineer roles?

Or should I invest more time into web dev and aim for a frontend/web developer job first (remote/freelance opportunities)?

Or is it realistic to try building both in parallel until I can call myself an IoT developer?


My worry is that with only a diploma, I might hit a ceiling in automation (since many jobs require a 5-year engineering degree). On the other hand, in web dev it feels like skills + portfolio matter more than formal titles.

I’d love to hear from people who’ve been in either automation, web dev, or IoT:

How valuable is automation technician knowledge when moving into IoT?

Is it smarter to specialize early, or to keep both doors open while I’m still young?

What would you do if you were starting fresh today?


Thanks for reading — any advice or experiences would mean a lot 🙏

I’m currently working as a Sales Assistant, and I love the customer side to it (when they’re not being rude or creepy), but because of where I’m at it is slow, mundane and repetitive and with my adhd that feels like a every day death sentence.

I have a BA and first class honours MA in creative writing.
I love to jump from one project to the next, and keep my brain active in discovering new things, through research or failing at it a few times. I’d love to have a more creative job, or one where I’m having to actually use my brain. I’d love to go back into learning but I am not in the financial position to do so.

I’ve dabbled in lots of different jobs, from social media, marketing, graphic design, barista etc, and although each of them have their perks, I want something a little… more. I want to work within the community and help people.

I’ve thought about becoming a creative director, journalist, an art psychologist, and running off and helping at an animal rescue.

You may be thinking: if you studied creative writing, then why not write? And you’d be right to think that, but it’s a bit more 
complicated than that. Im protective over my writing and wouldn’t want to lose my love for it by making it a mandatory thing, and having to rely on it for money.

I recently received an offer for an entry-level Marketing Associate role at a startup in SoCal. The pay is **$30/hr (\~$62k/year)**, which is interesting because the job description listed a range of **$42–52k/year**, so the offer is already above that.

For context: I graduated this June and have a couple of years of marketing experience through on-campus jobs and internships (social media, content creation, campaign support). This role will involve running paid ads, supporting product launches, using AI tools for content, and generally wearing multiple hats as part of a small team.

* Is it still reasonable to negotiate when the company already offered above their stated range, especially since the average marketing associate (according to Glassdoor) with 0–1 years of experience in my area earns **$62–96k**?
* Has anyone successfully asked for **extra pay or alternative perks** (like PTO, professional development budget, or clearer growth paths) in a similar situation?

So let’s face it- if I think it’s me, even if my boss has given no indication, it’s probably me right?

1mxtcjt,Has anyone else here become deeply disillusioned with engineering and the industrial system overall?,"I studied engineering because I thought it would be a way to contribute to society—building things that matter, solving real problems, and improving lives. I’ve now got over 5 years of experience in industrial design, including leadership roles where I’ve led projects from start to finish. But instead of feeling proud, I mostly feel empty and disconnected from the impact I thought I’d have.

I’ve been reflecting on why I worked so hard to get here, and the truth is: the reason I pushed through hardship, long hours, and constant setbacks wasn’t because I loved machines or profits—it was because I wanted to help people. That’s what motivates me. But the further I go in this career, the less aligned it feels with that core value.

Some things that have been eating at me:

1. **Most projects fail to deliver real value.** From the inside, I’d say 95–99% of projects don’t achieve what they promise. At first, I thought it was due to technical mistakes or poor planning. But I’ve seen first-hand how often projects are pushed for political reasons—because someone wants their name on a resume, because leaders want to look visionary, because funding needs to be justified. Numbers get “adjusted,” deadlines shift, and the project’s actual purpose—supposedly to help people—becomes secondary. The system rewards showmanship more than meaningful results.
2. **Efficiency equals job cuts, not opportunities.** Several projects I worked on were about automation and efficiency. I told myself it would reduce the burden on overstretched operators and mechanics so they could focus on more important tasks. Instead, those efficiencies became justification to lay people off. No retraining, no new opportunities—just fewer workers. I can’t shake the guilt that my work often meant eliminating livelihoods rather than making life better.
3. **What I truly enjoy is connecting with people.** The parts of my career that lit me up weren’t about CAD models or project timelines—they were about talking with people, listening to their frustrations, and trying to find solutions that made their lives easier. I realized I’m much more driven by human connection and service than by technical accomplishment.
4. **Relief when it ended.** When I was laid off, I didn’t feel devastated. I felt relief. That says a lot. I think deep down, I knew this career path wasn’t serving me—or others—the way I wanted it to.

This has left me with a serious question: where do I go from here? I keep coming back to medicine. The motivation that carried me through engineering—the desire to help people directly, to see lives improved in tangible ways—seems much more aligned with a medical career than with the industrial projects I’ve been doing.

I don’t know if it’s a crazy idea to consider a switch at this stage, but I can’t imagine spending the rest of my life working only to generate profit, while telling myself it somehow benefits society when I know it doesn’t in any deep or meaningful way.

Has anyone here gone through a similar realization? If you left engineering or another technical field for a more people-centered path, what was that transition like?",Timely-Wrangler-200,8,0.9100000262260437,2,1755928003,2025-08-23 05:46:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mxtcjt/has_anyone_else_here_become_deeply_disillusioned/,8,2025

1mxsxh1,Node.js vs Spring Boot vs .NET vs Data Engineering,"Hi all,
I’m stuck deciding which path to focus on and hoping to get advice from people who are actually working in these stacks. My main goal is backend development, but the market feels confusing right now.

Here’s what I see:

Node.js – Very popular with startups, but also feels over-saturated. Everyone seems to know MERN already, and the competition is huge. Is it still worth entering Node.js now, or is it a dead end unless I go full MERN?

Spring Boot (Java) – I don’t see many openings from MNCs (not talking about FAANG/MAANG, just regular enterprise-level companies). Most postings I find are from smaller startups. For those working in Spring Boot: am I missing something, or is MNC demand lower these days?

.NET (C#) – This seems to have more demand in MNCs compared to Spring Boot. I’m noticing more enterprise job postings for .NET, especially in South India. Is .NET the safer bet if I want to land in an MNC, even though resources for full end-to-end project learning are fewer?

Data Engineering – A lot of people suggest moving into this since backend/full-stack is crowded. But is it really realistic to self-learn and land a job? How do people usually build/explain real projects (ETL pipelines, cloud, Kafka, etc.) for interviews? Also, how’s the demand compared to backend roles?

My end goal is not a crazy package — even ~50k/month in 2 years would be fine. I just don’t want to pick the wrong stack and regret wasting time.

So my main questions to those with real work experience in these areas:

1. Is backend-only (Spring Boot/.NET) still a safe path for the next few years?

2. Is Node.js worth entering despite oversaturation and high competition?

3. For Spring Boot — are MNC opportunities actually there, or is it mostly startups?

4. For Data Engineering — how to realistically start from scratch, and what are the job openings like compared to backend?

Would love to hear honest experiences from people working in these stacks from India 🙏

1mxsq9b,When you have too much but want less,"I’m in a rather unique scenario that I didn’t think I’d ever be in to be honest. My mother recently passed away due to a car accident that she wasn’t at fault for (at fault state) from someone in a company car in company time and etc. we’re currently in pursuit of a wrongful death and everyone is pretty much garrunteed a settlement unless they want to be particularly silly about because they’re going to lose. 

As tragic as that is and it sucks to have to go through it. There will be an amount to that on top of inheritance. The inherence is no small figure. Nothing in the millions but that on top of taking over the estate towards a house I moved into and I don’t have to pay anything for puts me in a wierd money/job situation.

My job is basically an industrial operations tech. 3-2-2 shift. Days and nights. Every other weekend and etc. whatever. But all that above is making me think it’s… too much for what I need. I love my job and the people are amazing giving and receiving. It’s truly not a bad place. And it’s over 40 an hour so that’s awesome. Just the schedule stinks. I want to stay but I don’t want to do what I’m doing while sitting on what I have. Because I can drop to 20 an hour or even less and still be just fine for the rest of my life. Unfortunately the industry job doesn’t have openings for like janitorial or secretarial or ez pz little things like that because I’d love to be flipping papers behind a desk or sweeping between 7-3 for 8 hours a day with weekends off. And even on the off hour of them needing me for something about my current job I can easily do because I’m the most experienced person here. I just don’t like the schedule. I was enamoured with the idea today of working at a silly (but stable) flower shop today that’s for 3 old ladies and a store cat today and the “easier” life is just so much more obtainable now. I’m pretty sure even my mom would support this because I’m not horrible with my money anyways and she always cared about my work/life balance. Which doesn’t always exist when you work in industry. Mind you I’m 41 now. So I have a ways off to retirement. But I can happily make do with less and I had my eye on retiring early in life anyways so aggressively saved for it without sacrificing my luxuries. All this extra just pushed it way over.

Is this worth having a conversation with my boss about in hopes they might retain me in a different position or should I cut my losses and think about a simpler life and pursue that? Mind you we are on amazing terms but he definately is the professional before courtesy type so as supportive as he’d be I know he’d be probably losing out and adjust for that. And mind you losing out on the most experienced person here with that all in mind because there isn’t lead techs or superintendents that can’t run any circles around me and everyone is well aware of that.  Which is why I’m the highest paid.

1mxr7cf,Boss is retiring and I've been doing my job and his for a year. People don't think I'm qualified.,"xI started working at a non profit as a ""specialist"" under a ""director"" in a two person department one year ago. My boss has been here 20 years, checked out since long before that, just sitting and waiting for his retirement healthcare to kick in. He is retiring in two weeks.

  
I got trained by the person who I replaced who also was pretty checked out, and immediately thrust into things like training someone else to take on some work that she only was assigned because it was not supposed to be in my job description. I basically learned how to do everything that our department does. I delegate to him, he does not delegate to me, his employee. He is often frustrated when I do ask him to step up, when I'm overwhelmed or otherwise frustrated by his laziness. But i do like him and he is a nice guy personally, but sucks at work.

  
Over the last 6 months, two close friends of mine who have also been my bosses in the past have started at this organization in a different department. One of them consoled me when I'd state that I am frustrated by my boss' behavior that i should just ""sit and wait for him to retire so you \[i\] can just push all the work onto the person who takes your \[my\] job when you \[i\] get promoted."" I would never, but thanks.

  
Anyway, when I first started my union president suggested I consider filing a RFR (request for reclass - basically to get a new title/job description/salary since she could tell I am doing more than i signed up for). I did not because I was afraid of going against management. this is my first job as part of a union. In retrospect, I should have.

  
Basically over the last year people have gotten to one of the following conclusions:

1. Some people know and can see through whats happening, and figure that the limited capacity in our department is a result of my boss' laziness.

2. Many people think that our department is overworked and we need a third person, and since my boss announced his retirement have been sort of implying that i am not qualified, that I am not going to get the job, and it is just all around not seeming to me that anyone believes in me to get this job.

This is EXTREMELY frustrating since I have been doing the job of a 20-year director at this org, as an early twenties person. this is my first real full time non gig-work job, and I am doing his job better than him, along with my own. Despite having not worked a full time job before i do have a ton of relevant experience, as well as experience self-managing. I am the youngest at the org by a lot and know that I landed this job as a result of that. But i do not feel good about my first real world full time job experience being with someone who is not a mentor but dead weight, frankly. 

Instead of just promoting me, the Executive Director (my boss' boss) insists on doing a whole hiring process, internally and externally seeking candidates, to replace my boss. I get that we want the org to have the best candidate we can find, and perhaps I am not that person. The position would pay very well (85-105k) and theoretically be sought out by a lot of very qualified and more experienced applicants. I get that, so I am trying to sit with it. 

  
I'm just frustrated since I would be likely well positioned to step into the role and just be promoted if my higher ups actually saw me at my potential, instead of me burnt out from doing two people's jobs, frustrated by this dynamic, and even still (Despite doing well beyond my responsibilities) being at like, 50% of my capacity simply because I'm annoyed and dont want to go above and beyond more than I already am and give this my all. 

  
I work not a lot of hours a week, and my boss works probably 1/3 of what I do -- just attending meetings and answering some emails. It is a very, very dysfunctional organization. But the fact tha I work so little, and it is relatively chill, and my old boss for all his faults did allow me flexibility.... makes me feel like it's worth staying.

If i had a better boss or was able to spearhead the department and build on the good work I've been doing, I do think I could thrive here. But I fear that if I do not get promoted I may be too disillusioned and discouraged to produce good work, but maybe I just need to realize that this is a semi common workplace situation. But in a non profit environment, I just had hoped for a more people centered approach.

And to make matters worse, my two close friends mentioned earlier also want to apply. Both of them have been my bosses before and its either been a similar dynamic to this one, or a dynamic in which I was not advocated for, treated poorly, overworked and taken advantage of. And I feel weird that these people are my close friends but maybe I have a hard time picking the right friends. I do not want them to be my boss.

  
I also suppose i just need to see how it plays out with my friends applying. The structure of the org is staff/board with an ED and Board President that have a lot of say in hiring, as well as the personnel committee.

I guess I'm wondering if anyone has any advice as to how to prove my worthiness (if i even should try to?) while not implicating my boss? He is advocating for me but I'm not sure how far that will get me. I should have filed a RFR long ago, but I really am terrible at being assertive and sticking up for myself. I hate it so much. 

  
I want to show people that I've been doing my boss' job and mine and still have not reached my potential/capacity, but am frustrated and feel disrespected so am sort of skating by but COULD BE doing way more if I could run this department without having to go through my dead weight and opinionated boss, have someone doing the busy work that I do as an actual assistant, and I could just focus on the higher up work that I am already doing at decreased capacity -- but that everyone is still thrilled with. Do i try to tactfully explain what I've been doing (80% of the job description, the other 20% is completely irrelevant since the job description has not been updated in literally 20 years when my boss started) without implicating my boss or take more drastic action?  Should i mention this in a cover letter, interview, in conversations with folks or not at all...?

I just dont want to be disrespectful but also hate being disrespected, and I have an extremely long track record of that. I know I maybe sound silly and bitter and maybe I am, but I'm tired and frustrated.

1mxpmer,Full time study in late 30s for career transition from HR to Social Work/Counselling - which degree is best and is it worth it? (Australia),"
I’m in my late 30s living in Australia and I never got a degree. I had a full scholarship to uni back in the US but sadly I dropped out as I was struggling too much - late diagnosed ADHDer here who is now medicated. 

I’ve been working in HR for the past 5 years, it’s something I just sort of fell into from working in recruitment. There are aspects of it I enjoy, more the employee wellbeing side and learning and development. But I’m burnt out from dealing with people issues and being the “bad guy”. I also hate that I feel I can’t be my authentic self in this role and going from one toxic corporate workplace to the next where the highest paid are the most incompetent and lack emotional intelligence.

I’m a creative person who is deeply sensitive and empathetic. Having ADHD also means I have a strong sense of justice so liked being in HR when I could advocate for fair treatment of employees. However I get into trouble because higher ups see me as “challenging” decisions or processes too much because I don’t really have a fear of hierarchies and I’m not afraid to call out when something doesn’t sit right with me or there are better ways to do things. 

I’m tired of being in a role that requires me to fight against my own authenticity and thinking I just need a job where I’m an individual contributor with little to no corporate bullshit. I’ve been thinking of studying either a Bachelor of Psychology, Behavioural Science or Social Work. I want to get a degree that is flexible and opens many different pathways for me but I’m also worried about the workload and balancing life around it, especially as I’m recovering from burnout. 

Which of these 3 degrees would be best for someone like myself? I was thinking Psych or Behavioural Science could get me into Counselling roles but would also be a good supplement to my HR background as I may also look at transitioning to Learning and Development roles.

But company isn't pulling in as much money as they had hoped but still making money and moving in the right direction just slower than most expected. I have lots of pull in the company, good work life balance  and fully remote and good bonus program but hasn't paid out yet due to not meeting target. 

The company that reached out to me seems to be building something gimmicky if you ask me and not very interesting either. There team is all new grads with very inflated titles. Manager and team lead who graduated uni 2 years ago. Where as I've got 13 years experience and primarly work with others with similar levels of experience. My role will be a senior engineer but it also sounds like it comes with do whatever we ask you kinda thing.

Even in a call with them you can tell they are inexperienced. There CEO never ran a tech company before he just made lots of money in the Auto parts industry. Asking them basic things has them stumbling and word vomiting.

After the call I kinda decided that its a bad idea. I'd be giving up too much. But I keep wondering if I should just do it for the money. For reference family income is ~214k currently I would be letting go of 60k increase. The extra money won't change our lives but allow us to pay off our home sooner and maybe extra vacations (assuming I don't work 24/7) would help with the kids a bit too I guess but not like we're struggling right now either. 

I keep getting mixed feelings whether I should do it for the money.

1mxo7r0,Committing corporate su*cide at 29,"Hi ladies and gentlemen, I’m 29 and I’m pretty sure I just commit corporate suicide. I got burnt out at my job of 4 years, did an internal transfer in an attempt to reset, ignoring all of the red flags of the management and work, got to the new role and realized it was a shit show with tight deadlines that management expected no negotiations on.

I hit old job back up, new job got mad that I tried to go back, now they won’t let me go until they can backfill me and have determined that I ‘worked hard’ during the transition period. Old job told me if I didn’t get back within a few months, they’d have to fill the role with someone else. I rebutted with I’m applying to external jobs in the case of some worst case scenario like that. Old job was not particularly happy to hear that considering they’ve been busting their ass fighting new job to get me back.

So now I’ve thoroughly pissed everyone off and I’m stuck in the middle trying to figure out what to do. I could just leave completely, but I imagine this will burn all bridges back into this company and now I’ve got a couple of months gap on my resume where I was at this shitty job, which in this job market I imagine is not going to be a good look.

Don’t be like me guys. I got tired of playing the corporate game of lies and manipulation and was honest and blunt in all cases and it has fucked me over. I guess you just have to suck it up and do a job you hate. Or perhaps just leave a company when it burns you twice.",DoMyWonders,1,0.5299999713897705,9,1755911716,2025-08-23 01:15:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mxo7r0/committing_corporate_sucide_at_29/,8,2025

1mxnuva,questions for neurologists,"i am a junior in highschool who dreams of becoming a medical professional. i really get high off of helping people even if i don’t get benefits from doing so. 
my favorite subjects in school are science & psychology which i assume go hand in hand for the fields ive been considering for my future. 
neurology is such a wildly beautiful field imo and i would be so proud to call myself one…but i have just a few questions. (asking here because google is plagued by AI 🫩)

1. do neurologists go through the same bachelors-med-internship-residency-fellowship pipeline? i’m willing to do whatever it takes to be one but i just wanted to double check with real people.

2. will i be able to support a family with this career or will it put me in a working class position?

3. are there specific specialties within the field? i’d really like to specialize in adolescent neurology because i feel like teens struggle to get full attention on their needs…based off of personal experiences.

im willing to do whatever it takes but i always like to pull out the pros and cons of careers like this. i take my future very seriously and i want a happy family while im also doing a job that means something to me.

1mxncep,Do I need a degree or experience with a company more?,"I (29M) work at an architectural engineering company. I've been here for about 2 years and the company is great. Great people, great policies, great pay. I have dual certifications from a technical college (one in civil drafting and design, the other in architectural drafting and design) I went to years ago. I worked at a construction company doing AutoCAD work for 3 years in my home state before I moved to work where I live now with my spouse. 

My partner has brought up multiple times that I should go back to college and get a full degree in my field (partner edit: or find an alternative plan to progress in the field). However I am currently making $69k salary (yearly raises and bonuses on top of it) after only being in this field for a total of 5 years and having to move states due to other factors. I've talked with some of my coworkers and while a few have degrees or an engineering license, these are mainly the people running the different departments. My closest co-worker has worked at the company for 20 years, doesn't have a degree and is living fairly comfortably given the current economy. 

My partner is worried that we won't be able to afford our own house or live the life we want unless I get a degree (not immediately) or consider moving companies in the future. They have a bachelor's degree in computer science and is going back to school for their Masters. They have been incredibly diligent in trying to find a position in their field as soon as they graduated, but because of the economic downshift of the last couple years and there being a virtual flood of computer science majors (thanks to colleges pushing the majors) they have not had much success. (Though they have recently gotten what is essentially a part time entry level position at a library that pays just above the state minimum wage and will allow them to go back to school.) They are constantly applying and looking for positions where they could build their career and I am incredibly proud of them. 

Back to the topic at hand though, my partner keeps asking me to consider going back to school to get a degree in my field, saying it'll be better for my career in the long run. I don't disagree that it COULD be beneficial to my career, but I think working at the company I am at for years and years while building experience and skills in the field is more important. 

I also don't want to try and go back to school for a degree because I don't want to have to take on student loans, add on even more work than I already do (45+ hours a week), and have the stress of it when I'm already doing (to my mind) fairly well all things considered. 

(Partner edit: I'm open to other plans other than moving companies or getting a degree but I feel like him staying in the same position for years like he is isn't doing him favors in the long run. Especially because recently he shared with me something on his review that mentioned him not scheduling time for training. Honestly if he just made that a priority I probably wouldn't worry as much)",TheMagicHatchet,1,1.0,0,1755909223,2025-08-23 00:33:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mxncep/do_i_need_a_degree_or_experience_with_a_company/,8,2025
1mxn8po,Figuring it out,"Hi, everyone. I’m a woman who just turned 25 and trying to figure things out. I graduated and received my BA in Psychology in May of 2022. Throughout my time in school I always thought I wanted to be a therapist in some capacity (marriage & family, adolescent, school counselor). It wasn’t until after I graduated and things slowed down that I took more time to really think about what I wanted, and I realized I didn’t think that was what it anymore. I am highly empathetic, sensitive, and intuitive – which makes me great at supporting others, but also means I absorb their emotions. There is no doubt in my mind that I could be good at it, but for how long? I would surely burn out.
I started to explore other options and began to like the idea of becoming a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. Shorter appointments with patients still with an element of talk therapy, but more focused on medication management, less emotionally taxing, much higher pay. I thought I could “push through” being a nurse for a couple years before becoming a PMHNP, but after I took a CNA class I knew I wasn’t up for it. 
I then reconsidered becoming a school psychologist because of the mix between behind the scenes (paper)work and one-on-one assessment. I ultimately decided that wasn’t for me either mostly because of the red tape, rigid systems, and district policies (high bureaucracy, low autonomy).
After ruling these out, I felt more lost than ever. I’ve taken dozens of career, values, and strengths assessments, and done research on hundreds of career paths. Hello analysis paralysis!
After all of my research, several patterns emerged, and with those came clarity. I have attached a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qOLR4_q2zx_Rah5wazQr7o9QKH0sNGQzgKivE5g4COQ/edit) with my discoveries…if anyone would be so kind as to skim through it and recommend career path(s) I would be forever grateful.

**My number one “match” on ChatGPT (before anyone comes for me, know this has been a very helpful tool for me in all of this research) has consistently been UX Researcher. The more I’ve learned about it, the more I feel drawn to it and feel like it could be a great fit for me. Yes, I am extremely aware of how terrible the job market is for UX in general, but especially for UXRs right now, so it is discouraging and frustrating. However, I don’t want that to be the reason I don’t give it a real try. I’m willing to work for it, go back to school, etc.**

1mxmowv,"Advice Needed: Lost Copywriter, Chaotic Company, Supposed to be Leaving but Should I Stay?","I am a copywriter in a semi-niche industry. I have been the voice of a company for three years and currently run all copy across a quite sizable brand, where I am loved by the team (although the operation and structure are inherently chaotic and broken), but have been managed by a narcissist (like a true, real one) who has depleted my health and my spirit. 

First hired by an Amazing Leader five years ago, freelanced for her for two years, was invited to move in-house, and the Amazing Leader left the company. 

Narcissist boss (MD) has been in charge for a year; I have had many other bosses before their time. Over the course of the year, I have resigned once, and they enticed me to stay. I resigned a month ago, once again, due to physical and mental breakdown from work-related stress, accrued from this management style and the nature of the business culture (they did not ask me to stay). Two days after I resigned, so did the Narcissist MD. Amazing Leader returned to the company and was devastated to hear that I am departing. Amazing Leader (only working as a consultant 3 days a week, but in a leadership capacity) is appalled by the way in which the business is running, has been given the task of finding my replacement and tells me they cannot replace me, that I am a unicorn, and they want me here – three days before my role is supposed to finish up. I cannot work with the Narcissist anymore; they have two months left of their notice period (with a MAJOR brand event to finish up, of which I do not want to be a part). Narcissist has intercepted every formal conversation I have tried to have with Amazing Leader (weird, control, trying to cover up their true colours). 



Yesterday, I finally spoke with the Amazing Leader, where we were open about how broken things are, where I told them I was leaving due to the Narcissit MD and I don't know what to do, I said I could freelance and Amazing Leader said they need me here once again, right before they were going into an interview with another writer. At this point, they have no replacement, and I have no positive sign of getting another full-time gig anytime soon. I said I need a rest, but I am not OUT in my mind. The head of HR is on leave. My exit interview is on Monday, as is another formal conversation with the Amazing Leader.

  
Would you: 

A) offer to freelance, look for something else, and then move on

B) cut, run and face the realities of a terrible job market, maybe get skilled in another craft, have to move back in with parents or travel or whatever 

C) offer to work remotely, even though everyone understands me to be leaving the job, and I would feel quite embarrassed to go back on my stance from a team standpoint, and then return to the office next year once the Narcissist MD is gone

D) a secret fourth option that you can see, but I can't?

1mxktrp,"Offered 60% more to stay, but tempted by stability elsewhere — what would you do?","I’d love some outside perspective.

I’ve been with my current company (private sector) for nearly 7 years. I’ve been loyal, stuck through ups and downs, and delivered consistently — but the role has become draining, with little feedback or career development. They are always on the cusp of ‘this is the next big thing’ and have won majority investment from a private equity firm which has changed things mostly for the better, so exciting things could be around the corner.

I recently interviewed for a role in the public sector, which would mean a fresh start, more stability, and a long-term career path that feels more sustainable. I was excited at the idea of leaving my current environment behind, and build towards a future me (old) that I have never seriously planned for, but them grey hairs are coming!

But here’s the twist: as soon as I told my boss, my employer countered with a 60% salary increase (plus bonus potential) to stay. It’s a massive jump from what I’ve been on.

I’ve also recently become a dad, which makes this decision even tougher — on one hand, money and security for my family right now, on the other, long-term stability and balance for the future.

So my dilemma is:
	•	Stay where I am: Take the huge financial reward, but I don’t fully trust leadership owing to previous lack of care in my particular department and knowing they have tried to sell this arm of business previously but now ‘investing in the product in people’.
	•	Move to the public sector: Smaller salary up front, but more stability, balance, and a career that grows in the long run. I really feel quite passionate about how I am going to be able to help people through this new opportunity. Money is ok, nothing compared to the counter! But I could maybe start working up.

Has anyone else been at this crossroads? Would you take the money and stay loyal, or go for the fresh start even if it means a pay cut in the short term?",PurpleSufficient2751,1,1.0,2,1755902567,2025-08-22 22:42:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mxktrp/offered_60_more_to_stay_but_tempted_by_stability/,8,2025

1mxjmyj,"33 years old wanting to jump into tech, but I'm getting deeper into my current career. Want advice","I'm an aviation technician and have devoted the last 10 years to get to the current position I'm in. From working stepping stone jobs to get my foot in the door, finishing schooling, finishing an apprenticeship, being let go from a previous airline that I dreamt of when I chose to pursue this career, to recently starting all over with a new airline.

I've come to realize that I'm feeling like I plateaued in this field and that I no longer enjoy what I do. Not from experience or mastering the craft (since I'm still fairly new into the industry), but as far as the daily routine, schedule, stress, responsibilities, and sacrifice that come with this career. I'll be honest and say that I'm experiencing serious burnout that I'm starting to feel it with my health with the lack of sleep affecting me so much.

I've felt so complacent with a steady decent paycheck and feel like I'm just stuck on idle and feeling miserable just for the money. With this career being seniority based and a 24/7 365 type of operation, I'll be stuck in graveyard for a long time and working irregular days.

I had been contemplating to learning a new trade, so I went back to school 2.5 years ago and recently completed both an Associate's Degree in Computer Science with a Certification of Completion in Cybersecurity in June.

I pursued an IT career not because of the money or influencers claiming it's a quick six figure path, but because I've always been into computers growiing up, even joined the tech academy that was offered in high school, but unfortunately I didn't stick to it after high school which led me to working jobs that somehow fell into aviation just to make some income.

I'm coming to terms that this career path just isn't for me. I cannot fathom working 20-30 years in this industry. I'm not passionate enough.

Having zero experience in IT, I know that I will take a dramatic pay cut with an entry level salary, which makes it frightening for me to just walk away from aviation.

1mxizsy,Feeling Dumb,"Hey all -

For context, I’m the type that does my research before asking questions and asking for help. Been at the company for 6 years and then it was acquired last year so that means learning everything new. My new role is somewhat similar but with a new title. Myself and 6 other people in the same role have been in training and figuring things out for about 3 weeks. So we are all ‘new’ learning the systems, resources, etc.  even our boss is new and still figuring things out herself. And plus, she’s a super micromanager. 

So here’s my story -

I was asked to help figure out some compensation issues with a specialty group and went to run a report. However, the system wasn’t working and the thing kept spinning. I looked on another system and still no luck and wasn’t able to find the person. 

I email my boss, along with two other people (one is the lead that I’m partnered up to work with the specialty group and the other is the guy who assigned this group to me). I let her know the situation that there’s 150 accounts that have compensation issues and if there is someone that I can reach out to or if I need to submit a support case. She comes back and says she was able to run the report and basically answers all the questions in the email. I felt a bit stupid because 1) I know I tried running the report and it didn’t work and 2) the tone of her email came off a bit cold. I replied back to thank her and did let her know that I tried to run the report. She then emails me back and says ‘well, you know what I’m going to say is to submit a case for this’. I didnt respond back and not planning to.

1mxiscm,Some guidance please (UK based psych degree),"I (23, F) graduated off a MSc in Psychological Well-being and clinical psychology degree at the end of 2024. I live in the UK now but went home for a few months to see my parents. Throughout uni, I had a job as a kitchen assistant that I worked PT. When I came back in Jan 2025 I went back to my PT kitchen role whilst I looked for FT work in my degree. However, all the psych jobs (assistant psychologist, well-being coaches, assistant researcher roles) just kept rejecting me without interviews or would close applications within hours of posting leaving me no time to finish completing the application. I ended up taking a job at a call centre and started late April 2025. 

I am now sorely regretting my choices, hate working at the call centre and really do suck at the job and it is not the right fit. I am overly stressed and burnout although only working there for just under 4 months. Everyday I want out badly but know it won’t be good to leave without finding a new job first. I’m constantly applying but feel like I don’t have enough work experience in jobs related to my degree. I don’t know if I should go back to my kitchen job because my old coworkers have also left bc apparently it went really downhill there fast but still didn’t leave me stressed and upset after work. 

My boyfriend is also happy to support me if I take a lower paid job as he makes enough to support the both of us, but obviously don’t want to go down that route. 

I have considered behaviour mentor or TA for SEN children as I have done unpaid work placements and although physically exhausting I wasn’t mental shattered and anxious. However, a lot of the jobs seem to be agency work where I have to self fund an enhanced DBS cause I stupidly never put my previous ones on the update service. On top of that I’m skeptical of agency work as I don’t know how stable that will be. How it was described to me is that I get to trial in a few schools but if I don’t think it’s a fit I can move to another, but on the flip side makes me think they can trial me out and pass me along for whatever reason which doesn’t seem stable. The pay is also not as good as what I have now but I feel a bit rushed as the school year is starting soon and all the job listings seem to be popping up now but I know once schools started up there will be less roles going. 

I nearly completed some applications but stopped due to these concerns. That said, I can see a clearer progression from SEN/behaviour roles to the kind of work I want compared to staying in the call centre. I’m also considering moving back to Hong Kong, where my qualifications could get me school counsellor roles in private or international schools. Taking school-based roles here could give me relevant experience for that path as well.

So my question is: would moving into SEN/behavioural support roles in UK schools be a good stepping stone toward psychology or school counselling? Cause I’m not sure if it’s entirely true.",sunnysideupegghead,11,0.8799999952316284,1,1755897572,2025-08-22 21:19:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mxiscm/some_guidance_please_uk_based_psych_degree/,8,2025

1mxijx9,"27M Marketing Grad, Unemployed for a Year, Now Bussing Tables – How Do I Get Back on Track?","Hey everyone,

I’m looking for some career advice because I feel really stuck right now. I’m 27 (M), graduated in marketing, and have been unemployed for about a year. Just last month, I had to take a job bussing tables for minimum wage just to stay afloat. A year ago I was doing way better, but things have gone downhill fast.

My background/experience:
	1.	Ecom Advisor (1 year, contract): Worked at a marketing agency helping dozens of Alberta businesses move online. Earned the title of team lead training other advisors.
	2.	Digital Marketing Specialist (1.5 years): Managed Google, Facebook, and TikTok ad campaigns for a restaurant franchise group with ~65 locations. Also built Shopify stores for their brands and food distributors.
	3.	Tried Starting My Own Restaurant Marketing Business: Left my corporate role to sign them as a client and build a SaaS-style solution using GHL (automation, SMS, email, QR codes, review generation, etc.). Unfortunately, it flopped and I burned through my savings.

Where I’m at now:
	•	I’ve been unemployed for a year, applied everywhere, and the only job I landed was bussing tables (after pestering the manager with follow-ups).
	•	I’ve had a handful of interviews, sometimes even second or third rounds, but no offers.
	•	I’m drowning in debt from being unemployed so long. My minimum wage paychecks barely cover loan interest + car insurance. The only reason I’m not homeless is my girlfriend (she works multiple jobs while doing her master’s degree).
	•	Most days I’m living off the free food I get at work or ramen.

At this point, I’m willing to learn any new skill or pivot into another area as long as it’s legal/ethical. I just don’t know what’s realistic.

My question to you all:
Given my experience and skill set in digital marketing (ads, ecom, SaaS tools, client-facing work), what paths should I be pursuing? What’s the best way for me to land something steady, even in the $45k–$60k range? That would be life-changing right now.

Any advice, direction, or resources would be hugely appreciated.",Danger-Eagle,1,1.0,1,1755897002,2025-08-22 21:10:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mxijx9/27m_marketing_grad_unemployed_for_a_year_now/,8,2025

1mxgirn,Are those online certs helpful?,"Hey everyone,

I recently graduated with a master’s in human rights and international law, and to be honest, it feels pretty useless at this point. I’ve been unemployed since, and my entire background is basically law — I’ve interned at courts, law firms, and even worked briefly as a contracting coordinator before that job turned toxic. The problem is, that field in my country is completely saturated, especially after the government removed entrance exam requirements for law school and flooded the field with graduates.

I’m exhausted from unemployment and I want to switch fields. I’ve been really interested in moving into business, project management, and PMP-related work. The issue is, I don’t have the money to go back to university/school for another degree, nor the will to spend 2+ years in school again at this stage of my life.

So here’s my question: are those free Coursera, edX, or Open University certificates actually worth it, or are they just a waste of time? I feel completely lost right now, and after spending 5+ years in a field that no longer hires in my country, I just want to finally do something useful with my life that will get me somewhere.",Halen_hl,11,1.0,1,1755892229,2025-08-22 19:50:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mxgirn/are_those_online_certs_helpful/,8,2025
1mxg8v4,My boomer boss doesn't understand what I actually do,"Since I started working at my current job around 4 years ago, I've been having trouble with my boss. He's not a good boss, for a variety of reasons but I'll keep it to strictly work stuff. Basically, I don't think he actually respects the work that I do and doesn't make an effort to actually try and understand the extent that I work. He thinks that I'm just a professional Googler. 

My official title is research assistant, but I'm really a data analyst. I collect and analyze data that my company uses in external publications, basically make sure it's correct, glean conclusions from it, connect it to other data that we may have, etc. I receive feedback all the time from our clients that they find my work extremely useful. My boss says he does as well, but most of the time he kind of just ignores me until he needs me to do something for him. 

This dynamic, for the most part, is fine. But, sometimes little things happen that just make me resent him and my job a little more. Let me give an example. 

Today, my boss wanted me to find some quotes he can use to support an argument he's drafting. He at first wanted me to just glean some, but then pulled some exact quotes that he wanted me to source. 

I tell him that it will take me a bit to track down the exact sources, as I'll need to download and go through a bunch of regulatory submissions, since that's where they're most likely from. I have a good idea of what submission it is, but, even if I upload them all to ChatGPT and ask it to look for those exact quotes, it's going to take longer than if it was a simple google search. 

So, he decides to call me. He asks ""why isn't this a simple search"". I explain again: pdfs on government websites aren't going to show up in a search engine. 

He's like ok, but I don't spend too much time on this. I need you to get me the citations sometime today though, so we have something to point to. Like, I'm telling him I can do that, but I'm trying to make clear that this isn't the 5 minute task that he thinks it is!

Ok, vent over, now for the advice bit. I'm one foot out the door of this place for several other reasons that I won't get into. But, the job market right now is shitty, so I'll need to bear with my boomer boss until I can actually make the switch. 

Is there a way I can get my boss to better understand that I'm not just a professional Googler and that most of the time the stuff he asks me to do is not as simple as he has it in his mind? Or am I doomed to deal with it until I or he leaves?

1mxfucj,Accidentally fell into sales through college door-to-door summer work and I don’t know how to change paths,"I (28m) “discovered” sales as a profession by doing door-to-door sales during the summer. Not a MLM horror story, I did relatively well, had a good experience. After I was done doing summer sales I transitioned into doing B2B sales selling supplemental health insurance mainly to small businesses and their employees (still 100% commission, 1099) . A week after my 28th birthday I was diagnosed with cancer which put me out of commission (pun not intended) for a while but even the days when I can work I don’t have the willpower to go out and cold call in person for 8 hours a day.  Or I do but I’d rather do literally anything else. I realized the only way I’ll be able to work right now while I figure out the health stuff is if I do something part time that’s really flexible or if I work 100% remotely (again with really flexible hours as I have doc appointments everyday if not multiple times a day).  The issue I have is that ALL my experience is in sales so I don’t know how to transition out of that or even what to transition to (don’t really have a “dream job”) . I didn’t finish my degree because I was making more in 3 months doing sales than I would in a year with my degree. I’ve applied to some job postings and had one interview but I think I lost them when I mentioned my scheduling situation right now.  Has anyone else fully transitioned out of the independent contractor sales game and if so what did you translation to?  Any suggestions/thoughts?

Let me add that i do have plans to get an mba in the future but im trying to get exposure and experience right now

So lets get cracking

JOB 1 : ACCOUNT MANAGER 

This is a creative agency , i will be handling and maintaining relationships with certain clients.
Managing a small team , allocating budgets , ensuring deliverables are met.

Current offer : 4 lpa ( indian )

Growth is based on ability to handle revenue so for eg i handle accounts worth of 8 lakh my salary would be 80k per month.

___________________________________________

JOB 2 : GLOBAL CLIENT SERVICING ASSOCIATE

This is a mnc where i will be acting as a median between client and service provider and ensuring smooth communication and transition of information in a dedicated span of time.

Current offer : 9.5 lpa + variable 50k = 10 lpa ( indian )

Growth is time and numbers based. Steady growth structure

Now

While job 2 does look appealing to me and the money basically puts me in the top 10% of earners in india as a 22 yr old i feel that ill be working as a associate.

Where as job 1 i will be in a managerial role but at a much lower pay grade. 


I would like to know which one would be more valuable for my mba would it be leadership or global exposure and pay. A mnc has way more weightage but ill be in a senior postion in the other

However it has been crickets for over a week. I sent thank you emails after each interview and received positive responses back fairly quickly, so I'm confused with the silence now.

1mxbkcc,Which welding course should I choose for short-term high income (argon vs petroleum pipe)?,"Hi, I’m 22 and I’m considering learning welding mainly to make good money for a few years (around 7 years or less) before going back to university.

A friend told me:

 “If you’re looking for welding courses, I would definitely recommend either argon welding or petroleum pipe. Pipe fitters and TIG welders make a crazy amount of money here. And if you’re not necessarily looking for welding, CNC milling also makes very good money.”



I plan to take a course at the Italian welding school, but I’m not sure which to choose — argon (TIG) welding or petroleum pipe welding.

My main goal is to earn as much as possible in a short time and eventually move to the US or UK, since I’ve heard they pay well and also have good education opportunities.

Which path would be the best for me? Any advice or personal experience would be super helpful.

I didn’t love or hate my degree, and I’m certainly glad that I have it but I don’t think I have a real passion for engineering or a desire to work in the field for my whole life. I took a financial management module during my masters and really loved certain parts of it. I would love to try and see if I would enjoy working in finance, specifically corporate finance and investment analysis.

Recent years been in tech industry however due to company restructuring I am actively seeking employment in the recent months. Like many people the job seeking experience now is tough, even I never have any challenges getting offers and headhunted. 

Finally I have an offer for the role of Regional HR Manager in a startup environment. But this role is a full spectrum HR role including HRBP, coms&ben, L&D, payroll, recruitment, establishing HR policies and structure - for 5 countries altogether. 

While I am delighted to have finally received an offer, I also wonder should I request abit more increment considering the expanded and demanding role with management having no plans to hire any other HR.

Granted I do not have many hands-on experience doing full spectrum HR role, but I was trained before hence I can do it just that I know it will be more work from just being a TA. 

For perspective, the offer is not even of 1% increase, just $70 more. Logically I should at least try to ask even it's out of formality and for my profession sake. But given the dire job market situation now, I am conscious and cautious to rock the boat at all. 

Considering all factors shared, can someone advice?

2. Do additional cybersecurity certifications compensate for not having a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field?

1mx9s85,Thinking of leaving one job for another,"I’m 21, living at home. Only real expense is my car (~$600/month including gas). I’ve been working retail at a grocery store for 4 months now, about $500/week. Stable job, but I absolutely hate it. We’re always understaffed, I get stuck doing 9-hour shifts alone, and my boss still rips into me for not doing the work of 3 people. On top of that, my hours are usually 12–9, so I barely have time for my online classes (I’m trying to get into university next year).

I just got offered a dishwashing job at a breakfast diner. Same pay rate, but likely fewer hours and a 30-min commute instead of 10. It’d be way less stressful, and the interviewer said there’s room to move into hosting/serving later. Downside is I’ll probably just scrape by, and there might be months I can’t help my mom (she covered my car payments when I was unemployed).

So: retail = stable income but stressful, no time for school. Diner = less stable, less money, but more time, less stress, and possible growth.

I know what I want to do, but I’m not sure if it’s what I should do. Any advice?",KhanSolo945,1,1.0,1,1755876902,2025-08-22 15:35:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mx9s85/thinking_of_leaving_one_job_for_another/,8,2025
1mx9dy5,Apparently im a difficult employee and i have authority issues,"(28M) Idk where to even start yall. Im gonna try to be as self-aware as I can so i can improve but im at a loss…For brief reference, i got a job in airport cargo. Pretty big airport and lots of chaotic situations. Apparently my problems started the day i went in for my online training. I got locked out of my computer so i walked over to the trainer. I stood there quietly as she was talking to someone and i didnt want to interupt. She stops, says she’ll be awhile and to go sit down. I state im locked out as im starting to walk off but apparently my demeanor and behavior in that moment warranted being reported to HR. Granted i stepped out to smoke a cig and they took that as me storming out. It was an hour before the end of the day and since she said it would be a good 30mins before she got to me, i grabbed my stuff and went outside. When i went to go back inside, she proceeded to pull me to the side and say i argued with her and make it seem like i was more important than the person she was talking to. This was not the case and it was a completely blown out of proportion situation. But now its held against me. Fast forward to my first day onsite and my trainer that im assigned to decides to cause an issue. Im told to b in the breakroom at 8am to meet the trainer. I sit in the breakroom for 45mins. I decide to step outside to smoke a cig. Guy at the front said he’d let my trainer know if he came by. I come back in just before 9am and sit in the breakroom again. Im there till about 9:30 and decide to step to the front again and see where my trainer is. No word. So 10am comes around and i get a text from the trainer with the address. I tell him ive been there since 8am. He calls me immediately and demands to know why i wasnt in the breakroom at 9am. Theres literal video proof of me being in the breakroom at 9am yet im grilled for it. This immediately creates a situation where im super uncomfortable and to top it off, i tell the fromt desk guy “i hope he dont treat me differently” to which he says “he probably will”. Talk about a first day experience. Then when the trainer decides to finally come get me, he immediately rude and grilling me. He specifically states “dont step on my toes ur first day”. Apparently HR doesnt even care about how i was spoken to. Fast forward a few days and im trying to learn new equipment. The trainer doesnt fully inform me about how to use the equipment. I get frustrated so i park the equipment and go to the bathroom. While in the bathroom, ig i decided i had enough and went and grabbed my stuff. This trainer follows me all the way to the breakroom while yelling at me to stop. I tell him im uncomfortable with u following me and i want to speak to HR. Now this situation was made to be bigger than it was and i was required to make a statement. 6 pages. Describing every event that happened between me and that trainer. All while being intimidated by the head lead saying im playing the victim. They take my badge and i get reassigned to a different side of the airport. Fast forward to finally being put back on a schedule with a new trainer. First day, everything going great. End of the day, i clock out and apparently the trainer doesnt like that i mention how i have to sit outside for 30-45 mins waiting on a bus and that i wish i could have sit int he breakroom till then. Again, this is my first day back with a new crew and procedures. He says “ its not my fault u dont have a car” and i say wow, thats some disrespectful shit” and he flips out on me. Calls me out in front of everyone telling me im on thin ice and all this other shit making me feel like im just worthless. I come in today and after they let me clock in, they pull me to the office to tell me i cant work there anymore, i have too much of an issue with authority. I try to say my part but in the end all i was offered was to move to another division at a different part of the airport. I love this kind of work so ofc i said yes but im so truly discouraged. I dont understand why i cant keep my mouth shit and just eat shit. I immediately make friends with the people i work with but the moments tries to press me i press back but i get the shit end of the stick cuz im new. Idk what im expecting from posting this but insight is necessary for growth. I hate that ive been made to look like a stain to this company and i truly am a people person. And as much as its worth, ive never had this many issues with HR before at any job in my life. Ik i let my emotions get the best of me but why does it feel like i have this grey cloud following me trying to sabotage my career. Being reported to HR my very first day for something so overblown just set me up for failure. Now i probably wont be able to make rent and be homeless cuz i cant keep my mouth shut.

1mx7b26,Serious Advice Needed,"I have done my bachelor's in Information Technology and in my college days I didn't focus much on coding and only did what was needed for my curriculum. After placement season, I had a job offer from LTIMindtree for 4 LPA and I was doing their training program while waiting for the joining letter. I was not able to apply for other companies as the part of my placement program because my college placement cell redlists prople who have cracked the interview in order to maintain equal opportunity for everyone. After an year of long wait ( 6 months of my remaining semester + 6 extra months) they gave me the joining letter but it mentioned that the role was demoted and the compensation was heavily reduced. I was shocked and devastated knowing that I only had this offer and nothing else.

  
I didn't join that company because as I mentioned the compensation was reduced, It was not at all sufficient for surviving in that particular city where they wanted me to relocate. By this time, all of my friends had already joined their respective companies and had already gained around 6-7 months of experience. I started feeling very low as I was not earning and just couldn't withstand myself. I was eager to gain experience but the job market crushed me completely with low opportunities, rejections and high need of experienced people even for a fresher role. 

So my friend suggested me to join his company which was a consultancy and I started working as a talent acquisition specialist. I worked there for about 8-9 months. And after that I shifted to a different company with an HR Role. This is where I'm currently working. Now after 2 years, I'm realising the mistake I've done by changing my domain. I don't like this job or domain at all. I came into this as a fresher for making money but now I'm stuck in a environment which is just not the right fit for me. I really want to switch to technical roles now as I have a technical degree.

1mx6lbi,Companies that I've worked at are so disorganized,"It seems here lately whatever job I work at that the systems in place and people are so disorganized. It drives me bonkers. Currently my two bosses don't communicate at all, they both do things differently and our team is usually left in the dark and has to wing it. However, since I don't have any real ""authority"" I don't think anyone will listen to my suggestions. I try making suggestions sometimes and it may or may not help but the whole system is just messed up and unorganized. 

My previous job the owner was my boss and he didn't listen to any input at all and questioned everything I did, even if he asked me to do something I'd do it and he'd say ""well why did you do it that way""? Or he'd tell me to make a journal entry, then he'd make the same one himself and duplicate our work. 

My part-time job now is also a bit disorganized, I never know which manager is on duty and even then they don't check in on us or help supervise at all. I just started and they had me doing a lot of tasks on my own that I wasn't even instructed or trained on. 

Any advice? I've worked at maybe two offices over the years that actually seemed to have it somewhat together. I think my biggest work stress is lack of communication and disorganization because usually I am one of the people responsible for fixing these mistakes or ""putting out fires"" as they say.

1mx5uyn,"Need Advice, M20, student B.Tech Mechanical, Mumbai University affiliated college","I’ve been pursuing Mechanical Engineering since 2022. By now, I should have been in my final year, but I failed all four of my engineering mathematics subjects in the first two years (four semesters), which resulted in a drop year. I accepted the situation and waited for re-examinations while also exploring other interests—trading in the stock market and learning car tuning at one of India’s top performance tuners.

Since then, I’ve cleared three out of the four mathematics subjects (Maths 1, 3, and 4), but I still haven’t cleared Maths 2. Despite being confident about my performance, I failed again and even after applying for re-evaluation, the result showed no change. What frustrates me is that during my first attempt, I was just two marks short of passing, but wasn’t awarded grace marks.

Now I feel stuck. If I fail again, my 4-year degree will stretch into 6 years because of consecutive drops. Meanwhile, the average campus placement package here is only about ₹500k–₹700k annually (roughly $6k–$8k), with limited scope in core mechanical fields. On top of that, I don’t have a strong GPA.

While I’d love to stay connected to the automotive sector, I see it more as a passion project than a primary career. My bigger focus is on financial growth and building a stable future. I’m unsure about my next move and would really appreciate any advice or perspective.

TL;DR: Pursuing Mechanical Engineering since 2022, but repeated failures in Maths 2 have delayed my degree (could stretch 4 years into 6). Limited scope and average packages in core fields, plus low GPA, make me question if this path is worth it. Passionate about cars but more inclined toward making money. Looking for advice on what direction to take.

1mx4fot,Non-traditional career path (biology → teaching → research → data analytics) — struggling to land a job. Any advice?,"M-35. My professional journey has taken me through multiple jobs and areas of interest, so I don’t have a “traditional” path, and I think this is making it harder to find a good job.

My bachelor’s degree is in biology. As soon as I graduated, I found a job in the environmental field as an assistant for senior biologists working in the field. It only lasted 3 months because the project ended, and I had already arranged plans to go overseas to study English as a second language.

When I went back to my country, the only opportunity I found was teaching biology at a university to health sciences students. After a couple of years teaching, and because I was really enjoying it (plus receiving positive feedback from students, coworkers, and chair members), I decided to pursue a master’s in education.

Later, I was asked to join a research group on epidemiology and tropical diseases. Basically because I had a master’s degree, and as a biologist I knew about mosquitoes and viruses. They also needed someone young who was “good at computers,” which really just meant not afraid of Excel, as I later realized.

This experience blew my mind! I discovered data analysis, tools to map diseases, and applied statistics. I also met a wonderful mentor, an expert from my country who was having a successful career in Australia. I was doing great, developing new skills, learning tons, showing interest in this research field, and more. It was so great that he invited me to do a master’s degree in Australia with him as my tutor. The thing is, my wife and I already had plans to move to Canada permanently, and it was too late to call that off.

To stay on track with what I was doing, I took a graduate certificate in data analytics in my new country. I did my capstone project with a conservation organization in my city, and it went so well that they offered me a short contract to keep developing a flood watch tool for them. Later, the college where I studied hired me to teach new data analytics students for one semester.

After both contracts ended, I haven’t been able to find a job in my area (if there even is a “defined area” for me). I’ve been working at an auto parts warehouse doing physical jobs, but whenever I’ve had the chance, I’ve shown my other skills to the manager. I even designed some dashboards and tracking tools (Excel-based) to improve inventory accuracy and other things, because my data-oriented mindset can’t stay quiet.

Even though I’ve applied to several jobs, it seems like my profile doesn’t fit the standard paths of education or career development. But I really believe I have a strong set of skills that make me highly adaptable and resourceful. I’m able to build bridges between different fields. And while I might not be an expert at anything (and I’m not trying to be one), I know I’m a good worker and that I can have a positive impact.",Scared_Law3823,2,1.0,6,1755863728,2025-08-22 11:55:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mx4fot/nontraditional_career_path_biology_teaching/,8,2025

1mx4b3j,23M – Should I take a $32.15/hr Correctional Officer job (with 15% bonus) or stay at my current $26.50/hr job?,"Hey everyone,

I’m 23M and need some career advice. Right now I’m working as an armed guard making $26.50/hr. I recently got offered a Correctional Officer position that pays $32.15/hr plus a 15% bonus on every paycheck since the role doesn’t come with benefits or paid vacation.

On paper, that’s a nice pay bump, but I’m honestly nervous about stepping into the correctional environment. I know it can be intense, stressful, and even dangerous, and I don’t want to make a move I’ll regret just because of money.

A bit of context:
	•	I live at home and currently save about $2k/month.
	•	My current job feels stable and predictable, and I’m comfortable with the routine.
	•	The correctional officer job would be a big shift — more responsibility, higher stress.
	•	My long-term goal is to build financial security while I’m young, but I don’t want to burn out or hate my work in the process.

So, what would you do in my shoes? Take the higher-paying corrections job, or stick with the stability of my current job?

Appreciate any advice from people who’ve worked in corrections or faced a similar choice.",Significant_Ad_4251,0,0.33000001311302185,13,1755863345,2025-08-22 11:49:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mx4b3j/23m_should_i_take_a_3215hr_correctional_officer/,8,2025
1mx3sip,Considering a new career path,"I hope this is an okay place to post this. I am 25 years old and really juggling whether or not I should go back to school to get my masters in clinical psychology and pursue a career as a therapist. For the past few years I have worked as a career nanny, I make good money and have great work life balance, but as I get older I fear I might regret not continuing my education. I got my BA in psych in 2021 and held off on getting my masters being in the heat of Covid, moving to a new state, and just waiting to feel an undeniable pull to pursue the career. I just haven’t felt called to the career enough to want to go into the amount of debt that is required, otherwise I have always loved being a student and actually am getting pretty clear that my values are in line with that of a therapist. I have always thrived in small groups or one on one, I value emotional intimacy, presence, and authenticity.

I had the conversation with my fiance about going back to school. While he is entirely supportive of me pursuing a dream, he did bring up a good point that we do anticipate starting a family in the next 3-4 years, which will be about when I graduate and will be starting my career. If I choose to be a stay at home mom- which has always been my thought, my student loans will become a burden to him while I am out of work.

Argh! I just feel like I have the time now to pursue a career that might make me feel like I have purpose and fulfillment but I just lack the motivation to commit to such a large sum of debt at this time.

1mx3s6s,Former entrepreneur trying to find a career path,"Hey everyone, I hope this is a cool place for this. My TL;DR is I've been working for myself for a long time and my resume kinda sucks. I'm getting older and I want to have stability, but I don't know what to do.  
  
About 15 years ago I ran a very profitable website, when it shut down (it wasn't exactly ""legal"") I had a bunch of savings and it allowed me to work on projects that I enjoyed working on, usually spinning up some niche project and I would run it until I was bored of it and move on. In 2017 I started a niche ecommerce site that became really profitable but through a series of totally avoidable mistakes on my part I left that company in 2023. We were doing over a million dollars a year in revenue when I left. Before I left I created the two highest grossing (and most backed) Kickstarters within our niche... the first one making about 100K after upsells and the second one about 250K after upsells. 

Everything I work on I have bootstrapped. That first website I built was an Alexa top 20K website with hundreds of queries a second and it was being run on about $50 a month worth of low cost VPS servers (with routing to avoid legal issues and resilience). My niche ecommerce website started by me just dropshipping products and then using the money I made from that to actually develop my own custom product. I had really good branding and really good customer service. 

**My strengths are** system administration, full stack development (though, never in a corporate setting my skills are all self taught and likely not the way they are supposed to be), web scraping, customer service, branding, Chinese sourcing, in-person sales. 

**My weaknesses are** management, I'm not a good manager of people. My really awful resume, not like the document itself but my work experience doesn't really look that impressive on paper. In 15 years I've had only a few big successes and the rest of the time I'm just messing around playing with ideas until something sticks.  I am also a bit verbose in my Reddit threads. 

I am in my mid 30s and starting a family and I need more stability then just picking up random jobs on Upwork. I don't really want to be a developer. One of my favourite contracts I did was just help this person start her business by reducing her costs and just having experience having a business but there's not a lot of jobs out there like that I don't think and I really want to get out of contracting. I don't need to make a lot, I still have savings and where I live I need to make about 30-40K a year, I am fine making less right now and building a career with a company.

Right now I'm just applying for everything, Customer Service, IT Support, Development, etc. I'm not getting any hits, and I'm wondering if there's a field that meets my skills a little bit better. Something that combines my ability to code and do technical stuff while also knowing business development.

1mx3031,Should I force my girlfriend to switch careers?,"Hi everyone,
My girlfriend (24F) has done her BSc in CBZ (Chemistry, Botany, Zoology) and MSc in Forensic Science. She’s been job hunting for the past 4 months and has applied to over a thousand roles (mainly life sciences and QA-related jobs, plus some others). She’s gotten a few interviews, but most were in non-science roles like HR or career counseling.

Now, she’s received an offer from a small company in Bengaluru as a Subject Matter Expert (creating scripts and coordinating with video editors for lessons). While the role sounds fine, I’m skeptical because the company is basically a web development agency working on one project that’ll go live in 3–4 months. I fear they’ll lay off the team afterward. Plus, the company culture seems shaky (it’s run by a family, no clear growth path).

Her long-term dream is to join FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory), but right now there’s no recruitment notification.

Here’s my dilemma:
I (23M) work in performance marketing and feel there’s barely any demand for forensic science grads in the private sector. I was thinking of teaching her performance marketing so she can switch fields and get a more stable job with growth. But she’s reluctant since she invested 4 lakhs and 2 years into her MSc.

She’s a gold medalist in her MSc, so I know she’s capable. But I’m torn—should I encourage her to stick it out and wait for FSL recruitment, or suggest she pivot to something like marketing where there are more opportunities right now?

TL;DR: Girlfriend (gold medalist in MSc Forensic Science) hasn’t found a job in 4 months. Only current offer is a shaky role in a small agency. FSL recruitment isn’t open yet. Should I push her to switch into marketing for better job opportunities, or let her hold out for her dream role?",BrakeEvenPoint,0,0.2199999988079071,14,1755859180,2025-08-22 10:39:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mx3031/should_i_force_my_girlfriend_to_switch_careers/,8,2025

Situation with my boss has been tense since I applied last time. I think I do no longer have a chance for a promotion at my company any more. 

I supposed to work with another company/customer and attend all those meetings but I didn’t get any invites and only found out by accident that another colleague will attend those. I reached out to my boss and he said there is a lot of work which needs to be done and I am the one responsible for it. 

 This made me realize I am the one who is doing the routine work, preferable the difficult one. My boss calls himself sick often and I need to attend meetings with other departments alone, partly doing his job too. 

I found out others do get a bonus about it but it’s postponed once now. 

The situation on the job market is difficult. Usually you get only temporary contracts. It’s the same in our company. What’s positive I have a permanent position.
However, there was an external job offer with a 5 years contract and I applied for it. Turns out another colleague landed the job and left our company.

I am not really motivated, also looking for new job offers. Not sure if I should take the risk and apply for a job offer with 1 year contract or just try to accept my situation. Which is not easy right now…

1mx0lve,Lost My Only Job Offer at RNTBCI After LOI – Seeking Guidance & Referrals,"Hello everyone,

I want to share something personal and challenging that I’m currently facing, hoping for understanding and guidance.

I recently graduated with a B.Tech in AI and Data Science (CGPA 8.55) in May 2025. During campus placements, I went through a 2-hour technical interview and 5 rounds, covering the entire Data Science syllabus. Out of 400 candidates, I was selected as a Graduate Engineer Trainee in the AI domain at Renault Nissan Technology & Business Centre India (RNTBCI).

Since my college allowed me to accept only this offer, I didn’t pursue other opportunities. Now that I have completed college, I unfortunately have no options other than RNTBCI. Even after signing the LOI and completing all formalities, my joining has been deferred indefinitely.

I dedicated myself completely to my studies and placement preparation. I even denied all extra activities, IVs, college tours, and fun, believing education was the only way to pay off my family’s loans. I also have a research paper in AI, which I worked hard on, but now feels wasted. My father has been a mason for 25 years, and I feel like I have failed him and my family. Financially, I am now broke and without any source of income.

This situation has been overwhelming emotionally, and I have even experienced suicidal thoughts due to stress and hopelessness. I feel like I am nothing now, having completed college and lost this opportunity, despite guiding many others to secure placements.

Despite this, I am still passionate and eager to contribute to the tech field. I am seeking off-campus opportunities, internships, referrals, or guidance in AI and Data Science roles.

If anyone knows HR or Talent Acquisition contacts at RNTBCI, or can refer me, it would be a huge help. If you truly want to help, I can provide all proof emails, LOI, and offer letters. You can comment here or mail me directly: adsyssdigital@gmail.com

Granted I pay everything on time and have no issue paying my bills but I genuinely don’t want to be bartending my whole life. Maybe I sound ungrateful but it’s not fulfilling one bit.

1mwytmm,"Lower purpose, higher pay","Hey all. Facing a bit of a career dilemma coming down the line and wanted to get some advice/draw on others' experiences.

I'm just over 30 and have worked in the public/non-profit sector in research roles my whole career so far. I finished an econ PhD and am in a role with extremely strong purpose and pretty high social impact. There are a few frustrations (I'm seriously overworked, some of my team aren't brilliant to work with, and I don't think I want to be in this field forever). But overall, it's a good job.

I'm interviewing for a couple of jobs that are paid substantially more (like over 2x more) in the private sector. I've really enjoyed the interview tasks so far, so I think I'd find the work technically interesting and highly suited to my skillset - more than in my current job. Fundamentally, I also live in an expensive city (London) and I'd like to save a lot more money, especially having spent 4 years doing the PhD. 

However, what's playing on my mind is that the 'purpose' of the work would definitely be less fulfilling - it'd be my first time working for an organisation that is profit motivated, and in one case the company's impact is a little controversial.

1mwy5me,Boss called me a bully and I'm still not over it,"I'm going to simplify this as much as possible and Ill answer any questions with more details:

I began brand new at this job. I have 3 coworkers in total. One of them has worked here before and is the one I am refering to in this post.

This bossy coworker constantly oversteps and tells me what to do. I tried to be polite about asking for boundaries. She also does not follow safety protocols (which we are trained to point out to eachother). When I pointed them out she told me I was being rude. Eventually I crashed out and asked her what her problem was with me and she said that I'd been giving her attitude since day one. Had a panic attack in the bathroom but was ok afterwards.

A day or so later I get called in by the boss who reamed me out for being a ""bully"". She said a lot of other hurtful things, implying that my other coworkers didn't like me either. I asked for examples but she never gave me any. She suspended me for a few days (no warning, no email, no confirmation, and no pay). Later in my car I don't think I've ever cried that hard before. I was throwing up the water I was trying to drink. 

After jumping through hoops and spending hours trying to contact HR, I finally do and get a meeting set up between me, boss, and her boss. Meeting was a whole lot of bullshit and fumbling trying to justify their actions. Yes I recorded it because I live in a one side consent province. Glad I did because they yammered on about how they don't keep track of any mishaps, mistakes, or disagreements in the work place because it looks bad on the company. I did, however, get paid for my unlawful suspension because the situation ""could have been handled better"".

My favorite quotes from my boss during that meeting are:

""I hate seeing you cry, it makes me feel bad""

Like damn Patricia, sorrt my crying makes *you* feel bad. Let me cry on my lunch break from now on.

""Bully was not the right word to use but your behavior can still be argued as bully-like""

""We do things verbally around here""

For days after, she showed blatant favoritism to the bossy coworker.

There is more but Ill stop here for now.

I cant stop thinking about this event. It's been months and I still lie awake crying about it like a wuss. I genuinely was only ever kind to these people and my kindness and care was considered bullying to them.

Tldr: boss called me a bully for false claims by a rude coworker. It has been months and I still cant stop thinking about it. I still cry, shid, and fard about it.

1mwwxk1,Should I leave my current job because of a toxic coworker?,"Hi,

I work as a content creator at a company geared toward finance, where I joined over two years ago. I started at $65k, but have consistently gotten promoted over the years and now am receiving an $83k annual salary.

There have been a myriad of things that have constantly irked me throughout my time at this job, and now that I have made it to the final interview stages of another job, I am seriously weighing the possibility of departing.

The main problem is this one co-worker who is a boss, named Chad. Chad is approximately 30 years, four years younger than me. Since I've joined, he's consistently said insulting things to both myself and other female colleagues that make us uncomfortable.

Shortly after I was hired, he openly declared (within my hearing range) that I resembled Danny Devito's ""Penguin"" in Batman Begins, and the other boss he told this to started laughing a lot. I heard it but couldn't believe it, and told myself I was just being paranoid and imagining things. My former colleague told me the other day that this was indeed the case and he was comparing me openly, for everyone to hear, to this character.

On our team, there are three main bosses. One time, at a company happy hour, he asked me which boss I thought was hotter: Steve or Jonathan. I told him that I wasn't answering that question. Months later, at another happy hour, he asked me the question again.

Throughout this time, he has also been making a number of innuendos to my co-worker Laura. One time, he was talking to Steve about the size of specific companies. He then said, ""Size doesn't matter. Isn't that right, Laura?,"" to which she laughed nervously. He then followed up the question by saying, ""Was that inappropriate?"" and she said, ""Yeah, a little.""

A couple months ago, he asks Laura the same question and she laughs nervously again.

The other bosses (including my boss) are chummy with Chad and they go out to eat, go running, and go out to movies together. The weird thing is, while I really like my boss (Jonathan) and he has always been good to me, he is very close to Chad, which makes me concerned.

In addition, there is another worker on our team with diagnosed autism, named Robert.  He is withdrawn and doesn't bother anybody. Chad will make jokes about Robert to the other bosses, like saying one time that he probably eats sand.

---------------

Recently, another larger (and more well-known) financial services company contacted me and asked me to interview for a job, which would pay $90k a year. The problem? It is 5 days a week in the office, whereas I work a hybrid schedule right now.

Two of my former colleagues joined this company and had mixed things to say about it, including that it has been a taxing experience because of issues with senior management, as well as having to shoulder the workload of two people oftentimes.

Aside from Chad, there are issues with my current company as well. They currently grade us on a scale of 1 to 7 on each post and request we get info directly from speaking to people and not online, which they refer to as ""proprietary data."" The more original data that our posts include, the higher the score.

This has been very stressful for me, as a lot of times people in finance don't want to readily disclose sensitive financial information and I have found a lot of valuable insight through official government documents online.

-------------------------

Long story short: Is it wise to leave the company? I have chronic sleep apnea and find waking up early in the morning to be extremely difficult. Plus, the job I am interviewing for has earlier hours.

On the other hand, is the environment Chad and the other bosses creating too toxic for me to stay?

Would appreciate any/all advice. Thanks!",Civil-Text8443,0,0.5,6,1755836849,2025-08-22 04:27:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mwwxk1/should_i_leave_my_current_job_because_of_a_toxic/,8,2025

1mwwf5t,How to bridge from office support roles to senior roles after completing my MBA?,"Hi everyone - I have predominantly done office support roles in the past.

To try and get ahead I completed my MBA two years ago while working full time, so I’m “ambitious” and can handle a large work load with absolute ease. I’m often tasked with senior tasks because of this. 

After a short time travelling after finishing my MBA I’m now job hunting. 

Due to my lack of senior “titles” I’m struggling with bridging the gap between office support roles into something which pays a decent wage. 

What can I do to stand out? I’ve asked ChatGBT to look at my CV and it has recommended editing my titles in my CV to better reflect what I do, but I’m unsure about this.

1mwwckz,Got a new offer. Need advice,"I am a software developer for a company and was working with them as a contractor. I was earning 70k base, and they recently absorbed me (currently on probationary), they just added 2,800 on my base pay as allowance. They promoted me to a level lower than associate manager. 

I applied to this new company right before I got absorbed. For context, my current company weren’t sure if they can absorb me weeks before my contract end date. I was looking for opportunities outside due to this reason. I continued the interviews even after I got absorbed just to check which level can I go and check their offer. Luckily, I passed all the interviews and the director itself, during the final interview, approved my asking salary of 100k. At that time, I was just checking if they can offer that large jump of my salary.

Right after saying that he’d talk with the team and HR, they called me negotiating for 90k. I just thought that 90k is actually great but I am working comfortably on my current job, and risking everything by jumping on to a new company with fresh people I don’t know of, I think 20k won’t suffice. Honestly, I am having a hard time deciding, and if it was indeed, 100k, I would have leaned more on their opportunity. I’m not sure if I am being greedy or I was just disappointed because they initially accepted mg asking (main reason why I continued the interviews).

I told this to new company’s HR and still asked for 100k. I can still accept the 90k though as they are still more willing to offer that. Should I sacrifice comfortability and my position for a new opportunity with better pay?

It sounds attractive cause it's a regular 9-5 where you sit all day and get good pay without competitiveness similar to how bankers have degrees from prestigous colleges as a minimum in their resumes. A regular 9-5 with 100k and boring work days...my dream life. Other dream life is doing 12 hour shifts for 3 days in a row and have the rest of the week off like nurses. The thing is that I heard that skills in math and coding is needed. I'm not gonna lie, I suck at math. I took algebra 2 and geometry last year and I'm not gonna lie I didn't understand half of it. Geometry I did pretty well but I still need to get the circles better. Algebra 2...I understood most of it well until my teacher decided to teach 2 lessons a day and I couldn't keep up and bombed my final. (Still passed with a B+) I feel like my feelings about my math skills can improve during junior year possibly. I have never coded in my life cause it didn't really interest me so I don't know if I'll really like it.

I really don't know if math majors and tech majors are for me. I mean, accounting sounds cool too tho. Also, I wanted to be a nurse, but the competition and waitlists are crazy where I live. I would rather get my education as quick as possible, get a job as fast as possible, and start working to take care of my parents especially my mom.

Based on this description, do you guys think I should do actuary or am I better off doing something else? My mom really wants me to go to college and I don't want to disappoint her. I really need some advice and what to do by the end of the year/jr year.

Ok Im sorry if it sounds like I'm lazy and I don't want to work hard cuz I basically crossed out like tech, math and health (science) stuff. I don't want to major in something that I will end up hating and I would definitely want to have a career guaranteed to get like 90k+ a year but 100k is more attractive. I'm sorry.

1mwsu59,31 Years old and have NO CLUE what to pursue!,"Hello and thanks for your patience in advance, I know I’m probably the 9,000th person to ask this. 

About me: I am a 31 year old trans dude with ADHD that primarily affects my memory and of course attention. Even if I write things down (which I do, thoroughly) I tend to miss small details or require re-training on things that I was told in my early training but forgot. I also struggle heavily with desk or computer work, number make no sense to me and I cannot remember them for more than a few seconds. I am on meds, but there is not much else I can do and will likely always struggle with this. I also have a connective tissue disorder that makes lifting heavy object, bending/crouching painful and immobilizing for days at a time if I am too active. There’s also very little I can do about this unfortunately. 

This leads me to The Issue! What on earth can I do for work? 

My skills are: 16 years of customer service, junior bike mechanic and basic bike mechanic training, and little things from job I’ve had like canine nutrition, cannabis knowledge, in-depth art supply knowledge and inventory lead experience. 

My hobbies are: arts, studying psychology and social science

My passions are: community care and advocacy, art and nature as avenues for emotional regulation and queer and disability rights and mindfulness

The obvious choice would be peer support, but where I live the work is dangerously traumatic and underpaid, and I struggle with my own mental stability (I am in therapy, and the most stable I’ve been in years, but stress could literally trigger psychosis and this is something I have always dealt with and likely will for the rest of my life, yippie!).

Anyone here found meaningful employment facing similar challenges? 

Anyone here in some other career similar to peer support or disability advocacy or art therapy that could give me some insight into the work or similar careers?

Or something like that “Do you not speak because you’re shy or introverted?” I don’t think I would mind too much when she says it in a one on one setting but like others can hear it and to be honest it makes me feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. I feel like I can’t fit in. I am wondering if I’m overthinking and should just be over it or actually mention this to my supervisor. ,strawberrypeachsoju,117,0.949999988079071,63,1755824059,2025-08-22 00:54:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mwslip/coworker_keeps_pointing_out_how_quiet_i_am/,8,2025
1mwsby0,"confused about my future, and stuck between my parents’ expectations and my own interests","I’m a 16M in my senior year of high school living in the Middle East from Arab parents, and I honestly have no idea what to do with my future, or even my life.

For the past 3 years, my dad has been pushing me nonstop to study engineering and become a petroleum engineer. At first, I agreed, mostly because I had no plans at all and just went along with it. But by the end of junior year, I realized I actually needed to start thinking seriously about university because he kept asking, and I didn’t want to be constantly badgered. I told him something just to make him stop for a while, and that “something” was architecture, even though I didn’t really want it; I just needed space to think.

Over the past few months, I realized I want a major that’s less theoretical, more hands-on, and not too heavy on math or science. The problem is, I have no real passion for anything. The only thing I’ve ever really considered is filmmaking, but my mom was extremely against it, saying things like “my son will grow up to become an adult content producer,” which made me immediately drop it from my preferred options.

I then thought seriously about business and finance. It fits most of what I’m looking for (except the hands-on part), and my dad works in finance, so I would have support. I told him, and at first, he seemed supportive, asking about my courses and showing interest. But yesterday, my sister told me that my dad told the whole family, while I was out with my friends, that I’m ruining my life by choosing finance and that I should just stick to engineering because I’d make great money early in my career.

This gave me a massive headache. Why didn’t he come to me directly? Why did he act supportive at first if he was planning to criticize my choice behind my back? I feel like he’s ignoring the fact that it’s my future, and forcing me into a career I don’t like would only make things worse.

When I tried talking to my mom about it, she gave some excuses for why my dad said that, but then she asked me, “What interests you?” I honestly couldn’t answer. This made me feel lost and anxious because I've accomplished so much, from regional and international awards, participating in many internationally recognized competitions in various sectors such as debate(Model UN), Robotics, Entrepreneurship, Coding, and Innovation, but even after all that, nothing in particular really interests me

I’m stuck. I don’t know how to make my dad happy and choose something I might actually enjoy. I also don’t know how to figure out what I truly want, and that just made me rethink Finance after thinking it was the perfect thing for me and by time ill grow into liking it. Good universities here are competitive, and early admissions are approaching soon, which makes me feel like I have to make a decision immediately.

I really need advice from someone outside my family. How do I handle this situation?",HopefulDriver5173,1,1.0,0,1755823330,2025-08-22 00:42:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mwsby0/confused_about_my_future_and_stuck_between_my/,8,2025

1mws15o,I need some help making sense of a bizarre situation that just happened.,"I have a background with multiple industry certifications and partner status with a couple of FAANG companies. To gain experience and learn a new system, I took what I knew was an entry-level, short-term tech support contract role through a staffing agency.

The First (and Last) Day: I started the job and within the first three hours a supervisor from a partner company (not the agency that hired me) was micromanaging me over performance metrics, I took a total of 3 calls. At the same time, my actual manager from the staffing agency was telling me the exact opposite – to relax and just focus on learning the systems, not on metrics. After getting chewed out by the supervisor for following my manager's advice, I professionally resigned after just 3 hours. I figured that was the end of it.

About 90 minutes after I quit, I got a personal phone call from the Director of Operations at the staffing agency. She was incredibly apologetic. She said she was sorry for what happened, praised me, calling me a ""top agent,"" said the end-client ""loved me,"" and then said they have permanent positions coming up and wanted to know if I'd be interested in being hired for one of them.

The Confusion: Today, I received a standard, automated HR email formally confirming my ""termination."" Now I'm left with two conflicting signals: an offer of a better, permanent job from a director, and an email confirming my termination notice.

My gut feeling is that they were blindsided because they had unspoken plans to leverage my high-level certifications and partnerships for another project, possibly use me to show off in front of a client, and my quitting threw a wrench in their plans. I feel like maybe I'm just fantasizing and trying to put a spin on this but I've ran the situation through 5 different AI's to get the percentage of likelihood for different possibilities and this one has come up between 75%-94% across them all. The whole reaction feels wildly out of proportion for someone who worked for three hours.

I don't know anyone else to ask if this is normal, but it doesn't feel normal. This is my first time working for a company in any kind of tech role, but I know that at any of my previous jobs if I'd quit after 3 hours they wouldn't be calling me back to see if I'd work with them again or anything close to that. I'd almost surely be marked as not rehire able. Also the Director of Operations wouldn't be calling, it would be my manager or HR.

I'd appreciate any insight into this because I can't quit thinking about it but I also can't come up with an answer that feels right.",Expensive_Joke6430,1,1.0,1,1755822500,2025-08-22 00:28:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mws15o/i_need_some_help_making_sense_of_a_bizarre/,8,2025

1mwqxb1,Any advice with my career in the trades?,"Career advice in trades

Hey everyone, I’m 17 and a senior in high school. College really isn’t the path I want to take — I’d rather get into the trades and build a career that way.

Right now I’ve been looking into a few different options: electrician, wind turbine tech, HVAC, and welding. Out of all of them, electrical work stands out the most. If I go that route, I’ve been thinking about joining the IBEW right after high school instead of doing trade school.

I’ve picked up a lot of info from social media, but I’d really like to hear from people actually in the trades who know what it’s really like. My family and friends have been encouraging me toward becoming an electrician, and it seems like it could be a good fit.

Here are some questions I’ve got:
	What’s the best way to get into electrical work with no experience?

	Should I try to get into an apprenticeship right away, or do trade school first?

	What licenses/certs should I go for first to make myself employable?

	Union vs. non-union — what are the real pros and cons?

	Is electrical a solid career pay-wise long term?

	If I don’t know anything starting out, will I be taught well as an apprentice? 


From your perspective, what’s the best route to take?

	If you were my age and starting fresh, what would you do differently?

How do I make my application stand out to unions or companies with no experience?

What skills or habits separate a good apprentice from a great one?

Which trade skills are most transferable if I decide to switch later?

Are there certifications or skills that make you more future-proof as the industry evolves?

I don’t expect every question to be answered, but any input would mean a lot. I’m just trying to learn as much as I can now so I can make the right decision and build a strong career plan.

1mwp5w7,Worried I took the wrong role. What now?,"I have worked in the gaming industry for 6 years first as an engineer then as a technical game designer, and recently took a role at a non-gaming tech company who reached out to me because they were looking to expand their gaming department. They said they were looking for someone to make prototypes of game concepts for them so it seemed like a good fit. All through the interview process I talked about how I go about designing and building games from prototypes to production. 

My old job was a startup game company that just ran out of funding so the timing worked really well.

But now I am at my new job and I am very confused. Most people (including my boss) seem to think I am a UI/UX designer and are assigning me UI design tasks. No one has onboarded me to their development tools besides Figma. They have made games at this company before, but it’s hard for me to understand how they have even gotten them made. I am trying my best to find projects and do work that makes sense but I feel like I have to force my way in. I also feel weird saying “I can’t do that” to tasks when I’m at a new job and trying to be open. 

They just hired ANOTHER person with my same experience (technical game designer) and tasked her with creating production ready UI, which she then had to explain is not what she should be doing, but they are making her do it anyways. 

I have been in a lot of planning meetings and it is clear they are trying to figure out the whole games team/ situation but everyone seems very disorganized and not on the same page. I am trying to take charge and advocate for myself while also trying to not seem too contrarian/ unqualified.
 
I am regretting not just holding out to find a job at a game studio. I feel like I have two routes - try and take the reins and turn this department around (but I’m not in a leadership role) or leave because it’s a bad fit. I just need advice!

1mwmsgs,Torn between 2 career paths,"Hi all, 
I (24 F) have two possible job opportunities in fields I think I would really enjoy, but I can’t decide which one I should take. Taking one would kind of shut the door on the other profession for me indefinitely so I have to think long term

Option A: middle school teaching job. Full benefits, higher salary, would start next week. In my #1 choice district if I were to be a teacher (my original career plan until I found option B) Less work/life balance as teaching can be extremely stressful and requires a lot of work outside contract hours. More job security (I think).

Option B: entry level role with built-in career growth (formal training, role designed for me to take over PM role after 1.5 yrs and I’d be the only person in this entry level role) at small/relatively new non profit consulting firm. Lower salary, no benefits except for unlimited PTO but have a “plan in place” to be able to give employee benefits later down the line. Better work/life balance, flexible schedule, mostly remote. Would allow for professional development within the firm and for leadership roles in general. Would be a great way to get into the nonprofit sector/give me experience for future opportunities especially since jobs outside of teaching are hard to come by with an English degree. 

Both have great workplace culture. I can’t discern which pros/cons are bigger in this situation since I’m relatively new to the workforce. Option A gave me a verbal offer and is sending the official offer, but I haven’t signed anything yet. My start date would be next week. Option B wants me to meet the founder/rest of the team next week before writing up my offer. I’m the only candidate for this role so I can’t use the “go with who gives you a written offer first” logic, which would’ve probably made the decision easier lol. Also, despite not legally bound to anything yet, both options are communicating with me as if I’m for sure going to be working for them.

Over the past few years, I’ve dabbled a bit in software and found that I actually enjoy it more than I expected. That led me to start pursuing a software engineering degree online, which I’m close to finishing up now.

My background is mostly technical. I was in the military doing a hands-on technical job, then worked as a technician at a few big companies before getting hired on as an entry-level engineer. Since then, I’ve grown into my current role, but most of my experience is on the hardware and systems side. Lately though, I’ve been thinking seriously about making the switch to software engineering full-time.

Just looking to get some perspective from others who’ve either made a similar switch or are working in the software field. What’s the job market like right now, especially for someone coming in with engineering experience but not a ton of professional coding under their belt?

I’m in a difficult situation and could use some advice on how to proceed. Without getting too deep into it, my previous boss sent me a performance warning email, back in May. She also unintentionally forwarded me a draft of the letter that she had asked HR to look at, along with the HR director’s response. 

After that, long story short, my new boss sent me another PIP warning (no actual PIP), and so I went to HR and requested a mutual separation. HR said they “don’t do those”, and told me I could resign, while staying on for 30 days. I asked for severance, and they said they don’t do that, either (Note: it’s a large company with 10k+ employees.)

I’m stuck in a weird limbo of not technically being on a PIP (which may or not exist at this company), not being offered a mutual separation, not wanting to resign and give up unemployment benefits, yet not being terminated either. 

Among other things, this notable exchange was included in there:

5/15, 9am
From: My manager 
To: HR Director

“Hey [HR Director], 
I am planning on sending this email to [me], but wanted to get your eyes on it before doing so. I would like to cc [new manager] since he will be managing him officially on 5/27 and you. Please let me know your thoughts.
Thanks,
[manager]”

Hiya - there are definitely some edits that I would recommend - in red below. Ok, so I'm not a fan of how it closes, and would want to workshop it - we don't have 30 day plans as you've outlined - you can tell him that you are considered corrective actions, but definitely don't put a date range out there - we love to be vague, so we can get out of it early if we need to
I have to run, but can connect with you later.

[This was the part was in red, deleted from later draft]
“….and amongst your peers in the role-[focus on him only]. I will be working with our HR business partner on creating a structured plan for measuring your performance over a 30 day period and assessing whether this role is a good fit.”

I obviously wasn’t supposed to see this, but it seems highly irregular, deceptive, and like they were trying to avoid transparency. Any thoughts or advice?

Thanks,

I finally received an email for an interview for two positions at a place that will be opening in October, one of which I'm mostly confident in, the other is me trying to expand further in my career with an assistant manager position. However, the interview is an open interview with groups of 3-4. I have never done an open interview before and am quite anxious about it. What can I expect and what should I know and do going into it? I know in group interviews you want to be able to stand out, how do I do so?

Also, any other advice on interviewing for an assistant manager position when I dont have management experience completely, but I do have lead sales experience which lead to me being an acting manager most days.

1mwkx6o,Do I have to sleep in this bed forever?,"I’m not sure what exactly I’m looking for exactly but hoping to get some outside perspectives and advice. 

I’ve been working on the client support team at my public-sector agency for about 10 years providing product and policy support. I was originally hired to work directly with a subset of clients but about 5 years ago, I was given a raise and new title similar to a relationship manager. I now assist in an escalated capacity with our clients dealing with complex issues and our internal policy teams for efficiency in documentation and process. I am also the only on-site trainer for my team (all other trainings are online). 

About 2 years ago, I brought my spouse into our team. They needed to leave a toxic work environment but struggle with some mental health (ADHD, low self-esteem, anxiety). They did apply and go through the interview process (I was not involved) and got the job.

Overall, I’m fairly content in my role. However, due to the change in my role and some leadership changes the last couple years that made our team more of “dumping ground”, I’m beginning to feel quite burned out. I am also one of the most competent and reliable people on our team so I’m being ask to fill in the gabs in many areas and starting to resent the lack of equally distributed tasks. I’ve addressed my concerns with my lead but not much is being done. It’s a lot of “well, we support the clients so…xyz is something we need to deal with” and “well, other person doesn’t feel comfortable doing this task”. I have a pretty high standard for myself so my work performance is always high and I truly do value the support we provide and want the best for our clients. But, it’s beginning to be too much. 

It’s not even that I’m too “busy” or “overwhelmed”. My daily schedule is still manageable, but I feel myself getting irritated very easily and frustrated when working with others that I feel aren’t carrying their share. I think it’s the expectation and reliance that I will clean up anything that falls through the cracks while also being responsible for some of our most important tasks (travel training, working with policy teams to advocate for clients). 

I’m thinking of looking for a new job, but uncertain. It seems crazy to leave a cushiony job where I have almost full freedom with no micromanaging just because I’m annoyed with leadership and feeling under appreciated. I was just approved for a 2% raise and was told I will never get another one as leadership thinks I already make too much (to be fair, I am the highest paid on my team). We are also going into our busiest time of year and I do A LOT of the support for our team between Oct-March so my possible leaving would be a huge hit. 

I wish I could be the person that keeps their mouth shut and collects a paycheck but that’s just not how I operate. However, one of my concerns is if I eventually leave the team, I am 75% certain my spouse will be let go within a year. I know having my spouse work on the same team was probably not the smartest idea but they were dealing with a very bad boss previously and it was the easiest way to get them out of that situation. They have done fairly well overall but admittedly has struggled with our direct lead a bit - spouse is much better at big picture ideas and concepts than the small details our team most often works with. To add, spouse is not a “bad” employee - they were a top performer in their previous role but are neurodivergent and their previous boss was not respectful. Unfortunately, our current lead is also not the most understanding of that. Due to past manager trauma, spouse does not feel competent or comfortable advocating for themself. The idea of having to apply, interview, and learn a new job is pretty overwhelming got them.  

I’m just looking for any outside perspectives. I feel like I’ve backed myself into a corner and am now not sure of my options that don’t financially cripple my household.",herecomestheBird,1,1.0,0,1755805024,2025-08-21 19:37:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mwkx6o/do_i_have_to_sleep_in_this_bed_forever/,8,2025

While I’ve learned a lot, I feel trapped in the marketing industry and want to pivot into something new, ideally healthcare or finance.

As an analyst, I like working with numbers, research, and building ways to present data creatively. My struggle is with the “insights” side of marketing. I don’t enjoy trying to spin stories for campaigns or clients. What I do enjoy is pooling data, uncovering patterns, and making dashboards or reports that are clear and actionable.

Has anyone here transitioned out of marketing analytics into healthcare, finance, or another data-heavy field? Are there career-change programs, certifications, or pathways you’d recommend?

1mwjq3t,Stuck between Medical School in Romania vs Biology BSc (for Neurobiology MSc in the Netherlands) – which path makes more sense?,"Hey everyone,

I could really use some outside perspective, because I feel pretty lost with this decision. My dream is to do a **Master’s in Neurobiology in the Netherlands**. The two possible paths I see are:

# Option 1: Medical School in Hungarian

**Pros:**

* I’d have a professional degree (medicine), so if I don’t get into the MSc, I still have a stable career to fall back on.
* Strong foundation in biology/physiology, which could also help with neurobiology later.
* High social prestige, respected diploma in the EU.

**Cons:**

* It’s very long and extremely demanding (6 years + residency).
* If I’m set on research, a lot of the medical training won’t be directly useful.
* It’s a less straightforward path toward a research MSc abroad.
* Stressful lifestyle with less time for research projects or extra activities.

# Option 2: Biology BSc at UBB

**Pros:**

* More direct route into neurobiology MSc – everything I study is directly relevant.
* Easier to get research experience (labs, projects, Erasmus, conferences).
* Shorter (3 years BSc + 2 years MSc).
* More freedom and flexibility compared to med school.

**Cons:**

* No “backup career” if the MSc doesn’t work out right away.
* Less social prestige compared to medicine.
* Career path depends heavily on being accepted into MSc and later research positions.

So here’s my actual dilemma:

I’m **100% sure neurobiology research is my dream**, but if I don’t get into the MSc, I’d have nothing solid to fall back on with just a Biology BSc. My parents keep pushing me towards medicine. I still have time to decide, but this pressure makes it harder to think clearly.Would love to hear from people with experience in academia/grad school.",Rosee112,2,1.0,3,1755802324,2025-08-21 18:52:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mwjq3t/stuck_between_medical_school_in_romania_vs/,8,2025

Just wanting some advice and insight on a couple of things apologies if this post is lengthy. For context, I graduated in 2022 with a degree in psychology. Started in tech sales and restaurant management, and the last 2 years I’ve been working in hr services sales. Specifically recruiting, outplacement and development, and now I specialize in selling executive mentorship services. My goal when starting this company was to pivot into direct HR. I’ve obtained a few certifications in general hr, l&d, and organizational development. Been applying to various entry level positions but no success. Here are my asks:

1. Would taking the shrm or hcri exam be of benefit to me? And if so which ones?

2. Are there any positions in general that would be easier for me to at the very least get an interview? (I’ve changed verbiage in my resume to reflect general hr and talent development roles and emphasized my experience in hr sales has given me a wealth of knowledge)

Or would aplying to temp/contract roles be a better route?
  
3. I am considering going back to school to get my mba with a concentration in hr OR masters in industrial organizational psychology. Would either be worth it and help obtaining a job?

1mwioqe,Left a job due to 1.5 to 2 hour commute. Would appreciate some guidance.,"Hey everyone. I’m looking for some reassurance and guidance. Im going through a really difficult time. I’m lucky to have a strong support system. My husband, his family, and my own family have all been incredibly supportive, and I know I have a lot to be grateful for.

For the past six years, I built my identity around a job that eventually left me completely burned out. I didn’t have a degree, but it was the highest-paying role I’ve ever had. Over time, the job took a serious toll on my health. I was constantly dealing with severe headaches and migraines, chronic pelvic and back pain, and insomnia. On top of that, my commute was between an hour and a half to two hours each way. Eventually, I had a physical and mental breakdown, went on leave, and decided not to return.

Right now, I’m working part time at a job only 15 minutes from home. I’m grateful to have found something that allows me to rest and recover. I’ll be debt free by the end of the year and that’s a huge relief. Still, even with all this support and progress, I’ve been struggling with anxiety. I’ve been having random panic attacks and waves of regret, even though I know leaving that job was the right choice. My body seems to still be in survival mode. It might even be related to antibiotics I’ve been taking, which could be affecting my gut health.

What I really want now is to move forward with purpose. I’ve realized that I want to pursue a career in social work. I don’t have a degree yet, and I’m unsure which bachelor’s program to choose. Given my background and current situation, I would really appreciate any advice on how to get started on this path. What should I study? Are there programs or routes that might make this transition smoother? Thank you for reading and for any guidance you can offer. I’m 30 years old and feel quite lost.

So this happened some time ago when my employer sent me a document to sign to which I said no. Then we had a call where my employer threatened me, told me they'd make my work so miserable I'd quit on my own and this would be so much cheaper than to pay me the benefits they owed me if they went the legal way. 

My lawyer submited documents to an institution which investigates conflicts between employees and employers and make a decision. We are asking for a compensation because of the psychological damage during that call and further actions I don't want to mention now. 

The same day my lawyer submited the documents, I get an invite to a call to discuss my position and future in couple of days. 

Now, there are 4 possible scenarios what could happen during that call. One of which is stay with us, work for us, we need you. Others are not that ""nice"". 

PLEASE tell me I'd be the dumbest person in the world if I agreed to stay (IF it turns out they talked about this).

The reason I had a micro doubt was that there's a new hire who suppose to be covering part of my work and that new hire is the reason they decided to fire me. That hire is much more experienced in the field I work and I've never had a proper mentor. I'm junior in my role, worked on my own, learned on my own and finally I'd be able to learn from someone.

I originally wanted to do the pre-vet route, but my mom (who I was very close to) left (still haven’t seen or heard from her since) and the pandemic hit.

I prefer subjects that are logical and application-based rather than ones that require rote memorization, like chemistry. Still, I usually end up scoring better than my classmates in such subjects.

Geography and history are manageable for me—history feels like a story, apart from the dates and tough names. I also play chess seriously, both as a hobby and competitively, as I’m a FIDE-rated player. I like physics to a certain extent too, and I haven’t faced any issues with it in class 10.

I’ve been keeping track and I’m well over 1000 applications. Still, I keep getting turned down, even for roles I’m over qualified for.

One big issue is not having a portfolio. All my past work was done at an agency under strict NDAs involving trade secrets, proprietary tech, or federal clearance, so I can’t use any of it. Even if I could, the content would not befit a traditional instructional design portfolio. Also, I don’t know what makes a good instruction design portfolio. What do I include to stand out, and not look generic? What is actually interesting vs hack?

I’m the only one in my family with a degree. They try to be supportive, but they don’t understand. They think a college degree should be enough to get a stable job. I’ve gotten this far without guidance, but after 2 years stuck, I think it’s time to reach out for advice or even a mentor who can help me figure out the right next steps.

I'm happy to share my resume if needed.",Just-Manny,4,1.0,3,1755794702,2025-08-21 16:45:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mwga6o/ive_been_following_all_the_rules_for_job_hunting/,8,2025

1mwfo61,"Should I pivot into dermatology sales or marketing at skincare brands? (27F, career crossroads)","Hey everyone, I could really use some outside perspective.

I’m 27, currently in marketing (3 years experience), and lately I’ve been thinking about pivoting careers. I’ve always loved skincare, cosmetics, and acne treatment — back when I first started college I actually wanted to be a cosmetic nurse, but I didn’t follow through and ended up in marketing instead.

Now I feel like I want to get closer to the industry I’m passionate about, and I’m debating two paths:
- Dermatology/medical sales: I’ve been looking at roles with companies like Galderma, AbbVie, Allergan, etc. The appeal is high earning potential, relationship-building, and learning the science/clinical side of skincare. 

I feel like my personality (friendly, ambitious, good communicator) would translate well, but I’m nervous about quotas and whether this economy makes sales a risky move.

- Marketing at skincare/cosmetics brands: Since I already have experience, this feels like a smoother transition. I’d love to work on campaigns for brands I admire (think La Roche-Posay, SkinCeuticals, etc.). It’s more creative and stable, but probably a slower path to higher income compared to sales.

Part of me is also still drawn to the idea of eventually becoming a nurse injector: but that would mean going back to school for nursing, which is a big time and financial commitment.

I guess my main questions are:
- Is medical sales still a strong career move right now?

- Has anyone here switched from marketing into derm sales (or vice versa)?

- Would it be smarter to try sales first and see if I love it enough to justify going back to school later?

- Or should I just go all in on marketing, but at a skincare brand instead of staying in my current industry?

At 27 I feel like I should have my feet dug into my career already, but I’m hungry for experience, ambitious, and I really want to align my career with something I love.

I'm an English teacher struggling to make ends meet and after doing a lot of thinking I've come to the conclusion that trying myself in a  different field would make a lot more sense than plateauing here never knowing whether or not I'm going to be able to cover all costs of living the next month. The main issues seem to be that I'm not a native speaker of English, plus that I hold no university degree in general.
Without going into details, life with my family was a nightmare and I ended up having absolutely no self-esteem, goals, and trust in myself as an adult. Even though I have a TEFL and a CAE certificate, there are no really other noteworthy documents to list in my CV. 
I'd really love to get out of this situation and make the best of life as it feels like I've never truly lived despite being a grown adult.
Is there anyone who managed to climb out of a pit like this? Could you share your experience/insights with me? I'd be really thankful for any help on this.💜

1mwefkh,Should I get my MSW or go back for my RN?,"Hey y’all,

I’m stuck at a career crossroads and could use some advice. I’m an LPN, but I’m also finishing my bachelor’s in Social Work. I like both sides of healthcare nursing, which gives me that hands-on patient care, but social work pulls me toward advocacy, case management, and helping people navigate the system.

Here’s where I’m torn:

* **MSW:** would keep me on track with the degree I’m finishing, open up clinical social work, counseling, and leadership roles. Downside is that the pay isn’t always the best, depending on the area.
* **RN:** would build off my LPN, probably more pay and flexibility in the long run, but it means going back to prerequisites, exams, and clinicals.

I’m trying to figure out what’s smarter in the long term: stay the course with social work or pivot back to nursing. I want stability, decent pay, and a job I enjoy.

1mwchbe,Walk me back from the edge?  Career pivot in tricky times,"Let me start by saying I'm not every really sure what kind of advice I'm really looking for.  Maybe just a ""take a breath, it's going to be OK"" or something.

  
I work in Biotech.  It's an industry that has been hit massively hard by this ""invisible"" recession.  About 70% of my colleagues are looking for new jobs.  I've been out of work for about 6 months.  I typically work in R+D, which is really rewarding but also has some of the worst personalities and miserable working conditions around- often low pay, sometimes long hours, always in person/not remote, frequent layoffs.  I have an opportunity to pivot into a job function that would take me out of R+D and into another field within the same industry- something I've been looking to do for a long time.  The hiring manager is a friend of mine and helped get my foot in the door.  They are interviewing other candidates but it's likely I'll get the role because of my friend's influence.  This should be a no brainer.  Fingers crossed.

  
It's tricky though- the position is structured as a contractor role.  It was originally temp to perm but the company was acquired and they aren't sure what the acquiring company will allow them to do regarding headcount.  None of that really concerned me too much, but my friend/hiring manager let me know that he may be leaving the company to pursue a different opportunity.  So, in a month or two after starting, I may be reporting to a different person in a contractor role in a company that will be absorbed in a few years time.  I have no idea what his departure would mean for my role- would it open up headcount for a permanent function?  Would they let me go to consolidate functions somewhere else?  Everyone I spoke with said they don't know what will happen with the other company, but that things are status quo for around the next year, year and a half.  I have no issue working for the acquiring company, that's fine by me and may be a very stable place to be.

  
I don't have any other offers and while there are some promising things taking shape, none of them have come to fruition in the sense that I can nor would turn this position down for something else.  They're also all going to be in R+D, which has the problems I mentioned above.  Still, I'm a bit terrified of taking a role that is a learning opportunity for me and having it turn sour because my friend leaves and I'm left without appropriate leadership or am back in the job market, this time with two months of experience in something new.  I know that I'm worrying about something that isn't even a thing right now, but this job that I was so excited about keeps getting knocked down a peg, and I'm confused how to feel about it.",camp_jacking_roy,1,1.0,0,1755786490,2025-08-21 14:28:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mwchbe/walk_me_back_from_the_edge_career_pivot_in_tricky/,8,2025

1mwc6s5,Which Job Would You Choose? Career or Comfort?,"I'll call these jobs A and B.

Job A, I have already gone through multiple rounds of interviews for about three months now. The original position I applied for was filled, but they invited me back for the same title at a different location. Yesterday, I believe, was the final one because it was in-person, unlike the others, and they told me they would deliberate and get back to me more quickly than before. This job has potentially higher pay depending on how the negotiation goes, and would offer more of the 9-5 low-stress work environment.

Job B, I went through a phone screening and had my first official interview with them yesterday as well, but they let me know it was the first round and that they would get back to me within a week. This job would demand a lot more from me. Citing long hours, early mornings, late nights, holidays, and they were transparent about there being room for a stressful environment. The top range of the fixed salary of Job B is at the bottom of the range of Job A. The caveat is that Job B aligns more with skills I'd like to build in my industry and future job opportunities. With Job A, there is a possibility that I'm building new skills and could broaden my resume or pivot back down the line, because it is not far of a stray from the future that I want.

Of course, there may be issues with the timeline, but I more so want to know if you were in my position... which would you choose?

1mwbol4,"Friend/coworker was fired, employer is trying to say he quit.","Im a long winded writer, sorry in advance. TLDR at the end. 

First off, this is all first hand, not twisted office rumors. My office is right next to the management officr and i heard it as it was happening.
So our project manager was demoted for being shit, but because he's worked with the company for 15 years, they didn't want to get rid of him completely. Me and my friend (we will him Jake for the sake of the story) have both worked here since this location opened about 6 years ago. When we started, our PM was the lead. He couldn't actually do the job, and so ""Jake"" was hired in house (he was previously a contractor) and given half the duties of the role because his education actually fit the role. 

A few years later and the original pm left for another company, and our old lead was promoted out of seniority, not skill, and his half of the job was given to someone the lead snuck in that had oreviously been fired and put on a no rehire list a decade ago, claiming he was a different guy. That lasted until a few weeks ago, when our client had enough and forced our company to remove him from the role or lose the contract. 

They did so, but now they have 3 people in a 2 person job, so they had to pick one to get rid of. The new PM chose ""Jake"", over the newer guy. He doesn't know his mistake yet, as he's only been here a few days. ""Jake"" had been doing most of the acting PM duties, and the client absolutely adores him. He has automated half of this job for the entire location, but all his programs will cease to function without him very soon, and no one even knows how to do the role without them any longer. It won't actually effect my job so this is going to be ""fun"" watching everything crumble around me. 

So now, the guy that ""Jake "" originally replaced because of his inability, was now put back into that role, but with more than double the employees and workload to manage, and no idea what the current job entails. 

But back to my main concern. He was fired at the end of shift. Told it was his last day, and he would need to have everything returned and office cleared by Friday. This was over the phone. 

He went home, and had told everyone that needed to know, including our client. Many contacts there were very eager to hear he had been fired, because that nullifies our no poachint clause in the contract, and they would be very happy to being him onboard with  them. About 6 PM the new PM called him and offered to give him another position in a different system as a temporary paycheck while he finds something new. 
One of the client contacts advised against accepting another job from our company, because he would then have to then quit later when he gets any official offer, which would bring  the client poaching concern back. 
He texted our current PM back saying thanks for the extra opportunity but no thanks. 

As this entire situation happened after work hours and mostly verbally, there was no official paperwork yet. He was going to come in and gather all his paperwork and get his stuff. 

At some point overnight, the PM and district supervisor, have now shifted the story to ""Jake"" quitting on his own, and are refusing to give him an official notice of termination. We can only assume it's an attempt to block any benefits he is due, or just to be spiteful and block the client from hiring him. 
The only physical evidence of any of this happening is the 1 text of him declining being rehired hours later. 

What can he do?

TLDR: friend was fired, employer to rehire later. Now is claiming he quit instead and we assume its to deny benefits.

1mwb22i,Career transition advice from Marine Engineer to Offshore Wind.,"Hi all,

I’m currently sailing as a Third Engineer (Gas Engineer) on LPG/gas carriers, with around 2 years of sea time. My role involves:

Operating and maintaining main/auxiliary engines, compressors, and cargo machinery (including Burckhardt compressors).

Managing maintenance schedules, troubleshooting mechanical/electrical systems, and ensuring safe/economical operation of propulsion and cargo-handling equipment.

Overseeing engine room team tasks, safety checks, and compliance with international regulations (ISM/ISPS, MARPOL, SOLAS).


While I enjoy the technical challenges, I want to transition into the offshore wind industry, specifically in the installation domain — but in a more managerial/project-focused role rather than staying on the tools.

I’d love advice from people in the industry on a few things:

1. Project Management Certifications – Would something like PMP, PRINCE2, or APM really help me stand out for installation/project management roles in offshore wind? Or should I focus first on getting into the industry and then pursue certification?


2. Relevant Offshore/Industry Courses – For someone with my background aiming for management, which trainings are worth pursuing upfront? (GWO BST, BOSIET, offshore HSE, or renewables-focused project management courses).


3. Career Pathway – Given my marine engineering/gas carrier experience, what’s the most realistic entry route into offshore wind project or installation management? Do people with my profile usually start in site/operations coordination and then move up, or is there a more direct route?



My long-term goal is to combine my marine/offshore engineering experience with leadership in renewable energy projects. I’m trying to figure out whether a project management certification is the best investment right now, or whether it makes more sense to first stack up offshore safety/technical tickets to get my foot in the door.

Any advice or personal experiences from people who’ve made this move would be really appreciated 🙏

1mw8a18,"Should I move to Hong Kong for work, or stay in London for career + relationship stability?","Hi everyone,  
I (29F) work in professional services for Private Equity clients in London and I’ve been offered the chance to relocate to Hong Kong for two years to lead our Indian PE client segment (with potential to expand to ANZ too). On paper it’s a fantastic opportunity, but I’m torn and would love some perspective.

**Career/financial side:**

* **Hong Kong upside:**
   * I’d likely save \~£60–100k more over two years compared to staying in London (lower taxes, higher savings rate, larger end-of-mandate bonus).
   * It would give me international exposure, managing clients in Asia — a unique differentiator on my CV and a plus for pretty much any future career move (apart from if I wanted to try to move into PE in Europe)
   * Living in another continent would push me out of my comfort zone, personally and professionally.
* **Hong Kong downsides:**
   * London is the hub for European mega-funds. Staying here keeps me closer to the networks that matter most for future PE/consulting opportunities.
   * HK exposure is impressive, but possibly less directly relevant if I want to return to Europe or move to the US or Dubai long term.
   * Relocation would mean leaving behind the familiarity of my support network in London.

**Relationship side:**

* I’ve recently started dating someone I really like (after being single for a long time).
* His work is flexible, so in theory he could spend time in HK, but realistically it would still mean long-distance or disruption.
* I’ve always said I’d never let a man dictate my career, but this is the first relationship in years that feels worth considering in a major decision.

**The dilemma:**  
Do I take the leap, knowing the financial upside and international experience could really boost my career profile — but risk straining a new relationship and stepping away from the London networks most relevant for my industry?  
Or do I stay, keep building my career here, and give this relationship the chance to grow — even if it means passing up an adventure and potential financial upside?

Has anyone here faced a similar career vs. personal life decision, especially with an international move? How did you weigh long-term career positioning vs. relationships and stability?",Francesca007,3,1.0,4,1755775710,2025-08-21 11:28:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mw8a18/should_i_move_to_hong_kong_for_work_or_stay_in/,8,2025

1mw4g9h,Second Thoughts on accepting offer,"Earlier this month I accepted an offer at a small start up in tech in the sf bay area. 

At the time, the base salary and bonus was higher overall by 25k (and they offered a sign on bonus of 10k). Company has a hybrid work mandate (2 days a week in office - not a terrible commute for me). It is essentially a lateral title but a larger scope role which excited me.

Current company made a surprise pay increase that essentially marched the total comp (albeit with a smaller base salary and larger bonus but paid annually vs quarterly) before I even mentioned I was leaving. Current company is 100% remote for me and I manage a global team.

My manager/mentor was obviously devastated to learn i wanted to leave. He said he will support any decision, but felt i wasn't making a rational decision as there are some big things happening in the coming months at our company that will give me big exposure career wise, and potentially a decently financial gain (secondary offering of my rsu).

I have already vested all my current shares , but will be missing out on doubling my shares from a rsu top up that is still vesting (we are pre ipo).

Why am I having second thoughts?
- I have a big brand at my current company and am well respected
- I have time flexibility and my manager let's me do what I want 
- the prospect of the upcoming changes at the company is making me feel fomo
 - my current company is the top player in our space. The new company is smaller and in a crowded space, but Is going through some major transformation
- my boss/mentor has never steered me wrong, and has told me if I'm going to leave then I should go somewhere I can have a higher title (senior director or vp) and a large salary increase. And be at a more prestigious company.
- I have two young children (one in elementary and another starting preschool) and after school started this week, was reminded why wfh is so good lol
- hr and my manager have both strongly implied they will pay more to keep me.

Im frankly stuck. I truly believe my boss is keeping my best interest at heart. We've worked together for more than 10 years and he brought me here to my current role, has always given me raises and promotions without me asking. 

However I wanted to leave for a reason
- I was getting tired of the politics of the company senior readership and lack od defined strategy 
- despite being a top company things still seem uncertain in other aspects of the business (eg sales, product) 
- I wanted more exposure to other aspects of the business (which my manger says he will support)
- I wanted a smaller company
- I wanted to be able to go to an office when I want/need to. My currently company is in NYC, and while I can travel to any of our offices around the world each quarter, its been hard being so isolated as well
- I want to also make my own career and find my own way
- my mentor is great but not because he taught me things, he empowered me to figure out things and develop things on my own. I feel like i have reached a ceiling where I need more guidance

So, should I reneg on my new job and stay? Or should I make the jump and risk and move on?",nom_nom_noms91,1,1.0,2,1755761897,2025-08-21 07:38:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mw4g9h/second_thoughts_on_accepting_offer/,8,2025

A bit about my background: I completed my BMS in 2007 and have since gained 18 years of work experience in Marketing. While I couldn't pursue an MBA earlier due to various reasons, at 38, I believe a master's degree is essential for further career growth. Due to existing financial commitments, a full-time or executive MBA from other top institutions isn't feasible for me at this time.

1mw25xe,Physical therapist or excavation worker with potential of co-owning company.,"Okay, here's the deal. I went to school to be a Spanish teacher. I love Spanish, I learned Portuguese too, and took a class of German and Italian. I taught a year of Spanish in a high school setting, I didn't completely despise it, but the writing was on the wall and I wanted out. In the last couple years of my undergrad, I injured myself running and had to go to PT, I went and was floored at the job, I was confused how I didn't know it existed before cause it seemed right up my alley. The rest of my undergrad and through my first year of teaching I kept having second thoughts. Finally, I reached the breaking point and quit teaching to go back to school to be a PT. I love exercising, being healthy, being outdoors, helping people be active and more healthy, and interacting with people. Flashback a bit. I have always loved trucks, constructing equipment, and dirt. During summers of my undergrad, to pay for college, I would go back home and work an excavation job in my best friend's dad's company. I eventually learned how to operate equipment and I am pretty good, I also got my CDL and hauled aggregate in double bellies for a summer and a half. My best friend is going to eventually be the boss of the company. He said he would love for me to come back home and work excavation, become an expert in the equipment, then go in on the company with him 50-50 and grow it together and take on bigger jobs. I don't know which way to go.

PT: 

Pros: 8 hour days, helping people one on one, benefits, salary, easier on the body, eventually run my own practice, decide hours, etc,

Cons: A lot more schooling, debt

Excavation:

Pros: I really like the work and I am good at it, potential to own a company with friend, variety, being outside, big earning potential as company grows but more delayed

Cons: I hate exhaust fumes, I'm an environmentalist so a weird cognitive dissonance there, lower earning at first ($30 an hour but it will grow), average impact on body because I refuse to over exert and abuse my back and these days I am in the equipment nearly all day so in a way an office job, stress of bidding, estimating, and owning a company

I really don't know what to do. For now I am going to keep going to school because my wife is still finishing school. I am doing PT tech/aide jobs to get hours, experience, and an idea of the work, so maybe that will answer my question too. I also have a part of me that is sad I left my language skills behind. 1. What are some things I'm missing? 2. What is something to consider? 3.

1mw1sgm,What do I do?,"So I am in a bit of a dilemma, after several months of job hunting I have finally received and accepted my first offer. This position pays well (salary), privately owned company, good benefits; however, it is an hour drive away from my current residence. They seem like very good people, and would create a very fun work environment. I start this job next week.

The dilemma: I have just heard back after 3 weeks from an older application that I put into a hospital for essentially the same position, about the same pay (hourly) if not a little more. Haven't really seen the benefits yet, however, they are within my town and have emailed me back for a phone screening this friday.

My question is, assuming I pass the phone screening, how would I go about telling my now current employer about my possible interview. Do I even tell them? How would I get that day off to even do my interview? If i get offered, do i take it? Do I put my 2 weeks in already?

Anything helps, this is definitely a blessing and a curse, I do live where there harsh winters so driving an hour would be pretty rough during those times. But I just want to see if anyones been in a similar position or have any good advice for someone young.

1mw1dis,"Being ""too helpful"" as a junior employee is actually killing your career growth","When I started my remote internship, I thought the fastest way to prove myself was to say yes to everything. In fact, I did use the Beyz interview assistant during the interview process. This made me feel that perhaps my fit for this position was not as good as I had presented. At the beginning of my work, I was eager to gain the approval of others. I did tasks disguised as “exposure opportunities” all, like Scheduling meetings, taking notes and random admin.

Then I looked at my time breakdown and realized 60% of my week was going to things that never showed up in performance reviews. My reputation got reliable, responsive, *helpful* and not valuable in ways that mattered for growth.  

I started saying: “I’d be happy to help once I finish [priority project].” People magically found other solutions. When I framed my bandwidth around actual deliverables, I had more time for work that showcased my skills.  

If the task doesn’t build skills or visibility, it’s not helping me and it’s holding me back. I’m trying to channel that volunteer everything energy toward higher-value work.

Right after I turned 23 and graduated with my masters, I somehow managed to land this position with only experience as a Sales Coordinator and an Event Guide in the theme parks. 

I am 3 months into my role and I am not happy. I have some pretty extreme anxiety and am finding event management is really hard on me. I haven’t been able to sleep and feel like I’m in a constant state of stress and anxiety. Now that I am a manager, I have people calling/texting me at all hours of the day. When I have an event going on, I feel like I can’t handle it. I know I am still learning, but I cannot see myself doing this long term.

 I want to pivot to a new career field that is less client based. I do not like having 30+ clients needing me for things at a time. Honestly, I want to get out of event management entirely. I have always been interested in data and numbers, but have no experience besides the data analysis I did for my thesis. I also love finance, but again have no qualifications. 

Is there any career path I could pivot towards with my current experience? Would trying to get a certification help me?

I got married and moved to a very small town 6 months ago for my husband’s job. Honestly? I hate it here and I haven’t been able to find a job to hire me because my Korean isn’t the best. I’ve been applying to remote jobs, coffee shops, anything you can think of and I’ve had no luck. While teaching English I taught myself marketing and graphic design skills to hopefully switch careers cause I wanted to go to something with more progression than teaching English. I’ve had a few interviews with marketing agencies or beauty brands and things go well until they ask where I live and realize I can’t commute every day to Seoul. 

Recently, I had the lucky opportunity to get two offers from two completely different careers: the one I’m hoping to get into and the one I was hoping to leave. You might wonder why I’m asking for advice but hear me out because they both have pros and cons. 

Social media marketing job:
-It’s the career I want to enter 
-I’d have creativity to post for the small business however I want 
-It’s in Seoul (2 hours away) and I’d have to commute twice a week which would cost about $20 a day 
-There’s a one month trial period and if she doesn’t like my work, I’m out. 

Teaching job: 
-Stable income with more pay than the other job (about $1000 more)
-near my house so I don’t have to worry about commuting 
-I wanted to leave this profession in the first place bc it has no real growth 
-I fear getting depressed and settling into this job then quitting my marketing career dreams 

They both have 6 hours a day of work so I can work around my schedule to make my own personal content and do anything else I want on my own time. 

But what do I do?! It feels like a pivotal moment in my life and I’m freaking out so please anyone help…

1mvygbk,Navigating Ultimatum against 2 offers after 50+ interviews (Fixed Income),"For anonymity purposes I'll be a bit vague but hopefully provide enough detail that you all can provide advice/suggestions.

**My ""Resume""**

* B.S. in Mathematics
* 4-6yrs at a company that specializes in Fixed Income Analytics doing various roles
* Leveraged that into a buyside front office research seat covering Agency MBS (last 4-6yrs)

Recently I was asked to relocate to a new office or lose my job. I decided not to move, and was given until year end to find something new. So far I’ve interviewed with \~50 companies (everything from HR screens to 4th rounds). For various reasons, things haven’t lined up until now. I just received two offers at the same time that I need to respond to by Friday EOD.

Here are the options:

**Job 1**

* **Money:** Base > current, bonus < current, some equity. Total comp basically flat vs where I am now. Sign on bonus of $20-$30k.
* **Work-life:** 5 days in office, but hours are reasonable and some flexibility (occasional WFH/early leave).
* **Career trajectory opinion:** Slightly worse. Role is at a multi-asset (equity-centric) shop, but it’s middle office, not really aligned with my fixed income background and recent front office potential.

**Job 2**

* **Money:** \~15% higher total cash, \~25% higher total comp when factoring in a favorable equity program. Sign on bonus of $20-$30k. Will still qualify for this year end prorated bonus too.
* **Work-life:** Strong. 4 days in office, \~9–4 hours. Very good benefits: generous family leave, some work-from-anywhere days, unlimited PTO/sick (team says most people take 4–6 weeks).
* **Career trajectory:** Pretty dead end I think? It’s a ratings agency doing new-issue ratings for securitized products. That said, they’ll cover 80% of a master’s program, so I could potentially use that to pivot (ex: compsci/data/quant) if needed down the road?

**Current job:** I technically have until December which is after my year-end bonus of 30-70k. I also get to vest another $25k of my 401k.

**Question:**  
Given the trade offs; flat comp but middle office vs higher comp but career dead end—would you lock one in, or keep rolling the dice for 2–3 more months hoping for another front office buyside role? The risk is obvious: unemployment in Jan if nothing pans out.

What’s pushing me toward taking something is that \~50 interviews only led to these 2 offers, so I’m questioning how hire-able I really am right now.

1mvxmv8,Should I finish a degree even though I probably won’t enter the field?,"Title says it all… 

Basically 21M and I have three semesters of a CS degree. I’ve come to the realization that I hate software engineering, I’m not smart and talented enough for it, I really struggle with depression, and it’s gonna be a piece of paper because I failed to get an internship this past summer due to the market being really hard and my general disinterest. 

Classes start tmmrw and currently employed in an unpaid research lab and paid as a TA for one of my professors. 

I really can’t switch to another major bc I go to college out of state. My scholarship covers the last two semester and I already will have to take out a loan to pay for the other 3d. Military is out of the table for me, I have asthma and I have to be off my meds for two years and then apply with a waiver, already talked to a recruiter :(. 

In all likelihood, I will probably be another underemployed male when I graduate, either that or become an opiod addict. I’m kicking myself for not being smarter, having more courage to switch and a mix of both. Better yet, I should have never gone to college, I’m really not cut out for it and corporate America, or really life right now. 

Question is now, should I stick out and finish or drop out? My career prospects are going to be the same regardless in my mind, I’m so lost and I need some guidance, can’t talk to anyone, not many ppl are in my position. I’m not blaming anyone, but really I have nobody to blame but myself. I know nobody can save me, it’s me but I don’t trust myself to save myself because I myself got into this situation in the first place.

1mvxbp1,"MBA + 7 YOE in Analytics, H1B Visa — Should I Do an MSBA or PhD to Re-Enter the U.S. and Get Market-Ready?","Hi all — I could use some strategic advice.

I’m an international MBA grad (STEM-designated, analytics track) with \~7 years of experience across GTM planning, revenue operations, product marketing, and data analytics. After my MBA, I worked on data-heavy consulting projects in tech and healthcare — segmentation, forecasting, omnichannel optimization, etc.

But here’s where things get rough:

* I’ve been **unemployed since Jan 2025**
* My **H1B was approved in 2022**, but I lost it when I was laid off in Dec 2024
* I now carry **$150K+ in student loan debt**
* I’ve applied to 100s of jobs since, but keep getting ghosted or rejected — mostly due to lack of current work authorization

I’m now considering doing a **STEM-designated MSBA or PhD** starting in 2026 to:

* Re-enter the U.S. on an F1 visa
* Deepen my technical skills and become more **market-ready**
* Gain time to rebuild my profile and land a cap-exempt H1B job by 2027

Here’s what I’m wrestling with:

* I already have an MBA — will doing an MSBA make me look overqualified or desperate?
* I’ve **already used OPT**, so I won’t get it again — but I *do* still have time left on my H1B (under 6 years used), so I’m hoping to find a sponsor mid-program
* Financially, this is risky — I’d be adding **another $60–80K in debt**, banking on finding a job by 2027

So... am I crazy for considering this?

Is MSBA (or PhD) a smart play for a visa reset and career reboot — or just doubling down on sunk cost?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s done MBA → MSBA or MS in AI and actually *got hired* off the second degree.  
Are there smarter, lower-risk paths I’m not seeing (remote → L1, Canada PR, online programs, etc.)?

1mvw79r,What should I study if I will be graduating (and entering the workforce) between 2030 and 2035 ?,"I am so stressed about my future. Like I said in the title, I will graduate around 2030–2035, and I have just finished my first year in college. I just don't know if I should switch to something else. The job market seems terrifying, and I also need to get out of my country as it is very suffocating and misogynistic.

I am studying pharmacy  should I switch to something else? Does pharmacy have good job prospect ?(especially if I want to immigrate to Australia or Canada)? I come from an underdeveloped and misogynistic country, and I feel like I have to predict what degree would still be relevant when I graduate,
And would still give good opportunity, especially for immigration, and also give stability (no lay off ) ,and a decent salary and in general low unemployment 
It is not only about my future career  it is basically about my independence. I feel like if I choose badly, I will live a miserable life in my country with no opportunities. Cage at home 

I will list some fields that exist in my country, and maybe you can help me find the one with the best future and the one that could help me immigrate and build a better life. Obviously, if you have other suggestions, I am open.

All the basic engineering fields (chemical, mechanical, electronic, civil, process, industrial)

Quality, Health, Safety, and Environment

Environmental engineering

Renewable Energy Engineering
Water treatment 

AI engineering

Cybersecurity

Data science

Autonomous systems (engineering, I suppose)

Nanoscience and nanotechnology

Automation engineering
If you can maybe give insight of a how each field is in term of job and career 
Just help me choose please 🥺 🙏🏻

1mvw31x,Want to resign from my current role without any job lined up!,"Hi everyone, I really need some guidance.

I’m currently working as a Talent Acquisition Specialist at a small company. I have 3 years of HR experience outside of Canada, and I’m also very close to completing my CHRP designation (about a month away).

Right now, I’m extremely burnt out in my role. The company has no proper systems in place — everything has to be built from scratch. There’s little respect for HR, I never received any proper training, and most of what they rely on is my past experience. Unfortunately, this means I haven’t been able to add anything meaningful to my portfolio while working here.

The salary is not aligned with the workload, the commute is draining, and the overall mismanagement makes even small tasks unnecessarily difficult. On top of that, the work culture is quite negative, and it has started to affect me personally. I’ve lost motivation, I feel exhausted every day, and it’s now impacting both my health and my job search. I’ve even had a panic attack at work and I’m considering getting a doctor’s note to take sick leave. Since my company doesn’t support short-term disability or paid leave, I’m wondering if I could qualify for EI during this period.

My questions are:
	•	Has anyone been in a similar situation? How long did it take you to land a new role after leaving?
	•	Should I resign without anything lined up, given the toll this job is taking on my health?
	•	How is the HR/Talent Acquisition job market right now in Canada?
	•	What is the process for getting EI if I go on sick leave with a doctor’s note?
      •     Also i have sort of okay savings and my husband is working at the moment no kids, and renting a house atm. 

Any advice, personal experiences, or encouragement would mean a lot.",Vegetable_Prize7425,0,0.5,7,1755735621,2025-08-21 00:20:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mvw31x/want_to_resign_from_my_current_role_without_any/,8,2025

1mvvzfp,IT Helpdesk and advocating for myself,"So I work as an IT Support Tech in Canada. Recently we did a work trip out of town where I worked 4 days that had 4-6 hours of overtime. When I asked my manager I was told that overtime didn’t count and each day was counted in my salary as regular time. I checked my contract and employee hand book which said overtime needs to be paid. I was very frustrated by manager for saying that all the extra time I worked was for free. I had an organic call with the vice president of it operations and told him about the overtime part and that there should be some form of compensation. I was later told that the time I worked would be compensated as lieu time as straight time with is 1 for 1 instead of time and a half. I was happy I at least got something, now my manager has been acting weird around me, acting like I’m kind of a moron at certain things which wasn’t his impression of me before all this happened.

1mvvyyh,Merrill vs JPM,"To keep it brief, i am really in a pickle as to whether i should be moving jobs (currently at merrill - about to progress to what’s called ADP-FA) or move to JPM, presumably lose most of my current clients, and start from scratch as a private client advisor there. They make the grass seem much greener on that side of the fence but i have to exercise some healthy skepticism and DD. I’d be working in a JPM Chase Branch vs where im at currently is a WM office with Merrill. I really really like my current office culture and the people but im not sure if it presents as good a chance to grow as JPM. Then again… idrk. I also dont love the idea of working in a branch again which i did for a while before moving to wealth management office. If i stayed at merrill the base salaries are quite similar as well as grid rate. My number one consideration should probably be which spot gives me a better chance of growing over the next 3-5 years and forget about comfort. Im young.

1mvvy6g,Does it feel like building a career today is harder than ever?,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot. Finding a job is tough, but it feels like the bigger challenge is actually *building* a career:

* Endless applications and ghosting.
* Job descriptions stacking 3 roles into one.
* The fear of AI replacing parts of what we do.
* Even when you land something, climbing to the next runway feels like another uphill battle.

Curious — how do you all deal with this? Do you think careers are genuinely harder to build today, or is it just the same struggles in a new form?

I’ve been experimenting with tools to bring structure into it. One that stood out was **youe: AI career coach** (App/Play Store) — it maps runways, helps draft 90-day plans, and acts like a companion to guide you through the noise.

1mvug19,Laid off 3 months ago… Is accepting Part Time work temporarily frowned upon while looking for your next role?,"Hey all - I got laid off 3 months ago and am currently going through the ringer that everyone else seems to be facing with being ghosted after multiple rounds and automated rejection replies after spending hours curating every resume and cover letter to the role and matching my voice. 

It’s got me thinking that this could be a longer game than anticipated as companies going into Q4 don’t like to hire. Since there’s basically 1 month left before that happens, I’m thinking that maybe taking on multiple part time jobs while up-skilling and looking for work will help me keep afloat and sustain balance all so that I don’t get completely drained of my cash reserves.

My concern is - Do companies/recruiters frown upon those working multiple part time gigs (even if it’s unrelated - ie; a former Sales Account Manager working at Dominos doing pizza delivery)? 

Thankfully, time is relatively on my side here but when I get closer to landing the next role the employment gap only gets further and I’m worried that it will impact just further impact my chances and I’ll be stuck in this loop. Does anyone else share this same sentiment and thought?

1mvube0,Was previously bullied away from contacting HR. Now don't know what to do.,"In my previous department, there was a guy who was weird with me. For example, he would tell me the same joke several times a week but wouldn't tell anyone else. He once jumped on my car to startle me. I told him to stop and he didn't do anything else that crossed the line until winter 2023. I never reported the car jumping because he stopped the really inappropriate behavior and stuck with the weird but G-rated jokes.

There was a woman in HR. My boss had previously told me she had told another woman at work that this is America and she should speak English. I had told my boss I was uncomfortable with this HR lady's behavior and specifically told her not to discuss anything about me with the HR lady unless it involved the job training project our department was working on.

Winter 2023 my boss approached me and said the HR lady referenced above thinks the way the guy talks to me is ""weird"" and she and the HR lady want to report this guy to HR together. I asked her not to. Privately, I was uncomfortable because the fact that my boss and the HR lady seemed suspicious and I didn't want to get further attention from the HR lady, who I already went at great lengths to ignore.

The next day the guy increased his frequency of telling jokes to me to several times a day. This was during a busy season when I had a job to do that required my full, uninterrupted attention. I asked him to stop and he just stood behind me and kept talking. I put my headphones in and he said, ""Maybe if I touch her shoulders, she'll pay attention to me."" I told him, ""Do not touch me."" He left and came back. This time I yelled at him. I didn't want to, but I felt like my boss was using HR to make me uncomfortable so I didn't report or use the appropriate channels.

About a month later he made a joke that the company should follow me around with cameras at all times. I told him not to make jokes like that. He laughed. I reiterated not to make jokes like that. Then he said, ""Sorry.""

The next day he tried to offer me donuts. I yelled at him that I would like to clarify that the jokes he shouldn't use around me are about stalking. He left me alone.

Six months later, I saw him rummaging around my desk, it looked like near my purse. I saw him from across the room. I said, ""Stay away from my desk, stay away from my car, and do not talk to me and do not touch my stuff.""

Around that time my boss, who had lots of emotional issues throughout the time I have worked there, got worse. Examples were implying she was suicidal, crying during meetings when she didn't get her way with people at her level or higher (I would never challenge her), asked me to delay giving a VP info on purpose and to ""tell him I'm a bitch"" if he asked why, constantly looking for proof I was screwing up on my job to the point I had trouble getting work done because I was responding to questions I wasn't following procedures when she wasn't even looking at the correct SOP, interrupting me while I told her about an emerging situation to ask someone to get a document I was requesting to resolve the situation and when I clarified I needed a different document, she said, ""No you meant (the first document)"" in an angry voice, inviting me to team bonding lunches with the HR lady and I had to listen to the HR lady gossip about employees, including one where she suspected someone was going to get promoted and ""He's not a good manager but he's brown."" It got to the point where it was distracting and difficult to do my job. Unfortunately the job market was tight and my attempts to find a new employer were unsuccessful.

I asked my VP to help us figure out how my boss and I could work together with her behavior issues. In the two days leading to the meeting, the HR lady I am uncomfortable with started saying, ""Hello,"" every time I walked by when normally she didn't. My boss and that HR lady also frequently talked to another HR person. That HR person flashed me a smile. I knew my boss was going to drop a bombshell during the meeting.

My VP said the joke about being a ""bitch"" is just a joke and all my other complaints bordered on insubordination on my end. At the end of the meeting, my boss brought up the incidents where I yelled at the creepy guy and she said in a tone that sounded like it was supposed to intimidate me that I have publicly humiliated a colleague. Mind you, the last time I had said anything to him was more than 3 months prior, so this wasn't current.

I told our VP that the creepy guy had once jumped on the hood of my car. My VP said, ""That shouldn't have happened to you."" 

Two days after the meeting with my VP and my boss, my boss sent me an email and cc'd my VP and said she would put me on a PIP if I had another incident with the creepy guy ever again. My VP did nothing about this act of intimidation. Our VP is usually consulted in employee liability situations, so I figured reporting his inaction and my boss's efforts to intimidate me through our whistleblower policy would get me nowhere.

Finally it was near the end of the year when positions might be opening up. Partial truth I did want to change careers and have new experiences. I asked the director I knew well if he had openings and he said yes and he was interested in letting me transfer. He asked me if I had issues with my manager and I said I was burnt out on my current career and looking for new experiences.

I transferred to my new department a month after annual reviews. They had my old boss do my review. She had someone in HR present. This HR person seems pretty stand-up. She said all my workplace interactions have been great except for with the creeper. I said during the review there were behavior issues from the creeper and I am keeping a log on him. The HR person said, ""It's ok to have opinions about co-workers, but if you do, you should reach out to your manager to see how communication is different, like if all communication can be written."" In my response, I wrote I wasn't sure I understood the details of everything my now former manager had said about the yelling incidents (the order of events were unclear and she had used some subjective language) but that the HR rep. said I should talk to my new manager about issues with employees and that I have no issues discussing personnel concerns with my new manager.

Everything has been great in my department. My new manager and director seem very ethical. My colleagues in my department said there was only one personnel issue and the person who was fired very much deserved it and they were surprised our director stood up to the employee he fired. Very, very employee friendly department. In fact, my previous VP once asked my new director to take on someone previously in my department for a demotion as an alternative to firing and the director of my new department said yes. The point is, things are very lax in my department. The only time I have seem my director stick his neck out was actually to help an employee. Otherwise, he is very nice and agreeable.  
  
The problem is my new manager said I need to do some collaborative work with the creeper. I don't think he knows the back story. I am hoping to have very minimal contact with the creeper. How should I talk to my new manager about this guy? Should I wait until new creepy behavior starts and instead of yelling and go to my current manager for help? Or should I talk to him now? How should I explain the situation to him about the creeper?",anonymous_fish_bowl,11,0.9200000166893005,5,1755731001,2025-08-20 23:03:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mvube0/was_previously_bullied_away_from_contacting_hr/,8,2025

1mvttar,How do I tell my boss I am not moving back to the US?,"Long story short, my husband and I made the decision to move to my home country. Both of us work fully remote for US companies and got permission to work abroad for the summer. I mentioned personal reasons to my boss (which were all true) but in reality we had no plans to return, sold all of our belongings and left at the end of our lease. Now that we are nearing the end of summer I need to come clean and tell them I’m not planning to return to the US. My plan is to write my boss an email the day before our next one on one meeting. That way he has time to digest the information and doesn’t feel totally blindsided. I need advice on exactly how to frame this. I really like my boss and the people I work with. This is not a resignation letter. I am essentially asking if (1) there is any feasible way for me to stay on in my current role while living abroad- I think this is highly unlikely but plan to ask anyway because why not, I have nothing to lose and (2) if I cannot stay on permanently, how long can I stay on temporarily? 

Question 2 is what I need the most help with framing. Is there anything I need to say or avoid saying in this case? For example, if I avoid mentioning resigning, is there any chance I am eligible for severance or unemployment. Because effectively my company is ending my employment since I’m not willingly resigning? 

Other facts that might be helpful:
- I have dual citizenship and still have an address in the US
- my company is in a hiring freeze and I know my boss is very desperate to keep me at the moment, there is a chance I may be eligible to switch into a consulting role
- I do not have anything else lined up in my home country so it’s in my best interest to keep this job as long as possible
- my home country has a tax agreement with the US and I am not taxed on foreign income here until I have stayed in the country at least 6 months (I’ve already talked to a lawyer about this)
- I really like my boss, he is truly one of the nicest people and has gone to bat for everyone one of our team. I want to stay on good terms and make this as easy as a transition for him regardless of what happens.

1mvti9h,Is it wrong to mention you have a learning disability in a job interview?,"TLDR: I have a learning disability and will occasionally mention it in job interviews when it seems appropriate to mention it, but I have been told to no longer do this by others. What should I do? 

Hi y’all! This may sound like a silly question, but I am so lost in this job market and have no clue what is right and wrong when it comes to interviews. For some background, I have dyslexia and have been diagnosed since a young age (think ages between 3 to 5). I recently graduated from university after studying psychology, and am taking time to explore careers before I return to a masters. I am interested working with neurodivergent clients, as I feel like I can relate to the population, and when I do interview for positions focusing on a neurodivergent population, I like to mention my own experience with my learning differences. I don’t do this in every interview, but I thought that sometimes it would allow me to relate a bit more. Lately I have been told by others that I should not mention it, and I had one person tell me that they wouldn’t mention they are menopausal in an interview (as it is unnecessary), so I should do the same with my learning disability. I do understand their sentiment to some extent, but I also can’t imagine an employer not moving forward with my application solely because of my disability. However, I can’t help but wonder if this is something I should keep to myself, even though it is a decent part of my identity.

1mvt2cx,Feeling stuck and directionless,"I graduated in 2021 with a stem degree with the hopes I'll work a good Office IT job just like most everyone else who gets a degree in an IT like field. I did work as an S.E. for sometime but was hit with layoff after which I stepped down into tech support for sometime. 

I decided that I was doing crap and not even able to afford a place with Helpdesk and came across what I thought and seemed to have been a great opportunity for someone with my experience. It was a lot better than Helpdesk but maybe not as good as an S.E. 
I'm talking about a network field engineer working in telecom.
 
I was given the job description, I knew what I was getting myself into and wanted to see if I could mold a career from it as I was told by the recruiter and my buddy from Uni who got me into it(he was part of the consulting group that hires and trains) that I can move into a systems admin or NOC position with the initial experience in the field. Not just because of the looming threat of AI and layoffs in the actual IT industry but also because I had so little experience in IT after graduating when most employers look for 3-5 years in the industry just to get a liveable wage job. 

Over the last 2 years I've been to over 200 sites, driven 35000 miles and basically freakin tarzaned myself through forested or desert mountains where a site was located on top of because I didn't have a 4x4 with enough traction and rear wheel power to get to. I'd also used to work long hours, of course being compensated for OT if I did as well as gas, hotel stays, meals, etc... if I ended up being away from home. I just realized soon why no one really who graduated in an IT field wanted to do this role. It's taxing on your body, mind and vehicle. 

I'm wondering if my two years of experience in this position will get me anywhere now and what prospects I have of stepping up in my career working what basically comes off as a blue collar role on paper. 

One thing for sure is that I have job security in this role, like I mentioned there's not a robot that can be automated to do this work for the next several years to come and in addition, there is plenty of work and decent pay but not extraordinary.

1mvsezu,Hit a breaking point and need some advice,"Hey all, 

I've been at my current job for three years. The pay is solid, the people are nice, and the company is generally decent to employees. No long hours or weekend work, etc.

The problem is that there's no direction, and my job has completely changed on at least five occassions: I began as a newsletter editor for two brands in 2022, and then I became the sole managing editor of those brands a year ago.   
  
Since then, there have been massive layoffs, my department has lost nearly all its resources, and I've had to keep finding ways to grow with virtually no budget. (I am a content person, but because of the layoffs and other turnover, I wound up in charge of ads, sponsorships, contracts, etc.)

Recently, I was moved to a *completely* new department to oversee some revenue-generating projects for the brand. That was about three weeks ago — three weeks full of onboarding and training. Now, the job has changed *again* due to circumstances outside of my control, and I am being shifted to more of a ""floater."" This means I'm not managing anything and am instead just inputting fixes as requested by our SEO and revenue teams. It's a companywide mandate, not a sign that I was not learning the job fast enough.

I am usually a team player and I understand how the needs of the business can sometimes cause these radical changes in direction. But it's just always *something*, and I feel like I don't have another wholesale position change in me. I've had four different managers in 12 months. I feel passionless and directionless, and I really think I need to jump ship.  
  
My question is: Do all of these changes sound abnormal? I've never experienced anything like it, but I haven't worked at *that* many companies.",Kamandi62,1,1.0,0,1755726405,2025-08-20 21:46:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mvsezu/hit_a_breaking_point_and_need_some_advice/,8,2025

The problem is that my store has nice benefits. I’m 40% vested in their stock program and their insurance is pretty good.

My main concerns are:
-The pay for the salaried job is only a couple thousand higher than what I’d make currently at full time.
-The only benefit listed is paid vacation and a $400 stipulation to help pay for my own insurance. Insurance at my job only costs $45 a month. 
-I’m starting my Masters degree online soon, so, keeping both jobs may not be an option.

1mvr4yx,"I keep trying to reinvent and rebrand myself, but nothing seems to be working.","I graduated college in 2022 with a BA in Media Arts, which essentially means I have skills for filmmaking, digital art, communications and even marketing. That first summer, I went all in on the film and video production side, but everything was too portfolio-based, competitive, and just contract work. In fact, the job I finally managed to get that Fall was a multi-level contract. Then, over the past couple years, I'd been learning coding and things for the video game industry, but that industry is almost just as bad with portfolios and competition.

I've recently tried to come back to the media industry, under more of an AV tech role, but that hasnt been working out either. Everything on LinkedIn seems to be contracts and fake jobs, and I dont know where else to look. The only positive result I got was a screening with a medical software company called Epic in WI, but even that was eventually a rejection. 

I'm in the more farm suburb area of MN, which doesnt offer a lot in any of these career choices. The Epic position would've at least been a reimbursed relocation. Thing is, my skills, college and job experience all fit with AV, film, and related areas, but I'm sick of relying on portfolios. I do know some coding and design techniques from practicing game dev (though math isnt a strong suit), but without a matching degree, it might not matter. I dont like LinkedIn and Glassdoor (Indeed is full of scammers too), but its hard when you dont know what company websites to look for. 

In general, I care less now about getting into my ""dream career"", since I could at least do that in my free time. Software and Tech seem to be the way forward for me but im not sure.

I thought I’d be able to handle dealing with residents as they needed help and I was dead wrong and burst into tears and had an emotional breakdown yesterday. Along with that the management isn’t necessarily the best when it comes to both training (we have people who have been there for two weeks already training folks) and communication. On top of that corporate just came in yesterday and told the management they have to cut hours and people on shift so I’d essentially be doing double to triple the work for the same pay.

1mvqoln,Burnt Out in Clinical Research and Unsure of My Next Steps,"Sorry for the disorganized nature of the following word vomit. Including a more concise TLDR at the top, and thank you so much for any thoughts and/or advice you might have.

*TLDR*
I have a music therapy background but transitioned into clinical research, where I now manage large NIH-funded mindfulness trials as a Senior Project Coordinator. Despite excelling in project management, I lack hard technical skills (e.g. coding, data analysis and statistics) and feel stuck in a stressful and underpaid role. 

I also juggle freelance consulting (~20 hrs/week) to make ends meet, leaving me overworked, burnt out, and socially isolated; I originally pursued this path to get into a clinical psych PhD program. Doubts about academia, financial insecurity, and the unstable grant landscape make me question if that’s still right. I’m unsure if I should reapply to PhD programs, take more psych coursework to get my psych undergrad degree, hold out for a FT role with collaborators, or pivot into a better-paying field that values my skills.

*Further Background*
I have a bit of an odd/diversified background. I have an undergraduate degree in music therapy with a concentration in music composition and classical guitar. Minor in psychology. Also worked as a professional sushi chef for 3 years, but I don’t want to work in food service anymore. 

I moved to a major city in 2020. Starting in 2021, I was able to finesse a volunteer position in an ivy clinical lab that researches mindfulness. In that time, I was able to get promoted to Senior Project Coordinator. I’ve worked on several projects, always simultaneously. Currently I manage 2 large randomized controlled trials, one of which is national, supervising a team of research assistants and volunteers, interacting with our review board, reporting to the NIH, and generally overseeing the success of these trials. I’m very good at this job by now, and know a ton about how to manage interdisciplinary teams, run a clinical trial, and create some formidable excel formulas, but this job has not given me any desirable hard skills (coding languages, data processing, etc.) Often I just feel like my job is organizing, planning, verifying work, and generating/submitting reports. This job has been becoming increasingly more stressful and exhausting, and I don’t know how much more I can take for the meager wages I get. It is truly all encompassing. 

I initially took this job to give me a leg up applying to clinical psych PhD programs, and didn’t necessarily plan to be here this long. I applied to clinical psych programs 2 years ago and didn’t get in. I’m so uncertain about what I would want to study, and with how much of a nightmare it is at the NIH right now, I’ve had serious doubts about a career spent endlessly applying for and relying on grants. I also have been financially insecure for my whole entire life, and I’m very resistant to the idea of slumming it as a grad student for at least 5 years.

Currently, I also have a 2nd freelance job doing consulting work with one of our research partners at $30/hour. I was supposed to get hired FT by that company earlier this year, but the changes at the NIH completely nuked that plan for now. 

So, now I’m stuck working FT in a lab that has only become increasingly stressful and overwhelming. I was added to my current projects because they were a mess, and my PIs knew I could fix it. In order to make ends meet in this very expensive city, I have to work an additional ~20 hours with my 2nd job, so my work weeks are averaging out at about 55-65 hours every week. 

Because I work so much out of necessity, my social life has started to crumble, my hobbies are taking the back seat, my resilience is eroding, and I’m feeling tired, angry, and unwell almost all the time. With the small amount of free time I have, I want to be applying to jobs, but it feels like the job market for clinical research is either poverty wages, or just impossibly competitive. I have openness to other fields, but I just don’t even know what would pay well or be a good fit for my experiences. 

In my head, I feel like with a senior project coordinator title I should be able to land a well-paying job. Simultaneously, I wonder if I should just suck it up and apply to PhD programs again. Or maybe I should take a few more undergraduate courses and earn a 2nd major in psych. 

Or, maybe I should count my blessings and just take my daily beatings for now in my current job with the hopes of getting a FT job with our research collaborators. 

Small note, using my music therapy degree isn’t an option. I did a required internship, but never sat for the required exam. Passing the exam would take a ton of time and energy I don’t have, and that job market is shit.

I’ve been working in restaurants for a whole decade and finished my undergrad in 2022 with a BA in English. I was always a passionate writer, but AI started to blow up shortly after I graduated and all writers were getting replaced. I felt like I just went through 6 years of school for nothing and despite applying for hundreds of jobs 6 hours a day every day, I never had any luck. I’ve had a one year stint as a medical receptionist and while I loved the hours and benefits, it is IMPOSSIBLE to survive in New Jersey off of $15-20 an hour. I got myself into massive credit card debt, medical debt, you name it. I decided to go back to bartending *temporarily* to rebuild my savings and pay off my debts but nowadays, we make less money than we did pre-pandemic due to less people going out and I’m starting to develop serious chronic pain with age. 

I’m tired of being broke and stuck in a job where I have to break my back, not have benefits, never spend time with friends and family, never go on vacation, etc. and I’ve been applying for other jobs NONSTOP for the past few months with no luck. It feels like applying for jobs is a full-time job itself—I’ll apply for 200 in a week and maybe get one interview, and then they always find someone else. 

I don’t even care about finding a writing job anymore. After everything I’ve been through, I just want something with a livable salary and reasonable schedule so I can focus on what I really love to do outside of work. I’ve heard all the “just highlight skills you picked up from bartending that could translate to another job” but it seems like employers don’t give a shit about that and just toss my resume anyway.

1mvnu7x,What should I do to get a good paying job in this IT market?,"I really need some guidance right now. I completed my Master’s in Computer Applications (MCA) back in 2022. Unfortunately, I wasted almost 3 years being lazy and not working towards building my career. Right now, I’m 26, working in a customer service job with not-so-great pay, and I feel like I’m way behind my peers.

With the ongoing layoffs and tough job market, I’m scared and regretting my past decisions. I feel stuck and don’t know where to start.

I want to build a career in IT (since I have my degree), but I’m confused about what to pursue. I’m looking for good online courses/certifications that are actually in demand right now. Areas I’ve seen people talk about include:

Data Analytics / Data Engineering

Cybersecurity

Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, GCP)

Full Stack Development

AI/ML


Given my situation (no experience, customer service background, MCA degree), what would be the most realistic and future-proof path to start with? I don’t want to waste more time, I just want to put my head down and build skills that can actually land me a job.

Any advice, resources, or even personal experiences would be really appreciated. I’m honestly scared but I want to change my life before it’s too late.

1mvnpsd,24 have money but working a dead end job and have no passion for anything.,"Been working at a factory the last few years. It's complete hell, I make meh money. But I don't have to pay for transportation so it's technically better than a job that's father out that pays a bit more /the same cause transportation costs. There's basically no room for advancement tho. They say we gonna train you for x position then never do or say when we get time which never happens.

I've managed to save over 120k since I live with my folks and they charge me a minimal rent as I also help out around the house/run errands for them. 

I don't really want to do this for the rest of my life but I also don't have many skills. All I do is pile boxes and check to make sure everything is labeled and wrap them for shipping. 

Tried college courses like programming since I'd rather work from home, but i wasn't good at it. 

Have incredibly low attention spawn and can't drive. So while trades would be probably better for me right now I can't since I'm too afraid to drive. 

College is unreliable in our time and feel like I'd just be throwing my hard earned money away unless I'm 100% certain I know what I want in college.

Idk what I should be doing but it feels like I'm not doing enough. I'm sure many would kill to be in my position and I understand. I just don't have much enjoyment Working my job ,nor do I find much interest in other stuff.

1mvnfpt,Offshore Electrical Engineer Salaries and Working Conditions in Europe,"Hi all,

I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate interested in pursuing a career in the offshore wind industry in Europe. I'm looking for roles that are hands-on or field-based, rather than purely office work.

I'm trying to gather information on the following:

* Typical **salary ranges** for offshore electrical engineers (junior to mid-level)
* **Working conditions**: shift schedules, rotation patterns, time offshore vs. onshore
* **Differences between countries** in pay and working environment (e.g., Germany, Netherlands, UK, France, etc.)
* Whether companies offer **daily compensation for time spent offshore**, to cover the inconvenience of being away from home and working in isolated conditions

If you're currently working in the field or have relevant experience, I'd appreciate any insight on:

* Your specific role and responsibilities
* Salary (monthly or yearly, gross)
* Work-life balance
* How to get started in the sector (certifications, entry-level paths, companies to look for)

1mvmysq,Navigating Ultimatum against 2 offers after 50+ interviews (Fixed Income),"For anonymity purposes I'll be a bit vague but hopefully provide enough detail that you all can provide advice/suggestions.

**My ""Resume""**

* B.S. in Mathematics
* 4-6yrs at a company that specializes in Fixed Income Analytics doing various roles
* Leveraged that into a buyside front office research seat covering Agency MBS (last 4-6yrs)

Recently I was asked to relocate to a new office or lose my job. I decided not to move, and was given until year end to find something new. So far I’ve interviewed with \~50 companies (everything from HR screens to 4th rounds). For various reasons, things haven’t lined up until now. I just received two offers at the same time that I need to respond to by Friday EOD.

Here are the options:

**Job 1**

* **Money:** Base > current, bonus < current, some equity. Total comp basically flat vs where I am now. Sign on bonus of $20-$30k.
* **Work-life:** 5 days in office, but hours are reasonable and some flexibility (occasional WFH/early leave).
* **Career trajectory opinion:** Slightly worse. Role is at a multi-asset (equity-centric) shop, but it’s middle office, not really aligned with my fixed income background and recent front office potential.

**Job 2**

* **Money:** \~15% higher total cash, \~25% higher total comp when factoring in a favorable equity program. Sign on bonus of $20-$30k. Will still qualify for this year end prorated bonus too.
* **Work-life:** Strong. 4 days in office, \~9–4 hours. Very good benefits: generous family leave, some work-from-anywhere days, unlimited PTO/sick (team says most people take 4–6 weeks).
* **Career trajectory:** Pretty dead end I think? It’s a ratings agency doing new-issue ratings for securitized products. That said, they’ll cover 80% of a master’s program, so I could potentially use that to pivot (ex: compsci/data/quant) if needed down the road?

**Current job:** I technically have until December which is after my year-end bonus of 30-70k. I also get to vest another $25k of my 401k.

**Question:**  
Given the trade offs; flat comp but middle office vs higher comp but career dead end—would you lock one in, or keep rolling the dice for 2–3 more months hoping for another front office buyside role? The risk is obvious: unemployment in Jan if nothing pans out.

What’s pushing me toward taking something is that \~50 interviews only led to these 2 offers, so I’m questioning how hire-able I really am right now.

Appreciate any perspectives! Let me know if I missed out anything important!",ScrubbedDown,1,1.0,2,1755714360,2025-08-20 18:26:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mvmysq/navigating_ultimatum_against_2_offers_after_50/,8,2025

my_qualification: BCA (specialization in Cybersecurity)

Around the same time as graduation, I had a major ankle surgery and was on bed rest for months. Now I’m recovering — I can walk slowly, still doing physio, but I’m able to study while recovering.

Right now I’m stuck between two paths:

Take a drop year and prepare for competitive exams.

Join any college I get for Master’s and keep going.


I’ve heard from many people that if you’re planning a Master’s, you should go for a good college and that online degrees aren’t really worth it.

So my main questions are:

1. Should I take a drop to prepare for competitive exams?


2. If yes, then which exams are best after BCA for mca collages?


3. Which colleges/universities should I aim for in cybersecurity/computer science if I go the competitive exam route?



I don’t want to randomly join any college and regret later — I want to make a clear plan.

1mvmqfw,High-performing but undervalued? Looking for perspective.,"Hi all, 

I (29F) have about 9 years of professional experience and wanted to get some outside perspective on a workplace dynamic I’ve been navigating. I recently made a sector jump and have been with my current organization for over 3 years. I’ve taken on a lot, perform at a high level, and am starting to wonder if I’m being undervalued—or if I’m overthinking things.

Here are a few things I’ve been experiencing:

- My manager often makes faces or acts confused when I speak even though I rarely encounter this elsewhere. I communicate clearly and have no trouble collaborating across the org.

- She tends to frame my workstream successes as “team wins,” and rarely gives individual credit, even though I lead most of the heavy lifting. That said, at least 3 of 8 senior leaders regularly give me kudos (both in meetings and privately).

- I now hold a lot of institutional knowledge, and I'm often the go-to person for getting things done.

- I’ve had two conversations about salary adjustment—the most recent one included a detailed breakdown of how I’m operating over 100% capacity due to org pivots, that I bring a critical skillset not originally in the job description, and that I’ve been stepping in to cover for a contractor while also translating their work to ensure it aligns with our goals.

Her response was that she thought I was developing these skills on the job—but in reality, I came in with them. 

- I respect my manager and keep her updated regularly on my projects, always open to feedback, but she often pushes back against well-thought-out plans and ideas without clear reasoning.

- Leadership has gone over my head twice, passing off project responsibilities that I had already been leading, without consulting me first and last minute. With this they still expect me to stay connected and ready to support the work stream.

- One of my workstreams recently became a finalist for a national award. I inquired about attending the related conference—something I hadn’t initially planned to ask for—and found out I wasn’t even considered.

Overall, I feel like I’m kept at arm’s length despite my performance. I'm proud of my work, and I know I bring a lot to the table. But I'm starting to wonder:

- Is this type of manager behavior normal?
- Are there internal issues I might be missing?
- Or am I reading too much into all of this?

Would really appreciate insight from anyone who’s navigated similar situations.

1mvm0im,Is this it?,"Not sure how this is going to be received but I’m really exhausted trying to find a role that I really like. 

A little background on my education and experience:

-Bachelors in Marketing (India)
-Worked for a year in a big4 as a risk analyst (India)
-Masters in Business Management (UK)
-Working for a big4 in FS Regulatory Consulting (UK)
- I’m an ACCA Affiliate (it’s more than just accounting)
- FRM Level 1 complete, studying towards L2 (part of grad programme that company pays for)

Post completing my master’s I applied to every marketing role in the UK but couldn’t find one. There were so many sales roles advertised as marketing (they are different and nothing wrong in sales, just that I don’t want to do that). Long story short, got into another Big4 through their graduate programme and I’m now working with firms in the financial services sector. I’ve really tried to like the job but I can’t.

Not that I stopped looking after that but I have been applying but couldn’t get one. It gets very difficult managing studying towards these professional qualifications and work and trying to up-skill myself to get my dream job. And to top it all, I require visa sponsorship; something that not many firms do.

I’m interested in marketing, strategy, performance management (KPIs), business transformation, business and management consulting roles and want to work in the consumer goods and retails industry. 

I know it’s getting late but I’d rather turn now than go further into FS consulting and then start again from scratch; that would be more painful.  

Sometimes I wonder if this is it? As a kid I thought worst thing that can happen is do a job that you hate and lose sleep over it. I hate that this is becoming my reality.

Has anyone gone through similar career paths? I’d really appreciate if I could any advice that will help me land my dream job. I’ll do whatever it takes, just need a decent salary to be able to afford rent and bills and to be sponsored. I’m ready to do the hard work, always have been. I just need one opportunity!

I understand the politics a lot better now and am having to train myself to communicate better. Ie, not saying too much, being frank and to the point, keeping good records of everything.

How long do perceptions follow you in an office? I’ve never done anything particularly egregious but I’ve sidelined myself, people don’t really respect me I’ve noticed (as in I’m just not seen as a serious person).

1mvl1i4,"Weirdest thing happened after I stopped using ""professional"" resume language.","Hey everyone,

Just wanted to share a recent experience that completely changed my job search. Maybe it'll help someone else who's stuck sending out applications into the void.

For months, I was doing the classic thing: sending out dozens of resumes with the same stiff, formal language. You know the type: Leveraged cross-functional synergies to facilitate robust ROI  blah blah blah. I thought that's what ATS systems and hiring managers wanted. I got maybe one callback in 50 applications. It was brutal and my confidence was in the toilet.

Out of frustration, I showed my resume to a friend who's a hiring manager. Her first comment was, This reads like a robot wrote it. I can't tell who you are. She told me that after the ATS filters for keywords, a human looks at it for about 7 seconds. That human is tired, has read 100 of these, and just wants to connect with a person.

Her advice was to write it like a human talks. Not unprofessional, but just... clear and direct. Instead of Responsible for managing a team, try Led a team of 5 and helped them hit their quarterly goals every time. See the difference? One is a duty, the other is a story.

So I spent a whole weekend tearing my resume apart. I got rid of all the corporate jargon and just wrote plainly about what I actually DID and what the RESULTS were. I made it sound like something a real person would say in an interview.

The change was almost immediate. The following week, I got 3 interview requests. The week after, 2 more. Recruiters started writing back with things like, Your experience is so clearly laid out and I love how you quantified your impact.

It seems so simple, but I guess we're all trained to sound ""corporate"" that we forget to sound human. The goal isn't to list your duties; it's to start a conversation on paper.

I didn't even know how to do this properly at first, so I looked for tools that could help analyze the tone. I stumbled on one called Resumeflex (just google it, not linking anything) that was different from the standard ATS keyword stuffers. It actually gave me feedback on making my language more actionable and human-friendly. It was a game-changer for structuring everything.

Anyway, that's my two cents. If you're not getting traction, maybe take a look at your tone.",Positive_College5181,0,0.33000001311302185,2,1755710273,2025-08-20 17:17:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mvl1i4/weirdest_thing_happened_after_i_stopped_using/,8,2025

1mvkdb2,Should I leave my Job despite the upward mobility? Or find somewhere with a healthier environment?,"Hi everyone, I wanted to advice because the advice I have gotten from collogues and others in my industry has been conflicting. I am a lawyer who straight out of law school joined an accounting firm as a consultant. I am currently 5 years in. When I first started my job it was a team of only 4 of us, and that same team is all still here. The sub practice that we are in grew from 4 people to 50 and it felt good to be one of the OG crew. 

The issue comes from me being underpaid at my job and the environment being toxic. I am getting underpaid in relation to people I graduated with and my boss has frequent tantrums. I have spoken to my boss about the pay and he indicates that he is aware, and that is why he is fast tracking my promotions. And he is right about fast tracking my promotions, in just 3 years I was already a tax manager, and by the end of this year he wants to make me a Senior Manager. I have told my boss that I want to make partner and he has told me that he will make me partner by December 2030. In fact he has told other members of the practice repeatedly that ""User will be the next partner here"". 

The second issue is the toxicity. With the fast pace growth we have some less than desirable people at the firm now, very toxic and often it feels like they are out to get me. My boss himself can be very toxic, throwing insults, speaking down to people, never giving clear direction, etc. I started thinking I should leave after a particularly bad tantrum he had three weeks ago then I reflected and realized it had been a pattern of behavior with this guy. 

Now here's where I am conflicted. I already made a name for myself in this firm, I have the respect and ear of the other teams and have a great amount of leverage. I can get away with not even working a day if I wanted to and have a lot more leeway than I would get at any other job. This includes job security and general day to day things. In addition, I know the partners at the firm make a very high amount of money and part of me says to weight out the storm and collect the higher title and pay later. And leave when I have the higher title.

I know if I leave I will get paid a lot more, however, my career may not be on the fast track it is now. But also weighing the option of a heathier environment vs an environment where I can get away with slacking and Money now vs money later. Any advice for me?

1mvk3jd,Advice for Short Tenures,"Have a friend in tech sales who has had 3 recent enterprise-level tenures lasting each about a year or less (2 of were layoffs). He's having trouble finding a job. As someone who has been on hiring panels, my gut tells me it's the short tenure regardless of reason for the short stints. 

The thing is.. how do you fix this for prospective employers? Others have advised to either consolidate them into ""contracting for clients XYZ"" or flat out getting rid of one of them and extending tenure for one company.

1mvk3aw,Former manager lied - said I would receive bonus after resignation,"
Throwaway account

I resigned from a job at a well established company earlier this summer.  It was a few weeks before their fiscal year ended.  When I resigned I assumed that I would forfeit any annual bonus that have historically been paid out in August.  

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago.  I get a text message from my former manager. He said he has good news and that I would still receive my annual bonus and provided a precise gross amount to the penny (presumably after tax) and shared the exact date to expect payment.  This date aligns to previous bonus payouts and the amount was slightly higher than previous years but nothing egregiously excessive.  When I get this message I am overjoyed by this sudden influx of unexpected money.  

I wait until the stated date and no payment has hit my bank account.  Weird.  I text my former manager and ask if the payment was supposed to be processed that day and he confirmed.  I ask for a payroll contact but never get one.   A few more days pass and no money has posted.  I reach out directly to the payroll team and they confirm that I am
NOT getting any bonus as I voluntarily resigned and bonuses are forfeited.  Duh.  

So this leads me to a harsh realization.  He lied to me intentionally.  I always thought we were on good terms and held him in high regard.  It’s been very hard to reconcile the recent turn of events.  I have never experienced the feelings like getting scammed/conned before.  Fortunately, I did not make any financial commitments or purchases.  

What is my next move? What would you all do?  It pains me that this jerk can do this without any sort of accountability.  Just seems wrong on so many levels.

1mvjg8r,What’s the toughest choice you’ve had to make in your career?,"For me, it was realizing I needed to pivot out of a path I thought I would stick with forever. It was scary, messy, and I didn’t know where it would lead. But it taught me how common and necessary career changes really are.

That experience inspired me to start *The Career Path Pod* by Indeed. Each episode brings together two people from completely different backgrounds, like a dental hygienist and an assistant project manager, a freelance writer and an accountant, or a truck driver and a project engineer. They interview each other about obstacles, pivots, and lessons learned while sharing practical advice.

You will hear about things like:

* How to get jobs that pay over $100k
* How to get high-paying remote jobs
* How to get fun careers that actually pay well
* How to make extra income on the side
* How to get high paying roles that don’t require math

1mvj7ti,Lying/hiding start and end dates for your degree,"I took a big hiatus in my education. Started in 2015,  getting my degree in a couple weeks. I know a few of my ex classmates that took 5 or 6 years to finish school, just straight up lie on Linkedin and state their education from 2015 to 2019.

Is this something companies can/do easily check? My issue is that I have absolutely 0 experience in the field of my career (STEM) and my inactive years I was basically working in supermarkets, fast food, census taking. These were 2020 to 2024.

What I've been doing is not lie but hide that I started in 2015, however that is not possible on all platforms. What's the best play here? Pretend that I started my degree later? Or say I finished years ago? I have a pretty good alibi actually, which is the fact that I had to move countries for family reasons, so I'd be fine saying that I finished in 2020 (it's a 5 year degree) and recently returned from abroad, were my degree wan't valid (pretty weak?).",TorkelHoge,1,1.0,3,1755706366,2025-08-20 16:12:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mvj7ti/lyinghiding_start_and_end_dates_for_your_degree/,8,2025
1mviweu,"Good grades, No passion. Advice?","Hello everybody,
I’m a senior in high school and kinda lost on what to do after graduation. I’ve always been a good student (3.6 unweighted / 4.4 weighted GPA) but I don’t really feel excited about college. My parents assume I’m going, and I probably will since I’ve got a scholarship that covers in-state tuition (not housing), but I’d take another route if I found something better.

Stuff I’ve thought about:
	•	Not really into trades like welding/electrician/construction.
	•	Nursing → I find medicine interesting, for the pay, flexibility, and career growth. (I would NOT be a doctor)
	•	Data science/tech → because I’d love to live in Costa Rica (where my family’s from) and work remotely for a U.S. job.
	•	2-year healthcare programs like radiology tech → faster way to start working, decent pay.
	•	I would honestly consider the military but it feels like a waste after having good grades and I would need a plan for after I get out and what I will specialize in.


The problem is I don’t have some big passion, so I am choosing based on practicality. I find medicine (nursing,rad tech) jobs more interesting but I do not want to be stuck in a hospital where I can only see my family a few weeks out of the year. I would prefer a job where I can move to or spend more time in Rica while still earning a decent paycheck.

What would you do? Please help me out.

Thank you.

I'm seeking to go back to school for an MSW but I would like to see if I can find any type of entry level jobs that will give me more experience to see if I am well suited for the field. I'm from the NYC area. Does anybody know of any organizations or even job types that would be possible for me? I have a bachelors, but it's a BA in Human Biology (nothing degree). All of my prior experience is unrelated, but the skills I learned can be used. Primarily customer service and working eith the elderly as an IFT EMT (patient discharge and transport). I have also been looking at case manager jobs and am hoping I can find an entry level one. Maybe a pipe dream. If not a job, for volunteer. Ideally job bc I need money lol. 

My EMT job doesnt technically have a social work role, but I end up advocating for patients and ensuring they are going home to a safe environment where they can be adequately cared for while under my care, or I ensure the nursing homes provide adequate accommodations before I transfer care. I also try my best to share my knowledge with patients and family as necessary to help them. I also am supposed to start vomunteering with a women's shelter in my area at the end of the month. My interest area is mental health and I would be open to working in any setting as long as I get experience.

I graduated college in May (finance) and began working in June in government internal audit. I was aiming for financial analyst roles out of college but this was the only offer I landed, so i took it.

 I live at home with parents which isn’t the problem at all and thankfully have no living expenses right now. I just don’t enjoy this work and miss the extensive training that I had at my large REIT internship that made me self-sufficient and productive at work. At my current role, my supervisor abruptly left due to office politics and I’m just feeling a lack of structure and support as we’re in a big transition phase. 


Right now, I’m aiming to make it maybe a year to allow myself to save money and gain experience. I know the job market is tough right now, especially for recent grads and I don’t want to take this job for granted. Feel free to tell me to just suck it up and stay the course! Thank you in advance.

1mviocn,[seeking ADVICE] How do I transition into a GIS/geospatial/space tech career?,"Hi everyone, I figured this would be the right place to seek some career advice on how to successfully **transition into a long-term career in GIS/geospatial/space tech sectors.**

For the sake of making this as **'prescriptive'** as possible, here's some info on me and my professional background:

**- I reside in Washington D.C.; am on a U.S. green card** and looking for my next job that would pay me money and also develop strategic skills that could eventually get me into orgs. such as Planet, Mapbox, ESRI, etc. I am leaning more on the EO side of things and generally prefer commercial applications to military and intel.

**- I can't do ITAR (yet), but can work with EAR.**

\- My background is in GTM strategy, sales enablement, internal operations, and some data analytics (base-level SQL knowledge, strong Excel and stat analysis). So more soft skills rather than hard skills. I am working hard on the latter (by bettering my SQL knowledge), and happy to pursue it in a more concrete direction once I have a clearer picture of the skill-tree that I can build and the career path it will lead me on.

\- I have been in B2B, SaaS, creative/advertising industries, and consulting. The consulting job (4 years) was my 'in' into the industry because we were exclusively consulting geospatial and space tech organizations on their GTM strategy. I was an associate consultant and later a project manager, working with some of the brightest firms emerging in the sector. I learned a lot from that experience, and also got to toy with some QGIS while I worked on some client projects.

**- Where I see myself based on strengths and aspirations:**

\- Cartography/EO data/mapping have been a **passion** of mine ever since I was a kid and played strategy games like Cossacks/Civ/CK.

**- Lastly, I am happy to start over:** I understand that this is a large pivot but I will do anything to get to my dream.

Any and all advice is welcome - help a brother out!",obscurusarmenus,1,1.0,0,1755705228,2025-08-20 15:53:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mviocn/seeking_advice_how_do_i_transition_into_a/,8,2025

1mvhoa7,"Never worked more than 5 hrs/week, switched 4 remote jobs in the last 5 years. AMA.","Was even over employed at one time (had 2 full-time positions). Not flexing—just pointing out if I can anyone can. Just check the over employed subreddit - guys without college degree making $160k and paying off debts. I am not endorsing over employment but if people like soham parekh from India can work at 15 jobs and make a bank you can land at least 1 decent remote role.

Here’s my take: job hunting is a skill that gets better with reps. With everyone using AI on job hunting in this “employer's time” tailoring a resume has become a must now! 

Most effective way I have found is to build one giant master resume - dump everything in, dont worry about how long it goes. Never lie on your resume - you will get the interview but they will smoke you in 2 secs. Fill the master doc with numbers/metrics. If you don’t know the exact ones, make an educated guess. Finally, use AI to tailor you master resume to the job description and drop everything unnecessary. 

And since a lot of people ask, here’s my **exact master prompt** for Chatgpt. Took me months of testing - it just works, even I can’t explain why. Drop it into **ChatGPT/GPT-5** and you’ll get a clean, job-specific resume in one shot:

**Resume:**

Task: Tailor the provided resume based on the job description. 

Must follow the given instructions. 

Resume Text: ${resumeText} 

Job Description: ${jobDescription} 

***Instructions:*** 

1. Act as a senior resume tailoring expert and rewrite the resume to tailor it better to the job description following best practices while being concise, accurate and truthful. 
2. Maintain a professional tone and standard resume sections (contact, summary, experience, education, skills). 
3. Ensure the output is ATS-friendly. Naturally incorporate key terms from the job description for ATS compatibility wherever possible without making anything up. 
4. Keep the executive summary concise (maximum 300 characters). 
5. Each experience should not have more than 3 bullet points and can drop the lowest priority points. Each bullet point should be minimum 100 characters but maximum 150 characters. 
6. The work experience section should contain a maximum of three latest experiences (most recent first). 7. If there are multiple positions in the same company, only show the most recent job title and take into consideration all the bullet points for that experience and return the most relevant ones only tailored to the job description. 
7. Remember, there can be typos so be smart. 
8. Keep only the most relevant skills, not more than 165 characters. 
9. But you must give me the full and complete resume as this will be the final copy! Do not just drop something for brevity or have \[placeholders\] as this will be the final copy! 
10. You must think hard and not hallucinate at all or make up any facts not existing in the original resume. 

**Cover letter:**

Task: Create a professional, personalized cover letter based on the provided resume text and job description. 

Resume Text: ${resumeText} 

Job Description: ${jobDescription} 

***Instructions:*** 

1. Create a compelling cover letter highlighting how the candidate's skills and experience (from the resume text) align with the specific job requirements mentioned in the job description. 
2. The cover letter should not be more than 1500 characters with spaces. 
3. Use a professional, confident, and human-like tone with likeable personality and passion yet following best practices. Avoid sounding robotic or overly generic. 
4. Include specific examples or accomplishments from the resume that relate directly to the job description's needs. Emphasize on quantifiable metrics if available in the resume. 
5. If available, extract company name and position from the job description and clearly mention the company name. If not available please ignore. 
6. Keep the cover letter concise and to the point. 
7. Format the entire response as plain text suitable for the body of a cover letter.
8. Address it generically (e.g., ""Dear Hiring Manager,""). Must start with a compelling yet not cocky first sentence that immediately grabs attention - please avoid generic openings. 
9. Ensure proper paragraph structure and include standard closing elements. 
10. But you must give me the full and complete cover letter as this will be the final copy! Do not just drop something for brevity or have \[placeholders\] as this will be the final copy! 
11. You must think hard and not hallucinate at all or make up any facts not existing in the original resume. 12. Remember there can be typos so be smart. Also just ignore any explicit or profane language 

If you are lazy just automate this with tools like **Jobscan(web)** or **TailorMyResume(iOS)**.For remote jobs, completely avoid **Linkedin**!! 

Here are my top sites I keep bookmarked all the time: 

1. **Wellfound** \- So far the most efficient platform I've used
2. **We Work Remotely** – biggest remote job board, tons of legit listings daily.
3. **Remote co** – curated remote roles with a clean, no-BS layout.
4. **Remotive** – solid community + job board, especially for tech roles.
5. **Remote OK** – simple UI + tons of startup/tech jobs worldwide.
6. **Jobspresso** – hand-picked jobs so less spammy than others.
7. **Working Nomads** – easy email alerts, good mix of remote gigs.
8. **Indeed (Remote filter)** – high volume, just filter for “remote only.”
9. **Jobgether** – AI matches jobs to your profile automatically.
10. **Remote Rebellion** – curated list + extra resume and job tips.
11. **Remote Rocketship** – aggregator with solid search filters + alerts.
12. **Remote4me** – pulls jobs from 20+ other sites in one place.
13. **Pangian** – remote-first site + built-in community vibe.
14. **SkipTheDrive** – clean UI, no signup, quick filters.
15. **Talent Hubstaff com** – underrated, but easy to filter roles fast.
16. **Virtual Vocations** – massive database, free access still works.
17. **Crossover com** – high-paying remote jobs, salaries shown upfront.
18. **JustRemote** – good “power search” to uncover hidden jobs.

I made a bet with my friend and got him a job from **Wellfound** in a 2 hour sprint. The salary was 2x of what he was making.

Dont get **Flexjobs** \- I have paid for it and found out its all the same jobs in those 4 I mentioned. 

My hack is to email the hiring manager (or 2–3 top guys if you’re unsure). My very first job came from just 9 cold emails, with zero prior experience.

**6 Clean Steps (Dream 100 approach)**:

1. Take a clean sheet or paper
2. Make a list of 100 dream job posts
3. Build your master resume
4. Tailor each resume with AI
5. Apply + send an email
6. Go to “study mode” on chatgpt and ask it to get you prepped for interview!

Guys dont listen to whiners and create excuses just go full on! I was there and now I am not. Do it for your loved ones fuck it do it for yourself. My goal was 100 interviews before I land my first job but ended up with an offer on the third one.

1mvhjd7,I’m unsure about my career path,"I was debating whether to post about my situation on this sub Reddit, because I could just look up someone else in my situation on this site. However, I feel like while we may all be in similar situations, I feel like I just need to share how I feel about my career path, because right now I’m not happy with it.

I’m 27 years old from the UK and I feel a bit lost about what I wanna do in life. Like I said, I know I’m not the only one that feels this way but I’m just gonna share how I feel anyway. When I left school, I didn’t leave with the best qualifications. I didn’t get good grades so I had to go to community college. In college I spent 9 years figuring out what I want my career path to be like. Most of those nine years was spent doing creative arts courses.

During those nine years I did figure out what I wanted to do, which was to become a film director. However, during those nine years I had a mixture of good and bad performances in college. My grades good overall, but the final two years I spent in college I really messed up. I bad grades in my creative media and technology course. I passed, but I could’ve done so much better.

Now I’m out of college, and I’m just working a part-time job in a cinema. I’ve been working there for nearly 5 years now, I don’t wanna work there forever and I want to move onto a job in the film industry. However the film industry and the TV industry is not exploding with job opportunities right now, and I feel like I’m not able to get a foot in the door.

Now I’m at a point where yes I do want to be a film director, but the opportunities are now becoming slim. So I’m looking at second options now, something with a bit more stability, but I’m really unsure as to what I want to do. I also feel like I’m not qualified for the jobs due to my education experience.

I was thinking of maybe getting into economics, like accounting, or to do more physical labour jobs like plumbing or carpentry, or even doing something culinary based, but I just don’t know right now.

I know that was a lot to read through but hopefully you can understand my situation a bit better now. Thank you for reading.",Amazing-Conclusion50,1,1.0,0,1755702749,2025-08-20 15:12:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mvhjd7/im_unsure_about_my_career_path/,8,2025

I’ve worked at this place for a few years now and just started a nursing position there, so I’m familiar with how the staffing department reacts when you call in and they become very unpleasant. Because of this, I’ve always had extreme anxiety around calling in to work because they react so poorly when you do. I don’t want to give a bad impression and have them think I’m flaking from the start, but I also know as a nurse I shouldn’t be caring for patients when I’m sick especially with the flu.

Here is my concern. I am a female coaching young men. The only female in my dividion of 50+ schools. I am not a teacher nor do i have a child on the team. Just a basketball coach.
In my four years in current position, my team has gone to the playoffs each seadon. 2 elite eight, and recently took the team to state finals- the first time in nearly 3 decades. I am also the only woman in my state to do so, at any level.
I also received the highest score possible on my last review. I have also coached D1 college coaches kids, along with several former professional athletes children. 
I am left wondering where I stand within athletic dept. It is not hard to chat gpt a response, so I am extremely disappointed my AD had not responded to emails. 
I sent a follow up email yesterday asking for clarity on my role within the district. Hopeful for a response. 
I do not think I can work for a dept that does not value me or recognize my accomplishments. At this point, i believe this is a title iv violation, but I am not going to go that route.

1mveqyr,"Career Guidance in Sydney, Australia: Should I pursue Software Engineering or Psychology?","I’ve been struggling to decide between psychology and software engineering, and I feel really torn.

On one hand, psychology fascinates me because I have a deep urge to understand the “why” behind human behaviour. I love analysing how people act, how their past experiences shape them, and how different conditions or disorders affect their lives in unique ways. Since I was little, I have always made sure everyone was included and not left out, and I naturally found myself caring about whether people around me were okay mentally and emotionally. Whenever I hear about a mental health condition, I end up researching it deeply, exploring the criteria, symptoms, and real-life impacts. I’m empathetic by nature, so learning about these struggles makes me want to help others and support them in different ways. I even enjoy watching TV shows and documentaries about crime, trauma, or unusual psychological behaviour because I like connecting characters’ past experiences with their present actions or simply observing behaviour. This does not intimidate me but it fuels my interest. My curiosity extends not only to social and environmental factors but also to conditions people are born with, which make it harder for them to navigate life.

I think psychology appeals to me because I genuinely want to understand and support people on a personal level, and I’ve also seen mental health challenges affect my own life, as well as my family and friends. A big part of me feels drawn to psychology because I want to support and heal others who have gone through similar experiences to me or to people I know. I can also imagine myself specialising in working with children and adolescents, because it really brings me fulfilment to give that support that can completely change the course of their lives.

That said, I sometimes wonder if my interest in psychology is just a strong curiosity, or if it is enough to carry me through a full career in the field. I also know that statistics and research are a big part of psychology, and while I do advanced maths, statistics has always been one of my weaker areas. I believe I could improve with effort, but I sometimes lose motivation in areas I do not enjoy as much. Still, I think I could push myself to do better if I set my mind to it.

On the other hand, software engineering attracts me because I love creating and problem solving through innovative ideas. I’ve always been a creative thinker, and even though some of my ideas are not practical, I enjoy looking at problems from unique perspectives and coming up with fresh solutions. I’ve worked on projects like building websites and experimenting with code. While I did not always manually write every line, I understood how the code worked, combined parts, and created functions to make something that worked. What I loved most was seeing my ideas come to life in a design or a finished product. That sense of creating something from scratch is what excites me most.

Even though I have not coded much in the past three years outside of school subjects like IST or ISTEM, I remember enjoying it when I did. Part of why I do not practice coding in my free time might be because I am scared. I am scared to find out if I do not actually like it, or scared that it will feel too difficult. Every time I start coding, I feel intimidated, but when I get into the flow, I think I may enjoy it. I am not artistic but I’ve always been drawn to design, whether it is logos, labels, or creative features in group projects, and I think I could carry that into software engineering as a strength. I’ve also considered gaming as a possible path after software engineering, since I may have ideas for game features, though I know the industry is competitive.

If I pursue software engineering, I can still keep psychology in my life. I could read psychology books, watch the shows and documentaries I already love, and maybe even volunteer at mental health services like suicide hotlines to support others. If I pursue psychology, I could still fulfil my creative side by designing websites or even writing and designing children’s books on the side.

Beyond interests, I also have to consider practicality. I am the child of immigrant parents who sacrificed a lot for me, and I have two younger siblings. I’ve always wanted to make my parents proud. They say they will support me no matter what as long as I am happy, but I cannot ignore the fact that job security and financial stability are important to me. Growing up, money was always a concern in my household. I worry that if I choose psychology, I might regret not taking the potentially more stable and high paying path of software engineering. As psychology is very long pathway to become a clinical psychologist. At the same time, I wonder if I choose software eng, I will regret not choosing psychology if I realise later that helping people, especially children and young people, was what I truly wanted.

Both fields appeal to different parts of me. Psychology aligns with my empathy, curiosity about people, and desire to help others, while software engineering aligns with my creativity, problem solving skills, and love for building and designing things. The question I am still working through is whether I should choose based more on passion, skills, practicality, or a balance of all three.

1mvdohy,Should I Accept the Counteroffer After Giving my Notice?,"Hi all,

I have accepted a job offer and handed in my notice today.

I really like my current job, and my coworkers and managers are very warm and friendly. This was my first real gig out of uni, and I've learnt a lot thanks to my coworkers being patient with me and showing me the ropes.

That said, the type of professional development I'm after, and type of work I want to gain exposure to, looks out of reach at the moment. We're in a very busy period following new regulatory requirements introduced by the govt, and they need me to focus on getting our clients to be in compliance for the next 18 months. It's interesting work, but not really what in looking for the further my career. The type of work I want is available at my company, but I likely won't get exposure to it until we're beyond this 18 month project. I have been in this job for almost a year, and don't want to commit to another 18 months of what I'm currently doing.

So far, the gig I accepted has everything I am looking for. It's the type of work I'd like to do, and I will learn more in 1 year than I currently am at my current role. It feels like a no brainer to make the jump, if a firm offer comes in.

After handing in my notice, my senior managers have made a counter offer, and very convincing arguments for me to stay. They'll promote me to a role that has similar breadth of work, and the salary matches, though that's not a consideration of mine at this point. After mentioning the name of the competitor, they assured me the move would be a bad idea, as they're a noticeably smaller company, and my growth may be stunted long term, even if there is initial growth and exposure.

I'll relate my answer tomorrow, and I'm still planning to leave, but they've definitely given me something to think about.

This might sound silly - but one reason I don't want to accept the counteroffer is because I feel I've forced their hand, rather than earnt it by merit.

Thoughts? Many thanks.

1mvdd2x,"Bachelor's in Europe Master's in the US, what should I do?","Hey everyone! I just graduated and I’m currently taking a gap year. My long-term goal is to eventually earn a 6+ figure salary, which is why I’m aiming to build my career in the US. From what I’ve seen, CS salaries in Europe are much lower, and I’d rather work really hard to reach higher pay than just stay comfortable in Europe. Since I can’t afford US bachelor’s tuition right now, my plan is to do my bachelor’s at a top European university (affordable for me) and then target a Master’s in the US for better networks, internships, and career opportunities.

Rn I’m looking at:

Information Engineering at TU München (seems like the best)

Mechanical Engineering at KIT (as a backup, though I’d prefer CS related fields)

Also considering KU Leuven Engineering Technology, Politecnico di Torino Comp Engineering, and Sapienza di Roma CS with AI as safety schools (I’m studying for the SAT to apply to them; my IELTS is 8).

I don’t really know what exact career I want to pursue yet, which is why I’m leaning toward CS-related fields for my bachelor’s so I can keep my options open and later decide what I really want to specialize in for my Master’s (whether it’s CS, data, AI, or maybe even something like aerospace). I’m kind of interested in aerospace, which is taught in English at TUM, I always loved space but this isn't really about that more like mechanics which I'm not sure if I like it andalso I'm a girl and feel like mechanics is a male dominated field. Another issue is my German is A2 so I have limited options.

I’d love advice on:

1. Would studying at a top European school like TUM help me stand out when applying to US Master’s programs later and help me get a scholarship? Or what would?
2. Any other good English taught European programs I should consider?
3. For aerospace vs. information eng kinda program is aerospace worth it if I eventually want to go to the US, or is cs a better choice?

1mvce1e,Should I apply for this part-time role?,"Background: I work remote in academia as a part-time research assistant for RM28 per hour and I can claim up to 28 hours a week. I usually finish my work ahead of time but claim the full hours anyway.

I am thinking of applying for another part-time job, this one as a coordinator for a HIV/AIDS community project that entails working just 7 days a month.

They want applicants to submit a quotation, so I plan to put it at RM240 per day as I want to charge my hourly fee at RM30 and I am assuming that the average working day will be around 8 hours. RM30 x 8 hours is RM240..

If I get this job, it will boost my income. However, my research assistant contract is expected to end next March, whilst the coordinator role will be from this September to Feb 2027, around 18 months. There is no grant for my research position. 

Assuming that I get the coordinator role, would it be too risky to take it as it would lock me in into a part time role? I can apply for another part time role to work while I do the project coordination job, but there is a risk I might not, and would have to get a full time job.

If I am stuck with just one part time job then, my income will significantly decrease. Or should I just apply and then see how things turn out? I don't like the idea of having to quit a job mid-day.

1mvc5z7,Where do I go from here career wise? (bit of a rant),"So long story short (located in Canada) I have 10 years of customer service work (retail and serving/bartending), a political science bachelor degree, and a recent law degree. I'm halfway through the course needed to apply to the bar exam in my province but havent been able to find an articling position (specific legal internship) which is also a needed requirement to practice law. I don't overly see myself being able to obtain one, even if I do I don't have a great relationship with the legal field and I'm quite jaded about it (however only worked 8 months in a prior legal position -- i'm debating asking my old employer if he has a job for me but I quit because i didnt like the field and suspect he wouldnt take me back because of this).

I'm working as a server fulltime but I'm reducing to part time in Sept because of workplace issues.

I have been applying to other serving jobs, reception jobs, and admin jobs while looking for an articling position and havent got much of a bite for anything. I need a new fulltime job, but I also want to advance my career and not just stay in customer service work for eternity either.

I don't have a drivers license or a car. I haven't been able to pass a test despite taking several lessons. So a lot of options are limited for me at the moment including rural work.

Im basically just at a loss for what to do anymore. I don't know if I should continue my bar prep program, apply to a different school program, or just keep trying to get a new hospitality/customer service job.

1mvbsyw,Adjusting After Leaving My Job and 1.5 to 2 hour commute each way.,"
I worked for six years at a job I once loved with a 1.5 to 2 hour commute each way. During that time, the job became my entire identity and my whole life. It was the highest paying role I’d ever had, but over time I began to feel deeply impacted by everything, and I believe I was experiencing vicarious trauma (it was work at a trauma center). I also noticed my health was getting worse each year. My skin kept breaking out, I was getting more and more grey hairs, random body aches, constant headaches, unexplained health issues. 

Eventually, I reached a breaking point. One morning I woke up and felt like I couldn’t move. I went through what felt like a mental breakdown, possibly from exhaustion. I took a leave of absence, returned for one day, felt very sick, went back on leave, and ultimately resigned. Leaving was difficult, but I also felt a sense of relief.


Since then, I’ve gone through waves of grief and anxiety attacks, worried that I’ll never find another “good” job. At the same time, I’m grateful for my current part time role, and I’m on track to be debt free by the end of the year. I also continue to receive many interview offers, mostly from places that pay less but are much closer to home. Through this process, I’ve realized I can live on less and still enjoy life.

Working part-time has shifted my lifestyle. I wonder if I’m grieving the loss of my old job/identity or if I’m simply adjusting to this slower, healthier way of living. I’ve always felt a little lost about what I truly want to do withh my life, and I keep asking myself what kind of degree would be the best fit for me. I’m 30, have my family’s support, the support of my husband and his family, and I don’t have a degree. I was thinking of pursuing social work since that was the field I was pretty much in for those 6 years. Outside of this, I also have a habit of comparing myself to my peers who are doing well and already have their careers going. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. My anxiety attacks happen randomly throughout the day since I quit my job, and while I understand the mental and physical impacts, I don’t know if I’m just grieving or adjusting to my new, slower life. I’m currently typing this at 4 in the morning because I woke up with my heart racing, and fearing for my future.

1mvaven,Chose money over meaning — now I’m regretting it and don't know what's next,"This might be a bit of a long read so please skip to tl;dr at the bottom if you want. 

I've been in the field of Landscape Architecture for the last 8 years. I completed my master's in 2021 from a reputable college and moved back to my home country because living abroad without a stable support system (friends, family, partner etc.) took a toll on my mental health. 

Once I returned, I was staying with my parents until early this year, when I got married and moved in with my partner. I felt like I finally had a hold on things and life was getting into a good routine. However, the reality of bills and adulting hit me and I decided to move to a company where I got 2x the salary. 

Now, that sounds great on paper. But hear me out. I have been hired by a large corporate GCC which does back-end work for projects in other parts of the world. My total daily commute is anywhere from 3-5 hours depending on the traffic. I get 2 hours of quality time with my husband every evening before my batteries run out. And sometimes, he's working on those 2 hours and so I go an entire day without speaking to my husband.
 
I've also been wanting to adopt a cat for a while now, almost adopted one, but decided not to when I landed this role. I have to be at work 5 days a week during my probation period and 3 days a week after that. My husband is not confident about taking care of a pet. 

I have also wanted to start my own firm for a while. I keep dreaming of the autonomy it will give me over my time and life. 

So basically, I have put my firm, my relationship with my husband and adopting a cat on the back-burner for this job where I don't have any sense of meaning or purpose because I work for projects happening on a different continent. 

It's been 1.5 months at this company, and I have another 1.5 months of probation left. I've seriously been questioning whether this role is worth it. What do I do? 

Tl;dr I took a higher-paying corporate job, but the long commute and lack of purpose leave me drained. I barely get time with my husband, and I’ve had to put off personal goals like starting my own firm and adopting a cat. It’s been 1.5 months, and I’m questioning if this role is really worth it.",tURBIN27,0,0.5,3,1755685178,2025-08-20 10:19:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mvaven/chose_money_over_meaning_now_im_regretting_it_and/,8,2025

I’m looking at making a career change and I’m trying to figure out which paths are best for building real, long-term wealth — ideally something that could eventually set me and my family up financially through high earnings and possibly running my own business.

I’m open to hands-on work, skilled trades, or professional roles. I’d like to avoid routes that take 10+ years of training, and I’m aiming for something that pays well within a few years and can scale beyond just my own hours.

What industries or roles do you think offer the best balance of good pay, high demand, and a path to real wealth?

1mva556,MBA taught me sales… by making me sell cookies,"Our professor gave us a simple brief: set a sales target, and then achieve it by hitting the roads.

Felt cringe at first. Ended up being one of the best lessons I’ve had.

I baked cookies (ok, my sister did). Thought they’d sell themselves. They didn’t.

Quickly learned margins matter:

\-⁠ ⁠Cost for 2 cookies worked out to ₹18 (ingredients + electricity + packing)  
\- ⁠Sold at ₹30 initially, nobody cared  
\- ⁠Made it “6 for ₹85” and suddenly people found it to be fair since marketing them as organic

Paired it with coffee → actual bundle upsell

Ended up breaking even on day one, profit on day two.

But the real value wasn’t the money I made, it was learning:

\-⁠ ⁠The story sells faster than the recipe  
\- ⁠Unit economics matter more when you’re sweating in real life. Suddenly you get why founders obsess about scalability

1mv98eb,"Appreciated but they can't give me a raise, should I go for internal transfer and not tell I'm pregnant?","So, I love my job, team and company. I get along with my colleagues great, we laugh together. The values of my manager and upper manager and team align with mine. I work here for almost 2 years and I had exceeds expectations as my first year review and had an about 5% raise which they said was big for the corporate company we work at. I felt it was small but accepted it because I don't want to leave, so what else can I do than accept?

6months from then we find out that there is a promotion freeze and no one is getting promotions. Based on all the sparkling feedback I had, I knew I would have had a promotion, so naturally I was upset. However, since I generally love it there, I accepted it. the soonest pay rise would be 7 months from now.

This is also when I found out I am pregnant. I haven't told job yet as it was and still is too soon. So as you see, I would be on maternity leave during the potential next pay rise. (In Europe maternity leave is more than 1 year)

2 months later (now),, I was planning to already tell as I am now 13weeks, but the day before that destiny pushed my hand to check internal job offers within my company. I work at a huge international company,so there are opportunities always.

I found a job with a job description just like mine, in a different department. Shockingly, the pay was much higher than mine.  

I applied and told my manager this. Next day I had a chat with a person from management saying how much they appreciate me and don't want me to leave but they get that I feel that the salary difference is unfair. They also said that they most likely can't give me a raise right now, but I am ""definitely"" getting it in that next review.
They will try to do something for me, but not sure if they can because of the raise freeze.

So yeah, no one knows I am pregnant and will be going on maternity leave in 4 months anyway.

What do you think? Should I stay for appreciation, awesome people and potential rise? Should I tell I am pregnant already? Should I just fully go for the other role because of the money, but if I get it, have to tell them that my maternity leave starts very soon?

1mv5p94,I need some encouragement on making a career change at 40,"Long story short, my life ever since teenage years have been a series of compromises. Depression and problems at home made sure I didn't have the best grades and couldn't get into high school. (Live in a EU country so I'm translating roughly the equivalent US schools)

I went to a business school, mainly because I felt it was the second best option. I wanted to do graphics and design. I've always been interested in visual stuff. Fast forward 20 or so years, after mostly doing odd jobs, 7 years of cognitive therapy  in two separate occasions, I finally started feeling like I'm adjusted enough. Adult enough to star getting properly into worklife. Got a second vocational education for printing and graphic design. This was roughly 8 years ago when I graduated. I was among the best in my class in grades.

The first company I worked for had abysmal values, they advertised the position as graphics design work but it was sloppy optimisation of Google Display banners.

From that point on, I realized how much demand there is in digital marketing instead of graphics design. I switched to another agency, which was still pretty much bulk work but I started learning a lot more. My original basis, graphic design has completely vanished from my daily work. It's just Google Ads and programmatic.

In past 7 years I've gone through 5 marketing offices. I'm now in a one that's among the best respected offices in my home country.

But the thing is that I have to accept: I absolutely hate marketing. It doesn't suit me. I get nothing but praise, I'm a hard worker but I get the same problems in every office: anxiety, more stress because not only the work is demanding but the fact that I'm not really motivated enough to begin with. Still as I have quite a strong work ethic, I push on.

But I have trouble sleeping, developed chronic non-bacterial prostatitis...after 7 years and 5 marketing offices, I have to accept: no matter how far I go in this field, no matter to which marketing office, I feel terrible and I hate the work. I've made far too many compromises considering what work I want to do.

I'm 41 years old, I've saved roughly 20k and my wife is also a late bloomer, she's studying data science, really high grades and is aiming for a doctorate. We have no mortgage, no cars, no kids, no debt except her student loan but in this country there's no rush paying it back to state. So financially there's no immediate danger even if I'd quit.

I feel like I really need to do something different. Something more tangible or directly related to helping people. Going back to graphic design is out of the question probably because there's too many people doing that and AI is wrecking the field. 

I've been thinking about aiming for bachelor of social services. I understand that the field is probably high stress too but I just want to get away from likes of Google, Facebook and digital marketing. I just want to work in a field where I'm more directly involved with people. I'm emphatic and socially intelligent. My early life experiences with depression and trauma has made me acutely aware of human condition.

However 'm pretty worried about ""being too old"" for a career change but I know it's bs. I just detest marketing and I know I can't go on with it.

1mv22ao,Missed phone job interview,"I had a job interview today that I appeared to in person, but it was actually a phone interview. The people at the store were confused at my appearance as there had been no interviews scheduled for when I arrived, but there was one on friday, so we assumed there had been a miscommunication and that was my date. So you can imagine my surprise when I receive a rejection letter a few hours later, when I was convinced my interview hadnt even happened yet. Turns out, around the time of my interview, I ignored 2 incoming calls from an unknown number, because I obviously didn't want to start a call when I was at an interview. The call number indicated that the caller was from roughly an hour drive-way away, so I didn't make the connection to my application at all. It took me way too long to realise when rereading the email that it was actually meant to be a phone interview, explaining why the staff where confused as well as the unknown caller.

Im honestly incredibly embarrassed; I was confused, mad and probably missed a really good opportunity just because I couldn't read properly.

Now my question is: Before I realised my mistake, I had planned to call them again to clear up any confusion, but now there's really no confusion anymore; To them I was just a no-show and I was reasonably denied. Would it be the right thing to call them again still, if at least to apologize? I don't particularly expect a 2nd chance, altough I would be very happy with one (Even though failing at basic reading comprehension surely doesn't make one look like a good hire)

That also doesn't include the second and third 'side hustle' type things that my company does that myself and one other person essentially handle on our own and we've grown that to make our company well over what mine and his salaries are combined. (I'm a little vague on this as I'm pretty sure my bosses frequent reddit a bit and don't want this to be how they find out lol)

1mv18ll,Question for new graduate,"I have a quick question, is it the new industry normal to pay for someone to revamp your resume. I took a class at university that work on resume work and did great on this part, so i don't have any questions about the format or what to put on it, but ever since i graduated I haven't been able to find a job anywhere. By the way i majored in applied statistics, so didn't pick an easy major. My parents told me to post on linkedin and see if any recruiters would message me and all i get are people trying to see a service to fix my resume and land me a job. I never really heard of people having others writing your resume, mainly because they haven't done the things I have and don't understand all the complicated statistical concepts/programs that were learned. Has anyone else done something like this to land a job? Would really want to know if it is actually works?

PS Please don't mention that the job market is crap, just keep applying.

So I started this Management degree, which is 10 months part time due to my 20yrs work experience and cross credits from a BComm I never finished after high school. I thought it to be a good thing to do before applying for IT PM work and people on here also seemed to think it was a good decision.

Now Ive read this study which suggests most PM roles will disappear due to AI. It suggests roles will become more strategic, which is more like Business Analysis by how it sounds. 

After being worried about getting back into work, now Im seriously down about the role disappearing.

1mv0ll5,Horrible work environment,"I work in IT and recently my boss has brought in a few new hires, mostly younger women around my age. Since I’ve been here longer, I’ve been the one training a lot of them and showing them the ropes. At first I thought things were going smoothly, but lately I’ve started to notice a really negative shift in the way some of them treat me.

I’ve heard them talking badly behind my back, trying to tear me down, and in some cases making comments that feel rooted in jealousy. A lot of it seems to be because I was recently promoted into a new position. Instead of being happy for me, it feels like some of the women in the office are resentful. I’ve genuinely done nothing but be kind, supportive, and do my job the way I’m supposed to, but it seems like that doesn’t matter.

It’s starting to take a serious toll on my mental health. Work used to be a place where I felt focused and accomplished, but now I’m walking on eggshells wondering who’s saying what about me and why. There are still a few women I get along with really well, and I don’t want to paint everyone with the same brush, but I can’t stop feeling a concern that some of these people are trying to move in silence or gather little bits of information about me to use later.

I guess what I’m struggling with is how isolating it feels. I’ve always been someone who just keeps my head down and works hard, but now I feel like I’m constantly under a microscope or like people are waiting for me to slip up. It’s draining to feel like the very people I’m supposed to be mentoring or collaborating with are working against me instead

I’ve weighed the pros and cons of each. 



LEAVING JOB:

✅ Pros:
	•	Can go on holiday.
	•	Can focus fully on finding a full-time job in the field I studied.
	•	Might need to leave anyway if your interview goes well.
	•	Can dedicate more effort to applications and interviews.
       •   Don’t get along particularly well with coworkers
       •  Probation meeting discussed workplace cultures I don’t ‘get along with’ (e.g being told saying ‘how can I help’ is an unfriendly greeting I need to work on) 

❌ Cons:
	•	Risk of waiting a long time before finding another job.
	•	No income until you secure a new role.
	•	Possibility of ending up in another similar part-time job if a better one doesn’t come through.

⸻

STAYING AT THE JOB:

✅ Pros:
	•	Stable income and easy hours.
	•	More time to apply for other jobs while still earning.
	•	Can save money while searching.

❌ Cons:
	•	Employer might let you go anyway (since you’re still on probation).
	•	Only 16 hours per week, so not really full-time experience.
	•	Miss out on holiday.

1muzx1y,Current Job / Career - Fork in the Road,"This will be long, so tldr version: My new boss sucks and job scope has changed. The level of stress, number of hours, and overall culture change isn’t sustainable until promotion, if it’s even still happening, and has me wondering wether I should talk to my boss’s boss about shifting teams and/or issues with new boss (have pretty decent relationship with him), wait 3 months to quit (RSUs vest in November) while looking for work, or hand in my two weeks now and turn job hunting into a full time job. 

Here’s a little background before I dive in - I’m a single 34(M) with no kids living in the Bay Area. My rent is cheap and I could sustain myself for over a year+ with my savings if I had 0 income (although, that money is to buy a house). I’ve worked at financial fintech (for lack of a better description) for 3.5+ years in a niche aspect of the industry, but it is highly important to our company. I was promoted from analyst to senior analyst 1.5 years ago, and have graded in top 33% for all 3 full years of employment (2 of the years I was top 20%). Prior to my new boss being hired, senior leadership made it clear I would be promoted come February to senior manager (next level up from current role - our org hierarchy is weird, to say the least). 

On to the background of my fork in the road:

For my first 2 years of employment, my role was a bit of jack all trades and a cross between data engineering (large datasets, SQL, Command Line, etc), analytics (reporting in PBI, excel, and ppt), internal consultant (review of global “price” initiatives/changes), and project manager. 

This lead me to a senior analyst role where I took on our largest, most complex client from a data, reporting, and internal project management perspective (at least, for the teams I work with). While difficult, I’ve been able to improve the process and provide greater insights, all while training a new hire (who has been extremely successful in her own right) and being responsible for my previous responsibilities. Due to the high visibility nature of this client, my work is constantly being reviewed at an executive level and since I’ve been successful with this client and executive level analysis, I’m the go to person for ad-hoc requests from my org’s SVP, which lead to a dotted line from me directly to him. 

Around February this year, our organization (along with the larger organization we are a part of) went through a massive reorganization. Unfortunately, my direct boss (who was amazingly supportive, understanding, and an all around great person to work with) was let go - he didn’t get along great with his boss, which is why I believe it happened. Regardless, my SVP looked to me to pick up a lot of his responsibilities. While I was up for the challenge, this made 40-45 hour weeks a thing of the past, but I was happy to help pick up the slack and provide as much support as I could while we found a new person. 

Fast forward to late April/early May, my SVP let me know he had found a good candidate and had me interview them (my immediate team is 8 people and this opportunity was only extended to me. Additionally, I was the only person below a VP in our larger org to interview this person - not saying any of this to brag, just trying to convey the trust level I had built up with my SVP). During the interview, I was convinced this would be a great hire. While they had no pricing knowledge, data experience, or understood what we did, they said all the right things about being excited to learn, be a part of the team, grow everyone, etc. and since everyone else who interviewed them rated them 5/5 stars, I also rated them 5/5 across the board. 

We obviously hired this person and from a high level, we have not gotten along since the start, which is true for the majority of my team. Multiple things have shown that they are great in interviews and appearances, but when it comes down to the brass tax of what we do, understanding “what keeps the lights on” wanting to learn, and managing a team, they are wrong for the job.

This has lead to extreme stress, consistent 60+ hour weeks, sleepless nights, constant feelings of worthlessness, and my work becoming error prone (I take responsibility for my mistakes, I made them. However, this is something that has only recently started happening - with my current work load and lack of manager support, I don’t believe the full blame rests with me and my record supports that). By late June/early July, I knew I wasn’t long for my role (I know this post is long and I don’t think individual examples of issues between my new boss and I are important to my ask, but if anyone has questions, happy to provide). 

So finally, on to my fork - while promotion was on the horizon, with my current manager, there’s no way it happens. More importantly, there is no way I can wait until February as I’m currently hating my life due to my job. There is someone on a sister team that reports into the same SVP that is aware of my issue and would love to add me to their team and they have an open headcount, with the only issue being job title. Additionally, I have relationships with SVPs and VPs across my organization and I’m sure one of them would love to have me, but I’m doubtful anything would happen prior to next year as my SVP and manger would want to me to train my backfill. I’m in position where I’m wondering what the best path forward is. So here are the options I’ve come up with:

1. Speak with my SVP and let him know I’m looking for a new role to align with my career goals and/or tell him directly what is going on with my manager in a professional way (I think he’s a fan of her, unfortunately. I don’t think she lasts longer than a year though - just my 2 cents. I will delve in deeper if anyone is curious). 

2. Hold on until my RSUs vest in November and not a moment sooner (it’s a substantial enough amount that I think I could suck it up - plus, it allows me time to start looking for a new job). 

3. Rage quit immediately and go on the job hunt during one of the worst times to do it, but remove the stress of dealing with my manger and take some solace in knowing that my manger will be in deep shit without me. 


As an FYI, my current plan is option 2, but today was really hard not to take option 3 and these “option 3” days pop up every 1-2 weeks. 

I greatly appreciate any feedback, alternative ideas, advice, kind words, etc. as I’m at my wits end and have no idea what to do. 

P.S. - I’m typing this all from my phone, so I apologize for any misspelled words, grammar issues, or anything else wrong.

1muz9ji,Seeking Real Advice From Those Who’ve Been There,"I’ve always had a knack for coding ever since I was a kid. At 10 years old, I was already experimenting with different languages, and over the years, I’ve built a strong background in programming, teaching myself C#, JavaScript, and Python.

I’m now 24 and graduating at the end of the year with a Major in Finance and a Minor in Business Technology Management. During school, I tried a lot of different paths. I worked in operations, management, and sales, but no matter what I was doing, I always found myself looking forward to something in development. That’s where I felt at home.

Over the past few months, I decided to commit to a direction and started learning Salesforce. I’ve been working through Trailheads, focusing on the Admin path, and I plan to take the exam and then move into the Developer certification right after. My long-term goal is to start as a Salesforce developer, build real-world experience, and then eventually move toward machine learning, since Python has always been a strong point for me.

What I’m looking for right now is advice from people who have gone down this road before. What should I avoid? What helped you stand out? How do I become truly proficient beyond just certifications? And for someone starting, which positions are best to aim for to get that critical first step into the field?

I’ll be honest, I’m at the point where school is finishing, and I’m stressing about my career path. I want to make the right decision and build momentum quickly. If you’ve been in my shoes before, I’d appreciate your perspective. Any tips, lessons learned, or even mistakes you wish you had avoided would mean a lot to me.

1muz8mi,Negotiating a higher salary and/or signing bonus?,"Hello, I am about to have my final interview with a company for a role that I am very qualified for. The job description asks for 4+ years of experience and I have over 7. I was told that the final interview is reserved for the top 2 candidates so there is a high chance I will get an offer next week. 

The first recruiter I talked to I told my range was 118-125. They said they would put me down for 118. The job description range is  $80.5k-119.5k (and no yearly bonus). My question is, would it be inappropriate to negotiate for higher than the listed range? And if so, would it be okay to ask for a signing bonus instead? I’m fine with just taking the offer, but I don’t want to leave money on the table if I can secure it without the chance of a rescinded offer.

1muy8eo,SLP vs. Rad Tech - NYC/LI,"Hi all – I graduated with my bachelor’s in Advertising and Marketing Communications in June 2023, worked in marketing for two years, and absolutely hated it. Since quitting, I’ve been taking prereqs for a master’s in Speech and Communication Disorders to become an SLP. Classes I’ve taken include general chem, human bio, Anatomy & Physiology of Speech and Swallowing, Intro to Communication Disorders, Language Development, Linguistics, etc. I’ve really enjoyed those courses and I like that being an SLP offers flexibility in age groups and settings, like schools, hospitals, clinics, and home health. I’m probably most drawn to early intervention or working in schools since I value the schedule and summers off. At the same time, I’ve heard working with kids can be exhausting, and what really worries me is the price of grad school compared with the actual NYC salary afterward. I also know I’m not interested in swallowing/medical SLP. I’ve heard from a few friends of mine that there can be burnout, heavy caseloads, and loans that don’t align with the salary. From what I’ve seen, NYC SLP salaries vary wildly. DOE starting pay looks like it’s around $80–85K with some extras, but private or contract work can be much higher. The range confuses me, and it makes it hard to picture what’s actually realistic right out of school.

At the same time, I’ve been looking into radiologic technology. The programs seem way cheaper and shorter—some NYC schools are around $7–15K total for a two-year program compared with the massive debt from an SLP master’s. The salary in NYC also looks pretty good, with averages anywhere from $80K to $120 depending on modality and employer, and there’s room to move up into things like MRI, CT, etc. FYI I also am a bit scared of blood so if I took this path I think working in an outpatient setting would be better for me than hospital, but idk! I always envisioned myself doing something science/healthcare based but my fear of blood held me back, but I do hear it’s one of those things you get over with time.

 I feel stuck between the two paths. On one hand, I like the subject matter of speech and language that I’ve learned so far, I can see myself enjoying early intervention, and I like the idea of the school schedule. On the other, the debt-to-salary ratio and burnout warnings worry me. With rad tech, the path is shorter, cheaper, with strong salaries in NYC and the chance to grow into higher-paying specialties, but it’s also more technical and less therapeutic, and I am a bit worried about my fear of blood. I’m curious if anyone here has debated between SLP and rad tech or even switched between them. What do you think are the biggest trade-offs in terms of lifestyle, financial stability, and long-term growth?",alyyyyt,1,1.0,1,1755644989,2025-08-19 23:09:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1muy8eo/slp_vs_rad_tech_nycli/,8,2025

1muxtpk,Feeling stuck and unsure how to move forward — would appreciate advice,"**Background:** I’m a first-generation professional working in higher education as a researcher focused on supporting underserved student communities. Remote, soon-to-be hybrid work mode. I’ve been with my current organization for almost four years. The three things I value most in a job are opportunities for growth, mentorship, and a sense of connection.

**Situation:** I joined this institution after spending a year in consulting. I was immediately drawn to the supportive culture. At the start, my manager’s manager was temporarily acting as my direct manager — and he invested a lot in my learning and development. It felt like such a healthy environment: I could ask questions, grow, and maintain professionalism without having to hide who I am.

After a while, a new manager was hired to lead our team. He’s also supportive and genuinely cares about the team, but he has been absent a lot (busy schedule, rarely available). I appreciate that he’s stood up for me in front of senior leaders, and I can tell he wants the best for the team.

A few months ago, he told me something along the lines of, *“You always take the spotlight, and others get ignored.”* I was shocked. No one on my team has told me that they felt overshadowed. I was just talking to a teammate an hour before that conversation with my manager, where they provided affirmation about our collaboration and asked for future opportunities to collaborate as well. 

I immediately felt awful and started withdrawing from team conversations so that I wouldn't make the mistake of making others feel excluded and ignored again. I’ve always tried to give credit to others and highlight voices that might not get heard. But after that comment, I became afraid to speak up at all — on calls, in chats, even volunteering for new work.

I later tried to talk to him about it. He was kind enough to take a call via his personal cell after hours and told me not to “dim my own light” to let others shine — which I agree with — but he didn’t actually explain what that balance should look like or what he meant when he first gave the feedback. So I still had no idea what I needed to change.

He has checked in twice since then because I’ve been so quiet. I told him that I'm still confused and don't know what to do, so I’ve been trying to stay on the safe side and talk less. He encouraged me to keep shining, but never said anything I could apply to my behaviors, so I still don’t know how to do that without unintentionally making others feel overshadowed. 

At this point, I’ve also noticed myself losing trust — I worry that he’s just checking a box and protecting himself by messaging me on Teams.

Now I’m thinking about switching teams within the institution, but I feel conflicted. I don’t want to blame my manager — he genuinely cares and wants an environment where everyone can grow. But I also feel stuck and unable to thrive in my current team.

**Questions:**

1. What could I do to avoid overshadowing others on the team? How can I lift others up better and be a better teammate?

1muxpai,"Got into a MT program at a startup… but it’s minimum wage, and I’ll probably get wrecked by elite college grads. Worth going into debt and the trouble for or nah?","
hi there. i am a recent graduate from economics and business degree from abroad and moved back to home. (neither is located in the USA). i have applied for a MT program in a mobility startup in my country (they are the #1 in the field probably. main product is an app with e-scooter rental and uber like ride) they offered me to start on september for 2 week + 2 week + 2 week peogram where I will see different departments each week (tech, operations, growth). at the end they might offer a contract on what they thing that I fit in.

but there are problems. so the pay during the MT program period is minimum wage. if i were to rent somewhere i would pay the whole amount for accommodation basically + it is impossible to find short term stay. (it is located in the financial hub of the country, and i am from a rather small town 12 hrs drive away).

problem two is that, as i can understand there are many people from elite schools in europe like LSE or SciencePo and stuff id incited to program. and my skills are absolutely not enough to compete with them and shine there. so i feel like for %99 i will not be getting o contract.

so what do you suggest? shall I be just staying home or just go for it knowing that if I won’t get a contract then I will have a fairly big amount of credit card debt?

ps. another thing. i don’t know what will be the salary if I get a contract either. is it appropriate to ask from now or it is silly as it will most likely depend on what they observe during that one and half month

thanx!

I landed a seat in DAVPG Varanasi (affiliated BHU college) in BA History (Hons) and my parents are against sending me that far for a shitty course in a mid tier college, which seems fair ig. But I don’t have any other options anymore, I didn’t apply anywhere else, I don’t wanna keep babbling to justify why so but it is what it is.

My aim is to clear CDS and SSB interview and my parents have suggested me to prepare for RBI grade B exam alongside for backup. I’m a fresher so I think I do have the time to manage both but I don’t know how and where.

I’m not allowed to go to the one college I landed and getting a degree from IGNOU sounds like career su*cide to everyone around me, nor does it seem to good sound in the interviews. I also have to clear NIOS maths exam to clear the eligibility criteria first. (I always wanted to opt maths and was an outstanding maths student but was forced to opt biology)

I am considering going to Delhi (Anuj Jindal) or Chd for RBI grade B coaching and interview prep while doing my distance learning degree alongside and will start CDS written prep from the third or fourth year. I thought of Delhi because my friend (Hindu Clg, B. Com (Hons)) thinks its better for exposure and facilities and my parents are more likely to send me there.

Please suggest me the right thing to do, should I really push for DAVPG? is it okay to join IGNOU? Is it even possible to manage both exams PLUS  maths or should I stick to one? Is it worth it to go to Delhi for coaching and exposure? I don’t even know what to do if I have to do PG ese toh, and another drop sounds like a death sentence.

1mut4wp,Need advice: Senior AI PM vs. AI Lead role – which is better for long-term career & startup goals?,"Hi everyone,

I’m at a crossroads in my career and would love your advice.

**Background:**

* 7 years in a hardcore deep-tech startup (joined right after the founders, was basically a founding member).
* 3 years as a Deep Learning Engineer.
* 4 years as an AI Product Manager.
* Hands-on person – I code, build prototypes, have created websites, MVPs for co-pilots/agents, and small science platforms.
* The startup unfortunately shut down due to funding issues.

**Now I have two offers:**

1. **Senior AI Product Manager** at a well-established European/US-based company – good culture, AI-native product, focus on scaling the product for more languages and documents and optimising the system  (but less hands-on technical).
2. **AI Lead** at a \~4-year-old startup – role is more hands-on, focused on building agentic systems from the ground up, driving technical direction, and learning deeply on the engineering side.

**My dilemma:**

* My long-term goal is to eventually build my own startup.
* The **PM role** will strengthen soft skills (stakeholder alignment, GTM strategy, product vision).
* The **AI Lead role** will strengthen technical depth (agentic systems, building in production, staying hands-on).
* Both are lucrative and have growth potential, but I feel the AI Lead role may help me *build more directly*.

**Question to the community:**

* From your perspective, which role better sets me up for the future (especially if my end goal is starting my own AI venture)?
* Is it more valuable to sharpen my product/leadership skills now, or to go deeper on hands-on technical building in agentic AI?

Would love to hear how you’d approach this decision.",008kaaraan,1,1.0,0,1755633317,2025-08-19 19:55:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mut4wp/need_advice_senior_ai_pm_vs_ai_lead_role_which_is/,8,2025

I started as an individual contributor, and ended up moving up the chain. I'm interested in leaving my current position for a variety of reasons, but primarily because I don't feel I am growing in any capacity. I have the title, but feel like I don't quite have the same experience as others with this title. I've been in management for about 4 years now 3 of which as a director.

It is very hands on and disorganized where I'm currently at, so I don't handle overseeing hr or finance or some of the typical capacities of a director. I would say it's more of a catch-all for any operational issues as they arise, where I currently work. I do oversee CS, and Research, and work heavily with product/engineering, albeit with a very small team atm.

  
For that reason, I guess I'm a bit hesitant to take on another Director position if I might not be as well equipped. Maybe this is normal? Would love to hear your experiences.

Are there any other pathways you'd recommend I look at? I'm open to the same title but hesitant. I'm also open to a lower individual contributor title, but it's hard to find one that has similar pay as where I currently am. So range wise, I'd love to be close. I'm currently just under $200k when I include bonuses. 

Education wise, I have an unrelated BA. I have self learned some programming and am considering whether or not additional education might help, but either way I'm looking to change jobs before that.

  
I'm very creative and good at problem solving. I just am not sure where to go from here. I will add, people management is not my favorite thing, though I'm very caring and focused on it. It just takes a lot out of me. That's also part of why I'm interested in returning back to an IC role. I have about 7-8 total years Ops experience with 4 of them in management.

What I really want is to become genuinely good at programming, to be able to pass technical interviews and land a role that’s either remote or closer to where I live. But this job doesn’t feel like it’s getting me there.

I also don’t really enjoy the work environment.

I recently got the chance to work part-time at a supermarket, only on weekends. It has nothing to do with tech and it would mean a tighter budget, but it would give me four full days off during the week that I could dedicate to studying React, building fullstack projects and maybe freelancing. I feel like that extra time and mental energy could finally help me grow much faster and reach the level I want as a developer.

At the same time, I feel like I might be wasting an opportunity that many people would want — having a developer job at all.

1mumi3g,Thinking about returning to my old position. How do I explain why I'm coming back?,"I'm planning on reaching out to my old manager to see if I can get my old job back. Basically I left about a year ago to take a new job and I get treated like shit here and I think it's unlikely that I'm going to last here that much longer. 

My old job was basically better in every way except the pay is slightly worse and I think even then, the stress has caused me to do things like eat out more often and spend more so it might even be a wash there. But there were solid opportunities for growth, the work was really interesting, the company valued continuous development and learning and the people were mostly very cool. 

I guess what's holding me back at this point is I'm not sure how to explain the fact that I left only a year ago and now I'm coming back. The honest answer is that my manager is an asshole and I was lied to about what the work would be like here so basically my skills have been atrophying for a full year. Obviously both of these would be bad answers for why I'm returning but then I have a hard time coming up with what to say.

I'm afraid if I say things like ""Oh I find the work less fulfilling here"" or something like that, then the subtext might still be that I'm not working on stuff in my field which is kind of true.

Maybe I'm wrong here but this reads as a bit different than explaining to a totally new employer why I'm leaving my current job because a new opportunity kind of justifies itself. But going back strikes me as a bit more desperate. Like not only am I leaving my current employer but I'm coming crawling back to the last one. I'm almost certainly overthinking this but just spilling my thoughts here.

1muki61,Which Niche should i choose for my Future Career? I'm 16,"Hey, I was a little overwhelmed by watching those 'How AI will take over the world by 2027' videos, and I'm a bit concerned about my future. And imagine if AI just goes out of control when I grow up, how would I be able to earn digitally? 

I'm 16, so right now I can choose what to be, rather than switching later with regret. 

Currently, I have these skills and passions, which are not too advanced but good. Tell me which to continue and improve in:

* Programming (Game Dev using C#, Web Dev using HTML, CSS & JS, and General Python) 
* Graphic Designing (Photoshop and more Adobe tools like Illustrator), I learnt it when I was like 10, so I have experience in it, but IMO, it is not worth it right now because of Free AI tools
* Animation (I think this is also graphics, but different, don't know if AI would make animation a piece of cake in the future)
* I also have some passion for Engineering, like in Car mechanics, and I'm thinking about Robotics, which seems more useful in the future, as people would probably convert those digital AI agents into physical robots.

As of now, I'm thinking of programming, specifically Machine Learning using Python, which can hopefully help me adapt to AI in the future.

But I'm not sure. And assuming there are mature and experienced people here, I would appreciate it if they could give me good advice and suggestions.

1muk1fc,Wanting to leave my current job,"I think I’m over this job. I just started this month, but I’m not entirely happy. I was super excited at first as it seemed like a promising opportunity to get my foot in the door and gain some professional digital marketing experience, especially since I’ve struggled landing a job due to where I live as my mother moved us out of London where there aren’t any job opportunities. The job isn’t based where I live, I travel 2 hours by tram and bus every few days. So a 4 hour commute 3 days a week.

It seemed like a good opportunity at first, as I’ve struggled to land a job I quickly accepted my first ever offer in my field.. however during training I’ve realised it’s not what I thought it would be. It’s more of a personal assistant and admin role than marketing. There isn’t a team, it’s just myself and the director based in a coworking space. The job mostly consists of responding to emails and stakeholder communications which I’m fine with, but he says my marketing duties will come later as for now he wants to focus on admin. Also, he wants me to reorganise all of his files, respond to emails, and other admin duties. I even organised his receipts for his accountant. I also found out he has a marketing agency he works with so I don’t see how I fit into that if they’re handling the marketing side of things.

I am grateful for everything so far and he did promise to take me to trade shows which I believe would be a great opportunity for experience in B2B, but I don’t know if I see myself staying in this role long enough to even attend one.

To make things worse, he always arrives late. I rush out on the days I’m scheduled to work to get here on time, in fact, I’m always early. There’s only one time I was late. We were supposed to start work at 12:30pm, it’s now 13:10pm, he hasn’t arrived he told me where he is, nor has he apologised for being so late. I’m just sitting in the coworking space with nothing to do. I don’t have a work laptop, but he said he’s getting one for me, so I’m sat here just waiting for him. He sent me a message telling me he emailed over some videos for me to watch and it’s videos on trade shows. I can’t even access them and I told him I can’t and he said the instructions are in the email, I’ve tried but it’s still not working.

I just feel that my skills are going to waste. I don’t see how any of this is relevant to marketing. And I think it’s quite unprofessional to be constantly late every single week. I feel there’s no respect for my time and energy. I make an effort to make it here on time.

And it’s a part-time role, 18 hours and only £12.50 an hour. I don’t see how this is worth it. I haven’t even signed a contract yet, he said he’s still getting it prepared, although I received my job offer in July.

I have a first class degree in marketing with honours, I’ve spent the years gaining additional skills in digital marketing, graphic design and web design. I may not have much industry experience but I’ve tried to upskill, develop new skills and develop my current skills further. I feel like I deserve better.

I really want to leave this job, upskill in tech and explore further opportunities. I know what course I want to do.

1mujti4,Negotiation,"I’m applying to a new position in healthcare. I don’t actually NEED it but would like a change and my market value has increased with experience in the last couple of years.  They low balled me in the initial offer so I countered with the high end of the range of salaries typically applied to this setting with my role and experience. They wobbled a little, calling to tell me they were preparing an offer that was lower but not unfair but they would need the approval of the company owner before making it officially (and that the owner may not approve it). I said I was still interested with this new offer.  When they actually prepared the counter offer, it was about 3% lower than what they called to tell me on the phone. It would still be about a $15k increase from what I’m currently making.

The problem: I didn’t include mileage in my initial counter offer. They offered me .49/miles and the IRS rate is currently .70. I want to tell them I’ll accept this offer if they increase the mileage to the current IRS rate. This position requires significant amounts of driving. 

Is this a blunder? If I’m going to accept, should I just do it as is since I didn’t have the good sense to include it in the initial counter?

I would have accepted with the mileage as is if they had offered the rate discussed on the phone.

1mujrnn,Would you use this? An AI that tells you if you’re built for a career or a business—fast.,"Dear community! I’m a newcomer to Reddit, and I have an idea that I believe could help millions of people find their career or business path. Many people, including myself, sometimes feel lost between our passions and our daily routines in the workplace. I believe that if we could understand our strengths and pursue the right opportunities, we could eliminate the “ifs” and fully maximize our potential.

I’m currently developing a simple web app that provides quick, in-depth, and interactive personality assessments.

1muiygu,Please help me,"Hello, I'm from India. I'm currently pursuing a distance degree in Accounting and Finance from University of London (second year cumulative grade 70%, expected first class hons.). I have completed CFA L1 and four certificate courses - M&A, Financial Modeling, IB Fellowship, Forage IB Simulation. I couldn't do any internships due to family reasons. I have been preparing for GMAT focus this summer, my mock test score is around 695 which I believe I can increase to 715-ish with a bit more effort before the exam in September. I'm planning to apply for masters abroad and get internships there and break into IB/PE. Planning to apply to courses like HSG MBF, Vanderbilt MiF, Bocconi Mfin, SAIF-SJTU Mfin. Is it sensible to aim for these schools? And is this the right thing to do?

1muin3c,Career direction,"Hi, so to introduce myself, I (30F) have about 4.5 YOE in B2B Sales, and along the way I found that numbers and analytics in my work are what interest me the most. Of course I love my customers and the nature of my job, but it gave me anxiety and I already had depression before that. So I decided to leave my job to study abroad for a Master degree. 
Now I'm at the edge of finishing my Master degree in BA, I also realized that the job market is saturated for this position, and I have no real job experience in this specific field as well as I'm older than other younger candidates. Among my study, I have about 6 months of part-time experience and currently a 6 months full time internship in BA.
So I would like to ask for advice for the upcoming direction that I should take, because I have been in consideration for a while and it stressed me out a lot.
- Should I just go back to my country and find a job there instead or should I try to find a job in my current country where I finished my Master (France).
- I am also considering trying to advance to PhD, as I really like doing research work, and my thesis supervisor also said that he think I can do PhD. But I don't know if doing PhD is a good route, if I do it I will take a PhD in Management. So I would also appreciate advice on this direction - like what exactly are we expected to do in our PhD and the career direction after that (beside teaching).

1muifgz,"Only jobs I've had are a month or two long, I'm so stuck","I'm 29.  And have had a bunch of 4 week - 6 months jobs. Like 8 jobs in 3 years.  I have a terrible job history.  Understandably, no one is calling me back and I can barely get an interview.  When I do find a job, it's awful, because those are the only jobs I can get.  I'm having mental struggles which play into my ability to stay at one job.  I'm struggling everywhere in my life.  I really want to work at a steady job and feel fulfilled.  I also want to go back to school, but I'm stuck in a loop.  If I remove meaningless jobs, then my resume gap is MONTHS and I get zero credit for everything I have learned in these quick jobs.   Is it worth the hit to have a big resume gap of months, or show my weak job history and the fact that I'm burning through jobs to pad my experience.  One interview left me crying on the way home because they were so out of line, actually accusing me of being lazy and not a good fit for the company because I couldn't stay at any job.  Yes, it was a man interviewer and yes I am a woman.

Please be nice to me, I'm asking for gentle and understanding help and advice not ridicule. you never truly know what someone is going through.

1mugrij,I want to leave the job I just started,"
I think I’m over this job. I just started this month, but I’m not entirely happy. I was super excited at first as it seemed like a promising opportunity to get my foot in the door and gain some professional digital marketing experience, especially since I’ve struggled landing a job due to where I live as my mother moved us out of London where there aren’t any job opportunities. The job isn’t based where I live, I travel 2 hours by tram and bus every few days. So a 4 hour commute 3 days a week. 

It seemed like a good opportunity at first, as I’ve struggled to land a job I quickly accepted my first ever offer in my field.. however during training I’ve realised it’s not what I thought it would be. It’s more of a personal assistant and admin role than marketing. There isn’t a team, it’s just myself and the director based in a coworking space. The job mostly consists of responding to emails and stakeholder communications which I’m fine with, but he says my marketing duties will come later as for now he wants to focus on admin. Also, he wants me to reorganise all of his files, respond to emails, and other admin duties. I even organised his receipts for his accountant. I also found out he has a marketing agency he works with so I don’t see how I fit into that if they’re handling the marketing side of things.

I am grateful for everything so far and he did promise to take me to trade shows which I believe would be a great opportunity for experience in B2B, but I don’t know if I see myself staying in this role long enough to even attend one. 

To make things worse, he always arrives late. I rush out on the days I’m scheduled to work to get here on time, in fact, I’m always early. There’s only one time I was late. We were supposed to start work at 12:30pm, it’s now 13:10pm, he hasn’t arrived he told me where he is, nor has he apologised for being so late. I’m just sitting in the coworking space with nothing to do. I don’t have a work laptop, but he said he’s getting one for me, so I’m sat here just waiting for him. He sent me a message telling me he emailed over some videos for me to watch and it’s videos on trade shows. I can’t even access them and I told him I can’t and he said the instructions are in the email, I’ve tried but it’s still not working. 

I just feel that my skills are going to waste. I don’t see how any of this is relevant to marketing. And I think it’s quite unprofessional to be constantly late every single week. I feel there’s no respect for my time and energy. I make an effort to make it here on time.

And it’s a part-time role, 18 hours and only £12.50 an hour. I don’t see how this is worth it. I haven’t even signed a contract yet, he said he’s still getting it prepared, although I received my job offer in July.

I have a first class degree in marketing with honours, I’ve spent the years gaining additional skills in digital marketing, graphic design and web design. I may not have much industry experience but I’ve tried to upskill, develop new skills and develop my current skills further. I feel like I deserve better. 

I really want to leave this job, upskill in tech and explore further opportunities. I know what course I want to do. And I’d like to move back to London.

1mugclh,"My resume was getting zero replies, so I treated my job search like a science experiment","I've been grinding through job and gig market for months and honestly, it's been brutal. I feel like I've sent my resume into a black hole a thousand times over. You know the feeling, It leads to those late nights spent staring at a screen, endlessly tweaking resumes and gig applications all in the hope that it will please the filters and finally land on a human's desk.

TBH, my resume had become this generic, stupid generic document. It was a list of duties I performed, not a reflection of who I am or what I can actually do. It was boring me, so I can't imagine what a hiring manager thought.

So last week, out of sheer frustration, I decided to run an experiment. I figured what I was doing wasn't working, so I couldn't make it worse.



**1. I changed the entire goal of my resume.** I realized its job isn't to get me the job. Its only job is to survive a 7-second scan and convince someone to take one, single next step. It’s not a biography; it's a billboard on the side of a highway. It just needs to be interesting enough to make them pull over.

**2. I started speaking the robot's language.** I accepted that the first gatekeeper is often an algorithm (ATS) or a recruitment platform filter. I researched common skills for the roles I wanted, even ones I was only partially familiar with and made sure those keywords were on my resume. You have to beat the filters before you can talk to the human.

**3. I built a ""proof of life"" page.** This was the core of the experiment. I made a dead-simple one-page site with my name as the URL. I filled it with things a PDF can't show: screenshots, links to projects, and a short bio with more personality. It was my way of giving them an escape from the boring pile of resumes and proving I'm a real person who can do real things.

**4. I created a ""rejection log.""** This one was for my own sanity. I made a simple spreadsheet to track every application that went nowhere. Instead of feeling like a failure, seeing the list grow proved I was putting in the work. It turned rejection from a verdict into a simple metric and helped me detach emotionally.

**5. I'm starting to ""learn and do in public."" (This is the one I wish I'd started sooner).** I'm realizing a resume is just a snapshot. The real goal is to show you're always growing. It;s not like I’m trying to build a huge ""personal brand."" My goal is just to share my Point of View on my industry on LinkedIn or Twitter. Even if a post gets zero engagement, it shows recruiters who snoop on my profile how I think, not just what I've done.

And the strangest thing has happened since I started the first four steps. And i got results It's not like my inbox is exploding with offers, but I've gotten a handful of replies this week. A couple of them even said the portfolio link was the reason they reached out. 

So yeah, that's my experiment so far. What do you guys think? Anyone else broken out of the resume game with a weird trick or something?

1mugaxs,I want to leave my new job due to recent relationship developments but feel bad.,"I got a new job in a small company, my position is brand new. They have never had HR before and that is what I do plus some other things. I've been here for about 10 months now. At first, the job was great, owner is very nice and treats their employees good. The job is very self responsible, you do your work, get it done and no one breaths down your neck. Recently I started working remote to tend to a sick family member, I plan on returning in a few months.

 Since this remote work, one of my coworkers, that I have discovered a lot of the employees dont like and is the reason the last new hire quit, has been breathing down my neck. They send me book long emails and have been micromanage my work load and changing my order of operations. Which I wouldn't mind so much except I have built this position up from nothing and been doing a good job at it. Now all of a sudden, once the position has some ground beneath it, this coworker wants to change everything and micromanage me. 

I went to visit the office and this coworker yelled at me out of frustration. It was embarrassing and degrading. I've lost all respect for them. I've reached out to the owner and they see this happening but dont know how to handle it. They assure me I'm doing everything great and they even recently gave me a raise.

But I dont want to be micromanage by someone with zero experience in this field. Its frustrating. I want to quit but I feel bad for everything the owner has done for me just to leave. Specially letting me work remote to help my family. But I am not a child to be micromanaged by my coworker or yelled at because they cannot handle their own emotions. Is it bad that I want to leave? How do I fix this? Just be bold and tell this coworker what they are doing?

1muex4z,"What would you do: job responsibilities and function changed, no longer aligns with career goals","I’m in MarCom - when I was hired for my current job, my position was heavily focused on the marketing side rather than the comms side. Most of my prior experience was in comms but I was looking for an opportunity to make the switch over to marketing so this position seemed like the perfect fit.

Within the first year, my role expanded to include PR due to changes to the team structure. They eventually shifted one of the marketing functions I owned over to someone else and there is a lot of collaboration on the PR items, so most of the time my issue isn’t with workload or work/life balance. For context, there was no title change or reflective salary adjustment. I don’t have senior leadership ambitions so I’m not looking for a fast-track to a promotion.

Onto the issue: I’m transparent during check-ins and other appropriate conversations that the PR function - which majorly dominates my day-to-day and reduces the time I can spend on other marketing efforts - is not aligned with my career aspirations or goals. As much as I can be without sounding whiny. I know the team is not in a place to hire anyone new and others on the team couldn’t take on the PR work instead of myself. So there’s no plan to make further changes. 

I recently began considering looking elsewhere for a role that better aligns with my goals on the marketing side of things - either internally or even externally. My team leaders don’t want me to leave the company and stress that there are plenty of opportunities at our company but as far as I’m aware, marketing roles don’t open up often.

1muec8n,Should I quit my job and do school full time?,"Hello,

I'm 22 and I just got my Business Analytics bachelor's degree. I've been working at bank for nearly 2 years during my university. I'm going to enroll for Master's degree this year.

The problem is - I'm wondering if I should quit my job? My wage is above minimal wage, I work 100% remotely. I got moved to different team few months ago. It's a lot better job, but sadly it doesn't match with job I'd like to have. It's completely unrelated to things I learned at university.

Did I mention it got very stressful lately? So yes, For last 5-6 weeks it got very stressful, and I want to cry whenever I think about doing it again.

My parents pay for my housing and groceries, so if I quit the job I should be fine. Just with less money >. I have 16k in savings divided into different financial instruments.

I thought about not working for 1 semester, and doing few SQL/python courses.

Next problem is with expected hours I should work at my current job. At my old position I could make 80-120hrs/monthly but now 140hr/month is expected. I'm feeling slowly burned out because of working and studying.

I don't know what should I do.

  
I want to pursue career as Analytic - be it business/it, or IT-related job. I have experience in banking area (almost 2 years), what should I do, to increase my chances to find better job? What kind of certifications would you recommend for it?

Thanks :)

And yet, we don’t get any of the benefits of being self employed nor do we get any benefits of being employed, only the negatives.

They tell us when we are working, what jobs we are doing, how long we are out until (which can be up to 14 hours a day may I add” 
They pay us a flat £120 a day no matter how long we are out for even if this falls below minimum wage which it pretty much does every single day.  
No holiday pay, no sick pay, we are contracted 8am until 6pm but always work over this with no overtime pay.

They tell us we cannot refuse work ( even though the contract states that we can )

i am not the fan of the idea of working in music sphere. i love music but i've already realized that it's quite an ungrateful path to choose. so my other options right now are web development or a language-related career.

is there a chance for me to get a good job related to web and game dev without proper education? are there any affordable courses that offer projects after completion or give a valuable certificate?",yossi__fo,1,1.0,1,1755593657,2025-08-19 08:54:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mud2pa/career_possibilities/,8,2025

I’m about to complete 1 year as an Estimation Engineer (MEP). Right now, I don’t have much work, so I’m just sitting and googling things, while my two coworkers (who each have 16 years of experience) are actively discussing the project and doing stuff.

Sometimes I feel left out because they’re so experienced and I’m still new. I want to learn, but I don’t always know how to get involved or what to do when I have no tasks.

1muby4x,UPSC Aspirant Struggling with Financial Reality - Need Your Honest Take,"I am 23f, my_qualifications B.A.(( history+Political Science) and am preparing for UPSC and it's my dream, but honestly, the financial pressure is getting to me. I can barely afford good study materials, and the uncertainty of multiple attempts is scary when money's tight.

I know I need a backup plan, and I'm torn between banking exams, UGC NET, or CAT. The thing is, I don't want to half-ass my UPSC prep, but I also can't ignore the reality that I might need something more immediate.

What I'm really asking:

Anyone been in this spot? How did you handle the mental struggle of preparing for your dream vs. being practical?
Which backup actually makes sense if UPSC is still my main focus? Banking seems easier to juggle, but I'm not sure.
How do you deal with that voice in your head saying ""maybe you should just focus on something more realistic""?
I'm not looking for motivation speeches - I need real talk from people who get it. Did having a backup help or hurt your UPSC preparation? How did you manage on a shoestring budget?

Sometimes I feel like I'm being stupid for chasing UPSC when I could secure a decent job sooner, but giving up on it feels like giving up on myself.

Any honest advice would mean a lot. Thanks for reading this rambling post.

Edit: Thanks to everyone commenting. It helps knowing I'm not alone in this struggle.

I dropped out of my chemical engineering school after losing my mother to domestic violence.
She was a single mom and left me half a mil.
It was quite traumatizing, which led to me being addicted to controlled substances.
Along the way I picked up a felony charge for starting a dumpster fire near a gas station.
Now I am 3 years sober. 
I work for a small company and make around 50k a year.
I have also bought a small condo for myself and I rent the other room for expenses.
I have positive cash flow, life is simple.

This job is very easy. I started off at $17. Few moments later everyone got shifted to $19. Then last week my team and I got moved up to $21. 

The reason why I love this job is obviously how the pay went up to $21 (full time) but also how we get holidays off and paid and also get 2 weeks off for christmas break ALSO paid. What other job has that?? I’ve never had a job like this before.

My dilemma is that I am currently in school doing my pre-reqs to hopefully apply at my colleges rad tech program in 2027. The new job I just applied to is for a patient transporter at a hospital. This job will obviously help me get familiar with the hospital and patient setting. This Job is currently going for $24 full time. But unfortunately it is a hospital with a 24/7 schedule.

1mu8xwb,Need Advice on Going Back to an Old Job,"Hi. I need advice on if I should go back to my old job. I worked for company #1 for two and 1/2 years low pay but really good benefits. I was burnt out with no promotion or higher pay. A lot of project fell on me and I was told my promotion was coming. My team constantly asked for help and we were constantly given projects outside of our scope of work (I’m in the medical field but work from home so working within my scope is important). Me and a few other coworkers took our complaints to higher up. We presented facts with data to back us up and solutions to the problems but was met with very little action. 

I started at company #2. Higher pay and decent benefits and also work from home. I’m about 3 months in and am not allowed to do anything but be in a phone queue. They are behind on training the others that were hired on before me. Metrics are wildly unattainable comparative to those that I’ve spoken to in my field at other companies. The company is a non profit and every company meeting is about how we’re losing money. My dilemma is that I could go back to my old job and I know I’d be welcome, but I did tell them I left for low pay and continuous insane workload. I’ve tried looking for other jobs, but right now my job market is extremely competitive.

1mu8nhe,How to word this professionally?,"Started a new job about 4 months ago. I work in quality at a manufacturing plant. This is not my first quality position. However, here, since my training period ended, I am seeing that my job is basically pointless. The operators know how to run their own tests, including the ones I'm supposed to do, and when they get things out of spec, they don't worry about it and say they don't need to fix anything as there is a system that 100% checks the parts and kicks out nonconforming product before it leaves the building. 

That said, my immediate quality supervisor seems to be implying that I don't do my job without telling me what my job is despite me asking for a job description on multiple occasions. There doesn't even seem to be a reaction plan on place for nonconforming product since this system is in place at the end of the line. Looking at the data, it looks like 2/32 parts we make are failing 100% of the time. 

So my real question is how do I ask the plant manager what the fuck the point of my job is? I'm not trying to talk myself out of a job, but I am only seeing redundancies in everything I am doing.

1mu7yu0,I'm torn - Promotion in same company or higher paying job for a lower role?,"Hi everyone, badly need advice.

I'm 26F. I tried applying for a promotion at a company that I have worked on for almost 3 yrs. Not to brag but to give you a bit of a context, I was promoted at a faster rate compared to my colleagues. I started as a Tech Support, became a Shift Manager, Team Lead, and it looks like I will be promoted again.

However, I am no longer happy with the company that I'm currently working on due to bias in the upper management and stressful co-workers. I'm also burnt out managing my team as a TL so that may have affected as well. My current salary at this company is around $750 per month. I'm from the Philippines.

Last month, I tried to look at company listings and found a job posting that pays $9 per hour but in a lower role, Tech Support. I applied and heard back from them this week. To be honest, I can't decline the offer because it's double my current salary. 

Now, I'm torn between the two. Won't they get mad at me if I suddenly resign after being promoted? If you were in my situation, what would you do? Maybe I'm just overthinking this? This was my first job after graduating so I have no idea and would appreciate any advice from those who have already experienced this same dilemma before.

1mu637d,What would you do: job responsibilities and function expanded into an area that doesn’t align with my career goals,"I’m in marketing & communications - when I was hired for my current job, my position was heavily focused on the marketing side rather than the comms side. While most of my prior experience was in PR, I was looking for an opportunity to make the switch over to marketing so this position seemed like the perfect fit.

Just less than one year into my tenure, my role expanded to include more responsibilities due to layoffs that impacted my team. They added PR to my purview without significantly reducing/removing anything else (though eventually one of the marketing functions I owned was transitioned to someone else and there is a lot of collaboration on the PR items). There was no title change or representative salary adjustment either. I don’t have senior leadership ambitions so I’m not looking for a fast-track to a promotion, I just mention this for context.

Now, a few years later, there is still no plan to rectify the change. I’m consistently vocal that the PR function - which majorly dominates my day-to-day - is not aligned with my career aspirations or goals. As much as I can be without sounding whiny. I know the team is not in a place to hire anyone new and others on the team couldn’t take on the PR work instead of myself.

I’m tempted to begin looking elsewhere for a role that better aligns with my goals - either internally or externally. My team leaders don’t want me to leave the company and stress that there are plenty of opportunities at our company but there have been no roles in marketing that I’ve seen open up in the past few months.

1mu5xzc,"Current job has a potentially layoff-heavy merger in the coming months, should I take this startup offer?","Basically, my current company was acquired by a larger company recently. They did the usual 'nothing is going to change', spiel. And for a bit everything was fine. But they announced that by the end of the year a reorg will occur that will integrate the company into the parent company.

Both companies do similar things, and the executives were mostly talking about how great the marketing department was. I am a software developer, so I assume that they are probably going to gut the tech department and use the surviving developers for life support and to integrate parts of the system into the parent company's system. Also, the parent company is not remote, and I am remote, so even if I survive the merger I will probably have to move to a different city in the near future.

I started furiously applying and got an offer from a small seed stage startup, they only have \~20 employees but the founder says they have about a year of runway, people already using the product, and investors who 'believe in the mission'. They also have a large waitlist of clients wanting to use their product, they just need to flesh out the software to support them and remove some manual tasks. Theres only one other developer so I would be working with him and the founder. It would be a 30k base salary pay bump (not including equity which I just view as monopoly money) from what I'm making right now, assuming the job lasts a year.

Ive only been at my current job for less than a year, and if this startup job doesn't last long (I dont expect it to), I feel like that would look bad on my resume.

Should I keep looking? Stay in my current job and hope somehow things work out? Given the current job market for software developers, I feel like I might not be able to get something else by the end of the year and could be in a bad situation.

1mu5ogk,Dream job offer came in after I already accepted and started a different role—should I switch?,"Back in May, I interviewed for two analyst positions:

* **Job #1 (Children’s Hospital)** – my top choice. As a former teacher turned analyst, the mission aligned with my values, and the team culture felt like a perfect fit. I did three rounds of interviews, including one with the team I’d be joining, and left feeling really excited about the potential.
* **Job #2 (Fortune 500 Financial Company)** – not my first choice, but it was a new role where I’d be building reporting from scratch for a large tech team. The team is \~50 people, mostly contractors working remotely. Only my direct boss and I would be in a local office together.

**What happened:**

* In mid-June, I got an **offer from Job #2**: $85k salary, 20 PTO days, 11 holidays, 7% 401k match, and strong health insurance. This was a big jump from my last role ($65k, 10 PTO days, 7 holidays, 2% match), so I accepted.
* At the same time, I was still in final rounds for Job #1. But they told me their decision would take longer, so I couldn’t wait.

By late July, I started Job #2. Almost immediately, I felt uneasy—like I should have stayed at my old job or held out for Job #1. Understanding the ins and outs of the company is overwhelming but also boring. The team is all over the country, and the company just announced a 2-3 day RTO policy for some people and 4 days for others. It is unclear if this will ever apply to me but manager isn’t concerned as of right now.

Then, last week (three weeks into Job #2), **Job #1 called me**. They were going to go with an internal candidate initially, but that person moved into a different role that had just been created, and they are asking me to join the analytics team.

**The offers:**

* **Job #2 (current)**
   * $85k salary
   * 20 PTO days + 11 holidays
   * 7% 401k match (begins after one year of service and then immediately vested)
   * Strong health insurance
   * 12 weekish paid maternity leave
   * \~35-mile (35–45 min) commute if/when RTO is enforced
* **Job #1 (Children’s Hospital)**
   * $76k salary (I asked if they could meet me in the middle since I already had an $85k offer; recruiter spoke with the VP, but they said they’re firm at $76k to maintain internal pay equity)
   * 28 PTO days (can be used for holidays)
   * \~4% 401k match (fully vested after 3 years)
   * Good but slightly weaker insurance
   * No paid maternity leave, only STD (typical for hospitals I believe)
   * Remote with once-a-month office days, local team, stronger culture fit
   * 15-minute commute

**My dilemma:**

Would I be crazy to leave a higher-paying, Fortune 500 role after just 3 weeks, burning a bridge for a job that pays less but feels more aligned with my values and work style?

* The $9k difference feels significant now, but maybe not in the long run—especially considering the much better commute and PTO.
* Financial services likely has a higher ceiling, but I don’t know if I’ll ever love it.
* The hospital feels like a place where I’d enjoy the work and the people more, which I think could matter a lot for my career and happiness.

1mu4uxe,How to explain short tenure?,"TL;DR How to explain short job tenure at two roles to recruiter/hiring manager due to circumstances outside of my control?

I am early in my career (3 years out of college). I was laid off from my first job of 2 years due to a very public ransomware event that bankrupted my company. This was in the local news.

I’m almost 1 year in my current role and trying to leave. I took a $30k pay cut when taking this job and my new employer is heavily impacted by the current administration leading to high levels of stress/burnout and cost threat of layoffs.

When I’ve meant with recruiters/hiring manager they always hone in on my short tenure.

I’ve tried giving a variety of answers and none some satisfactory. Sometimes I’m fully transparent about Job #1 having a ransomware event, and Job #2 being reliant on federal funds. Other times I only mention Job #2’s federal funding dilemma because the gap between Job #1 and #2 is so short it seems like a normal transition time.

1mu40j2,"Stuck propping up useless team, need advice before I get myself fired.","(Throwaway account)

My manager has a bit of over inflated confidence, disproportionate to their actual contributions. Their position seems to stem less from real value and more from convenience, as their boss (a director) is disengaged from the details of the roles/departments they oversee and was completely new to the industry/company when they got the job. For years, my manager operated over a small, high volume/minimal effort team, only to be put into greater responsibility following one of many restructurings.

I’m now in a new team formed by this director after another restructure. They failed to clarify the team’s function or its relationship with their other departments amidst all the changes, leaving my manager to make it up themselves, which has produced disappointing results, as other teams do not take our work/team seriously. My manager constantly pushes for collaboration with other departments to legitimize our work, which isn’t really working, and in reality we are not needed. At least not without some formal responsibility changes from the director, which we won’t be getting. Early on, my manager went out of their way to be like second banana to the director, drafting department emails and organizational proposals for them, and these were all ignored.

Our team is burdened with multiple weekly team meetings and excessive documentation, in an effort to I guess give us a process. We have a work board to track tasks at a high level (with details of the work and dates, etc.), followed by over engineered project documents (adapted from a portion of my own work, as the manager struggles with organizing and writing thoughts), then projects logged in a PM software, excessive task lists, and timecards with detailed notes. Each of these requires duplicative updates, consuming significant time (as none of these things can “talk” or reference the other). But the reasoning is so we have “visibility” with the teams, but none are ever reviewed by other teams or even senior management. Every time my managers creates a document or presentation to display, I have to go in and re-do everything because it always looks sloppy and has poor grammar and incomplete thoughts (and this is with them using ChatGPT for every little thing). Additionally, they always have their own interpretation of meetings and next steps, and get so defensive when I (politely) point out they’re incorrect, even with recordings or minutes.

My manager's previous team was already struggling prior to the changes, largely due to a lack of organization and priorities. Despite these issues, my manager has maintained positive favor with upper leadership.

One of my new co-workers (from a team perspective), has worked with my manager for years, and was promoted into a senior role by them due to fabricated work on paper. In reality, their workload is minimal and often completed by other teams or myself, and what’s left for them to actually do is rarely ever done or is done very late. I am frequently expected to hand hold this person through their “new” responsibilities, even with projects getting reassigned to them after I’ve already done most of the work, I now get to walk them through how to finish it, while getting none of the credit. This person is online maybe 2 hours a day, and take a week to do the most basic things. They constantly reach out to me last minute when they need to have something to show and don’t know what to do. And my manager is honestly no better; they’re always away at some appointment or at a random location always with bad connection (requiring me to have to take lead on things). They’re supposed to be a ‘working manager’ but never follow through on anything (manager or work related).

In the last year, while I was with a different department, my manager also gave someone else a false promotion, complete with a new title and pay raise, where the only thing they did was ¼ of the work I used to do before moving to a new team (and to a degree I was still supporting that work as well, everything else I still kept while having to take on new responsibilities). The basis for this persons work was just modifying some reporting I had built before, and passing it off as new, which my manager was aware of. The director was new at the time, so they didn’t know me or what I had been doing all this time, so all this went unchallenged.

I have had promises of a promotion for two years, and the my manager claims leadership is “aligned” and all the necessary meetings(?) have happened revolving a promotion, just waiting on next steps…..this was months ago.

I know I need to find a new job (this company is ridiculous), but I would love some advice on how to navigate until then if anyone has had even remotely similar experience (I can’t seem to find anything close via Google). My patience is wearing thin, and I am on the verge of losing it and getting myself fired.

1mu24g1,What would be your choice if I asked for a raise?,"Hi everyone, around the beginning of May, I took a contract for an end-user support role (basically helpdesk with a bit of tier 2 work) for 6 months. It's been 4 months so far, I've really liked it, the people are nice and helpful, especially my coworker and supervisor, all nice people. The environment, although I would face some difficult users I they usually don't cause too much of an issue because of all this, I think overall this is a good place for me to grind out some experience while paying the bills. With all of the good things, there is always a problem, and for this company, it's the fact that there is no clear way of moving upwards. More than half of the company is ""consultants""(contracted) to work there, and the chance for full-time employment only comes after 3 years of time spent with the company, pending some exceptions. So far, I don't mind spending time here and just getting experience and learning, searching for my next role, but as it's getting closer to my renewal, I am getting stacked with more and more work to do. Currently, I am doing a PM's work where I am playing a project, looking through the budget, holding meetings with stakeholders on why we need to put here and here, getting the resources needed, and finally getting everything started, ready to execute in the coming month. It was completely out of my job description for me to do these things, but I don't mind because I have experience in different areas because of it. The problem now is that we are a team of 5 people, 2 supervisors, and 3 ""consultants"" working, and recently one of the consultants quit, which only leaves me and the new coworker that we got around 2 weeks ago, whom I've also been training. With all of this, I feel like I'm doing a lot more than what I should be doing, and feel that a raise should be a fair thing to get? But im a bit scare to ask for one as ive never done this before and my previous experiences have all full full-time positions where the expectation were each year you would get a raise.

I have been working with one of the 2 big credit rating agency for 3 years now, covering a portfolio of largely LBO corporate names and a couple of IG names, based out of Europe. 

I am been quite unhappy with tepid pace of career growth and frankly approaching disillusionment. To add to this there have been some changes in senior management with them imlementing their new strategy and vision frankly, they have sucked the joy out of the work. 

So here's my doubt, what could be a potential career opportunities from here ? Private credit sounds quite relevant to me and it's a fast growing segment of the market too. Any advice/sharing on experience on how I could target opportunities in this segment? What are the other fields I could aim for if not private debt ?

1mtzjjt,Is it worth being a pharmacologist in Canada?,"Hi I’m a class of 2028, yes pretty young, but enough to be concerned for my future. It’s been a topic of discussion between me and my parents for quite some time over the summer, on where I would go after graduating High school in Alberta. Seeing I already have some advanced extra classes and a Mother who works in healthcare (and works a bit with medicine) for more than a decade, it was pretty much a no brainer for me to also get into the field but behind closed doors. 

Cutting to the chase, I wanted to know of it was worth it getting a Masters after 4 years for the BSc, and if the entirety of getting into medicine as a whole is a good idea. Pharmacists respectfully have a better salary and often have more job availability in Alberta, likely very stable too, and it’s likely I’ll move to Toronto or Vancouver for more biotech jobs, kinda a big no no with how expensive everything is in those cities. Pharmacists have high demand here in AB, but I’m sure the demand will be fulfilled with the years I have before I’m qualified to even work with medicine, with immigration of very qualified people and many new grads as well. 

I’m planning to enroll into the university of Alberta as soon as I graduate, already have the funds, and have no problem financially, just need to get a grasp on what I’m dealing with here and what professionals in the field can guide me with.

1mtz47z,Looking to pivot away from software development due to stress in life. What are my options?,"Basically, I have about 6-8 years experience as a software developer. I am coming to the realization that it feels very difficult for me to find a work environment in this industry that matches with me and all the problems going on in my life outside work.

It just feels like this industry is extremely cold and filled with cold and unsympathetic people. I worked in a different industry prior to this and even though that industry is not known for sympathetic people, it was like night and day compared to this one. The endless outsourcing and abuse that comes from management onto those workers seeps over to US workers as well. Between all the problems going on outside work (I am seeing a therapist, please do not tell me that will fix my problem) and the stress from this industry is becoming too much for me.

I am seeking advice on maybe a place where I can pivot that will lead to less stress on the job. I experienced that in this field once with a company I really enjoyed, but that company laid off a bunch of workers (including me) and then turned extremely toxic like the rest of the industry afterwords. Forced attrition cuts each year and killing the supportive culture it had.

Where can one realistically pivot from a career in SWE to one that has a more chill work environment? One where I feel like I can turn off after work, I don't need to endlessly study for interviews outside work, and one where work is steady and there is none of this PIP culture or x% of people need to be laid off each year? I will take a pay cut (as long as it is a livable wage) for this type of job. Key word though is it has to be livable wages for today (so minimum 80k, but can be higher obviously).

I truly do love coding, but I hate what this industry has become. Does anyone have real advice on where one can pivot too for what I am seeking? It can be tech related or non-tech related.

I struggled with my mental health a lot during school and honestly could never imagine myself having a career. I was really lonely in school and I never discussed going to university or what I want to do after school with anyone because I never knew, I went to a university fair with my school and it was so boring and mundane that I left after speaking to 3 people about courses I didn’t want to do. When application deadlines were near I applied to a course knowing I didn’t want to do it just to keep my parents happy for the time being, but I kept telling them I wanted to do a gap year and rethink what I wanted to do.

Through clearing I ended up with an offer to do law at a university that’s not well ranked. I’m excited at the idea of moving away and doing something new but I think that deep down I’m just convincing myself that I want to do it because it has a clear career path from it and I don’t want to “waste” a year of my life thinking about what I want to do. I also struggled a lot with my mental health during school and I’m worried that the same thing might happen to me if I go to university but I won’t have my family there and I’ll be expected to cook and clean while I can barely roll out of bed.

I work at a horrible job that I dread going to every day (worst job I’ve ever had out of like 6) who gave me 16 hours a week all summer when I told them I wanted more hours while im free and they said they could accommodate it.

I’m also concerned about spending another year living at home because my relationship with my family is very inconsistent and can be so incredibly toxic, especially when I’m at home for long periods of times like holidays (or what I would be at home for doing a gap year).

I don’t really see a happy outcome for me between going thousands in debt for a degree I might hate and rotting in bed all day or living at home, working a job I hate while I know I’m capable of pursuing a degree at university, and having a screaming match with my family over tiny things.

Multiple people in my family have disabilities and I’ve done loads of volunteer work with the disabled and want to make my career around that. I’ve thought of becoming either a disability lawyer or pursuing a medical specialty like neurology or genetics that would allow me to work with and connect with people with disabilities. I feel more drawn to the idea of being a doctor, but I worry that I would feel like my job is just diagnosing patients and not having much ability to help them because of the nature of their diseases. I’m also very worried about how AI could affect specialties centered around diagnosing conditions because that sounds like something AI could do very well.

1mtyyw1,Need career advice as someone starting out. Help!,"Hello everyone, I need advice regarding my career as I'm feeling confused about which path to follow.

**Background;**

20M, recently immigrated to the US (NY), had to drop out of college in the process. Will be restarting it as a freshman.

Here's what I've been told about myself:

\- practical work > theoretical work for me

\- that I'm entitled and unrealistic (you'll see this soon enough)

I know about my passion- content creation. I've been doing it for around 5 years now (so I know it's not a phase), and plan on making it my career. However, I feel I should have a backup plan, a safety net of sorts in case it doesn't work out.

**Advice needed:**

I need to decide what my (backup) career would be. Ideally, something that has pays well, has job security, a good work/life balance and does not require an insane amount of studying (like a doctor).

(see what I mean by entitled and unrealistic? I am trying to work on this, but considering everything, what would be the BEST option to choose from for me?)

Here are my options with some context, the pros and cons for each:

**(1). Nursing:**

I would not mind the work (I enjoyed biology in high school), there's no threat of AI taking over the job and the pay is good as well. The issue I have is that maybe I want to move countries later on in life, where there's no jobs for nurses, what would I do then?

I thought about becoming a dentist, but 8 years of schooling put me off.

**(2). Marketing:**

I like marketing (I've done social media marketing) and I think it could help me with my passion as well. The downside is that I don't think it pays well, and do I even need a degree to get into marketing? how do I find entry level roles in this? Secondly, I believe that jobs might take a major hit due to AI, especially mid and entry level roles and I would be out of a job, no better than without a degree.

**(3). Finance/CS:**

Broad field I know, but I like the 'quant' side of it (econ + cs). Pays really well so <3

However, is this not TOTALLY replaceable by AI? Research, analysis presentations? or even the entry level software engineers? I also feel I am romaticizing this.

**side note:**

I was pursuing CS in uni, but put almost zero effort into it, leading me to barely passing courses. I love the money that comes with it, but neither this nor finance REALLY interest me. Should I still opt for either of these paths?

and should i even go to college? does not having a degree form a 'roof' for corporate growth?

1mtyol8,30 y/o considering major career pivot — advice from high earners?,"I just turned 30 and want to recreate my career with the goals of financial freedom and (hopefully) some fulfillment. I’m hoping to get advice from people here since I haven’t had much luck finding mentorship in my own network.

Quick background:

I have a BS in Petroleum Engineering and accelerated MBA from a state school, but pivoted out of oil & gas and into finance/analytics at a few mid-stage startups (none of which worked out) and now a large stable company with 7 years total experience. My current pay is around $130k, but the work feels unfulfilling and the job is easy but likely a dead end for my career. Currently no kids/unmarried but plan to change all that in \~5 years

Here are the main paths I’ve been thinking about:

**Pilot** 

* **Pros:** high pay once senior, lifestyle seems fun, every pilot I’ve talked to enjoys it 
* **Cons:** long time to reach current salary, 10+ nights a month away from home, automation risk, might get boring

**Software Engineer** 

* **Pros:** always been interested in it, good pay at top companies, probably fastest pivot (via CS master’s) 
* **Cons:** behind a screen all day, competitive, risk of not landing a good role, ageism?, already burnt out on corporate grind

**Physician** 

* **Pros:** meaningful work, strong pay once established, fulfilling in its own way 
* **Cons:** long road (10+ years), big debt burden, lifestyle challenges

I haven’t found a career I “love” yet, but I do like complex problem solving, competition, and working with people. I’ve also kicked around the idea of going into the trades and eventual entrepreneurship or even sales, but those are lower priority right now. Obviously the above are summarizations of the actual research I have put into these careers.

My questions for you all:

1. Do any of these paths stand out as clearly smarter (or dumber) financially long-term?  
2. Are there career options I’m overlooking that fit my background/goals?  
3. Any pitfalls I’m not seeing?",dolphin_meat420,7,1.0,18,1755551458,2025-08-18 21:10:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mtyol8/30_yo_considering_major_career_pivot_advice_from/,8,2025
1mtyn1n,How do you actually build a smart exit plan?,"Third burnout finally forced the question. This time it wasn’t the “work is crushing me” kind of burnout.

My corporate comms job in a big org is so process-heavy and slow-moving that I can do it without too much resistance. And I've got a lot of free time. But, there's no incentive to ask for more work as  progression is basically non-existent. Everyone’s just going through the motions all the way up the chain.

I’ve spent 13 years in corporate and political communications and I really want to start teaching what I've learnt. I’ve already started building traction coaching professionals on evenings and weekends on the same topics I teach grads in our organisation. This has got some surprisingly promising early signs. Longer-term, I want to build a reputation as an expert in organisational psychology and write about the future of work.

The catch: baby #2 due soon, so I can’t just light a match and walk away.

For those a few steps ahead:

* If you used a stable role as a runway for something new, maybe something completely different, what steps made the difference?
* What should I have in place before making any decisions (runway, client pipeline, systems, network, health)?
* What “hidden costs” caught you off guard in the transition? Honestly, part of me just thinks I should side step and make a career move up to another organisation - but I'm certain it would feel equally empty.
* How did you know when the side income was strong enough to make the jump?

I love being in London and want to stay in a big city ( I live in NYC currently). It would make me extremely happy but queen mary is a non target and would lowkey tarnish my brand. It's a downgrade from my home uni and I don't know if paying all that money for a mid uni when I can go somewhere better is worth it from a logical standpoint. 

2.Sciences Po ; Paris : Super prestigious. Classy. I love France and I love Paris so this is my best pick. I'm also majoring in International Business and Sciences Po is infamous with international affairs and politics. Also very good networking opportunities and brand recognition.

3.Bocconi ; Milan : Bocconi is an excellent university for finance and consulting and is a huge target school and asset to your resume. I just don't want to live in Milan though. I wouldn't mind making the sacrifice if Bocconi really is THAT much better than Sciences Po.

1mty174,Should I ask for unpaid leave to work on language skills necessary for my job?,"I work for an international company and recently transferred to a new country. Being an international company they work in both English and the local language (Spanish). Their expectation was that I would start with the English work and learn Spanish while I work so that I could do local work, progress in my career and integrate with the team well. 

I’ve been struggling with learning the language. I’ve been taking classes and working very hard on it but language learning has always been very difficult for me.

I have an exam scheduled in a month that I’m very nervous about passing and I don’t see myself becoming truly fluent in the timespan my boss and I originally discussed. My boss and coworkers have been very supportive and complimentary about my progress so far but I’m starting to fall short of the goals we set for me integrating and working effectively in Spanish. 

A local university offers a full time course for learning the language. It would take me around 2-3 months. I am considering asking my boss about taking unpaid leave to do this. 

Overall they have been very happy with my performance and I think I have a good relationship with my boss. I think I’m very sound technically and I work well with the team. We work in a more niche field and I have an uncommon degree focused on our field and a lot of experience for a young employee. Additionally our team is doing quite well and has been searching for new employees and promoting people to bigger roles. My boss has also allowed a few people to take leave for education and personal reasons and treats the team well. All of this to say I don’t think I would be let go or replaced for taking a leave but I’m still worried about how this could affect my career and everyone’s opinion of me. 

How would you feel about an employee asking for leave like this? 

Is it better for me to take a leave and come back fluent or for me to become fluent over a longer period while working? 

Should I bring this up to my boss now before the exam so if I don’t do well it isn’t a surprise or would it be better to wait and see how the exam goes? 

Thanks for any advice!

I’m about half way there, without including overtime, and am thinking about going back to school to get the skills and degree necessary for a higher paying job.

1mtvxau,Am I being cynical or is it really that bad?,"I (26F) worked within a specialist department under my company’s wider consulting department alongside my previous line manager, who was known for siloing me away from the wider team, until it restructured and senior leadership decided to get rid of the specialist department I worked in. Because I hadn’t worked with the wider department’s team before, other consultants at my level had already developed strong relationships with the wider department and, ultimately, senior leadership, than I had. 

I feel like I work to the best of my ability and consistently deliver strong work, but that these efforts aren’t reflected in some of the feedback I’ve been receiving. Whilst some of the feedback I’ve received has been really strong and I’ve been nominated for company-wide awards on back of the strength of some of the work I’ve been doing, I recently received vague, anonymised feedback from a mid-year review saying that my ‘time management needs improving’, the time I spent on a piece of work ‘didn’t correspond with the quality delivered’, and that my office presence could be improved even though I come in the mandatory 3 days a week - none of which I’ve been told prior to my mid year review.

My current line manager says that I could improve my visibility by posting more regularly on our department’s group chat and by bringing treats into the office - this is something another colleague of mine does which my line manager said was working to their advantage, but I don’t feel like I should have to spend money on things for people that are unwilling to give me honest, direct, or real-time feedback just so they notice me more?! I’ve been trying my best to be friendly with everyone and I have good relationships with some of the people I work with, but I still feel like an outsider due to not having the same interests as them at times. 

Despite trying my best on projects and openly expressing an explicit interest in data to heavy, corporate strategy projects which is where I feel my strengths lie, I’m often staffed onto unrelated projects halfway through them as a substitute rather than from the beginning. I don’t know if working under my last line manager stitched me up but it feels like colleagues at my level are commended more highly and are being given better opportunities for doing less and producing work at a lesser quality than I do. 

Is this what corporate is like or is this a problem that specific to the company I work for? Or, maybe I’ve just deluded myself into thinking I’m better than I actually am? I’ve been feeling really demotivated with everything that’s been going on - sometimes I get so overwhelmed I have to find a quiet room to work in by myself for an hour or two in case I start crying - and I don’t know what more I’m supposed to do at this stage.

1mtvl30,Currently Work Corporate want to switch to Nursing - ADN Evening/Weekend program or Chamberlain Online feasible?,"I currently work a corporate job ($98k annual) and have been in corporate since 2019. I feel like I've forced my way for the past couple of years and I really dread waking up in the morning everyday to go to work. I've always been interested in nursing and the medical field (most of my friends and family are part of it), and I want to fully commit to switching into nursing with hopefully becoming RN -> NP or CRNA depending on how the future looks.

I understand what nursing intitles and how stressful being a nurse can be. Please I don't want to read through all the comments stating negatives about nursing, how its also corporate and why I would want to leave my job, etc like most of these threads I've been reading. I just want advice.

What I would like to understand is even feasible, would realistically be better for me as I have a partner and bills to pay:

The CC next my house offers an Evening/Weekend ADN track, I'm not sure how the schedule exactly works. I would like to keep my full-time job while perusing this route as well, but I would like to understand how feasible it really is from how demanding I hear ADN programs are. Is it possible? I have my pre-reqs already, however the program doesn't start till AUG 2026. I missed the window this year.

Another option I thought about that seems more doable from my research is attending the Chamberlain Online Nursing program, I had my transcript evaluated by them and they accepted about 30ish (tuition $70kish) . So I would have about 90 credits to do and I can start immediately unlike the ADN program. I will most likely finish a little before the ADN program with a BSN. If it is feasible to keep my job while doing this program, I can afford paying the tuition.

1mtuh3x,Any Career Change Advice?,"Any career change advice? Feeling stuck at 28

Backstory: I’m 28 and hold a BS in Secondary English Education as well as an MA in English Education.

I started my career teaching, but by the end of my second year I was completely burnt out. I was overworked, underpaid, and questioning everything. At that point I had already completed my master’s degree, and I honestly felt like I had locked myself into education with no way out.

Then life shifted. My husband is in the military, and when we moved I stayed home for 9 months with our first baby. Before I got my current job, I tried applying for positions on base, as well as roles in instructional design, educational technology, and publishing/writing. Almost all of those fields wanted multiple years of experience, which I did not have. Eventually, I became an administrative coordinator at a local university. The pay is technically more than what I would make teaching here, but it is still not great. On top of that, the work environment is toxic and I dread going into the office.

Now I am pregnant again, and I keep wondering if I should start planning a bigger career change after the baby is born. I do not want to make a rash decision, but I also do not want to stay miserable and stagnant.

What makes this harder is the guilt. I already have student loans, and part of me feels like a failure for not figuring things out by now. I thought that by my late 20s I would have a stable, fulfilling career and a decent paycheck. Instead I feel lost and stuck.

If you have made a career switch in your late 20s or later, I would love to hear your advice or experiences. How did you know it was time? What helped you find a path that felt right?

1mtugcu,Totally checked out at my job. Should I tell them I’m done doing extra duties.,"I took a counter offer over a year ago and was promised a promotion into a new role that would open in our department in spring 2025 if I took on the work of this role primarily while helping out where I can in my current role leading up to the spring. But on top of that, my helping out in my current role is basically being a supervisor to my 3 other coworkers who are the same level as me, I just have more years on them. 

The role never got approved in the spring and there was no commitment to make anything else happen. Just keep on with the extra work for now. 

So I brushed up my resume and for the last 2-3 months I’ve been job hunting and I’d say I’ve had some pretty good interest. I’ve turned down a few jobs because I wasn’t desperate to leave and I’ve allowed myself to be picky. 

I have a second round interview this week with a company that I’m really interested in and they seem interested in me too. They even said they would be interested in me for a couple other roles too if this one I applied for doesn’t work out. I also had a really good interview at a very similar company that I think I have a good chance at getting an offer too. 

I feel so checked out. I’m not working hard on anything anymore, I’m letting a lot slide because I just don’t care anymore. I know if I cared I could manage the workload no problem but there is no incentive now and I’m fully committed to leaving as soon as I get an offer somewhere else. My manager is great (I didn’t make this counter offer deal with him, it was his boss) and he’s going to go up to bat for me and push to make something happen this week. Calling a meeting with his boss to figure something out. Maybe he’s noticed I’ve taken a lot of sick days (interviews) the last couple months and knows somethings up. He even made a comment the other day that this place will be screwed if either him or I leave. I’ve had to fill in for my manager a lot this year as he’s been away on vacation or away for work and the other 3 of my coworkers need someone to constantly give them instruction. He would rather I be a supervisor for him instead of moving to the other job that was supposed to open in our department. No one else is reliable enough. 

As much as I like my 3 co workers, I can’t help but feel resentment that I have so many years on them at this company (I’ve been here 8 years to their 1-3 years) and I am still in the same level as they are, yet they can’t do tasks that I was doing at 1-2 years in. They also don’t take responsibility to own tasks, or initiative to really figure out problems. They seem happy to wait to be told what to do and have either my manager or me figure out the hard stuff for them. What’s crazy is that I am the youngest person here. 

Should I just tell them I’m done doing any of the extra work and supervision and just going back to my regular job duties, only what’s expected out of the other 3 guys. and I’m no longer interested in promotion or should I just keep playing along as if nothings wrong and leave when I’m ready?

1mttbce,Should I Stay or Should I Go?,"I was laid off from a help desk job back in May. Hell, they laid off half the company, so I didn’t survive the Thanos snap. 

I interviewed for a few places and was hired by a Software Developer. It’s completely a 180° from what I did but they’re a good company. 

However, I was offered a job with another company a little after. More IT work that I’m used to.

Here’s the pros and cons, and why I’m at this point. 

Current company: learning and doing new things, nice coworkers, great benefits and 401k plan. Hybrid as well. 

Cons: 30 miles away from home means filling the tank twice a week, even for a subcompact SUV (I can go hybrid on 9/1). 
Took a pay cut ($1/hr) to work there. 

This other company

Pros: $4/hr more than I make now and 10 miles from home. Doing stuff I know how to do already but also new things to learn as well. Benefits aren’t bad but 401k starts after working there for 3 years. 

Cons: no hybrid or remote option. 

Is it even possible to try to renegotiate pay? Doing the math, what I’m being paid now doesn’t leave much room for saving. Would I speak with my manager, the director, and/or HR? I would like to stay (especially doing Quality Reviews for programs the govt uses in their aerospace sector, it’s kinda cool!) but if it’s more money and less traveling on the other side, it kinda makes a difference there.

1mttavf,Need help!!,"Sales reddit 
Been in high-ticket sales for a while – thinking of starting a coaching bootcamp, but unsure how to scale. Any advice?

I’ve been working in sales (primarily high-ticket/consultative sales) for the past few years, and I’ve noticed something interesting – a lot of people around me (friends, juniors, even colleagues) struggle with the basics of selling:

how to open a conversation without sounding pushy,

how to handle objections,

and how to actually build trust that leads to conversions.


Whenever I share strategies with them, they tell me it really helps. That got me thinking: maybe I should try running a small sales coaching bootcamp for beginners who want to learn practical, real-world sales skills.

The idea is to start small: maybe a 2-hour interactive online workshop just to test the waters. The focus wouldn’t be fluff or motivational speeches, but actual frameworks, scripts, and objection-handling techniques that I’ve used in real scenarios.

But here’s where I’m stuck and need help from people here:

How do people usually scale something like this beyond my immediate network?

If I go down this path, what’s the best way to be seen as a legit coach and not just “another course seller”?

Should I treat this kind of bootcamp as a lead magnet and then build a bigger program later, or try to make it premium from the start?

For those who have built coaching/training careers, what pitfalls should I avoid?


I don’t want this to sound like a self-promo – I’m genuinely trying to figure out if this idea is worth scaling, and how others have approached something similar.

Would love to hear from anyone who’s done coaching, training, or built programs around soft skills/sales skills. Any input is super appreciated 🙏

According to the **Bureau of Labor Statistics**, there were **7.4 million job openings** in June 2025 ([BLS](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm)). That sounds like good news, but the catch is competition. **Glassdoor** reports that the average corporate role receives **250+ applications**, and only about **3% of applicants get an interview** ([Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/job-applications-statistics/)). That means roughly 1 in 100 people who apply actually get hired.

So if you’ve been ghosted or rejected a lot, you’re not alone. The funnel is just brutal.

# Referrals and Company Pages Beat Job Boards

Not all applications are equal. A **CareerPlug 2025 recruiting report** found that job boards generate the largest number of applications, but have the lowest hire rates. Company career pages generate fewer applicants, but those applicants are more likely to be hired. And referrals? They’re gold. Even though only **2% of applications come from referrals, they account for 11% of hires** ([CareerPlug via StaffingHub](https://staffinghub.com/hiring/company-pages-referrals-result-in-more-hires-recruiting-metrics-report/)).

If you’re relying solely on mass job boards like Indeed or LinkedIn Easy Apply, you’re swimming in the most crowded pool. Networking, alumni connections, and direct company sites stack the odds more in your favor.

# Degrees Don’t Matter as Much as Skills

A **2025 survey from TestGorilla** shows that **85% of employers now use skills-based hiring practices**, and **76% use skills tests** to verify ability ([TestGorilla](https://www.testgorilla.com/skills-based-hiring/state-of-skills-based-hiring-2025/)). Similarly, **SHRM’s Talent Trends** report found that while critical thinking is among the most in-demand skills, fewer than one-third of HR professionals believe new grads possess it ([SHRM](https://www.educationatwork.org/insights/empowering-tomorrows-workforce-today-skill-gaps/)).

In other words, employers don’t just want to see your degree. They want to see proof that you can *do the job*. Projects, GitHub repos, certifications, and even self-directed learning often speak louder than a diploma.

# The ATS Filter Is Real

Over **80% of U.S. companies** use applicant tracking systems (ATS), according to **VisualCV**. And here’s the kicker: only **1 in 4 resumes** even make it to a human reviewer ([VisualCV](https://www.visualcv.com/blog/hiring-statistics/)).

What does that mean for you?

* Keep your resume **simple and clean** (no graphics, columns, or tables).
* Use **keywords from the job description** naturally.
* Quantify your impact where possible.

If you’ve been sending out resumes with fancy templates, there’s a good chance they aren’t even making it past the bots.

# Expectations vs. Reality

Many new graduates expect six-figure salaries right out of the gate, one survey put the average expectation at around **$101K**. But the reality is closer to **$68K**. That gap creates a lot of frustration and disappointment.

Being flexible, whether on salary, role type (contract vs. full-time), or company size, can be the difference between landing a role and being stuck in the application cycle for months.

# Career Switching Is Normal (and Rising)

If you’re feeling like your field has dried up, you’re not alone. **52% of U.S. workers are considering a career switch in 2025**, and 44% are actively planning one ([Apollo Technical](https://www.apollotechnical.com/career-change-statistics/)). The top reasons? Higher pay, better values alignment, toxic leadership, and for 83% of workers, better work-life balance.

The takeaway: switching industries isn’t a failure. It’s a strategy. Green energy, healthcare tech, and climate-focused industries are hiring aggressively.

# What You Can Actually Do

So, given all this research, how do you beat the odds?

1. **Prioritize networking** — cold apps are a numbers game, but referrals massively improve your odds.
2. **Tailor every application** — don’t send 50 generic resumes, send 10 tailored ones.
3. **Prove your skills** — projects, online certifications, or even assessments show employers you can deliver.
4. **Simplify your resume for ATS** — get past the bots so a human can actually read your story.
5. **Stay flexible** — adjust expectations on salary, role type, and location to expand opportunities.
6. **Think long game** — career switches are common and often necessary to stay competitive.

# TL;DR

The job market is rough, but the data shows some clear levers you can pull: **network more, tailor better, show skills, and beat the ATS.** It won’t guarantee you a job, but it does tip the odds in your favor.

What’s been your experience this year? Have you found any strategies that actually *work*?",cirby_ai,33,0.8799999952316284,2,1755537382,2025-08-18 17:16:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mts8me/the_2025_job_market_is_brutal_heres_what_the/,8,2025
1mtrxtk,Need advice for academic life !!!,"

Hi everyone, I’m 21 and preparing for CAT 2025, but I’m unsure if I should appear this year or wait until next year. I’d really appreciate your advice!

My Background:

Academics: 10th - 47%, 12th - 57%, Graduation - 52%. No extracurricular activities.
Personality: I’m introverted and don’t have a friend group to support or guide me for my future.

Challenges:

 From age 15 until about two months ago, I struggled with a masturbation addiction, which heavily impacted my focus on studies and socializing. This is a big reason for my low academic scores.

Recent Progress:

In the last two months, I’ve worked on myself and reduced the habit significantly. I started preparing for CAT (MBA feels like my last shot to turn things around), but I’m struggling with consistency, and my mock scores haven’t improved much. I’m worried that if I don’t score well, I won’t get into a good B-school.

Dilemma:

With only 3 months left for CAT 2025 (I’m assuming it’s in late November), should I take the exam this year or postpone to CAT 2026? I feel MBA is my best path, but I don’t want to rush and end up with a bad score.

Questions for You:

Should I attempt CAT 2025 for experience, or is it better to wait and prepare thoroughly for 2026?


Any tips for staying consistent with prep, especially for someone like me who’s introverted and lacks a support system?

Are there other ways to strengthen my profile (given my low academics and no extracurriculars) if I delay?

Thanks in advance for any advice or experiences you can share! I’m determined to improve but feeling a bit lost.",Naive_Bee4312,1,1.0,0,1755536747,2025-08-18 17:05:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mtrxtk/need_advice_for_academic_life/,8,2025
1mtrp84,Company wants to hire me but the gross salary is much lower than advertised,"I applied for a position as Linux Sysadmin in a small trading company which was posted with a base salary range of 70k-100k. Throughout the application process they seemed very positive and impressed of my previous experience, I am currently working in a very similar job for almost 5 years, but in a Software Engineering company. Nonetheless, the technologies and tools I work with are extremely similar to what they use.

In total I gave 3 interviews over a course of barely more than a week, it all went quite fast and today they gave me a call that they want to make an offer and proposed 75k for the base salary because I have no experience with the specific technologies used on Trading platforms (e.g. ultralow latency networking). I responded that I had expected 80k at the very least, but they went on that the company pays lots of bonuses and getting a raise later on may happen as well. 

What do you think about this, are they simply trying to sell me for cheap? I am rather young so I think they are giving it a try, but I am thinking to object, especially seeing how they rushed the interview process.

This is my first real application process since my first job so I really do not know how these things normally go.

1mtrl0b,Looking for advice on Career Change from Chef,"Hi All, 
I (29 M) currently work as Sous Chef at a private school, I’ve worked as a chef for most my adult life. As much as I enjoy the job, in recent years I’ve decide that Its not a job I want to do forever mainly due to the smaller salary. I completed a film production course at university but determined that the film industry was too competitive to try and secure a decent job. I’d love to do a job that is in a creative field and understand I might need to some form of degree/education to get a role like that. I’m fairly good with computers but have no formal education in this field. I had considered doing a graphic design course but with the development of AI thought that may be pointless.

Hoping someone may have been in a similar position and can offer some advice about next steps to change careers and also what jobs I should look into. Many thanks in advance.

I have been unemployed for about 3 months, before I worked in a fastfood place.
Today was my first day at my new job, I guess it wasn't bad, nobody really spoke to me (feeling like an outsider) but the job itself isn't too bad, very physical labour but I expected that.
The problem is it scares me that I have to be there 7-15 everday, monday to friday... I know it's normal, that's how life goes a typical 9-5 but I hope it's a natter of time before I get used to it, since I have been unemployed for sometime and my job before was a bit more flexible, as it was 10-18 and weekends but to be fair I only worked for max. 4 days a week...
Will I get used to this system? do you have any motivation to stop thinking so negatively about this whole situation?
Let me just say that I can't quit as me and my boyfriend are planning on moving out together so I need the money. Changing the job is also not an option as the job market right now is a joke.

1mtr48h,How best to approach and Negotiate?,"How should I negotiate and leverage for the best compensation given my below situation?

I currently work for a large financial institution in a specialty field. I’m a technical sales employee that’s paid a w2 salary with a good bonus plan, and my skillset is on the “better half” of the bell curve - I’m not the best, but I can compete with the best just fine. The best are at least 15 years older and more experienced then me, so my competitive advantage is that I’m good enough to compete, but young enough to be hungry, coach able and moldable to employers. The niche I work in is very small and everybody knows everybody. I’ve built a good personal brand in my industry and need to maintain that personal brand and integrity.

There are a bunch of new startups looking to compete in my space/marketplace. One competitor sounds very appealing; while I’m still having conversations with them to learn more about the roles, responsibilities, opportunities and challenges, I’ve got a very strong feeling they want to hire me. I haven’t gotten clarity on what the offer would look like, but I did clarify early there offer would be above my expected minimum requirements.

My current employer is having some competitive challenges, and the team I’m on of about 11 total has lost three of those individuals to competitors in the last 4 months… my manager has been good to me for my time here so I’d want to give him notice of a competitive offer, and with everything I expect he’ll work to keep me. I told the competitor this and they understand and are still very interested in me.

So how do I go about leveraging this situation to maximize what’s best for me and my family in an “honorable” way? I don’t have loyalty or feelings for either corporation, but how do I maintain my brand/integrity and not waste anybody’s time or put myself in a disadvantaged position?",cae1565,1,1.0,0,1755534959,2025-08-18 16:35:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mtr48h/how_best_to_approach_and_negotiate/,8,2025

1mtqky3,Work effecting mental health,Hey! I long term lurker first time poster. I [28m] working for a startup company for last quite a while. My mental health is gradually declining due to work anxiety and stress. It started 2 weeks ago when I started working in this new project. I was initially assigned to work on it but later they assigned me to another one. At the end last month I was told to help and later I was the only one working. Lemme give you some idea on the project. It’s for one of our biggest clients and it was couple of months long but later they extended one extra month (August) and about the deliverables we didn’t have the workforce to complete the job in the given time so in last few months nothing was delivered. Now the issue is that from the first day of working in this project I am being blamed for slacking off where I had no in-depth knowledge about how the project works. I have tired putting on extra hours to get things done yet no matter what I do I get yelled at or blamed. Today I was blamed for losing the client because of my slack off. Where I have been updating my boss with each and every step of work I did along with the timeline of each hour. Now my question where am I wrong?

Since I already have a bachelors degree, I was thinking about pivoting to nursing instead and taking an accelerated bachelors of nursing program OR just going for an associates in nursing (then a RN-BSN program).

Nursing is guaranteed to make me more money and I’ll still be helping people. But I’m still conflicted with this option too because I don’t
want to sacrifice the chance at earning a fair salary as a therapist, even though that possibility is low.

1mtqdbr,"I’m already a game designer, but I like to study part time for other degrees in my free time. What are your thoughts/advices?","First of all, I have some things to clarify: I already studied 2 years in game design and production in college, but I failed the second year, took an unintentional gap year off, and now past half way through this year the belief that my lifelong dream was nothing but a phase that I had moved on from is in itself the phase that had come to pass, so today I managed to finish the interview and get all things sorted in regards to completing the units I had to resubmit for within the course by following a unique study-plan/enrolment made just for me with the help of the school. The amount of study I need to do is just 3 months at the end of the year to get the advanced diploma I missed out on.

Within the time I had my break, I explored and tried out many things that I was interested in, and I struggled with the problem of having my multiple interests distract one another. For example, even recently I have been mind mapping things like general proteomics in biochemistry, and I don’t really have a reason, it’s sort of just fascinating to me in the same way that history is.

At the start of this year, I enrolled into a university to try out a bachelor’s degree course in ICT, and although I wanted to see for myself what going to a university campus would be like as an experience compared to the college I went to, the fees were not worth, the required subjects had nothing to do with what I was paying for, and the content was slow. So, I dropped out before the fees applied.

I am currently looking for a part time job to do at the same time I do my studies this year since before I was immature feeling that committing myself to anything but my own, overthought intentions was the only thing that matter, but this time around from now till I maybe even do an extra year and a half worth of study for this course to even get a bachelor’s degree since in this pathway I am around the corner for it so I wouldn’t be ‘wasting much time’ if that was still a concern of mine, I will have the responsibilities of a regular college student, which includes having a part time job.

Now, as for what I want to know other people’s thoughts on is, it’s in regards to me still studying other interests as whole, legitimate courses, whether one or multiple at a time, while actually working in the industry even, under a ‘part time’ study pathway, meaning that the workload is spread throughout let’s say 6 years instead of 3 to get a bachelor’s degree in a single course.

I am testing myself as a game developer by actually practicing technical skills in 3D animation so far since my biggest attachment is my dream game I want to make, and pulling my weight with a developmental role that I could actually do rather than just design which’s skills are to do with mostly writing and thinking, is my way of testing to see how I feel doing a single major commitment while also trail and erroring my free time to allow myself to focus on my other interests to give them their fair share.

I’ve found that there is a non-profit organisation in my country that curates all online-study options for course degrees, and the one I want to pick and discuss with the university this hope of mine to learn for the sake of learning since I already have my game development career I am attached to, is biochemistry.

I’ve been through the attempt of sharing my idealistic aims of mastering mastery, but everyone would just get mad because I didn’t have a big enough clue on how unrealistic the actual approach to achieving it would be. I would love to be smart enough to speed-run, life, but if instead I treat it (at least for now) a matter of long timespans instead, then maybe in like 10 years I could have a masters degree in multiple fields of interest.

\- **Video Journalist.** This doesn't pay that well apparently but with work I have done with it so far I do really enjoy it. There aren't many jobs for it right now however so I am focused on just gaining voluntary experience. If this does kick off I will probably switch to a more stable higher up job in the same company for security.

\- **Anything in marketing**, hopefully this can lead to a well paid career once I get in the door. I believe this to be my most stable and well paid option, it is still somewhat creative and practical so my brain won't melt of boredom (fingers crossed).

\- **Working with in television,** this (like Video Journalist), probably requires a lot of freelance work which I am okay with but it promises no security. Additionally I will always have to look for work which I hate about freelance.

The other job my friend has worked in, is related to my degree (criminology) but doesn't sponsor visas. My parents are pushing for the well-being role since it's connected to my degree and keep saying I can find another job within 6 months. I see where they're coming from but experiencing the job market and getting a crap ton of rejections and ghosting idk how hopeful those 6 months seem like.

1mtld2m,Why do I always struggle to hold down a job/show up?,"Right now I’m with Amazon (for the 3rd time) and I absolutely hate it. I only go for the money and sometimes it’s not worth it.

Before I was at Walmart, I hated it. I hated putting up fake conversations with co workers because it’s so hard to relate to other people. The fake happy. The anxiety, since it was such a big crowd. 

Do I struggle because I hate the job? I’ve never looked at a job and said “I love my job” 

At jobs no matter what I do,
I drive into the parking lot and don’t want to go in. I get this wave of sadness. 
I call off constantly, the longest I held a job was two years… and only because I was on the verge of being homeless at that time. But I still absolutely hated it.

How do you hold down your job? Do you love it? Do you enjoy the schedule? ",no_reason88,33,0.7900000214576721,49,1755522022,2025-08-18 13:00:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mtld2m/why_do_i_always_struggle_to_hold_down_a_jobshow_up/,8,2025
1mtjzpu,"Well paid, but unappreciated…","Hi all, I’m in a tricky situation and would appreciate your advice. 
I’ve been at this company for nearly 9 years in complex tech sales, and have built up a solid portfolio of clients, consistently reaching targets, and making great income as a result (mostly commission, but great base too). Overall the job is steady, grants me enough to cover my lifestyle, is close to home, and is interesting enough that I could stay forever. I have never had any issues, no warnings etc. and generally the management team has appreciated my work and efforts. 
The issue is that just after I started, the company hired another employee in a different role, that after a few years became the general manager for our state (and my new top boss). Unfortunately, we never really clicked from the get-go, and it’s become an issue now as he is newly responsible for negotiating pay rises and many other important decisions that affect my employment quality. 
Whilst we don’t argue day to day, it’s become increasingly obvious that he feels sales people generally are overpaid and expects unrealistic things from us (hours and output). There’s only two others that are in the same role as me, and they havent had these issues, which makes me think maybe it’s personal. 
I had a lengthy meeting with this boss two weeks ago about a pay rise on my base (three years since my last raise), which resulted in a 2 hour back and forth of him essentially saying ‘no pay rise, work harder and earn it from commission’. 
This, coupled with the fact he has never acknowledged my hard work on any project makes me question whether it’s worth staying. Is it worth stating and trying to ignore him and focusing on commission from sales? Never expecting any sort of praise? This doesn’t seem sustainable.
My job is quite niche in my state, and I’m at the largest and best firm in the field, so if I did change I’d likely have to swap industries. 
Very curious to hear people thoughts and suggestions.

Unsure of what to do with myself I took advice of a friend, and looked to work in the education sector, becoming a teacher. As time of typing I currently have three jobs (not of financial strain)  my weekend retail job and two teaching agencies.

I work weekdays mon-wed teaching and am using the time/experience to better my chances in my teacher training applications, 2025 marks my third unsuccessful year of applying for teacher training (where I’m from you need a QTS to be allowed to become a licensed teacher, only applicable from teacher training, these many knock-backs has left me burnt out for quite some time now, and now I’m looking for a career change for the past year I have applied for jobs across multiple job sites with little to no success. I know I have the skill and self-confidence to better myself in the situation I currently am in and want more out of my professional life, my question is it ever too late to start from Scratch

Forget passion, here’s how you should really choose a career: 

If you’re chopped, go pre-med or engineering. When you’re a doctor, no one will care that you’re chopped and you’ll bag all the baddies. Same thing with engineering.

If you’re good looking, go into business, marketing, or law. Networking dinners? Easy. You’re automatically charismatic. Pitching ideas? They’re were already

I scrape all new jobs posted in last 24h on LinkedIn and send them through 10+ AI agents. Some agents check if company and offer looks legit. Others compare description with my own profile. End result is a ranking how well I fit each job and suggestion if it’s worth applying. I even made a very basic browser extension – when I open a job posting it just scrapes the page, send to the agents and I instantly get a “fit score”.

Right now I set it up they way so it gives me around 5 jobs per day where I am best match.

The only downside: it costs me more than 20 bucks a day in API calls.

1mtefiu,Executive coaching is underrated for people who aren't yet executives,"I used to think coaching was only for people already in the C-suite, but the more I've seen around me, the more I'm convinced it's something mid-level managers and directors should consider earlier. Too many smart people stall out because they're great at execution but never build the leadership presence, communication style, or board-level perspective that gets them promoted.

At some point, technical ability just isn't enough, you need to rewire how you think and how you influence. That's not something most companies teach well. Mentorship helps, sure, but mentorship is usually limited to whoever happens to be available in your network. Coaching is more structured, and I've seen people accelerate years ahead of their peers because of it.

To speak from experience, when I worked with NEXT New Growth, it really clicked for me. Their focus is on CFOs and COOs in the private equity world, but the frameworks translate well no matter where you are. It wasn't theory but it was a mix of practical habits and mindset shifts that changed how I showed up at work. That was the first time I realized coaching wasn't a luxury, it was a lever.

So if you're sitting in that spot where you're capable but not breaking through, I'd argue coaching is a lot less of a luxury than most people think",AppropriateReach7854,0,0.4300000071525574,3,1755498819,2025-08-18 06:33:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mtefiu/executive_coaching_is_underrated_for_people_who/,8,2025

1mtdig2,Feeling hopeless as a recent BSc in Psych Graduate,"Hi all! I just wanted to post on here as I needed a little guidance on my career path.  Key info about me: I did a bachelor of science degree in hopes of becoming a healthcare professional but I realized too late that it was very competitive and is getting tougher every year, I live in Canada and we have limited seats here as we don’t have many schools. Don’t get me wrong, I loved studying psychology but it’s hard to make a career out of it without going to grad school. I just don’t feel like it’s worth it to spend even more money to go to grad school and even then a job isn’t guaranteed.

I was considering a career change into maybe something Cybersecurity related but I’ve heard that IT fields are very over saturated right now so I’m feeling hopeless right now in regards to my career. It’s like I have many interests but I’m not sure what to do. I just want a decent paying job, it kinda sucks seeing people you know have great jobs while you don’t know what to do. Sometimes I regret not going into engineering but I know my interest was health but everything is just so competitive and they aren’t decent paying for all the work you do. I know that IT is fast growing so I was thinking maybe I can try something in that to get my foot in the door. The job market really sucks right now so I’m just nervous.

That information aside, I've been off work due to my arm/wrist being royally fucked after a botched surgery in March 2024.

5 years of experience working under portfolio managers, but left the industry due to burnout from working with miserable ones.

1mt8z3l,Application rejected then re-activated,"Hi everyone! I would really appreciate some advice on a weird interview process I’ve been going through. I interviewed for a role at a large media company I worked at over 3 years ago, I was looking to return. I initially interviewed 2 months ago- I had 2 virtual interviews followed up by an in-person interview where I presented a couple things to them. It went great- the 2 people I interviewed with even brought in their boss (the president of the company) to meet me too. I also had 2 internal referrals from senior leaders at the company. I thought this was a great sign. For the first month after the interview, I followed up weekly with the hiring manager and HR recruiter for any updates. I didn’t hear back for over a month. When I did, I got a message from HR saying they are going in a different direction. This was probably a month ago. 2 Thursdays ago I got an email from the HR recruiter sincerely apologizing, saying she made a mistake and my application is still active, she asked me if I was still interested in the role which I responded yes to. She quickly responded to my response saying she’d be in touch soon next week (meaning last week). I never heard anything and followed up with her on Thursday.

1mt7fgz,What does an Application Specialist really do? Is it a good long-term career path?,"Hi everyone,

I graduated recently as a Software Engineer (5-year program), and I’m a bit confused about my next career step. 

I just finished a 3-month internship at a pharmaceutical company, working inside the IT Solutions team. The company has many systems/solutions like Oracle E-Business Suite, CRM tools, multiple computerized systems, etc.

During my internship, I mostly worked on Oracle EBS, helping the team by creating custom reports using SQL/PL/SQL, and occasionally assisting with support tasks on their other systems.

Now they have offered me a full-time job as an Application Specialist.

The problem is: I studied software development and always imagined myself as a developer (coding, building products, technical work) while this Application Specialist role seems more functional/support-based than technical.

It’s not that I disliked what I did over the last 3 months but I’m worried I might be moving away from software development without understanding where this path leads.
So my questions is:
Can I still grow towards positions like Solution Architect / Product Manager / IT Consultant, or will I get “stuck” in support",UpsetAverage9247,1,1.0,2,1755477174,2025-08-18 00:32:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mt7fgz/what_does_an_application_specialist_really_do_is/,8,2025

    I am writing to formally address the recent raise I received of $0.50 per hour. While I appreciate the acknowledgment, this increase does not reflect my experience, contributions, or the market standard for my role.

 

I have been with this practice for 10 years, serving as a Biologics Coordinator for the last 5, and my last raise was a little over 2 years ago. In that time, I have consistently gone above and beyond my job description — supporting patients before, during, and after being started on medication; serving as the direct contact for scheduling, pharmacy issues, and flares; and even assisting patients annually with open enrollment and insurance navigation. These responsibilities are critical to patient care and practice efficiency, and I have taken them on willingly because I care deeply about our patients and their outcomes.

 

The market benchmark for a Biologic(s) Coordinator is approximately $28.00/hour (ZipRecruiter, August 2025) . Nationally, the average is around $27.50/hour or $57,202/year (ZipRecruiter). Currently, I am earning $20.50/hour, which places me nearly $8/hour below market average for my role and responsibilities. Considering my tenure, specialized expertise, and the trust patients place in me, I believe my compensation should reflect both industry standards and the value I bring to the practice every day.  

 

I am respectfully requesting a reevaluation of my pay rate to align more closely with the current market average and the responsibilities I fulfill. I am confident that my track record, loyalty, and patient relationships demonstrate the value I provide and justify this adjustment. My work directly impacts patient satisfaction, continuity of care, and overall efficiency.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing this further.

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Thank you for the note. I did some research and discovered that you were provided a one-time lump sum payment for last year’s merit cycle, in the amount of $2,080. That translated to a 5% bonus. We do that when an employee’s hourly rate is close to the max for their position. I can’t speak to the exact particulars of your case since I was not here when those payments were distributed, I just see it on your payroll record. As far as the actual rate of your position, we conduct market analysis of all positions on an interval basis to ensure that our rates remain competitive. We will continue to do so and will make any necessary adjustments as deemed necessary and approved by the Board of Directors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Thank you for your reply and for clarifying the merit cycle process. While I appreciate the one-time lump sum bonus, I want to emphasize that, as you described, it is a bonus — not a raise. This means it does not address my base pay, which impacts not only my ongoing earnings but also future raises, retirement contributions, and long-term earning potential.

 

Currently, I am at $20.50/hour, which is significantly below the average rate for Biologics Coordinators  (around $28/hour according to recent market data). I am not at or near the maximum for my role’s pay scale, so the explanation of being capped at max pay does not apply in my case.

 

In addition, I have been with the practice for 10 years and have consistently taken on responsibilities that go well beyond my job description — including patient support for flares, scheduling, pharmacy coordination, and assisting patients with insurance decisions during open enrollment. This work is essential for patient care and directly supports our providers.

 

Given these facts, I respectfully request a permanent hourly rate adjustment to bring my compensation in line with both the market average and the value I provide to the practice. A one-time bonus is appreciated, but it does not resolve the underlying pay disparity.

 

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further and reach a fair resolution.

 

Thank you for your time and consideration,


 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When an employee is close to or beyond the max rate for their position, they are no longer eligible for adjustments to their base rate of pay. Your position falls within Grade 2. At the time of the 2024 merit increases, the max for Grade 2 was $20.14 and thus a 4% increase would have put you over the max. That is the reason you were given a 5% bonus. It may be called a bonus, but I actually think of it as earning the entire annual raise all within one check, in one lump sum. For example, if an employee receives a raise of .50/hour, then over the course of the next 52 weeks, at 40 hours per week, that employee will have earned an additional $1,040. However, if that employee is at the max for their grade, and they are given a ‘bonus’ of $1,040, that is equivalent to the raise they would have earned during the next year. The employee is not losing any money in that scenario. After the completion of the 2024 raises, we conducted an external market analysis and raised many grades, including grade 2. The new max for grade 2 is $22.15 and that is why you received an hourly adjustment instead of a lump sum payment this year.

 

The Board of Directors only approved a 2.5% adjustment for this year. I know that can be hard to hear and we wish it was more, but that is the budget we were given.

 


I hope this answers your question as it is all of the information I have and cannot provide anything further.

1mt4mm7,"I feel like I'm doing everything right, but finding no success, what am I doing wrong?","TL;DR:  
6+ years as an Instructional Designer, led teams, and managed major accounts. Hit multiple setbacks: layoffs, federal hiring freeze, and unfair termination in a new role. Exhausted all usual avenues, now looking for advice, resources, or opportunities to get back on track. I’m in the US.

Hey everyone,

In 2018, I got my BFA in Creative Writing. A few months later, I got a gig as an Instructional Designer for a start-up. We weren’t using the usual tools (Articulate, Camtasia, etc.), but a proprietary 3D animation software. Since I’d studied 3D animation before switching to writing, it was a great fit.

I stuck with that company for 5 years, eventually becoming a Lead #3. I secured our biggest contracts with Siemens, Nokia, and iFIT, and even turned around a team that had a reputation for poor work and arguing with QA and AMs. Within a year, they were performing \~15% more accurately, and other departments said the team was more pleasant to work with.  Also, the team told me I made their jobs less stressful since I cared about their needs.

By July 2023, the company had gone through several layoffs. Siemens was getting increasingly unhappy with how the other departments were handling their account, and as their lead designer, I kept bringing attention to the recurring problems and offering solutions to fix our relationship. Leadership didn’t want to act on it, and in the next round of cuts, I was on the chopping block.

Because I didn’t use the standard programs, finding work as an Instructional Designer has been tough. So I started applying to anything I was remotely qualified for. I worked at a start-up, taking on tasks and developing skills out of my title/job description was to be expected. So I used all that experience to punch up my resume. Even then, most applications went nowhere. After a year and a half, I took an entry-level job at Charles Schwab just to get a break from searching.

Then, in January 2025, I finally got a break, a Business Analyst II role at Bonneville Power Administration. After 3 interviews, I got the offer: six figures and relocation assistance. We packed up our house and started planning the move. Jan 21, my last day at Schwab, the federal hiring freeze was pushed out, and just like that, the offer was instantly rescinded. I tried going back to Schwab, but they had already filled my position.

Since then, it’s been rough. I picked up a 1099 SOP writing contract for a candy manufacturer (fun but inconsistent hours). After a few months, I finally landed a full-time position as a Licensing Specialist at a health services company. A field I had no experience in, and they knew that when they hired me.

The manager barely trained me, and a month later, I was let go for ridiculous reasons, one being “ falling asleep in meetings”. For context, I’m Asian, and because my head was down since I was focused on taking notes, since she couldn’t see my eyes, it meant I was sleeping (she’s the only one who worked remote, she never has her camera on, and I have no choice in the matter since I’m in office using a conference room). There were only two instances where she mentioned I had made a mistake. Instead of using it as a teaching opportunity to show me what I did wrong and how to fix it, she would just quietly correct the work herself and then tell me I’d messed up. It was clear I was being used as a scapegoat to cover poor management.

Now I’m back to square one. I’ve pretty much exhausted my resources. I’m the first in my family to get a college education, so most of the advice they give, though appreciated, isn’t helpful, and I’ve not had the luck or privilege to find a mentor. So I’m here hoping someone might have advice, point me toward new resources, or even just share some encouragement.

1mt4bnj,Want to quit over new responsibility,"For context I work as a “technician” in a relatively rural area. A few technicians are spread out across the large, rural side of our state, with myself living in the largest town in this area, Town A. My territory is mostly in town servicing the local university, but travel to more remote locations is not uncommon.

Recently, my company let go of a technician in Town B, 2 hours away from me with no plans to hire anyone else for his position. His entire territory was reassigned to me which makes me responsible for Town A’s local university and the school district in Town B (some schools in the district are as far as 3 hours away from me). The increased workload wouldn’t be too bad if not for the travel time which makes it impossible to keep up in only an 8 hour work day. The past few weeks I’ve been driving to Town B 3 days a week and working 10-12+ hours (including travel) and I have just barely been able to keep up. The university in my town starts in less than 2 weeks at which point keeping up will be impossible. 

I plan on meeting with my boss soon to discuss my dissatisfaction with the new workload, but I am unable to offer him any solutions to my grievances. Backup for Town B is too far away to be useful long-term, the amount of time spent in Town B is causing me to neglect Town A, and there is no solution to the commute which I do not want as a regular part of my job. Truthfully, I just don’t want to work in and commute to Town B at all, but my company made this decision without any other options. 

How should I go about this situation? Is a 2 hour commute suddenly being added to my job enough to walk away immediately? How can I leave on good terms when this entire are is dependent on me because my company did not plan this well?

Other things to consider that I did not put above:
I drive a company vehicle so mileage/gas is not an issue. 
Overtime is allowed, but generally discouraged and I do not want to work 50+ hours a week. 
I have been working this job for less than a year. 
No, they do not pay me enough, but I have enjoyed my time until now. ",ConferenceThink6974,1,0.6000000238418579,32,1755468879,2025-08-17 22:14:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mt4bnj/want_to_quit_over_new_responsibility/,8,2025
1mt3ruk,Quit MBB after 7 months for a startup?,"**Context:** I’m 26 with 3 years of in-house management consulting experience, and about 6 months ago I landed a second level consulting role at an MBB firm, something I’ve been aiming for since undergrad. The problem is, I hate it. I’m constantly stressed, exhausted, and nervous about work. I’ve spoken to others at the firm and while most feel the same way, they’re willing to endure it for a few years. I just can’t see myself doing that.

A few weeks ago, I started applying elsewhere and ended up getting an offer from a really exciting startup that’s working on something super niche and innovative. It feels much more aligned with what I actually want to do. The catch is that I’d be leaving MBB after only 7 months, I’d take a 30% pay cut, and I’m nervous about how this might look and affect for my career in the long run. On the other hand, the startup role seems exciting, healthier, and could give me back some balance in my life. 

**Question**: For those who’ve been in a similar situation did you decide to leave early, and if so, do you regret it? Or was it worth it in the long term?

1mt3mzn,Loved my first research project – how do I make a career out of it?,"
I’m a recent MBBS graduate from Europe and I think I want to upskill and move into research. 

Just before graduation, I was part of a small research project and I loved it! I learned a bit of Microsoft Excel for the project, and I actually really enjoyed using it. Now I want to learn much more.

I’d like to build the right skills to transition fully into research and be a better fit for research assistant positions.

From what I’ve researched so far, people suggest:
- Mastering Excel
- Learning Tableau
- Learning SQL

1mt3kf5,What are some things that I can do to make myself more competitive in finance with a low GPA?,"
Hi, I am currently 25 years old. I was studying finance in college a few years ago but I left at the time because I had some issues going. I originally was an engineering major when I started college, didn't enjoy it and then I was switching majors multiple times to get into something. I eventually managed to switch to finance at my last try. I haven't really started the major finance classes yet and I have those classes to complete. As a result of studying engineering and struggling with depression and issues with balancing work and school, I had a cumulative GPA of 2.7 when I left school. I was studying at a non-target and I will eventually return to one. I am thinking about something like FP&A or something in corporate finance, not specifically investment banking. If I get straight A grades when I return back to college, I will be able to get up to a 3.2 or a 3.3 when graduating. I am worried that it may still not be enough. What are some other ways that I can be competitive and to get the roles that I desire?

1mt2yze,"Looking for a career change at 28m, any suggestions?","28m living in Montreal, Quebec.

I've been working as a buyer for the last 3 years with a total of 4 years of professional experience. I had a bcom from India finished in 2018, and had a PG diploma in International Business from Canada, which I finished in 2022. I'm also a certified international trade professional (CITP from FITT).

I have good knowledge of procurement and as well of international trade, but I don't like working as a buyer. I have an interest in Finance / invest. banking or international trade related to diplomacy. Personally, if i have the option to choose, then I'll choose something like Trade Commissioner or Investment advisor etc.

Now I'm confused about what i can do to move ahead in my career. Honestly, i feel stuck in my career, and i need to make a move to get out of this situation. I want to do a master's but i don't want to leave my job as well. I can put a couple of year of insane hard work, i feel i'm mentally prepared for it but i don't know what direction i should move in.

1mt0eov,Torn between US psychiatry residency vs going all-in on business,"I just graduated med school abroad and I’m at a crossroads.

Option 1: Do US psychiatry residency  → eventually open private clinics. Medicine comes naturally to me, it’s stable, and there’s potential to scale into private practice. I like psychiatry because it offers flexibility (telepsychiatry, private clinics). Downsides: years of exams, licensing, and residency before I can really start earning. Bureaucracy is also heavy.

Option 2: Skip medicine and go all-in on business. I’ve been working in digital marketing/CRO for a few years. I know how to build and scale campaigns, run PPL (pay-per-lead), and potentially grow an agency or pivot into e-commerce/other businesses. It’s higher risk, but also a higher ceiling.



About me:

* 25 years old, no debts.
* Based in Europe, with flexibility to move
* Medicine feels safe/respectable, it comes easily to me & I graduated top of my class, but slow.
* Business feels riskier, but I always am fascinated by building/improving businesses, but more scalable.
* My long-term goal is financial freedom + building something meaningful (not just a small lifestyle business).



I’m trying to figure out if the delayed but stable path of medicine → clinics is smarter, or if I should double down on business now when I’m young and willing to take risks.

I'm open to any clarifying questions or thoughts! ",pathofbloom,1,1.0,5,1755459526,2025-08-17 19:38:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mt0eov/torn_between_us_psychiatry_residency_vs_going/,8,2025

She wants a career in which she can make a decent living and have some upward mobility (i.e. heard pharmacists being stuck in retail is very common). I also heard that Rad Therapy doesn't have much room for growth since it's too specific and niche, but it's not as regretful as a PharmD. Hospital residences are extremely competitive here too.

1msuk0u,Stuck in life,"Hey guys, I’ve been really stuck in my life and I could really use some career advice. I’m 32 years old, so I’m not among the youngest anymore, and I’m starting to feel the pressure of figuring out what to do next.

I finished Secondary School of Economics and later studied economics at university, but I didn’t graduate. I worked in IT sales for three years, but realized sales isn’t for me. Then I joined a startup in sales support, but it was toxic. I found out a colleague hired at the same time was making more than me, so I politely asked HR why there was such a difference. I wasn’t confrontational at all, just curious if it was because I didn’t have a degree. The CEO completely flipped out and fired me after just 14 days.

Later, I worked for a year at another IT company (first in sales, then as an ERP consultant), but there was no real work or growth, so I quit. Now I’ve been unemployed for about a year. I’ve applied to 50+ jobs but haven’t been hired anywhere. I live in a small area with limited opportunities, and I’m starting to feel really stuck.

When I was a student, I spent a year in an accounting department helping with bookkeeping and other tasks, and I actually liked it. I’m considering finishing my degree and going into accounting, but it would cost about €5,000, and I’d still need a job in the meantime. Right now I am helping waitressing which has really screwed me up, because I had good jobs before...

The hardest part is I don’t have anyone in my life who can guide me — my family isn’t educated, and my friends can’t help with career advice. That’s why I’m asking here: what would someone in my situation do? What would a more academically strong or career-focused person do?

I know I’m a good person — non-confrontational, hardworking, curious, and if I’m in the right (non-toxic) environment with a chance to learn, I know I have big potential.

- The recruiter let me know the range for this position is 70-75k before my first interview (totally fine, that’s in range, I plan on asking for the 75k).
- I had inquired about a high level overview of general benefits before scheduling my second interview. The recruiter did not reply to or acknowledge the inquiry, only responded with scheduling my second interview. 
-I asked around and heard this new job starts off at accruing 4 hours PTO per paycheck your first year. I’m WAY too far into my career to accept such little time off.

1mstkkg,"Has anyone become complacent working a survival job after getting laid off, but got back on track or found a new path? I'm feeling stuck.","Just a little background. I have been working in tech for the past 20 years as a front-end developer and product designer. Two years ago, at the end of 2023, I was burned out and laid off from a toxic company that acquired the awesome company I was working at for over five years. Anyway, I got a nice severance and took some time off. 

After recharging and recovering from the toxic work environment, I began applying for jobs. I was getting interviews, but would always get ghosted after a few rounds. Eventually, I burned out. I just got tired of putting in so much effort only to be ghosted. My unemployment also ran out. By chance, a friend at a company I used to work for reached out and offered me a temp job to help me stay afloat. It's an easy job. The pay is 40% less than what I was making previously, but enough to live off of.  I pretty much live month-to-month.

What was supposed to last for only 6 months has stretched out to almost two years. They really like me and keep extending my contract, but haven't hired me full-time due to the economy. During this time, I tried applying to jobs again, but I soon realized that I just don't have the heart anymore to go through all the effort only to be ghosted. I think I'm completely burned out from working in tech for so long. So I stopped applying to jobs and have been coasting.

1mssjja,Should I go back to school?,"I’m 31 and never really took school seriously or finished it. For the past 7 years I’ve worked in banks and mortgage companies, and right now I’m a loan specialist—which is basically a sales job in a call center. I spend my days calling warm leads, getting them pre-qualified, and passing them on to loan officers. I have to work odd hours and weekends, just feel like I’m on hamster wheel. 

The truth is, I’m burnt out. I don’t enjoy constantly calling people, and the stress from quotas (regardless of how the market is doing) is draining me. Also tired of finance, it’s so boring. 

I’ve been looking into going back to school for an MRI tech program. I like the idea of having a set schedule and not having to sell something to people who already see me as a nuisance. From what I’ve read, it seems like MRI techs have relatively low-stress jobs with decent pay.

Any MRI techs here who actually enjoy their job? What do you like about it? Im fully aware all jobs have downsides but I want to have a job where it’s relatively low stress.

1msqfos,HI’m 27 and really need some guidance,"Hi everyone, I’m 27 and really need some guidance.

Most of my life, I’ve just followed what others suggested rather than making my own decisions. Here’s my journey so far:

School/college was average (10th – 6.7 CGPA, Intermediate – 785, Degree after dropping B.Tech with backlogs).

Joined JSpiders hyderabad for testing but didn’t learn much.

With friends’ help, I cleared assessments and joined X MNC IT company in Chennai (2.4 LPA) for Windows troubleshooting (VMs, deployment, patching, ServiceNow). I just memorized steps without really understanding. Things didn’t go well with my team, I ended up in a bad space mentally, and left.

Had a 1.3-year career break, tried non-IT jobs, failed. Did an AWS course (spent a lot on hostel/living) but again didn’t gain confidence.

Briefly worked at Policy Bazaar in sales but quit in 3 days due to anxiety.

Now I’m working at X company payroll (3.45 LPA) in an order management/procurement role for a ServiceNow client. But it’s a non-IT role with no career growth. Even if I stay years, I won’t become full-time with ServiceNow.


I know what I want: Azure, DevOps, Windows, Linux, Git, GitHub, Kubernetes.
But I struggle with:

Problem-solving & decision-making

Consistency (I give up easily, don’t stick to plans)

Depending on others to explain things

Communication skills


At the same time, I also have dreams:

acting and writing,Helping others (career counseling, Doing something with empathy & social responsibility

I feel stuck. If I had been consistent, I’d have 6–7 years of IT experience by now with a good salary. Instead, I’m 27 in a non-IT role with 3.45 LPA and unsure where to go.

👉 My questions:

1. Should I go all-in on DevOps/Cloud/IT now and build skills on the side?


2. Should I try something creative/acting/writing
3. Is it worth doing a proper PG Diploma (like C-DAC), or should I keep working and learn online?


4. How do I fix my lack of problem-solving and consistency?


5.should I take a break to learn analytical skills,problem solving skills,reasoning,etc that will use I general and life irrespective of job to survive and live 

Any advice from people who’ve been through career confusion

Before learning any course I should be good at problem solving skills without the skills learning any course is of no use

Should I learn any institute and spend some time to learn and be a good problem solver or focus on learning while doing job 

I am from Hyderabad. I live in PG and it is not comfortable for me as I want to do many things like up skilling,physical fitness a daily routine but nothing is going right for me with long time GERD AND IBS health issue and feel sick most of time helplessly just to give up everything

1mskd3w,Software Engineer - I Want to Quit After 4 Months. Is it a stupid idea?,"Hey all,  
About 4 months ago I started a new position as a mid level software engineer at company. Before that I spent about a year unemployed. I was really excited to start working because being unemployed was started to get boring and I wanted to move on with my career. The first 3 months of the job had me feeling alright because I feel like I was doing decent overall and had decent WLB.   
  
However, the last month has been particularly rough for me. I feel like things have been really chaotic and I feel like I am always playing catch up with my work. I am feeling really stressed out all the time and its kind of affecting my personal life. I don't have much time to spend with friends and family and I don't really have much of an appetite anymore.   
  
My senior engineer on my team is a huge micromanager and he makes me feel incompotent and stupid. I really hate working with him because it feels like he looks down on juniors for not asking ""intelligent"" questions. Its a really frustrating experience dealing with him and all my other deadlines. Long story short I feel like I am just not enjoying my time at this job.

It feels like a stupid idea to quit now because I am so early onto this position. I worry about it looking bad on my resume especially since I had such a long gap prior to this. The pay is not bad at all and I really wanted to last at least a year to get my RSU grants but to be honest I am questioning whether it is all worth it every day. I feel like I should be grateful to have a job in this rough market but it still doesn't feel worth it sometimes.

1msji3s,Career Path Advice - Unsure About Future Job,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently a first-year student undertaking a double degree in Information Technology and Business at QUT, majoring in Computer Science (CS) and Finance. I still have a few years ahead of me in this 4-year course, but I want to be proactive in figuring out which career path makes the most sense for me and I’d love some advice or insights from people who’ve been through this before.

My Background:

I have prior experience in Python and SQL, and I’m steadily building on that through uni and personal projects.

I chose Computer Science because I enjoy problem-solving, logical thinking, and coding. It’s a skill I want to keep improving and applying long-term.

I chose Finance because I’m genuinely interested in how money works, how markets move, and how businesses make strategic financial decisions.

I included the Business degree partly as a backup but also because I’m interested in roles within banking or FinTech that might blend business acumen with technical know-how.


My Dilemma:

I’m feeling uncertain about which direction to head in, especially after doing a cybersecurity course (IBM cert) and keeping up with the current job market.

On one hand, Cybersecurity seems like a solid and impactful field, but:

The job market (especially in Australia) seems rough for entry-level cybersecurity roles, and a lot of positions want 2+ years of experience, even for junior roles.

I’m not sure if I’m passionate enough about security to commit fully to that niche.

It feels more like a specialization I could pivot to later rather than something to aim for directly out of uni. Furthermore, I am also interested in pivoting into some engineering fields such as cloud, system, AI architecture egineering. I am not sure if I'd be able to get juniors roles in these.


On the other hand, FinTech and Banking interest me because:

I like the idea of working at the intersection of finance and tech maybe as a data analyst, software engineer in a finance company, or in some kind of strategy role.

There seems to be a growing demand for tech-savvy professionals in traditional finance companies and startups alike.

I think my CS + Finance background could give me a competitive edge here if I play my cards right.


What I'm Hoping to Get Advice On:

For someone with my degree setup (CS + Finance), what career paths would you recommend exploring?

Is it worth trying to break into cybersecurity right after graduation, or should I lean more toward something like FinTech or banking and potentially circle back to security later?

Also since I am also interested pivoting into engineering fields I'd love to get some ideas on what I could do.

Are there specific types of internships or entry-level roles I should be aiming for to keep my options open across these areas?

Is it better to be more specialized early on (e.g., go all-in on cybersecurity or data science), or should I aim to stay more generalist and flexible for now?


Bonus Questions:

Would getting certifications (like CompTIA Security+, or something like CFA Level 1) help at this stage?

Any thoughts on how to use these uni years wisely (e.g., clubs, personal projects, networking tips)?


Any advice would be really appreciated even just sharing your own story or regrets. I know I still have time to figure things out, but I don’t want to waste these years being directionless.

1msh8w7,Should I resign?,"I (40m) have been in a new fundraising position for less than six months. It was a leap for me to move from social services to a more academic setting, and after a decade, it was time for a new challenge. However, this is not what I expected at all. There is a thinly veiled conservative agenda, people are fired on a whim, and there has not been consistency in the fundraising department for several years. Not to mention, I was told this would be a flexible environment, but we have just been mandated to be in the office five days a week. The CEO, my boss, does not trust employees and feels they take advantage of the their WFH days. All of this certainly makes building a culture difficult.

Lots of turnover, self-important leadership, and a vague mission do not get me excited about fundraising every day. I wouldn't say I'm quiet quitting, but I'm certainly tiptoeing into Office Space mode.

I have my first interview this Monday for something more aligned with my value system at a different organization in my previous world. I do not intend to be in my current position beyond this calendar year. I've also tapped into a recruiter I know well to prepare for a coming exit.

1msf59d,Failed as an Wannabe Entrepreneur. Don't Know What To Do Next.,"In 2016 I joined a company as a web content writer. The niche was purely entertainment. After working there for more than 4 years, i left the company in 2020, and started my own in this same industry, along with a couple of colleagues. 

For the initial years, we were thriving, growing exponentially, earning a lot of money. However, in 2023, everything was gone all because Google changed their algorithm. In the beginning, their core updates were favoring my site. But in 2023, Google instantly wiped out our whole income source. A couple of major mistakes that I believe we did were:

1) We didn't diversify our income source.

2) We never upskilled, which I learned later is extremely important for any business.

Now, I have no business, plus I have no skill because, like I said above, I never upskilled. I was following the analogy that, If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Even after our blog was decimated, I believed it was false positive and we will be back in no time. How wrong was I, damn. 

I am currently midst of an identity battle. One part of don't want to work in that industry anymore because its extremely volatile. But another part of me thinks, that's the only thing I know and I should stick to it. But with the advent of AI, traffic to blogs like me are near zero, so it wouldn't be a fairy tale as it was before. 

What's really exhausting is that because I never tried to learn anything, like improve my writing skills or SEO, I believe I have no transferable skills. Although I could try joining a new industry, my ego says, damn I have over 10 years worth of experience and this is what I have to do now.

I am sure there a lot of you who may have gone through similar situations. Its been a year since I closed the company and I do nothing but ruminate all day. I haven't done anything for the past year or so because I am paralyzed by thinking, if I do this, it will lead to this, but if I don't do this, then this will be the result.

What should  I do? ",ConnectorMadness,1,0.6700000166893005,10,1755397632,2025-08-17 02:27:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1msf59d/failed_as_an_wannabe_entrepreneur_dont_know_what/,8,2025
1msf56p,Companies don't give a shit about your career goals,"Been thinking about this a lot lately and figured I'd share since I see so many people making the same mistake I did.

For 3 years I was that guy who followed every single thing my company told me to do for my ""career development."" You know the type - showed up to every optional training, volunteered for every committee, actually believed my manager when they said ""just wait, something will open up soon.""

My yearly review comes around and my manager starts talking about putting me on the project manager track. Pulls up my IDP (individual development plan or whatever corporate BS acronym they use) and shows me all these boxes we'd checked. Project Management Fundamentals. Stakeholder workshops. Maybe a PMP cert in 2 years ""if budget allows"" lmao.

I'd been studying AWS on my lunch breaks and he noticed. His response? ""Why are you getting AWS certified? That's not in your development plan. We see you as a PM.""

Like bro, YOU see me as a PM because you need someone to update Gantt charts and run standups. That's not MY plan. I don't want to spend 5 years making sure other people do their work on time.

Best part was when I said I was interested in technical roles and he goes ""well that's not really where we see you. The PM track makes more sense for someone from HR.""

That's when it clicked. They'd already decided who I was and where I belonged. I was in the ""non-technical PM"" box and that was that.

Here's the thing nobody tells you: your company's development plan for you is designed to keep you useful to THEM, not to maximize your earning potential. They want you to be pretty good at a bunch of internal stuff that means nothing if you leave. They want you stable and cheap.

Think about it. They had me learning our proprietary HR system for a year. Market value of that skill? Literally zero. Nobody else uses that system. Meanwhile I'm getting 3% yearly raises while inflation is eating 7%. Every ""development opportunity"" was just more work for the same pay. And the skills they wanted me to learn only mattered at that specific company.

I'm watching people job hop for 20-30% raises while I'm waiting for my 3% and a pizza party. Following their development plan for 3 years got me exactly nowhere. Still making basically the same money, just with a fancier title that meant nothing outside that company.

So I made my own plan. Kept doing my job but stopped drinking the kool-aid. Got AWS certified on my own time. Applied to 100+ jobs. Left for a 75% raise doing technical work they never would've considered me for.

My coworkers who stayed on the company development track? Still there. Still waiting for that promotion that's definitely coming ""next quarter."" Still making basically the same money with maybe an extra week of PTO if they're lucky.

Look, I'm not saying be a shitty employee. Do your job well. But understand that your company's plan for you and YOUR plan for you are not the same thing. They want to keep you in whatever box is most convenient for them. You're a resource to them, not a person with ambitions.

You want to actually grow? Make your own plan. Learn skills the MARKET values, not just what your company needs. Stop waiting for permission to develop yourself. Your manager is not your career coach, they're trying to keep their team staffed with people who won't leave.

The company isn't evil, they're just looking out for themselves. You should do the same.

The best time to start was 3 years ago. Second best time is today.

1mscwkg,Not sure about my future,"I’m feeling pretty uncertain about my future. I’ve been accepted into an art course which I was honestly pretty excited about. But, I’ve always had a passion for mental health care and helping others, especially veterans, adults + children in or have experienced traumatic situations. Unfortunately, it’s a little too late to change courses, so I’m planning to do one year of my art program and see how I feel about it.

The problem is, I’ve been searching for jobs that’d require to my degree, but I’m realising there aren’t many options at all, that I’d feel passionate about doing for the rest of my life. I want a career I could do long-term without getting bored, something meaningful where I can make a real impact. I’ve thought about art therapy, but I don’t think focusing on the art aspect is what I want. I’ve experienced art therapy myself, it helped temporarily, but I tend to just revert back to old habits.

Honestly, I’m confused about why I chose this art degree in the first place. I was happy to get accepted because the university has a good reputation, and I thought it would make job searching easier, especially since art galleries often hunt for talent from degree shows. But deep down, I know I’d be much happier to work directly with people and support their mental health struggles.

I just worry about disappointing my parents, they seemed really happy I got into art school. But I just don’t feel like I am, I’m concerned about paying off student debt, I (sadly applied for a student loan because my dad made me) and not finding a stable, long-lasting job that I’d love doing every day.

I’m considering just completing the art degree and then doing further study, but my options seem so limited.. I’m not sure if I can switch from an art degree to something in mental health, especially since my current coursework is mostly art-related. Also, I’ve failed maths and sciences, which complicates things.",evewfish,1,1.0,0,1755391035,2025-08-17 00:37:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mscwkg/not_sure_about_my_future/,8,2025
1mscw2w,What job offer should I go for?,"The offers:

BT DevSecOps / Security Software Engineer (~£39-40k inc bonus, at home). I’d have basically 0 living costs if I take this one (living with parents). Role is like half swe, half security/infra. Stack is kubernetes, terraform, puppet, jenkins, python, js/react, bash, github ci/cd. Seems like it could open doors to either cyber sec or SWE later.

Marex SWE (Analyst) (~£55k inc bonus, London). More “straight up” software developer but in finance domain (trading/market data). Pay looks higher on paper but I’d be paying ~£1.6k/month for rent + living so actual savings end up lower.

Sage Graduate SWE (~£32–35k, Manchester). More of a standard grad programme, enterprise/business software, feels safe but train costs 3 days a week ~ £500/month. UK trains are a lot.


Questions:

Which one actually looks better on CV for fintech recruiters vs FAANG recruiters?

Does BT’s hybrid DevSecOps/SWE role set me up better long term cos of broader skills + savings?

Or is Marex better cos it’s already finance, even if I save less early on?

1mscuff,"I quit a month ago, and my “meh” boss is asking for my work b/c they didn’t make a copy - but it’s in his email, the drive, and printed copies I left in his possession - what would you do?","Putting this at the top because it’s a novel: TDLR: the title. Also, apologies for any grammar mistakes and thank you for reading in advance. 


So for starters I want to preface this with I like my boss as a person, but not as a boss or engineer for his given role. He’s the dreamer type of engineer with no idea how to do it. I’m a dreamer engineer, but I figure out if it works OR how to do it, test it, and figure out if it works (if the budget allows) before machining, etc. I’m basically the nerd in the back and I love that. I’ve been in R&D my whole career (6 years), and it requires design iterations. 

Now to the problem. 

The company baited and switched me on remote part time and said the interviewer would be my boss. We got along really well and had 2-4 hour conversations leading up to their offer on the project they were going to put me on. This is not normal in my field to give an interviewee all this info on a project before hiring… at least to my knowledge.. I turned down an offer that was 30k more just so I could have to the remote days. I need them because I always get sexualized in the office and it can be too much to where I can’t focus and get the job done. I’ve had my ass grabbed in jeans that fit well and jeans that don’t (they have to test if it’s still there). Well they put me under someone who was under my interviewer who didn’t understand design iterations, loves a power point for everything, and apparently wasn’t informed of my employment parameters of part time office/part time remote. Neither he nor the interviewer were present my first week. It was awesome. I made great progress on the project since I’m used to the unknown and “get it done as quick as possible.” However, I no longer will put up with bull****. I’ve been through to much in the oil & gas field. 

So his first day back he says there’s no work from home unless I have kids or a sick spouse. I have neither and that is not what I agreed to. I would’ve taken the other full time in office job had I known (same field, same role). I informed him. He said he talk to his higher up. Welp. He didn’t. He kept bringing up the remote thing as, “we need an engineer at both sites so I don’t think you’ll be able to work remote,” to “not possible until 2-4 years,” at which point I called the interviewer aka his higher up (he apologized and confirmed my employment as hybrid), then “you really should have negotiated a hybrid schedule prior to employment.” I quit the very next morning. 

I was only there six weeks. 

In that time frame I designed a whole new testing system for them amongst other parts and manufacturing specialty equipment that was basically one offs for our company, not industry (one of these are the part HAND drawings he’s asking for). The only thing I couldn’t design was a valve that DOES NOT EXIST YET. Im not a valve expert. I’ve never designed a valve. 

As far as the valve goes… After I spent three days looking for a valve to make my test system work, my boss informed me it didn’t exist and I had to design it, create a BOM for 7 other options we talked about and I had modeled, a power point, a GANT chart, a timeline, and what we the F else he said (remember… he’s a dreamer, so of course we had seven options that I had to make work) for EACH option. All of this BS with only one working day before the first design review. Ha. No. Not possible. That was the end of week 3. WEEK 3. 

His boss (interviewer) had said he only wanted an assembly to go off of prior to his vacation (week 2-3). So instead, I incorporated everything into one design that was adaptable - all in one day. As expected in the design review process, they said “wow, that’s exactly what all of us asked for. Let’s simplify and change it, but we’re very happy with this. Wow!” It’s just how it goes with R&D. 

(I’m separating for Reddit here): The very next day, my boss tells me that his boss is disappointed in me because he expected for the project to already be done and they have concerns about my ability to deliver. That was the Tuesday of my fourth week at the company. Wtf??? That told me this guy had no idea how this goes and has never tried to get a quote from a vendor on a specialty part before. Oh keep in mind since this valve didn’t exist, the testing system itself never existed outside of his boss… to their knowledge (it existed to my knowledge just different field of oil & gas so also a red flag). They were right that the valve didn’t exist though. 

Side note… my boss’ boss said he’d designed three of these just like he wants before, but he didn’t have the drawings when I asked. He came up with an idea for the valve, so I have to give him credit for that, but HE CAME UP WITH THE VALVE ON VACATION THE WEEK BEFORE. So how has this ever been designed before? 

So throughout this process I’m being belittled by my boss while watching him waste material and machinists time because he under “toleranced” and now the part is scrap because we can’t machine it down to what it needs to be. He asked me to put a reverse engineered part into production at 400 count that I didn’t have the mating connections, so I couldn’t verify it would seal. He wanted me to go off digital calipers. I refused in an email after his verbal demand. And honestly, that part would’ve taken me less than a day if he could just get me the connections info. I finished my drawing, informed him, then he let it sit for a week. Then he decided he need to get me lessons on measuring parts so I could be more confident in my measurements. Fam, this is 0.001-0.002 inches tolerance. I even used mics and dial gauges. If all three matched, maybe I’d put it out. Big maybe. 

He’s been with the company for 2 years and still hasn’t finished a complete assembly that he reverse engineered. Hm. Ponder that. In my first few weeks people were already coming up to me telling me he didn’t know what he was doing. I’m inclined to be positive. I like people with ideas, so I was giving him the benefit of the doubt for about two weeks. He’s a really nice person just off the walls a bit. As individuals we got along. He didn’t yell or sexualize me, so hey I’ll give him a shot. He killed it with not remembering the first hybrid conversation, not talking to his boss, harping on it, and telling me I was a disappointment every other day (with a smile too. Ajust very nice tone while using, “disappointment.” He never offered up how I could be better other than I should’ve completed this by week three so move faster. I asked. He just said move faster. This is not all of the BS though. 

Another side note: got sent a D pic my fourth week from a shop guy, told I should be a submissive wife (I’m single) by several others (Bible Belt babayyy), surprise exposure, and surprised kissed by a 65 y/o married man on my last day. HR was worth it. Maybe a lawsuit is because I have all the proof but I didn’t report to HR as those all happened in my last two weeks when I was pretty sure I was going to quit. F me I know. I dropped the ball. It’s hard out here and I’m tired. 

I’ve already gone on long enough. 

Boss asked for the hand drawing of that tool last Friday because they forgot to make a copy. They have it. It’s literally named the dude who asked for it tool. In the tool folder. 

Part of me just wants to say nothing, the other part just wants to not respond. 

What would you do?

1msca06,Unhappy in my role - should I try to transfer within the company before the eligible time frame?,"I posted here several months ago.  Around this time last year I was pulled into a conference room and out of nowhere told they are transferring me to a different team within the department in a completely different role that I have no experience in.  It was clear that senior management already had this all mapped out and even though I was asked for my thoughts, it was clear they were going to do this whether I liked it or not.  I haven't liked this new role from the beginning and things have been extremely disorganized to say the least.  You can read my previous posts for reference, but I have reported to SIX different managers since this time last year and it's been super chaotic.  They did give me a promotion at the beginning of the year (with a very small bump in pay), but that didn't really help with my unhappiness.  I was at my breaking point in the Spring and I was seriously considering quitting without something lined up.  I also tried to apply for an internal job posting around that time.  At my company, if you haven't been in your role for 1 year, manager approval is required before you can apply.  I met with my manager and she said the department rule is they like you to be in your role for at least 9 months before they let you post to roles outside the department (not sure where they came up with this).   So since then I have been doing my best, but still really unhappy.  Recently an internal job posting came up that I think would be perfect for me, but unfortunately I have still only been in my role for 7 months.  Should I try to revisit this with management and see if they'll let me post for this role or should I try to wait out the additional 2 months and hope that there are some good internal job postings around that time?  I'm also really concerned that even if I wait another 2+ months, that they are going to come up with another reason to block me because I know they don't want me to leave.  And yes I have been casually looking externally too, but I really like the company overall and would prefer to stay there and just move to another department.

1ms9c3o,"Skills needed for early grad in finance? (Asset management, IR)","I’m a new grad in an 18-month rotational program (starting in accounting, probably ending in FP&A). Solid experience, but tbh I don’t see myself in back-office finance forever. I’d love to pivot into something more engaging like Asset Management or Investor Relations. Honestly I'm still exploring so if you have any advice on what careers to move into that would be great as well:

Why I am fixated on asset management:

* Work with external clients, not just internal reports
* Actually feel like I’m making an impact
* Learn things I can apply to my own life (aka how to invest my money smarter)

I know it’s early and CFA might be a bit much right now, but I’d like to start stacking skills/certs that will set me up for that world. I understand that my entry to this field might be research but I'm not sure where i should start in terms of studying, resume enhancers.

So for those of you in AM/IR/Similar professions:

* What skills should I be building early?
* Any certifications/courses that are legit resume boosters?
* Where should I start if research is the most realistic entry point?

1ms986b,Public Works or Restaurant Managment?,"Hello all. Recently got offered a Part time job with my city. It is 27 hours a week. Typically you get hired part time, if you don’t have much experience with Public Works. It is a union, and once you get promoted to full time, your first year salary is 55k then step increases every year. They do provide pension and $1650 towards health benefits. My current profession is Restaurant manager, as an assistant General Manager. I make $74,000 base salary with about an extra $4000-6000 in bonus a year. I’ve been working in this industry for nearly 10 years now, I am 28 years old. As you all know, working in management, particularly in restaurants, you work weekends, nights, holidays, all that good stuff. I typically work 50 hours a week. Would any of you leave the 74k~80k restaurant job to do Public Works? I have two kids, my wife is a stay at home, and I am nervous to make this jump. A pro would be also that the health benefits with the city will pretty much cover almost everything, and at my current job I am paying roughly $1000 a month for health, dental, and vision.

For the last 6 years, I have been working in hybrid model in a large financial institution as a senior in one of the control functions and my current salary package sits at 70k. I'd be up for promotion to manager soon and my TC should raise at 85k. My worklife balance is currently good as I know the company very well, but it has had a lot of ups and downs.

However, I recently received an offer to work as a pre sales manager for southern europe (fluent italian, and spanish required), and here i'd be preparing demos of a saas that is specific to the control functions. The job would be based in Italy and fully remote with some travel required, and my TC would be 95k. Hiring manager said that worklife balance is a priority for them.

As I have no experience with pre sales, what are the career opportunities if I were to follow this path? What jobs I could realistically go after? How could my compensation structure look like in the future? Will i pigeonhole myself if become an expert of an internal control saas or would it be realistic to move to other companies?

One of the concerns with my current job is that I know that with my current salary i'm already at the top of the range offered for my line of work. I'm afraid after the promotion to manager there won't be anymore growth for me as directors' positions are highly competive, and difficult to get.

I’ve been doing an internship that was supposed to be 3 months. I spoke to them about converting me to full-time, and instead they extended it to 6 months, saying they’d look for chances to bring me on full-time after. There’s still a chance I might not get converted, so nothing is guaranteed.

Now, I’ve received a full-time analyst offer from another organization. That role provides stability and security, but the internship work feels more meaningful to me, even though it’s uncertain.



So here’s my question:
Should I finish the 6 months and hope for a full-time offer, or take the sure thing?

I enjoyed the job for a while, but I have been there several years now and feel a bit burned out in it now.

1ms2734,I don't know what to do [ADVICE NEEDED],"I (16 year old male) got my first job less than 6 months ago at a pharmacy. I work once a week, mostly serving customers and general things like that and I have a bit of a dilemma.

My boss is really pissed because I can't remember where certain items are and has told me to revaluate my position here (basically you're fired in a nice way).  So I'm slightly annoyed because it's not like I don't put in any effort. I do and I can remember where general broad items are (eg children, Panadol, eye related treatments, etc) but my boss gets really annoyed when I can't remember specific things like foot cream, cannabis or whatever and he said something like ""your item orientation is shit"". So I'm confused, how do pharmacists remember where specific items are, like specific brands, etc. I know that it comes with experience and they work a lot more too, but I'm very conflicted right now. What's wrong with me? What am I doing wrong? 

When I was talking to my boss afterwards, he was going on about how a passionate and dedicated person should be able to remember where the items are after <6 months (He also got annoyed when I couldn't remember how long I had been working there and I know it is my fault, but it didn't seem like an important detail, so I don't know why he got annoyed?). There was also this one time a few weeks back when he got really mad because I couldn't remember where this foot cream was and he said he wanted to slap me. I know this is my fault but the customer said something like 3B cream but I didn't know what that was because I only remembered the general categories and which general area they are in. But I have been trying to remember specific items and just like why can't you see that instead (of course I have no problem with receiving feedback to improve but it's just the way my boss reacted?).

My boss was also telling me about how my customer service/communication skills were shit. Yes, I am an introvert and shy in general, but it's not like I don't do anything. I do go and serve customers (the ""hi how can I help you"" with a smile) but he goes on about how he always sees hesitation on my face? I really don't understand what he meant here because I always make sure I'm smiling and sound happy while interacting with customers. (There was this one time he was annoyed because he said something about me frowning/giving confused looks, but I genuinely thought I improved because I'm now always smiling at customers no matter what). But yes, I do know that my communication skills in general are not the best, but they have improved especially from when I started. I'm also not very confident apparently and I don't know how to engage the conversation with customers - but I seriously thought I fixed that. Regardless, I always have gone and talked with the customers.

Well my boss told me to revaluate my job here and that I shouldn't waste my time, like it was clearly a mistake or whatever. I thought I sort of fixed my social anxiety being shy and everything but like I don't even know what people want anymore. He told me that they could give me another chance though, if I wanted, but he made it pretty clear they didn't actually want me back and he was just being nice. Like, I know my communication skills are shit - They had never been good I was always the shy one, the one that didn't talk but I genuinely did try to improve. He has also said that he wouldn't even be able to reference me as good (or even adequate?) if I put it down as experience on my resume.

I also don't understand what he means by dedicated and passionate or what he wants in general. I've noticed this thing with me where I'm like not very expressive? Like someone could tell me that they're having a baby and my face would remain neutral - and I am really happy for them, but I just don't show it on the outside? I seriously don't know how to fix this and like I always have to remember to put in more effort to appear happy, even though I already am. I just don't show it.

There was also this one time where he was like think about whether this is something you really want to do and forget it if you want to become a doctor, pharmacist or whatever when he was mad because he said I was apparently frowning? So I'm not even sure what I want to do anymore, because I originally wanted to study medicine and being a doctor.

I know that I'm in the wrong here and I should have tried harder, but I don't even know if I should go back anymore. I don't know what I'm doing wrong and how other people are so good at communicating in general like wtf I thought I was improving and actually doing things better and I'm so pissed with myself for being shy all the time and for not trying harder.

I just don't know what to do and really need advice asap.

I’m feeling pretty lost and hoping for some guidance.

I’ve been working in development and international development for the past 10 years, with the last 4 years focused exclusively on international development. I hold two master’s degrees, one in Public Administration and another in Communication and my career has largely been in project management, training, and financial management roles, mostly in nonprofit and donor-funded environments.

Even before the recent changes in the international development space (and the shift in administration), I was already trying to pivot out of the nonprofit sector. Now, it feels even more urgent, but also more confusing. I’ve been applying to general management and operations roles outside the nonprofit world and trying to leverage my experience in project management, training, compliance, and budget oversight. I’ve also applied to roles at universities, given my experience working with a few higher education institutions.

But I’m stuck. I’m getting a handful of interviews here and there, but not many, and no offers. Most of the responses are from nonprofits which I’m actively trying to transition away from and most of my connections are in the same industry.

So I’m turning to this community: Where else should I be applying? What industries or roles would value my background in project management, training, financial oversight, and communications?

I’d appreciate any ideas especially from folks who’ve made a similar pivot out of international development or nonprofits.",Human-Amoeba1640,1,1.0,5,1755364179,2025-08-16 17:09:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ms19r9/trying_to_pivot_out_of_nonprofits_after_10_years/,8,2025

1ms07iu,"Landed my first marketing job at an FMCG startup, ended up resigning in 2.5 months. What now?","I wanted to share my experience (and also ask for advice).

About 2 months ago, I joined a 1-year-old FMCG company as a Management Trainee – Social Media. But in reality, my role looked more like a full-fledged Social Media Manager:

● Ideating campaigns
● Designing and creating creatives
● Posting across Instagram, LinkedIn, and the website
● Handling DMs and comments
● Contacting influencers and agencies
● Shooting Content 
● Hiring Candidates
● Copywriting 
● Handling YouTube 

Basically, everything social media. And honestly, I liked it. I was learning a lot on the go.

For context: before this job, I had zero professional experience - the only related thing was my personal instagram dedication to books(2.5k followers, though it’s pretty inactive now). So this was my first real taste of marketing.

But eventually, the pressure got to me - approvals everywhere, no guidance, constant criticism without solutions. It got to a point where I was scared to even pitch new ideas (which used to be my strongest suit). So after 2.5 months, I resigned.

Now I’m stuck asking myself: What do I do next?

● Should I try for another social media/marketing role right away?
● Should I take some time to skill up (analytics, ads, design, etc.) before jumping again?
● How do I frame this short stint in my resume/interviews without it looking ""bad""?

I’m genuinely passionate about marketing and digital media, but this experience shook me up more than I expected. Would love to hear from people who’ve been in similar positions - what did you do after leaving a job that early, and how did it impact your career?

1ms01bs,Stay in toxic environment while I pursue training or leave for a longer commute and less training time?,"Hey guys first off thank you to all who provide guidance. 

This is from a burner account to protect my identity. 

A quick background, I am from Ontario Canada and work for a government employer under a union. Most of my 10+ year career has been trouble free up until a few months ago. 

My coworker had a tantrum on me and told me that everyone hated me and was out to get me. There is another coworker who has more authority over me who has been a bully to me for majority of my career, I was mostly able to avoid it because he had no authority but once he got that it started becoming unavoidable.  I spoke with my supervisor and hr about it and they haven’t done a thing despite all my evidence. 

This coworker in an authority position has been having everyone in the workplace spy on me and when I do something that isn’t 100% in line he takes those people’s accounts and files an hr complaint against me. It has been for the most minor petty things and for the most part no disciplinary action has been taken against me by HR. They did find on one instance that I violated something and gave me a verbal. 

I recently took my employer to the labour board for it because I felt like they were not adequately fulfilling their obligations. The process was a nightmare and ate literally every off day I had so eventually I decided to drop it and turn my attention on leaving. 

During that process about 1/3 of my coworkers reported me to hr saying that they felt uncomfortable working with me because they felt I was spying and recording them. This was a result of the legal action I took. In my most recent HR meeting this one was held with people of a higher authority than my last one. They began questioning me on my entire employment history bringing up incidents from prior to 2020 that I was completely unaware of were actually incidents. Trust me when I say this but they threw everything including the kitchen sink at me. And this was just weeks following me dropping the board case. The way they questioned me felt like they were trying to build a case involving a toxic work environment. I did adequately defend myself saying that all actions I took were in accordance with the legal process that was underway. However because of the sheer volume of everything they threw I am not confident. 

The question becomes now is that I have an opportunity for another job. The job pays about $1 per hour more but requires a 45 minute commute one way. I basically can walk to work if I would like to now. I am currently going through the process of becoming a pilot and will be starting my training in the next month hopefully pending a medical. This new job has less time off and will lose me my seniority which is a little valuable. It will also force me into a 1.5 hour daily commute with a good portion in traffic. That time is significant when you consider my flight training. This new job does open up doors for me to obtain licensing and certification that would benefit me greatly in the future if I weren’t to become a pilot. However the process to obtain those licenses are not easy and I will absolutely not be working on them while I am in flight training. That opportunity does not exist at my current employer because there is an hours worked component and my employer does not have the equipment available to achieve those hours. 

I’m a little unsure what to do. If I were not in flight training I would 100% without a doubt leave. I cannot function in this environment anymore. I cannot keep being pulled into hr meetings on a monthly or bimonthly basis. I am at the point now where I feel unsafe in my work environment because of the actions of my employer for failing to intervene. I do not want to obtain a medical leave because that may impact my ability to obtain a future medical and I don’t believe it’s fair that I jeopardize my career for the actions of a few. On the other hand, the other job is a significant time waster and offers me less time off than my current role. I can hold up to 3 weeks off in my new job compared to 6 weeks in my current. 

Right now my coworker with the authority has been isolating me at work from practically everyone unless the responsibilities require me to have someone. While that sucks and I am documenting it I am looking at the bright side. Right now I pretty much just go into work, do the absolute minimum required and I barely see anyone all day. Occasionally someone comes to check in on me (usually it’s to make sure I am not taking a second longer than 30 minutes for lunch) but that’s about it. For the most part I am by myself and barely get asked to do anything. 

Thank you all for your advice. ",bully-free,5,0.8600000143051147,3,1755361512,2025-08-16 16:25:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ms01bs/stay_in_toxic_environment_while_i_pursue_training/,8,2025

Actually in our project we are using mono-repo where there is almost 3 project 2 existing and one is our current project so from these 2 existing project reusable components all icons, api, custom hooks and all AgGrid also we are using its very hard to understand and also we are not using any co-pilot and all in our codebase/vs code I am using ai externally like claude chat gpt and all. And i am not getting how can i study we are using tech stack like Javascript, react js, typescript, react query, material ui, AgGrid for tables should i study all this tech stack or for now just focus on learning codebase  all the functions, flows, design how things are working etc. Daily getting new task not getting time to study i have to start preparing working on new task and i have no real experience on any of these i just have theory knowledge of javascript and react js I am always in stress and daily in anxiety tension like today will be my last day they will terminate me for sure but somehow surviving don’t know how much day i will survive here.

I am not getting what to do should i quit this job and start as a fresher in new company money is not concern for me i just want learnings atleast as a fresher they will understand me give some time, Kt trainings some mentors or atleast they will give more time to understand to complete task and all. But then i also think like here i am working on very good project very rapid development, package is good, daily learnings new task experiences, playing with api’s learning debugging analysis team mates are good, team lead is good and understanding my 3yrs experience in corporate will not wasted please someone guide me i am ready for both the scenarios working as a fresher and also as a experienced ( but daily stress is there ).

1mrvqtb,Career advice needed: Application Specialist or software developer?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a fresh Computer Engineering graduate and could really use some career advice and opinions on my next move.

Over the past 3 months, I interned at a pharmaceutical company in the IT Solutions department. Most of my work involved learning Oracle E-Business Suite, writing custom reports in SQL/PLSQL, and providing support for other systems the company uses (CRM, management systems, etc.). They have now offered me a full-time position as an Application Specialist where I would continue supporting different software solutions across the company. I believe the future path for this track would be moving towards roles like  Solution Manager, which are more functional than technical.

My second option is a 6-month internship at Inria (French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology) in France – which is a well-known research institution in computer science. This internship is much more technical and R&D-oriented: I’d be working on embedded systems using ESP32, programming in C/C++, etc.

I’m trying to decide whether I should:
Take the full-time Application Specialist role, get stability, and grow into the more functional/managerial side of IT.
OR
Go for the Inria internship, stay on the technical/software development path (embedded systems), and potentially strengthen my profile as a developer/engineer.

Worth mentioning: I’m not based in the US, so the job market and opportunities might be a bit different than what’s typical there.

Is it better nowadays to go more functional/solution-oriented or stay technical?

Any insight is greatly appreciated

1mrv8uf,What to do when you feel stuck at your job,"What to do when you feel stuck at your job.

I’m 22F, and currently struggling to figure out the right direction for my career. After giving the JEE exam, I couldn’t get into an IIT, but I did get into an NIT — though the branch I got was civil engineering, which I wasn’t really interested in. I didn’t want to waste a year or drop, so I joined anyway. But by the end of my first year, I realized civil wasn’t my thing. That’s when I started exploring and found an interest in coding. During my second and third year, I worked hard on my coding skills, solved 300+ DSA questions, and built two good projects. I also secured a research internship in AI/ML at the end of my third year. Still, to keep my CGPA good for placements, I kept studying civil side-by-side. The catch? Since my branch didn’t attract coding companies, I had limited placement options. Eventually, in my fourth year, a reputed e-commerce company visited for a management role, and I was selected for an internship plus PPO. I joined the company, but now I feel stuck — the work is minimal, and I’m often told to just ""learn from others"" without any real tasks. Though the pay is decent and the company is well-known, I don’t feel fulfilled. I’m not deeply into civil, coding, or management — I just have bits and pieces of each. And while many might enjoy earning without working, I personally don’t feel good about it. Now I’m unsure — should I continue in this job? Or should I explore other career options and prepare for something that actually excites me? If so, what roles should I even consider? I’m open to learning and growing — I just don’t know what direction to take next.",letmelickyourlemons,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1755350824,2025-08-16 13:27:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mrv8uf/what_to_do_when_you_feel_stuck_at_your_job/,8,2025

If you don’t have something practical that can help, I’d prefer if you didn’t comment. I’ve seen too many posts where people get hurt by unnecessary remarks, and I really can’t handle that right now.

Currently in school I'm enjoying biology (diseases and animals are most interesting to me) and chemistry, I'm also good at drawing and a bit of creative thinking, I'm an INTP-T and my ideal career is the usual, high paying, remote and fun with work life balance.

I originally thought of medicine like dentist, anesthetist, forensic scientist bc it fit the biology part but I'm hesitant bc of the number of years I need to study before I can start making money and I'm worries the stress levels are too high.

I kinda dont want a career in arts because its so saturated and i dont want to lose passion for something i enjoy bc of pressure and money

Scientific illustrator is interesting too bc its both art and biology but my artstyle is very much those pinterest, stylized ones and the pay isnt much

Since it's preferred to live in china bc its a growing economy it would be best if the starting salary is 70-80k+ usd since I want to be able to support my parents comfortably. I'm also alr with places like europe aswell.

appreciate all help!!",Agile_Luck1117,1,1.0,0,1755347001,2025-08-16 12:23:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mrtqo6/possible_career_choices_that_mixes_biology_with/,8,2025
1mrtk13,My boss told me he doesn't know how to work with me and that I should find a place that “fits me better.” What should I do now?,"I've been in this company for 2.5 years and a core contributor to a key project from the start. I was hired for analytics but stepped into development due to project needs. I don't have a dev background, so I worked hard to catch up. I've delivered results and even presented our work at conferences.

My relationship with my boss is mixed. He’s generally approachable, but there’s been friction. Once, he shouted at me during a meeting for sharing something I was testing. He accused me of “doing my own thing” when I was simply exploring and sharing. He later apologized. Since then, I’ve felt resistance whenever I share new ideas. His reactions often fluctuate — one moment he says stop, the next he wants to showcase the same thing.

I also stepped up to finish work that interns couldn’t complete. I was transparent and regularly shared progress during meetings. No one raised concerns. But months later, a project co-lead called me “difficult” and said I didn’t follow process, even though they still used my work.

This, combined with worsening health (my asthma flared due to stress/weight gained), led me to ask my boss if I could temporarily step back from development and help out in other ways. He said okay. I followed up with an email confirming our conversation.

During this time, I still contributed — presented at a conference and worked on items in my work plan. But I could slowly feel the shift as I was excluded from meetings and projects. Recently, when I asked if I could help with anything, he said:

* He doesn’t know how to work with me
* He had to scramble when I stepped back
* My email was too black-and-white and he “already knew”
* I’m selfish and only care about myself
* He prefers to run the project without me
* I should find a place that “fits me better”

He also brought up a past workshop and claimed I “dropped the ball.” But I had done everything: created the deck, got his review, flagged my leave early, assigned tasks in advance, and offered to help check setup in our assigned room before leaving. He said it wasn’t necessary at the time.

He even used casual comments I once made as part of his justification for pushing me out.

Now I have no assigned work or clear role. I want to remain professional, but it’s hard, especially when I followed process and had his prior agreement.

Should I clarify my side, wait to be let go, or just quietly leave?

Thanks for any advice.",External_Brother_166,200,0.8999999761581421,123,1755346502,2025-08-16 12:15:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mrtk13/my_boss_told_me_he_doesnt_know_how_to_work_with/,8,2025

1mrst3j,Dream job if I had support,"I was hired 8 months ago as a subject matter expert for advanced technology projects in manufacturing. There are 10 reps here but no one is specifically accountable for manufacturing. So they are bringing in projects that i can assist with periodically but nothing that's substantial. I was finally told by president of sales that they had hoped the one rep would dive into this area but he just didn't have the time for it. Then he says new person they hired thinking he would be great for this area is going to focus on another specialty. Finally ends with admission that he dropped the ball and needs to hire someone to work with me. So in an act of self preservation for my position,  I offer to step in to help with sales but he quickly tells me that's not my job. Now I dont report to President of sales. My boss is holding me to how I am going to be utilized more. I am really pissed off. Meanwhile I have sourced out business for my company through another avenue but doesn't help me at all and the president of sales wants me to continue bringing in leads this way.

I am confused about how to approach this situation. Should I keep applying to jobs abroad or should I do another masters degree abroad? I also checked requirements for Digital Nomad Visa and although I freelance, it would be difficult to meet the threshold.

1)Which of these fields is most in demand right now in the era of AI ?
2)Which offers better salary & long-term growth?

I did a 3-year BA in Psychology from Delhi University ( India) and want to study abroad, but only with a fully funded scholarship due to finances. I’m torn between:

Counselling/Clinical Psych - requires supervised hours + license after Master’s. How realistic is this for international students? Do visas get sponsored during that stage?

Organisational/HR Psych - seems more straightforward, but I’m unsure about job prospects abroad.


Mainly: which path has better job/visa opportunities for international students? And how tough is licensing in counselling psych vs employability in org/HR psych?

1mrmjo7,Between a rock and a hard place,"I’m desperate and I need some advice. I don’t have many people to talk about this because I feel shame and embarrassment, but honestly give it to me straight because this is a throwaway account anyway.

So I have a very good resume, I’ve worked in big companies for 3 year stints. I was let go in mid 2024, I took it very hard as this was a dream company that is highly sought after but it wasn’t performance based, they really just didn’t have any work for us and they eventually let go of my entire team basically. I was unemployed for only about 2 weeks before I accepted an offer from a nightmare start up. It didn’t start off that way though but about a month or so into it my boss was fired and the company became shady and my new boss was not experienced at all and I hate to say this but I think she hated us. 

I was let go for performance about 6 months in with no pip or warning, my manager even took the time to berate me while she fired me. Just awful but I’ve had some time to heal since then and I guess make peace with it as I really have always been a good employee. I’ve always been told I do tasks good and I can handle heavy workloads, even receiving awards. 

I feel like I lost myself essentially, like I wasn’t deserving of good things happening to me. Lost faith in myself, the universe, everything. I started looking for a new job but this market is insane. I told myself I would take my time and find an established company and a role I liked. Savings started to run dry and I kept getting rejected and I started to feel like I should take a cut in pay or even lower title. I started applying to anything. 

I interviewed for a small consulting company in my field (okay title) and I got the job, the salary is far from what we need and want but it’s a paycheck and a start. I told myself I need to try hard to reach success at this company and give it my all. My team is very competent and skilled which is a relief. They are very kind and are willing to pay for some certs and it’s remote which I didn’t even care about anymore but is still cool. My partner even told me it’s like the old me is back. 

I keep getting call backs and I go through with interviews but I worry about what this will look like on my resume. Should I add this new job to my LinkedIn? Should I add career break to my LinkedIn too and what do I say now? 

Did I do the wrong thing? Should I keep applying? Should I stick this out for a year?

1mrm9rv,Asking for hybrid work?,"
I’ve been interning at a small company for the past 6 months as a Data Analyst, working on system transformation, automation, and building processes from the ground up. There’s no senior mentor for me, so I’ve been figuring a lot out myself. My manager and team have been very impressed with my work, and they just extended a full-time offer with a very generous salary.

The commute is pretty brutal, and I feel like I have no time for my life outside of work. From what I understand, no one in the office has set hybrid days, but everyone has the ability to work remotely occasionally. My manager sometimes works fully remote for a few weeks at a time. There are also some employees in the US who work fully remote, but they tend to be highly specialized, usually with PhDs.

I’d like the ability to work from home one or two days a week for productivity and to help with the commute. I’m wondering:
	•	Is it reasonable to ask for hybrid days before accepting the offer?
	•	How should I frame it so it doesn’t come across as ungrateful or demanding?
	•	Or would it be smarter to accept first and ask later once I’ve established myself full-time?

Who are the employees in the company we cannot lose? 
What does your direct boss do? How often do you see your said boss? 
What’s your biggest flaw? 
Are these appropriate questions?

1mri2rl,Did I mess up my life?,"Tldr; Had a nice job, nice apartment, but life got hard, I gave it all up, and am struggling to find the energy to pick myself up and try again. Need some advice/straight talk.   
  
I had a job that wasn't perfect but it worked for me on many levels. I had solid pay, it was non-profit work that made me feel like I was contributing to society, and the commute was almost non-existent. I was extremely stressed when I first started working there because there was almost no training and the heads of my department had a very hands-off approach to leadership. I basically had to figure out how to execute all the tasks my role was expected to do on my own. After two years, not only did I accomplish establishing my role, I excelled at it. But, the effort took its toll. I was frustrated that I had to work so hard just to get to where I was. The burnout was real and I started slacking on my tasks and appearing uninterested in the work to the point that my department director said that I looked ""bored"". 

Another disheartening factor was that I had gotten my roommate a job next to me. We were very close so people immediately lumped us together. He is admittedly more charismatic than I am and didn't have to try as hard to get people to like him. We would work on projects together but I would do most of the work. To the point that when I presented something to our team, my direct manager addressed him instead of me... the guy who actually wrote and presented the information. That completely took the wind out of my sails. 

To add insult to injury, my roommate's mother got herself into a messy situation. She sold her house without having somewhere else to go (it's complicated and I don't want to add any more details to an already long post). We were splitting a 2-bedroom apartment and we didn't really have room for her. But my roommate had a codependent  relationship with her and didn't know how to tell her she couldn't stay with us. Even though she and I got along fine, I didn't sign up to be living with my roommate's mother for an undetermined amount of time. After all that, I got fed up, quit my job, and decided to move back in with my parents and start over.

I hated leaving a home and independence that I worked so hard to build. I hated leaving a job that gave me so much, even if I was exhausted by it. I hated that I let my roommate be the reason that I left a pretty good life. Now I'm unmotivated to work in the same kind of job and I'm working at a shitty part-time job with no benefits. Meanwhile. my roommate got to keep the job and the apartment and I'm back at square one.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read. Venting in and of itself was a cathartic but I'll take any advice or straight talk you might want to give. Did I completely derail my life? What should I do now?",RestlessWanderer93,8,0.8500000238418579,7,1755311113,2025-08-16 02:25:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mri2rl/did_i_mess_up_my_life/,8,2025
1mrhy9o,Looking for a career change that is stimulating and creative,"Hi everyone,

I (26M) live in Los Angeles, CA. I have a B.S. degree in cinema production and I worked freelance in the film industry since 2022 full time, but between the strikes in 2023 (and the residual effects of it in 2024) and the integration of AI, have had to make a career switch due to the lack of work.

I wound up getting a mailroom job at a law firm and am pretty miserable there. A lot of my friendly coworkers are no longer there and I have no interest in the legal field and am so bored of reading court documents for hardly above minimum wage. There is also no vertical growth, unless I would want to go into the legal department (and to clarify, I do not want to do that).

I genuinely don’t think I’m cut out for a cubicle/corporate office job and really enjoy working with my hands and being creative. I like new and changing environments and where I don’t necessarily need to sit at a desk the whole time. Working in an office space itself isn’t the worst thing ever, but where I work is SO corporate (white walls, no art, suit and tie, etc.) and I think that’s more of my issue with the cubicle/corporate idea. For example, I used to work at a production company and even thought it was an office space, we still left the office for shoots, didn’t stay at our desks all day, had team meetings and I enjoyed my time there.

I’m still trying to work my way back into film/tv full time, but it feels impossible (minus a gig here and there) and most people I know and my contacts are also leaving or switching careers.

I’ve been trying to think on alternate career paths/environments that would be fulfilling to me and I’ve come up with a few such as looking into being a Park Ranger (but I know the NPS is losing funds and jobs are getting cut), working somewhere within the boating world, being a flight attendant, serving jobs, etc. I’ve also considered some marketing/advertising jobs but the thought of a cubicle kind of kills me but at least it’d be creative. I’ve also been considering working in academia at a university or something along those lines because I find giving back to be really fulfilling.

I’m passionate about the outdoors, love meeting people, travel, art and working as a team.

As you can maybe see, my mind is really all over the place and I’m pretty lost. It’s maybe a bit of a “quarter life crisis”, I just would love to find something more stimulating and that pays a little better.

I know I can’t have my cake and eat it - but I think ideally, I’d find some job that allows me to be creative, work with my hands and have a changing/exciting environment (and of course, feel like I’m being fairly paid). If you have any suggestions on jobs to consider based on my situation, I’ve love to hear them. I feel like I’m at square one a little bit and exploring what else is out there.

Also this:

I’m going to actually sound crazy and I know the odds of it happening are incredibly slim, but I make music as a hobby and I’ve recently been discovered by some bookers/promoters in LA and it genuinely feels like that’s the best thing going for me even though I have practically no following/fans. I’m working on a large music project that some of these hollywood industry heads have a small eye on. It’s kind of keeping me alive right now because I’m able to express myself in a creative way and is very exciting for me even if nothing ends up coming from it.

Maybe that’s just lore and is irrelevant, but it’s pretty important to me, and mentally is keeping me going because it’s exciting and something I’ve always loved and applied myself at.

Thanks for reading, any advice is appreciated!

1mrh7bm,Moving around a lot,"I’m a teacher who wants to make a career change, for context. Out of college I was forced(ish) to move across the country. I hated it there so I moved across the country again to be with my sister. 10 Months later and I moved again across the country with my sister. So in 3 years, I have moved three times. I’m about to start a job in my third state, but now am wondering if I would do better to NOT work here and try to land a job where I want to be long term, in Wisconsin or Illinois (where I’m originally from), because all this moving looks awful on a resume. I am finishing each job’s 1 year contract, but I still think it looks really bad.

I’m wondering if it’ll make a difference to not work and apply in Illinois from my old Idaho address, rather than stay here a year and work, and then apply from a new New Jersey address. Hopefully my question makes sense, but essentially I’m wondering if adding this new state to my resume (by virtue of working) is majorly different than applying from an old/ new Idaho address.

Option 1: stay in new jersey and work for a year, and then move to Illinois/ Wisconsin ((then I will have moved 3 times in 3 years on my resume- 1 year in idaho, 1 in florida, 1 in NJ))

Option 2: don’t work in new jersey and apply for jobs in Illinois/ Wisconsin and work in Idaho if nothing shakes out ((then on my resume I’d only have 2 states ideally, plus an idaho address on my application— 1 year in idaho, 1 in florida, in between state on application))

Generally, is all this moving awful in terms of landing a job?

1mrgcso,WARNING Resume Fraud Guru: Josh Speyer,"

Meet u/jirashap aka his real life identity being Josh Speyer: a dumbass who only got a BA in history (took him 5 years to get it from Berkely), and works at Golden Bear Equities, but currently lives in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. His online Reddit identity involves being a user who openly teaches people how to fabricate jobs, titles, and responsibilities on their resumes and runs a whole company called Background Proof to help you accomplish this and they help you lie for you. Likewise, he also brags about being involved in other sketchy/illegal businesses from cannabis to adult entertainment. 

He also constantly brags about how smart he is for this and his ""intellectual capacity"" to do this. But if he is so smart why does he post all his problems on reddit and his identity got revealed so fast? Your gonna get caught buddy and put in jail for fraud. 

Example from r/resumes:

> ""I've fabricated complete jobs, responsibilities, employer name, and title. You just need to take certain steps, and you can pass the background check. Once you realize that, you can fabricate whatever you want on the resume.""
(reddit.com)



Here’s the kicker: resume fraud is illegal. If reported, it could lead to:

Lost job offers or fired employment.

Civil lawsuits from affected employers.

Criminal charges for fraud in serious cases.

Maybe you should've really started at a real low level low paying job and get your proper credentials in a real STEM degree and get your Masters and PhD before you joined the big leagues buddy. Since you need all this help from reddit. You asked helped about your home lighting setup and even how to set up an anonymous LLC, you have terrible OPSEC bro for a person who constantly says he is so smart and that he has so much ""raw intellectual power"" compared to a 25yo student named Amanda that has a psych degree. Meanwhile you got a liberal arts degree too buddy, you don't even have the intellectual power to even build or invent or even major in something in the tech field yet you claim you have so much experience in IT buddy.


And u/jirashap’s “strategy”? Post every detail online, making it incredibly easy for anyone to trace and report him. It’s reckless, illegal, and just plain dumb.

Finally everyone should report him especially since real life identity was extremely easily to find thanks to him mindlessly posting all his thoughts and problems on reddit.... Like a dumbass. I love how he even made a reddit post saying he wants to use a voice changer to disguise his identity. Like wtf it's a bit too late for that buddy.

TL;DR: u/jirashap aka Josh Speyer openly teaches resume fraud on Reddit while leaving a clear trail for authorities. Reckless, illegal, and easily traceable — a perfect example of how not to handle online oversharing like the pure intellectual dumbass that he is.

1mrga69,Application Specialist vs Software Developer,"Hi everyone,

I’m a fresh Computer Engineering graduate and could really use some career advice and opinions on my next move.

Over the past 3 months, I interned at a pharmaceutical company in the IT Solutions department. Most of my work involved learning Oracle E-Business Suite, writing custom reports in SQL/PLSQL, and providing support for other systems the company uses (CRM, management systems, etc.). They have now offered me a full-time position as an Application Specialist where I would continue supporting different software solutions across the company. I believe the future path for this track would be moving towards roles like  Solution Manager, which are more functional than technical.

My second option is a 6-month internship at Inria (French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology) in France – which is a well-known research institution in computer science. This internship is much more technical and R&D-oriented: I’d be working on embedded systems using ESP32, programming in C/C++, etc.

I’m trying to decide whether I should:
Take the full-time Application Specialist role, get stability, and grow into the more functional/managerial side of IT.
OR
Go for the Inria internship, stay on the technical/software development path (embedded systems), and potentially strengthen my profile as a developer/engineer.

Worth mentioning: I’m not based in the US, so the job market and opportunities might be a bit different than what’s typical there.

Is it better nowadays to go more functional/solution-oriented or stay technical?

Any insight is greatly appreciated

1mrg1vd,"31 working in tech as a software engineer, possibly about to lose my job but have the opportunity to go to medical school. Which path would you advise?","

Software seems to have gotten really competitive lately. I’ve been having a difficult time focusing since I started this career about 1.5 years ago. Frankly I think I’m close to losing my job as I haven’t been able to focus well in this isolated environment. My work is extremely isolating and I honestly feel like I’m going insane not having the ability to talk to people at work since my team is remote. That being said I’m compensated well ($130k TC). I’m decent enough in software interviews that maybe (seems like a big maybe given the current tech market) I could make it to a FAANG company within the next few years.

In my free time I had been applying to programs for medical school out of curiosity. I was accepted into an excellent postbacc program with guaranteed entrance to med school. I also am lucky enough to have my entire med school tuition covered & paid for. I’m well aware of the challenges of medicine, but it does seem to have the potential of a more satisfying career. I’d be working around others and helping others better themselves, even with insurance company nightmares, admin work, horrible residency hours, and everything else wrong with medicine, this seems more fulfilling than software work will ever be for me. That being said I don’t like the lost time in markets, it’s a big opportunity cost financially.

I could really use some advice. I’m starting a bit later in life in terms of my career because I spent my early 20s traveling the world and experiencing life. I’m thankful I had those years but admittedly feel a bit behind financially now, so need to put in the work over these next years.

Company policy is that you stay for a year, but I just could not stick it out. The work is unorganized and the 2nd level manager who is blocking my transfer is an egomaniac who I’ve noticed the team has a degree of fear for.

I’m being told to stay several more months and can only be released if the 2nd level manager is convinced I “worked hard”. It’s not even clear how my performance is being evaluated at the moment considering the managers thought I was doing well but I can tell the team is annoyed with my performance.

My options are stick it out and hope I met “worked hard” expectations or I can resign and try to rehire as external with my old office. Problem is, it sounds like this second level manager has taken my request to leave personally, and will likely mark me as do not hire if I resign outright, blocking my attempt to get my old job back anyway.

But currently I’m sort of stuck in the middle of nowhere with my parents so it’s not like I’m doing better here. My ultimate goal is being a remote worker/ freelancing so I can travel.

1mrf8b9,Trying to move into sales internally,"I’ve been working as a warranty admin for 2 years at a small-ish boat sales/service company (2 locations, less than 20 employees per location). I’m 34 with a bachelors in education but left teaching over ten years ago to live abroad, been back 2.5 years. A sales position opened up today at my work. Each location has two sales people….i want the job. I’m a single mom to a special needs child who attends a year round day program but that will end 2026 when my kid starts kindergarten. I approached my boss (who started in sales/finance) a month or so ago that I wish to remain with the company but that would require substantial growth in income so I can afford private childcare as daycare isn’t an option. I run my own department and work very very closely with our service writer. Thankfully my boss respects family commitments as he is a single father himself, and he respects that I’m always looking for improvement. He’s on vacation this coming week so I will approach him Tuesday the following week so I’m not overwhelming him on my first day back. Any and all advice is welcomed. Strengths: excellent communications proven, already working on a commission basis, knowledge of the sales/parts/service pipeline at our company, good rapport with existing customers, previous experience owning an hvac business with my ex husband, a reference for a sales positio from my previous employer from when I was a waitress (he’s also a business owner in our community so the owner likely knows him/of him), a proven willingness to do what it takes to be successful in my current position(working from home nights/weekends as needed), my boss likes me. Weaknesses: no previous direct sales experience, currently requiring schedule flexibility around my daughter (which will vastly improve with a pay raise so I can afford childcare), occasionally stumbling over words when uncomfortable in conversation which is a bit of a running joke at work but it’s truly not bad at all and I can work on it, I don’t know that much about boats but in the past few months have made it known and shown that I’m proactively seeking/contriving situations so I can learn more.",Objective-Local7312,1,1.0,0,1755303486,2025-08-16 00:18:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mrf8b9/trying_to_move_into_sales_internally/,8,2025
1mrezut,New IT graduate job advice,"So as the title goes I’m a fresh graduate from UCF with a Bachelor’s in Information Technology. I’ve applied to about 100 jobs so far and I’ve had no success, only about 25 replies, all denials. I just built a fresh personal portfolio site, surprisingly I did it entirely free, server is on AWS free tier, domain is through GitHub student on [name.com](http://name.com), and I started a few personal projects to add to it. All are quite advanced compared to other sites I’ve built, all using vite with flask or node.js backend using scripts to pipeline GitHub pushes, all on AWS, but will cost money if I add more EC2 instances so haven’t added them yet. But I really need some direction because it’s getting quite demeaning to apply to jobs all day and get nothing in return. I know I need to change my resume up quite a bit but it seems okay for now and has been evolving as I apply to jobs and find better resources. Currently I’ve been applying to junior web development, junior software development, and basically any entry level IT position. I just got denied from a tech support level 1 that only pays 40,000 a year and was a little demotivated. I’ve made more money working part time at restaurants in a year than that so I’m thinking about doing that for now. I have not really tried to network because that isn’t really who I am, but I can try. I do not have many certifications, except AWS student ones from school and an IT test out one, but I’m working on security + that I bought through the school. I would love some ideas as I only have 2 months rent left and need something fast. Likely I will find a job outside of the industry for now. I’ve attached my site that has my resume on homepage if anyone would be willing to take a look. Here is link: [kylewhitman.app](https://kylewhitman.app)

1mrevs1,Should I risk or opt for stability?,"Hi I’m 29F. I’ve been in confusion for quite some time now and hope you could give me some insight. I am new to a country to be with my husband so I am starting from scratch. I am an interior designer working for kitchens back in my home country. Thankfully, when I came to the new country, I’ve landed a job in kitchens as well. 

Just a quick context, the job market where I am is difficult for my profession. It is difficult especially for me without experience in the country to get in. When I was looking for a job, I can only count the jobs I applied to. So aside from applying on job ads, I also emailed firms asking if I can be a part of their team. One boutique firm replied and I had a chitchat with them but they said they aren’t in a hurry to get a person but they really pick who they place in the team and wanted to get to know me. I felt grateful they took a chance on me even if I don’t have industry experience in this country. They at least wanted to get to know me.

One week in though, I got a job with a kitchen company I applied for on a job ad and I was really grateful. It was very similar to what I do back home so I am confident that I will make it even after probation. 

Within a month in training to this new company, a firm that I emailed personally came back to me offering me a job. Without that offer, I wouldn’t really be confused since I love my current job with kitchens and I love the people and the work environment though the pay was low. The firm offered me a high pay but more than that, I felt that I would learn a lot in the firm as someone who just landed in the country, I felt this firm would teach me how the process is here in the country. It will broaden my horizons and I could solidify my identity as an interior designer here in the new country. They are giving me 3 months probation and told me from there I could see if I like the firm and if I am also fit for their studio. That for me is a risk. But I felt the growth is immense and setting aside all fears I know I can make it. 

It wasn’t an easy decision for me because I love my current job and I’m starting to settle down there but I told them I was leaving and then they are currently trying to convince me to stay. They are going to counteroffer and get back to me on Monday. 

I’m not really sure what to do. I know when it comes to growth, I can learn a lot in the firm and will bring up my value here as it will widen my options in the future. I feel like I needed go wide again before going deeper or specializing being in a new country. 

They say stick with what you are good at. If I stay in kitchens, I’ll really master it and I know I’ll have the stability. If they counteroffer with a better pay, then I feel one of my problem with low pay will be solved as well. But then I dont know if I should settle or choose growth the firm offers. But then after 3 months, I’m not sure if they will take me in either.

I am a breadwinner back in my home country and I am also building a future with my husband. 

This is such a long story I’m sorry but I definitely would like to hear your thoughts and learn from your experiences. ",mrsluna15,1,1.0,0,1755302575,2025-08-16 00:02:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mrevs1/should_i_risk_or_opt_for_stability/,8,2025
1mrentp,stuck between choosing passion over money,"Hi everyone I want some advice on a decision I have to make, and maybe help others in a similar boat.

The first part is,   
I am currently entering my senior year at nyu majoring in psychology. I have always wanted to use my degree to help people, and had a dream of working for unicef in some form after graduating. I always wanted to work somewhere I could help improve the outcome of lives for children, or engage in research that help to do so, whether through mental health, or just helping children in developing countries. My goal was to do my masters and then work, but I've seen that unicef requires a phd for a lot of roles or years of experience. Also, the pay isn't that great below 6 figures and I would still need to complete higher education and work experience prior.  Unfortunately, I don't know if I have the luxury of doing a Phd route because I have to support my family as well and I don't have the money to not have a stable job. I think i'm also struggling to find a more obtainable job because I've always had a dream of working for unicef, but I want to open myself to other career options that pay well but I don't want to do another 5 years of school. I could intern at unicef, and maybe pursue a phd but I really want to start making decent money to help my family financially, or maybe start a career that has potential to increase in salary. Does anyone have any insights into any other pathways or careers in this area?

The next part are other options that I can do with my undergrad degree in psych, and then pursuing a masters degree in another area to better my chances of getting a higher paid job. I do have a lot of interest in quantitative data, not really coding statistics, spss, data analysis I wouldn't mind a job in. I have thought about doing i/o psych considering it usually just needs a masters and getting into a good company pays 6 figures on entry. I do like the buisness psychology aspecct of consumer behavior, but it isn't my passion in life but I know that is where the money is and it doesn't require a phd. 

I know what I was going into with getting a degree in psychology and I always planned on pursuing graduate studies, but I have had a huge change in family dyanmics and been very finacially unstable and im starting to think phd won't be too obtainable for me, as much as I would like to do it.

just want some insight or advice for this, if anyone has gone through something similar or know of any career choices, I'm open to anything ideas.

1mrcv0f,Constructive dismissal?,"I started with my company 2 years ago. I interviewed for a Director role, met the CEO, received a job offer. Title changed to Senior Manager. I worked with HR and the recruiter, pushing back on why at the final hour the job title changed. Director of HR insisted it was simply a title change due to the structure of the team at that time, and to not worry as I’ll be on the director development path. Nothing to be changed. I have this in writing along with the Director job description.

Was on the path for development. Then cadence changed per my VP. No feedback, I’m doing a good job, received a pay increase. 

Recently most of leadership resigned. Today I was informed they hired a director (role I was interviewed for). CEO was excited to tell me. I reminded him I was interviewed for this role…he tapped danced. Then we chatted about how I need to support and train this person, as well as I’m not being replaced. I said don’t believe I would be as I’ve done a good job (which I have). Then I indicated my job description is the Director one. Needless to say, he was taken aback.
It was awkward and clearly a big misstep on the organization. To be honest, I’ve been managing and doing director projects so I have been in limbo.  Even today he was telling me how I need to look at my team and see if it’s the team to elevate things. Lines blurred again.

I’m in Canada. I’m good in my role, teams like me, and I actually support a lot of multiple departments. Especially since most leadership has left my reach is further. Any thoughts on whether this is constructive dismissal? Not overly sure what I’m going to do as the job market sucks but I’m not happy, and I don’t even know why I wasn’t even considered.  

I remained calm, but I also stood my ground professionally. I’m just not sure where this will lead too.  Thoughts? ",jillm42,1,1.0,1,1755297684,2025-08-15 22:41:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mrcv0f/constructive_dismissal/,8,2025

1mrbno9,Should I leave my the family business?,"Hey everyone! Here’s the story, I hope you enjoy… so when I was 16 I joined my brother’s small business as my first job. He owns a small scale Hemp company/smoke shop business. Started with only $100 and some CBD products. My starting pay at 16 was $12.50 an hour, which at the time was great for me! I worked like 20-25 hours a week so part time. Considering I had no bills, it was perfect! Mind you, the job was fairly easy at this point, I just made sales at one of our locations and did some small office work from time to time. Things have changed…

COVID then hit during 2020 and the cost of living went up exponentially afterwards. My bills increased as I turned 18, having to pay rent, car bills, insurance, food, etc. along with that, my responsibilities at work increased….

I then made an investment that helped skyrocket the businesses growth to a higher level. From only making 100k bet our first year, to this year projecting to hit 275k… while also making personal purchases for the business out of my own pocket, my commitment to this mission is visible. 

I’ve been working there for 5 years now and now only being paid $16 an hour… still only working for 25-35 hours at best. For context, I only made $12/hr when I started… No FullTime…. here in Florida the minimum wage is set to be $14 an hour, so that would make it to where I’m only being paid $2 more an hour for LEGAL MINIMUM WAGE PAY.

I decided to research the average pay for supervisors (not managers) and according to Florida’s average, I should be being paid around 18-$20 an hour, and most jobs offer benefits, tips, pto etc. my current job offers none of those. 

Now my role has changed to “supervisor” yet I have the responsibilities of one who is a manager. I manage two stores, do marketing events, social media advertising and manufacturing of our products.. I completely manage most operation aspects of the stores, including our other employee.. 

I decided it was time to request a raise…I handed my brother a raise proposal to something more appropriate to my pay rate for this position, considering the average pay for a store manager is $20/hr in my area, and he said “he’d think about it, and I’ll have an answer on monday”… 

Monday rolls by and at the end of the shift, I bring it up to him and see what he says, and he says “I haven’t had a chance to think about it” So the search begins, I’ve been interviewing several jobs and finding other places that not only pay more but offer benefits. At my current job I have ZERO BENEFITS, no tips, no commission, NOTHING. 

A week goes by and he finally came up with an answer, to which he offered me $18 an hour and more hours… But not what I initially asked for, and said I needed to further prove myself to be able to be paid more. He said that I shouldn’t be paid more than he does, which me knowing the information I know about the businesses finances, I know this is simply not true. If he paid himself $2500 a month, then how could he afford an apartment that’s 1750 in rent, a child, food, bills, and other expenses, including a gambling budget. He frequently travels to Vegas, Europe, and other places around the United States, and somehow still has money left over. We also got a credit loan from our grandmother, and it was supposed to be used for business debt, but after he received this credit, he coincidentally went on a trip to Jamaica and spent $8000 out of the 15,000 that came in. To me, I feel like I’m being lied to, and the Business is being used to fuel only his wants and not much of mine. Considering it’s just me and him and one other employee , it’s not like we have a giant workforce or high overhead costs. when, I am over here, still living with my parents, and can’t make much ends meet, without using credit cards. I’ve sat down with him and broken out all of my bills, to him and showed him what happens with the money that I get for my paychecks, and 95% of it goes to bills, food, gas, etc. leaving no money for saving or personal money.

I’m wanting to stay, but I feel like I’m just hoping for a miracle at this point… the thing that makes this Hard is that he relies on me for most of the businesses operations and he’s a fulltime dad and business owner. Which in itself can be very stressful, I love him but when it comes to making ends meet, I need to be paid more, and the industry is paying wayyy more to the same position. I want to be able to elevate my career, and take my entrepreneurial mindset to higher levels, and to be able to support myself and have my own place to stay what do I do?

I at least need verbal approval to book flight tickets. but he has not replied yet. I can see he saw my message but left me on read. I have not taken any vacation in 2 years and already made sure my teammates would be here entire time I would be off. Manager is remote and haven't talked to our team in more than a year.

1mrargk,"Thought I landed my dream job with a millionaire real estate developer, but it turned into a nightmare. How do I recover and build the career I want?","I’m 28F, spent most of my working life bartending/nightlife but wanted OUT. I dreamed of something stable, higher-paying, and connected to real estate.
While training at a bar, I served a man who turned out to be the owner. I told him I was new to real estate investing (I’d done two flips with a hard money loan) and wanted to grow. He said he was a real estate developer with big connections, offered me $4K/month as his executive assistant, plus commissions. I thought I’d hit the jackpot — finally a chance to network with powerful people and build a career.
Reality check: The job was basically me trailing him around to nice restaurants, talking to his rich friends, and looking good on his arm. Then he made an unwanted advance (he’s married, late 50s). I shut it down, asked for professional boundaries… and suddenly my bartending shifts were gone, he was late paying me, and eventually he ghosted — still owes me 2 weeks’ pay.
To top it off, the marketing guy I briefly worked under was also a creep who FaceTimed me “just to see how pretty I looked.”
Now I’m broke, behind on bills, and questioning if every job outside nightlife is like this. I have:
Licensed esthetician (worked at European Wax Center)
Years bartending/serving (clubs, nightlife, dive bars)
Sales experience (tanning packages, upsells)
Basic real estate investing experience
I want: ~$6K/month, some freedom/flexibility, to use my people skills and interest in ownership/sales. Working on getting my real estate license but I need immediate income and a path that won’t trap me back in nightlife.
What industries or roles could actually get me there within a year? Or am I being unrealistic?",Diosababy,26,0.9200000166893005,26,1755292843,2025-08-15 21:20:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mrargk/thought_i_landed_my_dream_job_with_a_millionaire/,8,2025

1mr92xc,Interested in career pivot via grad school - how would you tell your org you want to stay until you leave?,"33M, mid seniority in an education consulting org for the past 5 years. Consulting has taught me a whole lot in terms of both educational issues and landscape, as well as professionalism and being a productive employee. However it’s also a million times less rewarding than when I was working directly with schools, students, communities. Considering a career pivot to school counseling which requires specific certifications and in most cases grad degrees. No way in hell can I afford grad school without gainful employment… but there are evening and part time programs available. However if accepted into those, I feel like I gotta tell my employer to 1) cover my bases, and 2) set their expectations on work load and capacity while in grad school. Not a lot benefits for them in this set up though, other than not having to hire and onboard yet another new team member. The content and skills just aren’t transferable across these two career paths, I wouldn’t be able to apply much from grad school to my current scope of work.

I (31F) have just about 3.5 years experience in a niche field in aerospace.

Which turns out is a night shift with lots of visual helps. By the time I realize realized all of this my performance deteriorated significantly in both jobs. I will admit in the first job my performance was my fault. And I will admit in the second position I applied and was accepted to a job that was outside of my scope of know how and spent my entire time there trying to play catch up while managing my ADHD. I will also admit that there were some performance issues whose lessons clicked it o place at the very end of the second job. I really like this field and I feel really embarrassed that it took me so long to figure out what works for me. 

I'm terrified that I'm not going to get hired again because my field is so niche It's a Small World especially in the region where I live in regards to this field. I'm terrified I'm not going to get another chance to prove that I learned my lessons and that I'm going to fall into the same habits despite having better management techniques and better Lessons Learned. 

Additionally, I talked at length with my brother and he brought up the fact that how he and I were raised in our childhood with our parents put us at a disadvantage for professional behavior in the workplace in the emotional aspect and I'm very positive that that contributed to my performance issues as well.

1mr7s4j,My boss want me to always be available even during meetings and don't let me say no.,"Hi everyone. Using a throwaway account just in case.

So I'm having an issue with my supervisor/boss which is overwhelming me day by day.

So I'm currently a student coordinator for a college. We have an open door policy where our door should be always be open unless you are in a meeting or during lunch time. I've been doing exactly that, my door are always open unless it is lunch time or during a meeting, which usually include discussing a student's situation, for which close the door due to info privacy issue. The problem comes in when aside from serving the students, I have totake on 5+ projects at anytime, which results in me having 3+ hours of meeting everyday, including regular staffs meeting (these meetings are non-negotiable, even if I find them uneccessary). At first, I got my boss' permission to close my office door during these times due tothe sensitive nature of them. However, after a few months, my boss basically come down to me for having my door closed, even though he has my full work schedule, and are aware of the sensitive nature of the meetings, which both of us discussed. He wanted me to have the door open even during those meeting, which I obliged. Then a few months later, he wanted me to have my door closed during the meetings because ... info privacy. We have been having this conversation a few time for a while now, with the worse of it being the top brasses (including him) suggestings staffs be available during lunch time for students.

My boss also have a tendency (or should I say ""policy"") where he doesn't want his staffs to say no to helping coworkers or take on work (even if it's not a ""no""). The first time I actually refused helping someone, what I said was ""I'm currently having these priorities (list them out), and they are neccessary for the college and students, so I can't help you at the moment, but I will happy to help you at a later time if I'm not as busy"". Mind you, that was the first time I refuse to help, and I have been helping my colleagues with work before that. I was talked down by my boss because I failed to collect ""goodwill credit"" (aka assisting colleagues) so we could ask them for help later. After awhile, another request came through my boss, again when I was having extra responsibilities. I didn't really said no, but ""I'm having these tasks & projects which were assigned by you and upper-managements, if I were to take on this tasks, I will need to let go one of these tasks to ensure I can complete them by schedule and they can succeed. Again, I was reminded of the ""goodwill credit"", that everyone is also busy so they can't take on this tasks, and that we need to keep a good image for the team. After a few times, at this point, I find it impossible to refuse, because if I do, I still have to do it with some talk down. All of this has reached the point where I'm extremely stressed, overwhelmed,and have to see a psychiatrist for medicines.

Maybe I'm just ranting here, maybe I'm a bad person for having all these thought, but I think I just need some help here.",ShotTitle7426,2,0.75,5,1755286189,2025-08-15 19:29:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mr7s4j/my_boss_want_me_to_always_be_available_even/,8,2025
1mr7ct0,They plan to lay her off but I want to quit,"Hi, I’m a corporate recruiter at a firm I plan on leaving in the near future. Business is slow and so they’re intending to lay off our other recruiter on Monday. 

I really like this firm. I love our team. However, I work entirely remote and the lack of in-person interaction is starting to fuck with my brain, hence my wanting to leave. That said, I don’t want to fuck anyone over. Why have her get laid off if I’m planning to leave — she could just keep her job. If I stay, I will invariably leave them without a recruiter later this fall, when they’ll likely really need one. I’ll be screwing several people over.

That said, I’d also be screwing myself over by quitting right now. While I’ve submitted some applications and I have a large network, I don’t have anything lined up. Jumping ship without a safety net sounds dumb as fuck, but I really don’t want to burn any bridges. 

Do I let them lay her off, quit later, and leave them recruiterless?

1mr5f95,"Recruiter reaches out, you respond, they don't...what's your next move?","TL;DR: Recruiter reached out for a highly desirable career thru text on same day application was submitted, responded confirming my interest 6 hours later (was sleeping, work on 3rd shift, mentioned this to them as well) have not heard back yet (4 days later), whats the move?

A bit of the backstory here to indicate my desperation, I'll try to keep it brief; In December last year, I was fired from my kitchen job (new ownership took over and cleaned house) ending my 7 year career in the restaurant industry, which started when I was in high school. After that, I decided it was time to switch something with a bit more stability, actual benefits, and a consistent schedule with most weekends off, but I had to move quick because the bills don't pay themselves, and I live in the rust belt so the obvious choice was auto manufacturing. Long story short, I ended up at a plant that makes windows, and for several reasons, its a terrible job lol, like terrible even given the already low standards of non unionized manufacturing jobs. I'm desperate to get out, but I'm not sure if I'm desperate enough to go back into the unforgiving line cook life, but I've been given a potential out, albeit its a slim chance, but it's not impossible.

There is an aerospace manufacturer right down the road from my house, I'm fascinated by that industry, but I'm even more fascinated at how well they pay, how good the benefits are, and the amount of people who remain in the job for decades. I'm aware of how desirable of a career it is given all these reasons I want it, so it's an uphill battle to actually get in, but I decided it was worth a shot to apply. I submitted my resume and went through the application process on their website, and wasn't expecting to hear back right away, if at all.

Well, I heard back the same day, but the circumstances aren't looking great. I submitted my app. around 9am, I work 3rd shift at this auto shop (11pm-7am), and it was Tuesday, so shortly after that I got to bed. I woke up around 8;30 and saw I got a text from a recruiter at the aerospace plant at about 2:00, and in short it said ""hey there, we tried to call and we're reaching out to confirm your interest so we know how to proceed, we look forward to hearing back from you"" (I did not have any missed calls, so I'm not sure if I buy that first part) I responded right when I saw it despite business hours being long gone, I apologized for the late response and said I was interested, and I sent a second text 2 minutes later explaining I'm on 3rd and I'm easiest to reach in the morning hours.

It's Friday afternoon while I'm typing this out and I haven't heard back, I know from experience how common it is for stuff like this to happen, but I'm not sure I should just let it dead end like this, it happens a lot but that would suck. So, that being said, what should my next move be? Do I demonstrate some patience and wait a bit longer? Try sending another text during business hours reaffirming my interest? Let it slide, and try applying again in a few weeks/months? Take it as a sign they don't want me? Go fuck myself? Threaten them and say I'm gonna hurt myself unless they get back to me?

1mr4t2q,Inappropriate Conversation about Gender/Culture,"I am trying to figure out how to deal with this.

Background: I have been at this job for less than 3 months and have been butting heads with my direct supervisor frequently. I have spoken with our manager about this multiple times and he says he doesn't really want to be involved.

Today a coworker came to help for half the day and she seemed pleasant at first. I then hear her making jokes about drugs and drinking etc which is unprofessional but not a huge deal. What made me freeze in place though was her bringing up a family member traveling to Asia soon. 

I was working on paperwork for a client and she was having a conversation with my supervisor and another coworker, right next to me, so I heard the whole thing.

She brings up how she warned him about ""ladyboys"" in Asia (I feel weird just typing this) and how he is going to be surprised by their downstairs and her and the other two were laughing and making jokes about it. I felt so caught offguard and uncomfortable that I just froze up. I should have said something in the moment but it was so crazy to me that she would feel bold enough to say those things but also that the other two just went along with it.

I don't really feel comfortable bringing it up to my supervisor and now I'm worried our manager won't even address it or will downplay it.

I haven't worked with this employee who initiated the conversation before, so I couldn't say if it is a pattern or anything but I know that would be HRs job to investigate anyways.

Bleh. I have already been applying to other jobs but this just reinforced me wanting to gtfo.

I also don't know how to contact HR outside of work, and it would be very obvious if I was to make a call from my desk phone. Is an email to HR the answer?

I usually let jokes/insults slide in the workplace just because i dont want to create a bigger issue.

Some person who i have never met before contacted me via teams with a very rude approach and demanded me to unlock it immediately because he needed to use it. And i replied saying i had it locked because i am fixing an issue and i should be done soon. I stepped out of my desk to go to a meeting for about 35mins.

He sent 6 messages while i was gone and said i do not have manners because i didn’t explain to him why i had it locked.( i did tell him why i had it locked).

I lost my cool and i responded with the same “energy” explaining that i had already told him why i had it locked and needed to fix this by COB. Little did i know he was a higher up lol.
I just didnt think someone with that type of rude approach would be someone with a high position.

He never replied and i dont go back to the office until monday. I only had it locked for 55minutes.

I regret doing what i did and dont know what to expect since its my first time losing my cool in a job.

As part of my severance package I had to train my replacements in Asia. I did my job got my package and got another job in the same industry which is pretty niche. 

Fast forward a few months, my new job just told us they may go into partnership with my old job to assist with clients in the US. 

Here’s where I get worried. My severance agreement states ‘ Employee waives any future association, employment, contractual
relationship, or any other relationship of any kind with any Released Party and agrees not to apply to any Released
Party for employment or a contractual relationship.‘ 

My current gig has treated me well and I would hate for this to become an issue but I’m also worried about legal repercussions. ",RoutineAccident483,1,1.0,0,1755277180,2025-08-15 16:59:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mr3n87/am_i_overthinking/,8,2025

1mr2tla,I regret leaving my last job and want to boomerang back. How should I go about this?,"Hi everyone,

I just started a new position this week as a website product manager after working for 3+ years as a website CMS expert and scrum master. The career move made sense on paper and came with a small pay bump and benefits like a salary and 401k as apposed to hourly contract work. However, I have profound regret over leaving now for a few reasons:

* I was well-respected at my last job and was told by both the company and staffing agency that the door is wide open if I want to return. They said people often ""boomerang"" back to the company and that rehires are welcomed with open arms. They said they would keep me in mind for any full time roles that come up down the road, but they also said I wouldn't be the first person to leave and ask to come back if the new role wasn't a good fit. They also gave me the option to change my mind during the two week notice period, but after a public send off I felt it would have been unprofessional to back track so I committed to this decision. I made sure to leave on great terms with everyone and make the transition as smooth as possible.
* Both my last role and current role were fully remote. But in order to be converted to full time at my previous company, I would need to move to the bay area from the midwest. I have a house so that would be tricky to sell or rent out. If I wanted to remain remote I would have stayed as an hourly contractor. I have asthma and was told I should plan to move to southern California eventually. I asked the new company if I was free to move anywhere due to my asthma and they said yes, but now they are saying that they want me to remain close to the east coast and potentially move to the New York/New Jersey area. For my health it seems like staying in my last role, even though hourly as a contractor, was the smarter move.

I am going to stick it out for at least a month to see how things go, but I am seriously considering reaching back out to my old manager. Headcount and budget restrictions might prevent them from hiring me back even if they wanted to, but my manger and other leadership's comments about being welcomed back gave me some hope.

How should I go about this given my situation?",No-Today-2459,1,1.0,0,1755275392,2025-08-15 16:29:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mr2tla/i_regret_leaving_my_last_job_and_want_to/,8,2025

1mr2bw9,New job is asking to push up the start date,"I recently accepted a job offer to begin on 9/15. When I interviewed with HR they asked if I would need more than two weeks before I start, I told them I would need to give 4 weeks notice, and they told me that would be fine. I did my interview with the hiring manager and it went great and I was given an offer. The date was listed as 9/8, and I replied asking if the start date can be 9/15 so I can give 4 weeks notice. They replied and said yes, and I accepted. They sent me the official offer letter, and I signed that, and formally submitted my resignation to my current employer. Now they are telling me that they want me to start on the 8th, and have repeatedly asked after I told them I will not be able to start before the 15th.

I am panicking a little. Since I have signed the offer letter they sent me, am I entitled to anything if they rescind it?

1mr264x,Internal Job Rejections,"I have been at my current job for just under 5 years. I am in a position that requires a high school degree, but I have a Bachelors. My role focuses on clerical work, data entry, and helping the public. Some say it’s a glorified receptionist role. I am not happy in my role due to lack of tasks, and poor management. This position is in local government for a department under 100 people. 

About two years ago I applied for another position, that was similar to my role but is an admin assistant position. It included purchasing and payroll, which I do not have experience in. However, current employees in that role did not have prior experience in those aspects. I was hyped up for basically “having the job” prior to my interview, but was denied the position. I was told it was due to a lack of experience. I totally understand that, I was upset only because I got my hopes up from other coworkers. Ultimately, they gave me more tasks due to my complaints of being bored. This only lasted on year though, since they hired a part time person and gave them all my tasks. 

Fast forward to now, I apply for another position and am denied again. This is a more technical position but I was told ONCE again that I would be a great fit. Upon my rejection, it was extremely personal and so vague to the point that I questioned what they meant. They told me that they want someone with more specific experience in this role. They had no negative comments on my interview or their experience working with me. Their first pick ended up not working out. Now they are interviewing more people, and one has the same experience that I do. They are younger than I am and only graduated college last year. 

I was the only internal applicant for both positions. 

So my question is, how does this look from an outside perspective? I understand if I don’t have enough experience, but when they look more into people without that experience, it feels like there is something wrong with me as an employee. However, I have never been told that I am a poor employee. I have good performance reviews and get along with everyone. Is it worth leaving? 

TLDR; I was rejected for two internal positions due to lack of experience, however, the perspective hires have similar experience to me. Is this common?

1mr1wra,Law student lost in life,"I finished my last year at law school 2 months ago, but I still have exams to take since I didn't pass all of them. I choosed law back then because it seemed that I would like to study about it and I was right. I love to go classes and read from the professor's books, but since I did it for myself not the grades and exams I ended up in this situation.
The thing is even though I should study for the exams that are in 2 weeks from now I don't do it and I am stressed for what career I should go for. But after 4 years of law school I realised that I do not want to be a lawyer or a judge or prosecutor. I don't want to work 10+ hours 5 days a week. I think my health and well being are the most important things and that does not aline with this jobs where you live in stress and surrounded by big egos persons. I don't judge them or the system or how this field work is just that I realised I don't want to spend my life like this. Money and social status was never a thing for me and giving up of my life just to work even though I like law it is not for me. I didn't dream all of my life to be a lawyer, I found out about this job in the last year of highschool. :)
So I search for ideas of jobs. I would like to do something with my hands not to spend 8 hours sitting on the chair, but I am still open if is a job that I would like. Is just that I don't know how to find jobs other than the ones that everyone talks about cause I am sure there are a lot of them but most of us don't know.
I want to feel that I help someone, that I give back the help that I got, especially in this world where the poor people who think that don't have a chance in this world are becoming more and more day by day. Or the kids abandoned by their parents, or the victims of domestic violence. Can you work at a ONG or just volunteer? I also think about working as a front desk at a medical clinic and just volunteer and keep learning languages like english and korean.
Do you have any ideas? 😔

1mr0mhf,Recently Laid Off But At A Cross Road,"Hi everyone! I am F[25] and I recently was laid off from my associate role at a nonprofit organization due to restructuring and an overhaul of the entire mission of the organization. I wouldn't say that the job was my dream, I actually really did not enjoy it and so being laid off (with severance) felt like a hidden blessing; mixed emotions of relief but also mourning the loss of something familiar. 

I have been unemployed for 2 weeks now, and as I begin thinking about the future, as well as the state of the current job market, I feel crazy for wanting to be intentional with my next role. I'm not just looking for a job, I'm looking to build my career and whenever I bring this up to others they seem to be confused, as if to say I should probably just rush to find a job.

I don't want this next job to be led with the energy of fear; I want the next role and organization to feel right which was the mistake I made with my current role - I rushed.

A part of me wants to explore independent projects, as well as giving myself perhaps until the end of severance to have some time to myself and to see what better opportunities both financially and title wise might come up instead of staying comfortable in the same kinds of roles and limits I've placed on myself. 

For context, I have a pretty good amount of savings and I live at home, I do not have any real responsibilities besides my dog who I take care of financially, but other than that, this feels like (contrary to the state of the job market) the right time for me to actually pursue my passions, to take some risk, and to think about being intentional. 

Side note: I am also thinking of applying to MPA programs in the meantime. At this moment in time I want to stay in the public sector, but it kind of feels like the clock is running out for me to go to grad school IDK 😐 that's another dilemma I'm dealing with

Mostly my fault, I know - I have a severe case of rbf and I'm quiet, but I've been working with these people for years, they KNOW that's not all there is to me.

Today at work I really couldn't take it anymore and I asked my boss if I could go home, trying to hold back tears all the while (didn't work btw if that wasn't obvious). He looked concerned but allowed me to go. But then wrote to me on teams afterward telling me I should talk to him if it's work related. And the HR lady also wrote to me saying my boss told her what happenned and she would like a meeting with me to talk about it.

I've been crying all afternoon.

I've been (severely) depressed for many years but I was holding on until my coworkers made it plain they don't like me (which, to be clear, I am perfectly aware is their right and they owe me nothing). But this has been completely wrecking what little of me was still holding together.

I know HR isn't there to help me, but to help the company. But I still kinda want to tell her how excluded I feel. Just so SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE will know. I dom't expect or even want anything to change, I just want someone to know why I've been feeling like this.

Should I tell the HR lady the truth?

I’m 32, based in mumbai, and I spent the last 7 years at Accenture working as a content moderator. I used to take home about ₹46k/month. Unfortunately, things dried up in that space and I’ve been without a job for a while now.

I’ve been looking into switching careers into the KYC / compliance field — specifically roles like KYC analyst doing global screening, CDD, and EDD for entities.

Problem is… I have no direct KYC experience, and I’m honestly not sure where to start.

I’m hoping to get some help with:
	•	Roadmap: What skills/certs I should get to make myself hireable.
	•	Where to apply: Which companies in India actually hire for KYC/CDD/EDD roles.
	•	Pay expectations: Since I was on 46k before, what’s realistic to ask for as someone “new” in this field?
	•	Strategy: Should I go straight for banks or start with BPO/KPO firms that service them?

If you’ve made this kind of switch, or you work in KYC/AML, I’d really appreciate your advice — even just a list of companies to look at or tips on how to position myself.

Thanks a ton in advance.

I really enjoy working remotely and the benefits are great. However, I was just offered a Senior Data Science role with about a $20k salary increase, but it is hybrid.

My dilemma:

\- I don't have much data science experience so imposter syndrome will loom large.

\-I am more passionate about Data Engineering (DE) and have been learning DE skills in my free time for the past year or so.

\-Senior DS title and salary increase are tempting but I am worried it might take me off my DE learning path.

\-I love the flexibility of my current role and I am beginning to take on some more DE related job tasks as well.

\-I also do not currently have a reliable vehicle, so I will have to spend some money on that as well if the hybrid role is chosen.

\-My current company has higher turnover while the company that offered me the new position has a much lower turnover.

If you were me, would you:

1.Take the DS role for the pay bump and title, even if its not my long-term passion, and keep trying to break into DE (Maybe later than I would like)?

2. Stay in my current role and continue building DE skills/projects to target DE jobs in the future?

Also might have undiagnosed ADHD so mind is my mind is racy and only settles with stimulating work.

Been getting to the realization I might be a much bigger of a loser than I appear now at 40. On paper knowing enough about excel and automation should put me ahead of most of the pack higher up than me who output manual spreadsheets that take entire work days. Am I not advocating for myself loudly enough? On the other hand, I feel years of wasting away my potential has gotten me set in my own bad ways and habits (I've long realized this but still struggle with untangling the clutter in my head as I've never done this type of work long enough). At 40 it feels like I should be doing more self-advocating alongside the continuous upskilling. Had I been doing this at 25 I'd have been well on my way on a different trajectory. Managers see the same pattern from a younger version and see potential. At 40, you just look useful with little to no upside. Should I just keep plugging away and find an environment that recognizes me during the interview stage? Is it a waste of time to change minds after you've been contracted for work you feel is beneath you now?

After months of rejections and silence, I recently spoke with two career coaches to see if some expert help could make a difference. One coach charges $1,200 for their program while the other offered two options: $2,200 and $4,000, with a promise to work with me for up to six months or until I got a job offer. Both seemed legit during our strategy calls, and I contacted some of their previous clients who all had very positive things to say about their experiences.

But I’m stuck on whether it’s actually worth it to invest this much when I’m unemployed and every dollar counts. I couldn’t find any established coaches below $1,000, and even though the pricey coach said she’d be with me until I landed an offer, I’m skeptical about how much anyone can actually guarantee results with the current job market—especially for roles requiring visa sponsorship.

So, has anyone here actually paid for a career coach and felt it was worth the investment? Did having help from a coach really make a difference in getting interviews or offers? Would you recommend coaching for someone in my position, or did you find any more affordable alternatives that actually work? And how did you know which coach to trust? I’d really appreciate honest feedback or advice—good, bad, or tough love. I want to make the right call and not just spend money out of desperation.

1mqsmz2,"Help please! On the verge of crisis, can't afford a break and can't afford losing the opportunity either!","TL;DR: Need to switch job within probation due to Instability in new org.

Hey good folks of the community!

I've been working for past 3.5 years at a product based company, where I had a wonderful time. Just last month, I got a good opportunity and took the decision to accept it.

But things have taken a slightly different turn as they always do in life. My new org where I joined barely a month ago, had laid off bunch of their employees just by saying that we're restructuring. Now I didn't know about this and only got to know once I read the messages sent on public channels.

Not only this, some of their founding members were let go and that too without even finding a replacement for them. Then, I myself have seen 3 of the senior/important folks leave.

Now after seeing all of this my natural reaction was to look for a new opportunity once again and thankfully I did get a call from one of my dream company where I had previously applied to, when I was on the lookout for a job switch.

But after clearing almost all the rounds, when I told the HR about my current situation, she mentioned it being a red flag and not sure what would happen in next rounds or how this would be taken by their hiring team.

I agree I should have told this a little earlier but I thought this can happen with anyone in their career and honestly have heard about these situations a lot. 

I've got only 1 major HR round left now, where I need to somehow prove that all of this scenario is circumstantial and I can't wait till my current org tells me to leave.
This was my 2nd switch in a journey of nearly 5 years.

Please guys!  help me tackle this situation, I know it won't be the end of the world but some opportunities do come once in a while.

Thanks!",Purple_Ad_3671,1,1.0,0,1755249627,2025-08-15 09:20:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mqsmz2/help_please_on_the_verge_of_crisis_cant_afford_a/,8,2025
1mqskvc,Career Progression vs Remote 24hrs to decide,"I have offers from 2 jobs and about 24hrs to decide. 

Both are offering approx $100K USD for a senior software engineer role (frontend) which is pretty much top market rate where I live. 

Company A was recently valued at 1.5Billion and is offering an additional $100K USD in share options vested over 4 years. This role is an onsite in office every day role and they said they are eager to make me a manager once I’ve gotten situated in the role. (This comes with a $10k pay increase). I love that they believe in me and want to make me a manager but onsite work every day and a reputation for management working people really hard is off putting. 

Company B is fully remote and has a much more relaxed work life balance and less overtime required. It has less responsibilities so there isnt the same manager progression possibilities or career development. Also no share options, but it’s still great pay and I love remote work and the time I save not having to sit in traffic and the comfort of my own space.

I don’t know if the possible career progression benefits out weigh the freedom of remote work. Also share options from company A could amount to something.

 * Resume & Career Path Feedback: I've attached my anonymized resume below. Based on my experience, do you think I'm targeting the right roles? I would be incredibly grateful for any constructive feedback on how to make my resume stronger and better position myself for these fields.
 * Networking & Referrals: If my background seems like it could be a good fit for a role at your company, I would sincerely appreciate any leads, connections, or potential referrals.
Thank you so much for your time and for any advice you can offer. I'm looking forward to reading your thoughts!

1mqqild,Put on PIP and I quit did I make the right call?,"I was with a start up and we were all new. My manager was fired and I had no work. Finally after a year I got a sad pay raise that was like 2k and no promotion. They tended to hire outside people with experience well my last manager was fired within a year and I didn’t know things she was teaching me was not their way. I went to my main manager but received no direction that I needed to be retaught on certain things. Or job duties. 

They got a new client and reassigned me again to a new manager and promoted two coworkers to managers.

1) I was told the wrong hours and finally by July I had to redo my timesheets 4 times bc they didn’t tell me the correct hours for billing. But they now are preaching they never said did this bc the meeting nor emails documented this. 

2) I asked for help bc I got thrown on a new project and I made the mistake of asking my boss if I could bill certain  hours for the notes bc I was drowning

3) my new manager who was my prior coworker has been so anal about minor things : my writing and she complained about me numerous times to ‘my direct manager. Not once when I requested feedback did she give it and she had called me stupid and idiot on calls. She ignored me on teams. Recently she accused me of not transferring table over so I sent the screenshots of the document trail. But of course my managers  don’t respond. 

3) I got hit with a low evaluation score due to these issues and they put me on PIP.My prior managers who were fired had no issues with my writing. I asked my current one why wasn’t I told this before or given warning and he grew quiet when I questioned one time infractions and the emails I asked for help in

4) they were being so helpful and checking my work (finally) but then lo and behold I was told I’d receive a promotion based on my first year.

5) paycheck came thru and it was nothing. Everyone else was promoted and I feel slapped in the face. 

6) I finally quit and only HR and not one of my managers has contacted me. 

I’ve been told they were planning on firing me for awhile but I guess this is it.

Was this the right call? I don’t have another job to follow up with but I couldn’t stay a minute there now

1mqpzzj,need some future career advice as a high schooler,"I don't know where to ask so all I'll js say is that I'm a girl who is hella indecisive on everything, including my future. I'm an upperclassman where a lot of ppl are now REALLY asking ""what career do you want to pursue?"" ""what college do you want to go to?"" And I simply don't know what I want 🤷‍♀️. I also wanna mention that I live in socal and wanna stay here, it could be an important factor which may affect your guys’ answers. (idk tho thats why I need advice)

I would prefer to pursue something within “arts” or “film.” Whether it’s video production or animation, hell i’ll consider acting, I would not be against having a job like that. But my mom wants me to pursue something in the medical field, and honestly she will not take a no for an answer. Doesn’t help the fact that every female family relative I know is somehow in the medical field. But I know she wants what’s best for me so I can have a secure & stable future. That makes sense since it has benefits and good money. But I have NO passion and interest for any sort of that stuff what-so-ever, and having to dedicate my whole life to work JUST for money seems like hell to me. I want to take something else, like how my brother majored in comp sci (ik job market is bad, but i feel happy for him no matter what). I also want to break the cycle and be the one who won’t pursue that career. I want to work in something for passion AND money, which it seems like for me is near impossible. AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER, I’m not too passionate, like crazy passionate for anything really, unless you include the crazy passion of not wanting to be in the medical field. Anyways, here’s a pros and cons list of both:

Medical Field:

\-I would hate it

\+Good money & stable future

\-Did not break the cycle

\-Studying in that field would DRAIN me

Film Industry:

\+I would love it

\-Money situation seems risky

\+Would actually be passionate to study for it

\-Industry seems bad right now (like with strikes and AI)

\-A chance that I lose passion for it because it’s now *work* and not a hobby.

Like I said, I’m indecisive. A part of me says to go all in on my passion, while another part of me would only *consider* the other path. So what is it that I should do and/or consider?

At first, I was happy but as time as gone on, I am very burnt out. From struggling to meet my metrics, dealing with higher ups etc I'm very stressed out and depressed.

The worst part of all of this is that my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's two years ago, which has even fuled the overwhelming feelings of sadness and stress. My mom was the most important person in my life and to watch that fade away right infornt of me is a pain I can't even describe, especially since my mom is so young to be going through this. 

With all of this being said, I've been struggling with finding a better fit. The one upside to sales is fact that the commission structure is something that really helps my income and while I don't want to be in sales anymore, I just don't know what type of a role I can get that supports me in the way that my current one does. But all I want is something fulfilling, low stress and can pay somewhat decently. I'm not dating I have to make six figures but $18 an hour is not going to cut it. 

I don't really have friends or any social connections I can inquire with, so that part is also a bit challenging because I know a big part of getting a job is all about who you know.

I’m a 23F currently working in a small-to-medium sized product-based company in Kochi. I have 2 years of experience in Java Spring Boot and graduated with a CSE BTech.

The problem is — even after 2 years, I don’t feel very confident in coding. Most of my work so far has been bug fixes and smaller tasks, often switching between teams, so I never got deep into a single product. Now I’m in a team where I’m finally getting hands-on work, but I’m slow compared to expectations. The team culture is also pretty toxic — late nights are common, and I take more time to finish even small tasks because I’m still learning.

To be honest, I don’t even enjoy coding much — I’ve been doing it mainly for the salary and because I don’t have skills in other fields yet.

I’m now considering two options:

1. Prepare for the Bank SO IT Officer exam.


2. Try to switch to another company and see if things improve.



I’m confused about which path would be better for me in the long run. If anyone has experience in either field, I’d really appreciate your guidance.

It is EXPENSIVE to be disabled. 

My health has been improving and I am trying to get back into the workforce (let's just say that our marriage isn't working out and that my spouse is ""jealous"" of the time I have at home - go figure). 

My biggest obstacle to employment is in-person work. I am immunocompromised due to my treatments and I have extreme fatigue, sleep disturbances and severe joint pain (inflammatory arthritis). I could do in-person work if I had a 10 min commute and a 11 AM start time. Alas...

While my passion is to get into a people-oriented field, such as an employment counselor or a vocational rehabilitation specialist, in-person requirements for these types of jobs make me very wary. 

I have a background in analytics, and I'll admit that I find it incredibly boring and unstimulating. However, the last remaining opportunities for remote work seem to lie in this domain. 

What would you all do if you were in my situation? Go for a remote BI analyst job and ""deal with it"" or keep looking for a job in a field that I'd enjoy? 

Going back to school is a third option. But, too exhausting for now. I'm just trying to survive. ",Beneficial_Tree7723,1,1.0,2,1755238333,2025-08-15 06:12:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mqpcre/disabled_returning_to_work_and_need_your_advice/,8,2025
1mqpbbp,should i take the job offer,"I’m 23(M) living in the UAE, graduated in BBA Marketing about a year ago. I’ve been applying for marketing and HR roles and recently got a marketing job offer (6 months probation). On paper it looks fine, but I felt uncomfortable with the culture after visiting — I’d be the only Arab there, and I read about a lot of politics and layoffs.

I currently work at my university as a library intern (also help with marketing), which is peaceful and covers basic expenses. I’ve been getting steady interviews lately, so I feel I could find a better offer. My family says if I’m not comfortable, don’t go. My manager says I can keep learning marketing skills here.

Should I take the offer for the experience, or hold out for something better?",AlaaMazin,1,1.0,0,1755238208,2025-08-15 06:10:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mqpbbp/should_i_take_the_job_offer/,8,2025
1mqp2ph,Creepy GM replacing me after I set boundaries. Should I go to HR?,"I’ll try to keep this short.

I recently found out I’m getting replaced. The only “reason” I can think of is that my General Manager is a creep, and I have a spine — I set strong boundaries and call him out when he’s inappropriate.

Nothing that would immediately get him fired (and I didn’t keep records, my mistake), but here are some examples:

-Commenting that he hired me because I’m good at my job and pretty

- Showing me his dating profile

- Hiring a “shot girl” for a company event and telling me to make sure she’s “dressed sexy and in fishnets”

-Talking about how lonely he is and asking me to help him meet someone.

- Constantly talking about women, what they look like, what he prefers, ect. 


Each time, I told him to knock it off and that it was inappropriate. I never let him get away with a single comment and made it clear that it was unprofessional.

For context: HQ is in another state. When I started in January, there were zero processes in place. I figured everything out and built the systems from scratch. I stayed because I was in a bad headspace, and the nonstop work kept me distracted. I’m in a better place now and ready to leave… but I’m angry.

Now he wants to bring in my replacement and have me train them in the systems I built. The only reason I can think of is that I don’t tolerate his behavior.

So, what would you do?

Keep my head down, job hunt quietly, and if I get fired first, so be it? (I'm very lucky to be financially stable currently. Getting fired will not hurt me immediately)

Or finally go to HR and file a complaint, knowing another one already exists against him (though the last one went nowhere)?

1mqjjet,Am I not fit for the role? or do I just need more time?," am a newly graduated student with two degrees. I got really lucky with a finding a job in my field. The pay and benefits aren't where I want them but I didn't have any internships because I had to work almost full time to pay for school and housing as a I come from a low income family. I do a lot of paperwork.

I am now embarking two 1/2 months into my first ever corporate job and I always feel so anxious. Anxiety is something I have always struggled with. The interview went amazing! The on boarding not so much. My computer and profile was never set up into the system. It tool multiple weeks. So I shadowed for that duration with someone who did similar work expected of me but they worked on more complex projects. Now I am expected to do my own work and am able to ask questions as I go. It is my understanding that this is not how they normally train people but rather they sit at their own desk and learn with procedures. I am a reading learner so the latter would have been much preferred but when I started reading them it became obvious they were outdated and didn't reflect the many differences in processes from project to project. I feel really disheartened by this because learning styles and onboarding process was a big portion of the interview that made me feel like I was fit for the role. Now I am having doubts.

I keep making mistakes. There is an overwhelming amount of information and our product is super niche. My first day I was given hundreds of pages of notes and access to multipage excel sheets. While this isn't daunting to me because organization and studying are some of my strong suits, my higher ups and peers all have different expectations on how processes need to be completed. Learning what the correct way to do my tasks has been difficult because I feel like the framework isn't there and I don't understand why some things are done a certain way.

To be clear, I understand company's while it best to be helpful to teach newbies with their preferred form of learning its tied to the resources the company has available. I'm not expecting not be guided like a child and I don't want to quit because I'm facing resistance. I'd rather figure out methods to improve my skills so that I can adapt better to the work space.

Also I admit while I believe my mistakes are partially influenced by the onboarding process that I have never been particularly skilled with details. I am more of an efficiency big picture person. Now that I've worked at in role for two+ months. I've come realize that my job requires me to keen with details and to slow down. I make the same small errors sometimes repeatedly but I've completely fixed those problems after I've figured out why I was doing it and made a sticky note for myself. This is understandingly frustrating for me, my collogues, and employers.

Is it a lost hope? Should I look for another job? or do you have advice for a new worker on how make less mistakes and improve learning?

Lastly, it has be rather difficult to adjust to criticism, not because I'm offended, but sometimes I get corrected even when I do something by the book or exactly how trainers tell me to do something. For example, the blame for a piece of paperwork was put on my name after I completed it correctly but was told to adjust by a trainer. This has been particularly frustrating for me because I get scolded when I do something by the book, by how they would do it, or by making a mistake. Then I get told to look at the procedures more instead of listening to them or I need to be asking more questions instead of relying on the guides. There are other things like favoritism in the work place, like a coworker screwing up epically and my peers laughing it off.

My ""boss""(slight higher up, been there longer but same position?) has put me back on training while our actual boss is on vacation. I'm afraid I could lose my job if I don't improve but am wondering if its worth it. Either way I am going to begin to apply elsewhere to be safe.

1mqhi3f,Quitting my job... for a second time?,"Hi all,

  
Long story short, I got hired at a conveyor manufacturer in the as a junior project engineer as I finished my bachelor's in mechanical engineering. I worked there for a little over a year, and moved on to be a mechanical designer for a another manufacturer in the food industry. 

  
The manufacturer in the food industry was having a hard time making profits, and we knew changes were coming. So, I decided to contact my first employer and sure enough they hired me back as a junior project engineer.

  
I've been back for about 4 months now and I am dreading going to work. I think this whole time I just didn't like making technical design decisions and it's draining. I think I'd like to go into project management instead, and deal with scheduling, budgeting, and scope responsibilities instead.

  
I would feel so bad for leaving my current employer since it's a small company. They could've hired a new guy instead and trained him for all this time, but I feel like they wasted their time on me and I'm gonna betray them.

  
I have a potential opportunity as a project coordinator in the construction industry, and I'd like some advice from you guys. Should I stick it out and work for at least a year with my current employer? Would they take it better instead of leaving after just 4 months?

1mqh9uy,advice for third round interview with a VP?,"hi! tomorrow I have my final round of interviews for a position that I have been very excited for, as it is specialized in my industry, something I have all my career experience in, and not a position that frequently pops up in my area. I was laid off from my first post grad job after three years in June so I have been unemployed for two months and am really banking on this, as this company is also the only one that I have gotten a response from out of all my applications. 

I had a first round interview with the director of the business unit and he was really impressed with me, so I moved on to a second round interview with the manager I would directly be reporting to. He also told me at the end of our interview that he was really impressed. 

They contacted me yesterday to tell me I will be moving forward for a final round of interviews tomorrow as it is between me and one other candidate. One interview is with the strategic operations manager of the business unit and the other interview later in the day is with the VP of the business unit. I figure these will both be pretty typical interviews, just as the other two were, but for once I’m kinda nervous because I’ve never had such a long interview process and I’ve never had to interview with anyone so high up in a company! Any advice for these final stage interviews and any additional questions I should ask? I never know what questions to ask in an interview.

1mqgecm,"Master’s in urban planning first, or skip it and go to law school later?","I’m 33, been in urban planning for 7 years (no degree in the field), and just started an online master’s in urban & regional planning that’ll take 3 years. My job is stable, I’m saving money, and I’m helping family with health/life stuff, so now isn’t the time to leave for law school. Long term, I’m drawn to becoming a lawyer, but I’m wondering—would finishing this master’s actually help me in law school admissions or my future legal career, or am I better off skipping it entirely and going straight to law school later when I’m ready? I’d likely be in my early 40s when starting law.

TL;DR: 33 y/o urban planner starting a 3-year master’s, but really wants to be a lawyer. Is it worth finishing the master’s before law school, or should I skip it and go straight to law school later?

1mqgbqz,IT job choices.,"Hello all,

I’m deciding between two offers and could use some perspective, I got laid off recently from being a solo sysadmin and now have a few offers.

Job 1: MSP Centralized Services

Brand new position at the company.

Smaller org, would be building out internal automations and standardization processes.

Expecting lots of work and a steep learning curve, I’d gain a ton of hands-on experience. But going to be a clusterfuck.

People are closer to my age, builds great network because more turnover.

Salary: $75k, okay benefits.


Job 2: Senior Services Engineer (really more of a desktop support role)

Work would be fairly easy, not much chance to really flex sysadmin skills, maybe I could shadow the more expirenced admins

Team has very low turnover, most folks have been there a long time.

Not sure how much room for upward movement internally.

Hourly position — possibility for overtime pay.

Salary equivalent: $80k + 10% bonus, better benefits.


I’m torn — Job 1 means slightly less money now but a much stronger skill set down the road. Job 2 means more money now and that helps family more (and possibly more with OT) but I might need to do my own learning outside of work and plan to switch sooner.

As a result, I have been training on taking over her position on top of the workload I agreed apon. I did not make the decision to do this. I don’t even make enough to move out of my family’s house, and this job is becoming mentally exhausting.

1mqf9vx,I’m not sure if I’m being concerned or just paranoid.,"About a month ago, I made a big mistake at work and was written up. Since then, I’ve been feeling more anxious, which has sometimes led to smaller careless mistakes.

This past Tuesday, right before logging off, my boss asked me to come into the office next Tuesday. Normally, I only go in on Wednesdays or Fridays unless needed. When I asked why, he said it was because shareholders would be there and he wanted to meet the team. We’re a small company (~60 people).

I found it odd that:
	•	He told me privately instead of posting in the team channel (where two other team members are).
	•	The others are apparently already scheduled to be there that day.
	•	I noticed he has a private meeting blocked off that morning.

I asked him directly why I was told one-on-one and if there was anything I should be concerned about since my write-up. He explained that the others were already going to be in and that the main thing I need to work on is avoiding careless mistakes. He also mentioned a recent delay in my response to a task, which I explained happened because I was helping a senior manager.

So now I’m wondering — am I reading too much into this, or could there be something else going on?",Muted-Environment-66,2,0.75,2,1755210100,2025-08-14 22:21:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mqf9vx/im_not_sure_if_im_being_concerned_or_just_paranoid/,8,2025

1mqf2eb,Stability or Passion?,"Hi all! 

I am 35 (F) and currently work in the public service with a 6 figure salary. The job is secure, flexible and pretty easy if im being honest but it is boring af. 
I know I am beyond blessed to have this job (i did work hard to get here) but its slowly killing me and im losing my drive and ambition within the role. 

My partner 26 (F) is starting her own business in the equine industry and doesn't earn a great deal so we rely on my salary. We have some dreams of working together and running a complete business, so I signed up for a course to become an accredited body worker (think horse physiotherapist). This is very niche but is in demand and pays around $200 an hour once you're established. I am very excited to maybe move into something that better aligns with my passion/lifestyle but the feedback im getting from family is that im crazy, and I need to stick with my current job because ""no one likes what they do"".  

So I guess im looking for people that have made the jump from a secure well paid job to working for themselves.

1mqdf8x,"Got completely Blindsided with a ""Below Expectation"" for my Mid-Year Assessment","Been with my current company for 3 years this month. Every prior review that I've had with my manager has been ""meets expectations"" or better. All of my peer reviews have been ""exceeds expectations"". I originally started in a different role, but due to workload need I was transitioned to my current role after 1 year (of course a horizontal move with more workload). During that time the company had a RIF so I had to do my previous role while learning my new role and completing my tasks for the year. Fast forward to today I have my mid year review. I've met all of my deliverables on time as my manager states but marks me as ""below expectations"" stating that I'm being compared to others in similar roles who have 5+ years experience in this role. I felt completely Blindsided and don't really know where to go from here. My manager said I won't be on a PIP, and that I've already improved in some of the criticisms that he laid out. I'm planning on following up and discussing their comments, and point out potential improvements.

Is it fair to be compared to people with significantly more experience than me? I feel like my workload is at the same level if not more than what they have. I don't know if this is a sign of a potential RIF/layoff, but I feel like the criticisms are from a lack of communication from my manager and his manager.

What do I do to restart? Nobody seems to want to hire me or anything and that’s understandable I’ve been slipping like hell lately for the past 6 months, I’m really reaching a brink and I want to get out of this mess. I have no drug problems, no legal problems but I have to catch up on tickets I need to pay, only two but they’re getting way overdue I’m hopefully not gonna get a warrant for any. 

I think any driving job I’ve tried doesn’t accept me because of my pay driver history which was close to 3 years ago but still it’s something dealerships bring up when applying there and driving positions. I almost just want to find a job at some restaurant or fast food spot, pizza place maybe? Work there for a good while taking up all shifts possible and then see what I can get into after being employed a good deal of time. Don’t know how that’ll worn I don’t have an awful lot to pay for just rent, a car payment and insurance, also paying on a loan but still not much. That doesn’t account food and household but that’s also a place I spend pretty frugally anyway.

I am a last ear student in corporate finance, and I am at the end of my apprenticeship as I live in France and basically I work 3 weeks and go to the uni for a week.
Now I work in one of the biggest French firm as business controller it is an international company. They are proposed to me to relocate to Poland and work there as FP&A junior ( financial planning analyst) and I would have under my scoop costing campaign and tasks for 2 plant.
It is a stressful job during the campaign 3/4 month in the year. 
On the other side I have  a little French company but for more senior position as business controller and I would have multiple scoop as costing budget, process and kpi creation, advising on decisions. A more strategic position. 
The salary for both are equal so idk what do you think ?

1mq8ifa,Am I in a position to ask for a raise?,"I’ve been at an agency recruiting firm for 4.5 years. We’ve grown from 12 people to 36 and back down to 10 employees since I’ve been there. My revenue has always been pretty strong but never at the top. 

This year has been tough on recruiting and I’m the lowest biller at my company. But we hired a middle manager at $150k and over the last 5 months, he hasn’t done anything. No new clients, no deals made, and he just goes over our KPIs weekly. 

I’m making $75k plus commissions but I’m living paycheck to paycheck and would want a raise. I believe my loyalty to the company and positive attitude helps the culture. Although my revenue is not super high, I’m still bringing in more money than our recent manager we hired. He’s making twice as much as me for a base salary but has brought no significant impact to our company. 

Can I use this situation to ask for a raise? I would mention that I’m not performing to the highest standards but I’ve been loyal and want to continue working here but I need an increase on my base to meet my needs. I’d like a base salary of $95k

1mq7g20,"Going to Night School to switch careers, How do I communicate with my current job about schedule conflicts?","I'm looking for some advice and/or hear what you have done when telling your employer about going back to school to switch careers, and how much you disclosed to your employer.

I've been working in community development/disaster recovery since I graduated college in 2023, and I quickly realized its not what I want to do with my life. I am now trying to make a switch to become an art teacher. I do not have an education degree or any certs, so I've decided I wanted to participate in a post-bacc program to get my teaching certs. This is ideal for me because I can take classes at night and work towards getting certified while maintaining my benefits and current income at my job until I start student teaching. Generally, there will be no overlap with my work and class schedules, but I do have to teach some community classes as part of my course work, which generally starts at 3:30 PM once or twice a week, and I work a 9-5 schedule, although I am remote and there is some flexibility in my role (like I could work a few extra hours the day before or after so I still have 40 hours total for the week).

Originally, I was planning on not telling my employer that I was going back to school to switch careers, because I feel like if they think I'm a ""bad investment"" they'll just fire me. However, I also work for a very small company, on a very close-knit team, and its hard to give a vague answer about what I'm doing without looking ""anti-social"" or ""not being a team player"" (do you catch my drift?). My supervisor has noticed I don't seem super passionate about this job and has voiced to me that they want to be supportive about my individual growth and finding something I'm interested in. I like my supervisor, and I'm starting to think it would be nice to tell her about my plans and get support and flexibility while I'm in school, but I also worry that at the end of the day, she works for the company and I would see some negative consequences from telling my employer I'm switching careers.

I know at the end of the day it's up to me, but I'm looking for advice on how I should go about this, I don't know if it's a bad idea to just say I have a doctor's appointment on those afternoons where class overlaps with my work schedule, or if I should open up to my supervisor and tell them what I'm actually doing and get some extra support. I would also like to hear your experience with conflicting schedules at work!",ch0ccy_cow,1,1.0,0,1755193065,2025-08-14 17:37:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mq7g20/going_to_night_school_to_switch_careers_how_do_i/,8,2025

1mq6b7o,"""Fresh grad dilemma: Is ₱17k a fair start or am I underselling myself?""","
Hi, IE fresh grad here 👋 Just got my first ever job offer — ₱17,000 monthly. The role’s at a company literally 5 minutes from my house. I could even bike to work and save every peso on transportation.

On paper, it’s the most convenient setup I could ask for. No long commutes, no Manila traffic stress, and I can even go home for lunch if I wanted to. The only thing making me pause is… is ₱17k a good starting point for an Industrial Engineer?

I know fresh grads aren’t exactly in a strong bargaining position, but part of me wonders if accepting this now might make it harder to negotiate higher later. At the same time, experience is experience, right? And being close to home is priceless.

For those who’ve been in the industry: should I take this offer and focus on learning as much as I can, or should I hold out for something with a higher starting salary, even if it means longer travel and more expenses?

Would love to hear both fresh grad stories and veteran advice. 🙏",Serious_County415,1,1.0,1,1755190663,2025-08-14 16:57:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mq6b7o/fresh_grad_dilemma_is_17k_a_fair_start_or_am_i/,8,2025
1mq6625,Advice needed on micromanagement,"Hello all, looking for workplace communication advice. 

Context: I've been working various medical staff positions across a handful of practices for 3.5 years now after graduating from college, and switched medical fields a couple years ago. So far I've been treated like an equal by medical staff, healthcare providers, and patients alike. I like to think I have a strong work ethic (show up early, stay late if needed , any tasks are completed on time if not early, and I put in extra effort to make sure my coworkers' and supervisors' needs are met). I also like to think I contribute to a positive work environment, and I've never had any writeups, disciplinary concerns, patient complaints, supervisor complaints, etc. I really sound like I'm hyping myself up here lol. 

Current situation: I switched to a new position around 8 months ago hoping to gain more experience in the type of healthcare that I want to work in long-term. Initially the director for the department I applied for was very friendly and said that they viewed this position as a mentorship opportunity for me, that they would personally make sure I had everything I needed to be successful. As I've gotten further into the position, though, it seems like no matter how hard I work, how many projects I complete, how many patients I work with, how early arrive, how late I stay - you get the picture - I get treated like I'm a subpart employee by my supervisor. This manifests itself in constant micromanagement (including non-stop ""checking in to be sure you're not slacking"" e-mails when my supervisor is out of office, not being able to complete a project without the supervisor *physically* watching over my shoulder), constant degrading remarks over how ""unprofessional"" I am, frequent comments regarding being ""too young to be taken seriously in this field,"" comments that I get paid more than what the supervisor thinks is ""fair"" (still not covering costs of living, by the way). Mind you, these comments are being made by the same person who hired me, and I've never had similar feedback at any of the other medical positions I've worked before. 

I've had several conversations with the supervisor about these issues, but without fail, every change that is made lasts a few weeks before things go back to the problematic way they were before. I've tried to activate HR resources as well, but I don't have enough objective evidence of what's going on to make a real case.

This wouldn't suck so bad if I felt like the comments and behaviors were justified. I unfortunately can't afford to switch positions right now (have definitely considered it) as any other position in the field would require me to take a significant pay cut (as mentioned previously, I'm barely scraping by financially as is). 

So I guess the overall questions here are:

a) anyone have advice on meaningful ways that I can come to terms with the fact that my boss is never going to see me as an incompetent child pretending to be a professional?

b) anyone been in a similar situation and made it out the other side? what worked and didn't work for you?

If you read this far -- thank you and I hope you're having a wonderful day!",anonymousduckbill,1,1.0,1,1755190352,2025-08-14 16:52:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mq6625/advice_needed_on_micromanagement/,8,2025
1mq60rs,Do I stay or do I go,"Hey guys so my question really is about that. So bit of a backstory about myself. I graduated in 2021 with a Bachelor's in Business. I went to a small school for it. I graduated without an internship because it was cancelled due to Covid and I don't come from a family with a high net worth and not established in any type of career. I been trying to make name for myself and keep bouncing around jobs mostly in sales. Back in 2024 I was working as a server (because I needed a second job) and ended up serving a man and his family. He liked how I treated him and his family and thought that I was very personable. He ended up giving me his card and to come interview with him. I mean I thought why not it would be better than what I do right now. I went through the interview process and was able to get my Life Sickness and Health License to be able to sell life insurance, annuities, and financial planning. I was told this job would be hard the first couple years because I would be building my book of business and building my salary from the residuals i get. While I am doing this I still serve at my other job so im working 50-60 hour weeks. 

The issue I am having is that I am broke. I had to move back in with my mom last year at 27. Im barely paying for my bills right now and its playing a toll on my mental and physical health because I am so stressed about where my money will come from each month as I am grinding hard to build my book but nothing is sticking. I am currently in so much debt that it makes the situation worse for me. Currently owe roughly $25,000 in student loans, $12,000 in credit card, and owe another $4,000 in taxes that I am paying off. 

I do like my boss, my coworkers, the business, and understand how much I would be making if I stick it out but because of my financial situation I can only think that I would be better in a salary position. I have found one in the same realm that I would be helping people and be base + commission versus just being commission only and living off just tips. 

I feel bad wanting to leave because my boss has done a lot for me and looked out for me plenty of times but I cant escape the feeling I am constantly drowning and constantly fighting for air. 

  
Pros of my current job:

Great boss, Great work life balance, Great training and learning information, great coworkers, helping people and their livelihoods.

Cons of my current job:

Very sales oriented, commission only,  I am mentally and physically stressed, and really working more hours than I want and never having a day off for myself.

1mq5nc9,Mechanical Engineer with 4 YOE but feel like a bad engineer.,"I have 4 YOE at a coal plant and about 6 months experience at a simple cycle gas site.

My question is: Should I feel like a marginal engineer if I am not able to troubleshoot/ solve problems fairly quick? 
Please give me your feedback. 
I’m thinking I’m going to start reading 30 minutes a day on material for work on my own time.  Below is a summary of what’s on my mind.

I am sad/worried that it will take me about 6-7 years to become a senior engineer. 
At my company, it takes 3-5 years based on what the training program says. 

My “focus” or what I will do, has changed and I think has contributed some to me not feeling like a good engineer.

- focused on pollution control equipment 
- then vibration analysis but still expected to handle existing job duties.
- at one point last year: coal and gas site support & vibration meetings with the company experts.

The vibration didn’t work out because the experts did not feel I was going to be ready in 1-2 years to do their job. - fair assumption/ reasoning

Management has even said what they did to me was a lot for an entry level engineer.

1mq45nc,UK Legal Career Advice,"Hi all,

TLDR - any advice on moving from High Street to regional/national firms to make career progression as someone who is about to enter the first year of their TC. 

If am hoping for any advice which can help me visualise the next 5-10 years to get me where I need to be. 

I left university a couple of years ago in a bit of a rut, I was probably suffering from some form of a bout of depression. Up until university I was straight A’s, got a good LNAT score and went to an excellent university for law.

A number of caveats can be made, but ultimately it would be shirking responsibility, and I left university with a 2:2 due to my dissertation receiving a 10 mark penalty for being late. As I wasn’t in the best place, I didn’t appeal this and put my head in the sand. I left university to do “odd jobs” for the next year and figure everything out. 

Fast forward a couple years and I have an LLM, and gained 12 months experience working as a paralegal working with plaintiff litigation, some conveyancing, and employment. I have been fortunate and able to demonstrate my value and have been offered a TC, despite the 2:2, which I am very proud of. 

However, I am not where I want to be career wise. I am still young (under 26), however I want to attempt to start putting in the foundations so I am able to make a smart move in the next 2 - 3 years to level up my prospects. 

I have a long term girlfriend who I want to make my wife, and I want to start a family before I am 30. This will require capital and advancement that I simply won’t reach at the firm I am currently at. For context, I currently don’t bill, I just “do” ancillary legal work and draft documents for counsel etc. Anything weird and wonderful is thrown my way and I try and turn chicken sh*t into chicken salad. I believe I will start billing come September when I am a Trainee. 

What I am looking for is advice on how to prepare myself to attempt to make the next step, things I should be doing with my network and events i should attend. How should I be recording tasks Ive done for my CV. What industries might give me the leg up? I have an LLB and an LLM which focused on contract law. How can I demonstrate my worth and what opportunities should I be seeking out? I am determined to make this work, despite not being a “dream” candidate. So any and all advice or perspectives are welcome. 

To be clear, I’m willing to move all around the UK provided it’s the right move etc, so I am not limiting myself to a dream of London city law which frankly seems out of reach for me. 

I am aware there’s no magic spell to make this happen, but any positive and tangible steps I can take to give me a leg up in preparing myself for the life I want would be ideal.

1mq20v7,Juggling start up & career for the past 5 years. Now I have to choose.,"For the past 5 years I’ve juggled my career and my start-up. On average, I’d spend 8 hours a day on my full time job and an additional 4 on AgainstData. It was both a great and a terrible experience, fulfilling and disappointing, but **overall the best learning experience I’ve ever had.**

**I’m 40 now and doing both at the same time feels like stalling.** I believe that giving my career or my start-up full time attention will have better results than juggling both.

**It’s time to go all in:**

**- Either focus on building my company and grow**

**- Or focus on my career and finally get that promotion**

**My career:** Ogilvy, McCann, and others - I’ve been working as a Creative Director in advertising, creating campaigns for big brands. I was lucky enough to get some recognition and won important creative awards.

**My start-up:** Helps users clean their inbox and remove personal data from the companies that have it.

My family wants what’s best for me, but they don’t come from an entrepreneurial background and I know they mostly see the risk. My biggest fear is that I’ll regret not focusing on my company. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts.

1mq12jx,"37, UX content strategist with no visibility into impact - how do I pivot strategically?","I'm at a crossroads and could use some perspective from people who've navigated similar situations.

I've been a UX Content Strategist for 4 years at my current company, with 10+ years total experience in content and UX. The challenge I'm facing is that I work in complete isolation from results. I create wireframe copy, conduct content audits, and work on SEO landing pages, but I never see conversion data, user testing results, or any performance metrics.

I've requested access to analytics multiple times and keep getting vague responses about looking into it. This makes it difficult to know what's working, what isn't, and how to improve strategically.

The situation feels more urgent now because my company has been through several rounds of layoffs and recently automated entire departments, including sales and development roles, with AI tools. I'm wondering where content strategy fits in this landscape and whether I should be concerned about my own role.

**Current strengths:**

* Content strategy and information architecture
* Cross-functional collaboration
* SEO content structure
* User-centered writing

**What I'm missing:**

* Any visibility into business impact
* Technical skills that seem increasingly valuable
* Measurable wins I can point to

I'm considering content operations, product content strategy, content engineering, or roles that integrate AI and automation.

When you can't quantify your current impact, how do you make a strategic career move? Should I focus on developing one strong technical skill or build broader capabilities across related areas?

Would appreciate hearing from anyone who's successfully transitioned out of a role where they couldn't see their results, especially those who made changes in their late 30s.",choppedcheesesteak,1,1.0,0,1755179026,2025-08-14 13:43:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mq12jx/37_ux_content_strategist_with_no_visibility_into/,8,2025

1mpz0xb,A really weird unethical situation that I need to counter in order to possibly get a job to turn my life around.,"So this might be a doozy for this sub, but here it goes. 

I've been homeless since last Fall, and every single opportunity and every single approach I've taken to turn things around have fizzled out. I'm getting extremely desperate.

I came across a job posting and started talking to the person. They are a union handyman in a large apartment complex. Solid pay at 65k a year, free apartment+utilities+storage+parking space. They are looking for someone to take over their position, and an added benefit is that the apartment I'd get already has two other people living there, which is another 1700/month in income. As the person in question is leaving the country, they can possibly leave me their furniture and tool kit. 

Here is the problem: the guy claims that when he got the job 5 years ago, he paid off the guy who recommended him for the job, to the tune of 5000 dollars. And he says he'd ""like to get that money back."" So he's looking for a bribe of 5k if I get that position. 

Obviously there are two issues. One, if i had 5000 dollars in the bank, I wouldn't be in the position I'm in, nor would I be looking to bribe someone for a blue collar job. Two, I have no way to verify his story.

So my proposal to him will be: 

- I'll take the apartment with the existing roommates

- I'll keep his furniture and tools

- the two roommates will pay him rent directly for  4 months, so he will net 6800 from the deal. After 4 months, the roommates will switch to paying me directly and our transaction is complete. 

Any thoughts here? Is my offer to get the position rational? ",syringistic,6,0.7200000286102295,30,1755173891,2025-08-14 12:18:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mpz0xb/a_really_weird_unethical_situation_that_i_need_to/,8,2025

I got 3 years of experience, during all these times I have only 1 target career: Working as Offshore Mechanic at X company (im not gonna give company names).

2 of my experience years have been Onshore (base) mechanic at American Company branch that is based in my country.

And more than 1 year I am working as Offshore Mechanic at different company to get the experience that X (my target company) wants me to have.

So gents, company I am right now working in has got 5 years timed project, right now we are at 2nd year of project. After 3 years (end of 2028) project gonna finish and company will say goodbye to me.

And I know Senior Mechanic from my X target company (who is gonna be a Offshore Mechanic Supervisor at the end of this year), we are close to each other, he tries to help me to pass to X company.

He himself suggested to me to reference me to the management. He shares some books with me that can help me to answer technical questions at interview.

But the most important thing is, 2/3 mechanic vacations are internal at my target company. So they don't announce it. They just hire within company.

1/3 vacations are shared, and that is almost 1 vacation for every year. At this point what should I do? I should pass to this company during next 3 years, and I am a little bit worried about if I can't and be unemployed?

I wanna text General Manager of this company on LinkedIn about giving me a chance. I know 1 former HR of this company, we know each other. I got his advice, he also advised me that.

I dont think I can continue to work here but im terrified of being unemployed and basically have nothing going for me at this age.

I know that i’m not guaranteed a job or even an interview at this place though so I don’t want to put all my faith in this. This place is also hiring in September/October time so i’d be out of work until then.

1mpukth,"(21M) Been fired after one month, what do I do now?","**Context:**

I am a Political Science major, currently studying law so I can have both majors under my belt. I am also a certified accountant and I am currently working my way towards a regulatory compliance certification. I do have decent skills in things such as Graphic Design, WordPress development and automation and also stuff such as investigation writing and data analysis. I speak 4 different languages and I have worked for a year in a law firm as a legal administrative assistant which I eventually decided leaving due to the miserable way I was paid (otherwise it would have been the best job I had). Worth mentioning that I have ADHD which is the main reason why I have such a weird range of skills.

**Story:**

Last month I found an offer as a Junior Administrator in a job placement agency. The tasks that were highlighted in the offer were mainly support tasks, mail administration, data entry and some internal accounting. I applied because I liked the rather social goal the company had and because it was a 6h shift, which I found quite appealing. (Worth mentioning that the household dynamic I currently have forces me to find a way out so I applied to literally more than 300 job offers just to find something so I can get a rent)

They called me a few days later and we scheduled an interview, I was pretty excited because I thought this is my chance so I went to the interview with a few projects I made, such as articles I wrote, websites I made and data analysis projects, because I really wanted to show that I am capable. They complimented my resume and projects but they told me that they are pretty afraid that I will get bored fast of the work giving that it's mainly a pretty repetitive job, I tried to reassure them that it will not be the case and so I got hired.

This month of work was pretty chill, no major problems, I did not ask a lot of questions to my superior during training because I got used to look at the previous made tasks so I understand how to do it myself. When I was done finishing my tasks I usually went to my peer/superior to ask her if there's anything else I can help since my job was done. I also asked her if in the future when I will already get the hold of all my current tasks she will give me newer, more complicated once and she told me no. After the first 2 weeks we had a conversation about ""how do I like it and how do I see myself long term"" and they always seemed to be worried that I won't reach that long term. At least the salary was very good, 1600€/monthly (I leave in Spain).

Yesterday they told me that the collective agreement in their sector does not allow them to pay me less than what they are already paying me due to my studies, and that they needed a lesser qualified person, and that they believe I would have left anyways when the first opportunity would have appeared.

1mpu8hg,I’m too in my head about negotiating!,"So after a year of searching, I finally got a job offer for an Operations Assistant role, but the pay is not really what I was looking for.

The posted job description says the range is $45-75k on their website and $45-65k on Indeed. They came in at $52k; however, there was no talk about salary during the interviews.

They are a startup located in the Bay Area and I researched that Ops Assistants in the Bay make an average of $57-65k if that gives any context.

Would it be asking too much to see if they would meet me at $60-62k or is that super unreasonable? I’d be willing to accept at the $57k range, but don’t want to leave money on the table (if there even is any).

I also worry about them rescinding the offer if I do try to negotiate. Feeling lost on what to do in this situation.",neurodivergentdino,3,1.0,3,1755158062,2025-08-14 07:54:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mpu8hg/im_too_in_my_head_about_negotiating/,8,2025

1mpqwbo,Healthcare Role Impacting Rare Disease Patients (Clinical or Legislative),"Hi all!

My fiance (23) is a member of the rare disease community and has battled them for around a decade now. She is incredibly smart and has a degree in health sciences and has always wanted to be a doctor, but we’re concerned about the toll that residency would have on her body. We’re wondering if anyone knows of any positions that would have an impact on the lives of rare disease patients, whether that’s in a legislative or direct capacity. 

Ideally, one or more of these qualities would be great: 
- help people get diagnosed faster
- help better access the right care faster (hard to figure out what tests to do and places to go for many rare diseases)
- transform access to care or policy around it 

Her main thoughts are:
- She’s likes policy advocacy, patient advocacy, and direct patient impact 
- She wants to avoid administrative roles that only facilitate things but wouldn’t let her leverage her experience to directly impact patients
- She ideally would like to pursue something that requires a graduate school degree for job security, specialty, and specialization
- STEM is great but ideally not solely stats / math

Jobs she likes:
- Generic counselor
- Rare disease policy advocate (JD/MPP/MPH)
- Internal medicine (what she wanted to be)

Jobs she doesn’t like:
- PA/RN (not enough of a focus / speciality / rare disease impact)
- Clinical coordinator (too administrative)
- Patient advocate (often just connecting resources but not helping direct care)
- Patient experience (often just advocating for hospital or taking complaints) ",Ecstatic-Program-874,1,1.0,0,1755146582,2025-08-14 04:43:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mpqwbo/healthcare_role_impacting_rare_disease_patients/,8,2025

1mppnho,I want to leave my job,"After college, I started an account manager (sales) role at an Industrial automation company. In college, I majored in industrial engineering. I had an internship in manufacturing engineering, but I didn’t love it much. I went to sales because I thought that it would be an interesting experience, and that I could always pivot later. Shortly after I started the sales role, I knew that it wasn’t for me. I told myself that I will stay for a 18 to 24 months as I’m working on my pivot strategy to either a different department within the same company, or find something elsewhere. 18 months in, the company decided to eliminate the team that I was working on. Many of my colleagues got laid off, but I got offered a position on a different team, and I had to relocate to a different city. They paid for my relocation, but I’m required to pay the money back if I don’t stay for at least 2years after relocating. Since I didn’t have anything else lined up, I had to take the offer. 

Six months after my relocation, I found myself increasingly unhappy with the job. I don’t feel fulfilled. I want to quit but here are my issues: 
1-leaving now means that I would have to payback the money they paid me to relocate, 10k. 
2-I don’t have any connections to this new city, so if I’m getting a new job, I would rather be where I have relatives/friends. 
3- I have a surgery coming up, I want to wait after the procedure to start looking for a new job. I feel incredibly guilty for this. 

I think they pay me well. When I started 2 years ago my TTC was 74k, but 2 years later, my TTC is 110k. 

I wanted to vent and get some opinions from people who are more seasoned in their careers.

but now he’s obsessed with my team page photo. 2 months ago they asked for one so i literally just sent my slack profile pic its not that deep. i literally replied to the email with it and moved on. he’s been on me for like 4 weeks now saying its not a good one and he can take a better one. every time i tell him it’s fine and already on the site he just brings it up again next time. nobody at work cares its literally the same pic everyone sees on slack every day

feels like he’s just being negative cos i’m moving up in life and he’s still doing uber. like i’m getting invites to corporate lunches and he’s still driving people to nando’s yk. i love him but he’s acting salty for no reason

1mpnf6a,how to catch mistakes at a fast-paced understaffed job?,"
it’s my third month working front desk at a pet resort (daycare, boarding, and grooming) between university classes, and i just received my first write-up today for mistakes:

	1.	during my third week, i was not trained to adjust medication dates in the system. these must be done manually twice—on the reservation and on the pet profile—or it autofills the last date of stay and does not print on the pet’s card. i was given a verbal warning at the time and told to give high priority to medication accuracy. i owned the mistake and was horrified.

	2.	recently, during check-in, i verbally confirmed feeding information with a pet parent. a manager who knows the dog noticed it was different than usual—1x daily open feeding rather than 2x individual bowls daily. she chalked it up to miscommunication, but it was listed in the write-up as my fault.

	3.	again during check-in, i confirmed medication dates, frequency, and dosage with a pet parent as they had input it themselves in the online portal. drop-off was very hectic, and i did not notice the parent forgot to include the medication in the bag. i sorted their belongings after a rush (i was alone) and did not catch the missing meds. the dog went without medication until the owner was called the next day.

	4.	again, i confirmed medication dates, frequency, and dosage with a cat owner. she was flexible about when the meds were given as long as it was three doses, so i asked if morning was okay, and she agreed. i did not read the bottle because it was already set in the system, but people in the back noticed the instructions were different on the medicine label. they called the owner, who confirmed that anytime three times daily was fine. but i should have entered it as am, midshift, and pm.

the write-up stated that i was inattentive and needed to slow down, or further action would be taken. for context, i work alone during both weekend shifts (very busy intake and pickup, as well as handling all the daycare dogs, which can exceed fifty) and alone during pm shifts during the week. rushes often have no support.

i feel like management is building a paper trail rather than giving solid support. i am unsure how to improve when i am already verbally confirming with clients, and it is rare to have time to sit down and read all medications or backdate reservations while people are constantly coming in and out.

this is a stepping-stone job, but i am feeling very disheartened and anxious. i have a meeting with a psychiatrist tomorrow to discuss medication for insomnia, which has appeared recently due to stress, likely from this job.

does anyone have any tips to catch errors when i am the only one at the front desk?

edit: they sent me back out after the writeup to continue working the shift alone, and then had another coworker spontaneously pretend being a customer looking for a tour (they wanted to test my tour skills). i got the manager, apologized, and declined in favor of moving the roleplay to another day.",angelre0702,1,1.0,0,1755136180,2025-08-14 01:49:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mpnf6a/how_to_catch_mistakes_at_a_fastpaced_understaffed/,8,2025

Apparently it didn’t work for them and they want to cut ties and our COO on the agency side apparently is acquiring the agency and will announce it this week. This means we will be receiving termination letters this week and offer letters next week (from what my manager told me during our morning meeting). 

Apparently our SEO director and creative director will not be accepting the offer, as they have other offers lined up. 

My question is, when I receive my offer letter, should I ask for more money? Reason being is because I basically do more responsibilities than the job description stated initially. My role is the main web developer on our team but for some reason the tile is “Jr. Web Developer” which I’m not… the “senior” developer is not even full time, he’s on a contract/ freelance basis.. I look after all of our client websites, which is currently roughly 70 websites. I even do some client facing meetings etc. 

I think it’s a good idea to counter the offer (assuming it’s my same salary), and detailing that I’m doing more work than I initially was hired for and to update my job title and compensation and will throw a salary range I’m looking for. I think they will go for it as I’m the sole person managing all client websites and if they decline my counter and I walk, they’d be screwed during this transition, at least temporarily.

What are your thoughts? Should I just take what they offer me and be thankful or should I counter and ask for more, being that it’s justified, at least from my perspective.

But anyways, im getting paid crap. especially for living in HCOL area. Anyone else who has any advice to better my resume and experience. such as licenses and certificates, it doesnt have to be related to marketing much (because the job market for marketing is garbage), im sure having a degree in business can open many doors in the business world. im currently looking into book keeping, i see many jobs who ask for book keeping experience who start at a good wage. so any other licenses/certificates that can be very useful?

1mpkbgx,"Struggling to Find a New Job After Leaving My Previous Position, Any Advice?","I recently made the scary decision to leave my old job in search of better opportunities. My goal was to transition from a management and oversight role into something more hands-on, specifically in R&D engineering.

I've been working as a mechanical engineer for about 5 years. While I know that's not a ton of experience, I was really hoping to move into something that would challenge me more and better align with my long-term career goals. I voluntarily left my previous position on May 1st, and now, three months later, the job search is proving much harder than I anticipated.

To give you an idea, I’ve applied to over 100 jobs on LinkedIn and more than 50 on platforms like Indeed and Monster, and a few on ZipRecruiter and Dice. In total, I’ve applied to over 200 positions, and the response has been disheartening only heard back from maybe 15 companies, all of them were rejections. I’ve also reached out to recruiting agencies, talent acquisition people, and headhunters, but haven’t gotten any responses from them either.

At this point, I’m feeling pretty discouraged and unsure if I’m doing something wrong in my job search. Has anyone else been in a similar position, or does anyone have advice on how to better approach this process? Any insight on what I could be missing, or what I might be doing wrong, would be greatly appreciated. I’m starting to get really nervous that I won’t be able to land something anytime soon.

1mpjwml,I’m on a lost path and don’t know what to do.,"I’m a 24M, and I live in north Texas (not DFW, the texoma region between DFW and Oklahoma). I work at a big corporate chain collision shop that has 250+ locations all across the southeastern US. I am currently the lot porter/detailer there making $15 an hour. I started in January making that pay because I just needed a job. Well since I’ve started this job, I’ve realized that I do for sure like automotive a little bit more than other industries and I think it is what I want to stick with. I’ve been helping the body techs and the painter with little things when they ask for help, I ask them learning questions.. you know the stuff that shows interest. They are all either older millennials or Gen X so they like that stuff. 

The problem? Management. 

I feel like management is ruining my love for automotive. 

The first problem I have, is that when it comes to the detailing stuff they always claim “it doesn’t have to be perfect” because the whole point is just cleaning up after us here at the shop— not a full detail. 

The second problem is that I’m constantly being rushed, (or atleast it feels that way) with my work. And this leads to me having to redo work, because I was being rushed in the first place. 

The third problem is that this company is typical corporate America, where you have to fight for a raise for 6 months just to see MAYBE an extra $1 or $2. The painter was telling me the other day that he basically had to verbally argue his way into a raise, and I just don’t like that at all. 

Today was a good example of why I think I’m at the wrong shop. I missed a little bit of dust on a screen and got completely shark attacked (think army bootcamp, surrounded by DI’s yelling at you) over this by every manager in the place. Typically I have a good attitude about this kind of thing, but at the EXACT same time that this was going on, we had a body tech that was passed out in the break room for 2 hours. Which caused the painter to be behind, and not only that another tech is losing flag hours to that guy. Huh.

I’d like all advice on my situation here. Am I being too sensitive about the place? Do I need to just go somewhere else and ask for more than $15 an hour? 

The other guys in the shop tell me I need to get with our area manager and tell him that I’d like to be an apprentice- but I have a feeling that’s going to be kind of the same concept as fighting for a raise.",Visual_Prune5368,1,1.0,4,1755126834,2025-08-13 23:13:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mpjwml/im_on_a_lost_path_and_dont_know_what_to_do/,8,2025

After 9 years at Claire’s I left to become a Area Manager at Sally beauty then was promoted quickly to District Manager for 1 year

I went through a layoff with Sally Beauty after a year in my district position.

So far I found my previous positions qualifies me for Project manager, supply management. I’ve also looked into which certifications needed to accomplish this as well. Any additional insights would be much appreciated.

A few years ago I ran a creative agency (which I loved doing). I stopped when I got married and started a family because the feast or famine nature didnt suit me any more + my business partner got a great opportunity and I didn't want to stand in his way. 

For the last 5 years, I've been working a 9-5 in a marketing and sales.... fantastic company and great colleagues (which Ive heard is not easy to find) but I miss that life and the challenge of growing a business, I'm a bit tired of marketing and sales and I don't know where my skill set is going to translate to. 

I'm not willing to risk financial instability for my family in pursuit of something that may or may not work out and it's not easy to find the time outside of being committed to my job, and my family to run a side business.

1mpi1at,"37, mechanical engineer, done with job hopping. How do I finally specialize and go global?"," Hi everyone,

I’m 37, a mechanical engineer by degree with an oil & gas background (although my only hands-on experience in that field was an internship many years ago).

Since then, my career has been a mix of industries: automotive, tobacco, construction materials, and now manufacturing as a Production Manager. I’ve always adapted quickly, but I’m honestly tired of switching industries every few years. I want to finally build a clear niche, become an expert in something, and use that to work internationally or as a freelancer/consultant.

In my current situation, the natural next step would be to move from Production Manager to Operations Director, but that path comes with a lot of stress, constant pressure, and the kind of 24/7 responsibility I’m not sure I want for the long term.

Some of my strengths:
	•	Strong people management skills (in two companies, colleagues voted me as employee representative after just a few months)
	•	Process optimization and production efficiency experience
	•	Tech intuition: I’ve built internal tools using AI to automate quality control and streamline workflows, even though I’m not a programmer
	•	Adaptability to very different industries

I’m open to learning something new if that’s what it takes, whether that’s a certification, a technical specialization, or even pivoting toward tech/AI applications in manufacturing.

Given this mix, how would you approach building a high-value skill set that’s in demand internationally? Are there specific certifications, industries, or roles where my background could translate into much better pay and opportunities abroad?

Thanks in advance and I’d really appreciate advice from anyone who’s made a similar leap.

If I get the job offer for this job but still have other opportunities closer to home, how would you weigh the benefits of the crappy commute to something closer?

1mphtrn,My coworker isn't pulling her weight,"Hello! I'm relatively new to reddit so I hope this is the right place to post this. 

I (25F) am a remote employee on a team of two who report to our direct supervisor. Our supervisor is super cool and the three of us interact well. The issue is that my coworker (45?? F) isn't pulling her weight. After working here for 3 years the additional tasks and responsibilities built up on me to the point that I addressed the workload imbalance with my supervisor. She immediately acknowledged this and corrected it. Our roles were readjusted and evened out. I'm getting a breath of fresh air and my coworker....is drowning. I'm watching her destroy my spreadsheets, not keep up with tasks, and damage the overall functionality of the team. What she had as an ""I'm busy all day"" workload I get done in about 2 or 3 hours and tend to my other tasks. 

It's been about a week and a half of the role switch, and other teams are reaching out to us for updates. I want to make it clear with my boss if I need to be picking up her slack so I don't go under, but if I do that I'm back in the situation of doing 2/3 of the workload. I'm quite frustrated and I don't know how to address this as I feel I've already put her down enough. She's complaining to me constantly about her new position when I had been doing that and more for years. 

I don't know how to handle this professionally. 


Tldr: I was doing most the work and told my boss, she evened out the workload but my coworker can't keep up and it's effecting our closely working teams.

	1.	Switch to a similar technical role elsewhere for more money, save for retirement.

1mphtez,Should I stay or should I go? At a crossroads in my career and I don’t know what to do.,"I (33F) have been doing my job for 8 years, work from home for 5 of them. This is the first professional job I’ve worked out of college. When I first got hired, the company seemed stable, like a place you could work your whole life at. There were people who worked there 20-30 years. Good benefits. Boring, but nice. That was before the new CEO came in. 

6 years ago, we acquired a ton of companies. In the last year, we’ve restructured and had layoffs accordingly. I’ve gone through two job reassignments, lost multiple friends, and the sense of stability is gone. Those people who gave 25 years of their life? They were some of the first to get cut. My role has productivity trackers with it now which make no sense for the work I do, so even though I’m salaried, I need to clock in and out 8 hours a day like an entry level employee. 

I’ve applied to a new job and have a final in-person interview. The catch is it’s in office work, 5 days a week. I would be starting all over again with PTO. At my current company, I have 30 days off a year. The new job would start me off accruing 4 hours every two weeks, which would bump up the longer I’m with the company. The commute isn’t bad, but it still isn’t being in my own home. I feel like I’m at a point where I should leave (both in my age and everything happening), but I’m second guessing myself to stay with the devil I know. I’m finding it hard to give up the work life balance I have by working from home and the time off I currently have. But then again, there’s no guarantee that I won’t be let go during the next round of layoffs (if and when they occur). 

What should I do?

*TLDR;* I’ve worked at my current job for 8 years, mostly from home, enjoying stability, great time off, and decent work life balance. That was until a new CEO brought acquisitions, restructuring, layoffs, and productivity tracking that doesn’t fit my role. Now, after multiple reassignments and seeing long-term employees cut, I’m interviewing for a new job. The role is in-office with less PTO, but potentially more security. I’m torn between keeping the comfort and benefits of my current job despite instability, or starting fresh in a less flexible role that may offer more stability but sacrifices my current lifestyle.

1mph5f5,Am I overreacting?,"Do recently I made the decision to leave my job that I had been at for 2 years and it was my first job out of college. To preface this was one of the best working environments that I could have ever imagined and even made many friends during my time here as well. But while it comes with an amazing WLB the negative is that the pay is lower than averages and upward mobility is more about doing your time rather than performance. My salary at this company was about 103k but the positive was a typical work week consisted of 30 hours of work but I had to go into office 3 times a week and it was an hour drive to the office. 

I was about a month ago hit up by a recruiter on linkedin and decided why not just go for it and test if I could even get another job. When interviewing I did a typical resume screen then they did an in person interview that I came in for. During this I was given the impression that the work environment is actually pretty chill and its more about completing your work. Also the interview process seemed to be actually pretty easy (which was a little alarming) as this was for a Senior Software Engineer role and I only have 2 yoe total. But I did end up getting the offer and it was for about 150k a year. Now the positive is the high salary and the fact that the new office would only be a 5 minute drive away. So naturally as I would move up such a high title and pay it was just an offer that even if it doesnt work out you have to try. 

Well so I did accept it and leave my old amazing job. Now I just completed my third day in the office and am feeling anxious, stressed, regretful and worried. I acknowledge a lot of these might be attributed from moving from the known to the unknown. But the main things that have thrown me off are the following. Apparently between the period I accepted the offer and joined a new ceo was hired, now this may not be a bad thing but apparently he came into the office on a Friday at 6:30 pm and was pissed that no one was there... Then during his intro town hall he straight up said work here devote to it or leave and go work for the competitor... Now these dont directly affect me yet. It is a 4 days in office and 1 day wfh gig, which he apparently wants to change to 5 days in office. Even this considering the close proximity isnt too bad but apparently they are so anal about it that you have to be at your desk/office from 8:30 - 5 when you are in which idk how they track. All these things I believe could be adjusted but already are red flags.   
  
Then on day one after onboarding with HR I meet with my manager for lunch during which he talks about how his boss is such a workaholic and expects people to work off hours. Which his boss had interviewed me and had actually not said this and made it sound like work stays at the office. Then he went on to say that for the first month or 2 I wont be doing what I was told which is managing offshore and essentially maintaining code quality and making sure work is getting done and dependencies are maintained. That was the role I was told I would be doing here. But it seems that now for the first 2 months I will be working with them in the guise of working under them as a different title since they plan on firing all of the contractors. Since me and others who will get hired will replace them. Also to expect to work after hours which im assuming is around a 50 hour work week. This already made me uneasy but I said okay I guess that will work. Then after lunch I went to my desk and worked on the onboarding trainings related to harassment etc. 

Then on day 2 everything was still okay I was feeling anxious and a bit duped that things at the company actually seem up in the air and there is not much structure or guidance. I found that there arent much onboarding docs or much support from my manager. The time that he did to come support me he used the n-word straight up (he is not black or should be able to say it) which threw me off completely. I thought maybe I miss heard but then he proceeds to compare the ceo being in a house while we all are in the fields working for him..... Already im seeing major signs of a toxic workplace. 

Then today its not as bad but a wave of stress, sadness and anxiety came over me making me miss my old professional workplace. My old manager even asked today how I am feeling about leaving today through text as well. It seemed to be in a way to see if would want to return maybe now or in the future. Then my manager just gave me something to do without ever explaining anything that they use, the tools they have or anything. Documentation also seems to be severely lacking here meaning im basically all on my own as the contractors seem to have picked up that I will be replacing them probably with others. I cant tell if its imposter syndrome, inexperience, leaving what I know or what but just looking for opinions of am I crazy for even wanting to run back to my old job?

So I will start with the story itself…. I started my new job (contract role) 1 month ago along with this woman she’s like 20years older than me who’s quite experienced in Accounting with experience working in some big corps. I started as a fresher to the Accounting industry (with 2years credit management experience), so the difference between me and her can be quite significant.

I had a talk with my manager last week and he pointed out that my lack of experience but willingness to learn and that I’m eager to learn. But since then, I realised that this woman she’s actually getting more and more work than me and sometimes some managers would just talk straight with her and take me like invisible like I wasn’t started at the same time as her. Today I found out that she’ll be helping out some important tasks and my name isnt even in it. I feel frustrated as they didnt even let me try and didnt ask me if I can do that.

1mpgibf,Loophole decision! 🤯,"
Hi,
I’m looking for advice. FYI: 37M, no married, with partner and no kids. Also no student debt.

I have been working in this company for over a decade in IL. I started from the bottom and I’m a R&D (research and development) manager .

For a while, I feel deeply demotivated at work. Company has changed a lot in a bad way, lack of leadership, my boss goes thru terrible periods to deal with (like treating us like a we’re children, acting like a dictator, setting us up for failure, etc). I asked multiple times and k don’t think management wants to move me up so my promotion ladder ended.

I make around 100k which for IL outside or Chicago is not bad. Work is not too hard as I have been here for so long and management don’t want us to run many R&D testing anyways. I’m not happy at work but coasting.

4 years ago I started a creative side hustle that I like but I’m struggle to grow it to a level that allow me live off it. Specially doing it part time. However I discovered im good dealing with clients, decent at marketing and I have potential for sales if I get some training.

Also i only got 3% raises for a whole  so i feel the longer I stay here the more im tanking my earning potential. However i also feel i dont love that type of engineering job no more. To be fair this is the company i worked most of my life so i don’t much many more references. However based on what i hear from coworkers… may be the same.

My dilemma: 1) suck it up and switch jobs to another company for a technical role like mine and get a raise, hopefully in 5-10y I can retire with enough savings. 2) move into an adjacent role with commercial like business development, but may need to take a pay cut because besides selling for my biz I don’t have experience. 3) Stay put and keep learning how to grow the biz.For clarity I felt a bit lot on how to grow the biz, just figuring out a bit at a time but making progress. Option 2 and 3 mean leaving behind the career I work hard for.

I feel super stuck here and kinda depressed. Please some thoughts here! Thanks!!!",cliclaclu,1,1.0,0,1755118826,2025-08-13 21:00:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mpgibf/loophole_decision/,8,2025

1mpg9l1,"Managing Workplace Trauma, Possibly PTSD","Hi everyone! 

I am a first-time poster, and I’m not even entirely sure how Reddit works, but hopefully I receive some useful insight. 

I recently left my corporate job about 3 months ago because I couldn’t take the toxicity and pressure anymore. I worked there for 3 years and during that time I definitely “sucked it up” and “dealt with it” until the pot overflowed. This was one of the most toxic environments that I had ever worked in, and it ultimately led me to having a complete mental breakdown. I was unable to go to work for weeks. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat. All I did within that time was cry and try not to have an anxiety attack. This was the worst mental breakdown that I had ever had in my entire career, so at first I was confused as to why it was happening, but ultimately figured out what it was. Once I did, I turned my shit in and left. 

I recently just got offered a new position and I am very excited for it! I am truly looking forward to my next steps, but I think that I have PTSD from my previous workplace. I’m afraid that I will bring this mindset into my new company, so I want to process everything before I even start my new job. 

I have a therapist and we are working through it, but I want to hear some of your success stories. 

Has this happened to you before? If so, how did you overcome it? 
What are some of your tips and tricks for returning to the workplace?

Anything would be helpful. Thanks, friends of Reddit!

1mpftzq,"Where do I go (Engineering, Technician)","Graduated from a Tech university with a major in MET. Chose this major because I didn’t know what to do and I was told if I wanted to do hands on stuff I should pursue and Manufacturing Engineering Technology degree. Started machining work and loved it so much I got a job in the mechanical engineering machine shop using welders, mills and lathes. To create mechanical engineering students projects. I learned a lot and spent a lot of time just practicing on the machines. Had two internships one as a process engineer and another as a mechanical designer. 

Now I’m 7 months post grad I have a good job as a mechanical designer for a smaller company. That I also interned at. I’m making 70k good benefits. I do work hard so much so I believe my boss sees me as more of a technician. As I have done vastly more tech work for projects. I have designed, prototyped and installed 5+ components. All have worked with little to no issues, but they are relatively simple. I’m not against engineering work I am simply rarely assigned actual engineering work. 

I’m not enough of an engineer to pursue analytics and in depth evaluations of processes to be a real engineer. And not to say that work is below me; however, I feel I could be doing better things than turning nuts and bolts. 

I enjoy prototyping and finding solutions to problems, and I really really love working on machines. I work on motorcycles, dirtbikes, and any small motor that has issues and I really feel a sense of fulfillment learning how they work for my self. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on paths I should look into or anything would help. Im fine with relocating but it’s gotta be somewhere with some mountains. And I am not against being outside or a lot of manual labor.

1mpetwn,RN or Radiology Tech?,"I am 30F and currently work in mobile/internet sales and am not great at it. I am on the autism spectrum so I struggle with small talk/eye contact. While I can mask well I still come off as a little bit awkward or quiet. I am extremely friendly and polite, but I struggle with meeting sales goals.

I am married and we want to start a family in the next couple years so I need to study something that I can support a family on since my husband is low income as an entry mechanic also. I also need to keep working full time while going to school, and work about 10 hours a day right now since we can’t afford less or we have to start cutting things like the gas/water bill to make rent. I wanted to study IT, but it’s too saturated, and I live in an area where the only healthy market of decent paying jobs is healthcare jobs.

I have been considering studying being a registered nurse, and I have an aunt and a cousin that were nurses + a big hospital about 2 miles away from me. But I am also interested in studying to be a radiology technologist, it peaks my interest more, and frankly just seems like it would be less bullshit. But I am worried about AI and how it will impact the field.

Both seem to have a healthy amount of job openings around here, and pay the same. One drawback though is while checking out my community college, the radiology technologist program only accepts 16 people a year, and next start is not until July next year. It seems to imply it’s very competitive to even begin and I am someone who has a GED and no other higher education/healthcare experience other than a vet assistant cert. Which doesn’t make sense to me because considering the amount of job openings for radiology techs here, it seems they are desperate for workers.

Are there other options for schooling like partially online with this kind of work, if I have to drive to another city on my days off to do the other half on-site?

1mpe5e6,Multiple job offers. Confused on what to do?,"Hi Reddit folks!

So I have a situation, I left my current employer(company A) after almost 4 years working there early this year for a better opportunity(and pay) for company B. However, after joining new role I found that company B has very bad work culture, the people are bad and overall it was very unprofessional and micromanaging environment. My manager was also the head of the team was also vey impolite and the fellow workers were rude. I was really miserable working there. I was so frustrated that I was planning to resign the company with no offer on hand from any other company. I was continuously applying to new jobs that I was seeing and also was reaching out to my network for job. During that time I reached out to my previous employer(company A) and they were more than happy to hire me back however on a junior/entry level role (and also paying me almost 25% less than what I was making when I had left previously). I was happy that they atleast hired me back. Now I am working for company A since past 2 months and now I was reached out by company C( which I had applied when I was planning to leave B and before my current employer had given me the offer to rejoin). The role at company C is very good, its more in line with my career and also the pay is significantly more than what I was making before all this.(however the role at C is a contract role of 6 months with mostly converting to permanent after 6-9 months) I am wondering what should I do if I potentially receive any offer? I am super confused. Any help?

1mpdta1,Career advice: Move from 3rd LoD Audit Manager to 2nd LoD Senior Risk Manager?,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some perspective on a career decision within banking.

I currently work as an Audit Manager (3rd Line of Defense) in a European bank, earning around €75k/year. By all internal feedback, I’m ready for a promotion to a Senior Audit Manager role — my Head of has told me this multiple times. However, with a recent leadership change, all promotions have been “paused” and there’s no clear timeline. To make matters worse, a new Senior Audit Manager was recently hired externally without even asking if I’d be interested.

Now, I’ve been approached internally by the 2nd LoD (Non-Financial Risk) for a Senior Risk Manager position. I’ve indicated my salary expectation of €90k/year, which is realistic for the market. This role would be in their Risk Transformation & Analytics team, with responsibility for implementing the risk framework, data-driven risk monitoring, and working closely with the business on proactive risk management.

My dilemma:
	•	Should I push one last time with upper management to secure the Senior Audit Manager role now?
	•	Or is moving to 2nd LoD as Senior Risk Manager actually a smart career move, given the influence and exposure it offers?
	•	Would moving from 3rd LoD to 2nd LoD be seen as a step sideways, or could it help me progress faster towards senior leadership (CRO/COO level)?

Has anyone here made the switch from Audit to Risk? How did it affect your career path?

Thanks for any advice!

1mpbeac,Quitting a job that I would love to come back to in ~6 months,"I have a job that I like. I would say I do a pretty good job and am well liked by managers and co workers. I've been at it for a year. It's a fairly niche thing that can have a pretty steep learning curve and usually takes some time to get new people up to speed.

It tends to get a rather busy season starting around November, that lasts until March/April and then gradually becomes more laid back through summer before picking back up.

I want to hike the Appalachian trail which usually takes 4-6 months and is conventionally done during a window of February-September give or take on either end.

I know I may just need to outright give my job up and I've weighed the pros and cons and decided it's worth it even if when I come back I end up needing to find a new job and it isnt as good. 

But I'd like to try and ask if they would consider letting me leave unpaid for this time and then come back and pick right back up. 

It's a small department so I can kind of talk directly with the people that make these decisions.

If I'd probably want to leave mid-late March (kind of the end of the busy season) how far in advance should I have this conversation? Part of me thinks waiting as long as possible to make sure I'm working and saving right up until it's time to start this long stretch of unemployment and not like ""showing my hand"" too soon and being let go. I have more than enough already but of course saving more and contributing to my 401k and stuff as long as possible is a priority.

On the other hand, I could see giving like months of notice being taken as a big courtesy. But also its really hard to imagine them wanting to let me go when I bring this up in like October, right before its about to get very very busy, and I am agreeing to work through like 5-6/7 of the busy months",Plane-Session-6624,0,0.25,6,1755107398,2025-08-13 17:49:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mpbeac/quitting_a_job_that_i_would_love_to_come_back_to/,8,2025
1mpbdlo,I need life/career advice,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 23M living in Canada, and I could really use some advice. I currently have about $2k in savings, but I’ll be able to start saving a lot more soon. My plan is to leave in November, and by then I should have around $15k saved up.

Here’s the dilemma:

* Right now I make $26/hr.
* I just landed a new job (currently in training) that will pay me $37/hr.
* I can’t stand Canadian winters and would love to skip it entirely — ideally I’d leave from November until mid-April.

If I go, my first stop would be Southeast Asia — somewhere I can live shirtless on the beach, warm weather every day, and not think about snow for months. After those months abroad, I’d probably come back to Canada, work a dead-end job to save up again, and then head to Europe for the summer — basically repeating that lifestyle for a few years while I’m young.

Part of me wants to stick around for this new job, but another part of me is tempted to tell them I have “family issues” and just take off to travel for those 5 months. I feel like now is the perfect time in my life to do something like this before I get tied down with more responsibilities.

If you were me, would you:

1. Stick with the new high-paying job and grind through another Canadian winter?
2. Take the money I’ll have saved by November and go live my travel dreams now, leaving my current life behind for a while?

1mpaflt,"How Realistic? - Career Pivot, Part-Time MBA","Age: 25

Work Experience: 2.5 Years (also worked 1.5 years in undergrad in same department, so 4 total, listed on resume)

Current Role & Industry: Assistant Manager in department at same university I graduated from. Have received 3 promotions since interning during undergrad.

Looking to career pivot into finance, sales, or real estate from a completely unrelated and niche industry. Have been accepted and starting classes this autumn at state school, part-time MBA (T-25) and entirety of program is fully paid for by my employer (despite taxes, est. $1800 year). The program would take 3 years, and I’m feeling torn about the length of the program and the fact that I’d have to continue working in my current role that demands intense hours (est. 60-80 hours/week given time of year)

I’ve spoken with career services, and they mentioned that a career pivot would be entirely up to me through networking, although I do have access to all OCR, it will be difficult to attend due to my demanding job. I have been networking with multiple individuals in these target fields and some have advised that an MBA is not strictly necessary to break in but would be nice to have. I’ve never quite felt ready to make the jump, and I’m struggling with whether this MBA path is the best use of my next few years.

Additional Note: Have around $50k in undergraduate loans. Have been making payments and also waiting to hear on court decision on SAVE plan. I do have the ability to consistently pay down these loans through job income.

Additional Questions:

Given my background and goals, is the 3-year MBA worth it compared to trying to pivot now?

How much does the “fully paid for” factor change the ROI in your mind? (again only 25 YO)

1mpad0w,Customer Offered Me a Job in Intermodal Sales,"I am (29M) and I am in security sales and I love my job and who I work for. A couple months ago I got connected with a trucking and logistics business and sold them our product. Throughout the sales process the owner of the business and I spent quite a bit of time together.

After the sale closed, he called me and said he wanted to grab dinner and had a proposal for me. Fast forward a couple days and we get dinner. He tells me he wants me to work for him and he was serious. We talked about it - I let him know I am happy and make a good living but I would listen to what he has to offer.

After a few more calls and meetings he sent me an offer of $128,000 base salary and a fair commission plan. Essentially they have around 125-150 containers that they transport a day. He wants me to bring him n more customers and increase the number of containers transported daily. I will get paid 3.5% on each dray that is moved.

I’d have some growing pains building my book but after it’s built it can be very profitable. The average container moved is $650 so 3.5% $22ish. If I get my book up to 20+ containers moved a day - this can be very profitable obviously.

Good work life balance and good pto as well. This puts me in a bind. I love my job and had no intentions of leaving or looking elsewhere.

For context, in my current role I have a base of 85k and OTE of 125. I am currently outperforming my OTE by a significant margin and pacing closer to $160-170k. Along with that, I am on track for promotion

1mpa1tg,Stuck with no experience - advice needed! [UK],"Hello,

My situation is as follows

I graduated with an MSc in Business Analytics earlier this year, and have applied for so many jobs I believe I've lost count - these have included cover letters

While I have academic projects I can show off to employers, I'm not even getting to the interview stage.

I've also applied for roles ranging from Entry level to intermediate, but this doesn't seem to have made a difference - I've been turned down for Junior Analyst roles that require apparently no experience, grad schemes etc

I am genuinely at loss as to what to do moving forward, any help would be great",Open_Duty7726,1,1.0,0,1755104449,2025-08-13 17:00:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mpa1tg/stuck_with_no_experience_advice_needed_uk/,8,2025
1mp9se4,"Help me please, I’m a complete mess","I showed signs of early promise at my last job which was a sales job, I left 3 months ago. At only 19 I was able to rise to the top closer of the quarter, following that I made a switch to a tier 1 Tech distribution company. It’s been rough lately, in the last 3 months I’ve lost all my confidence, my spark, my energy, my willingness and motivation to get anything done, my entire identity, I am a shadow of the person I was 3 months ago. 

The money in tech is amazing but the stress levels are high so I find myself constantly pouring money into acts of degeneracy, things I vowed never to do, things that are killing my potential, things that I would never touch just 3 months ago 

My manager has serious hatred for me and if he could he would fire me on the spot he would and I don’t blame him, I’m way too slow and I make too many mistakes. The only thing keeping me in this job is my good relationship with the directors 

My goal was to use this job in tech as a trampoline into a sales job at the likes of Oracle,AWS Etc, however the only thing I do in this job is send out daily reports(which are inaccurate) and emails and useless follow ups. 

I need to regain my spark, my current job is killing me everyday is another lecture about how much I suck at excel, how I make too many mistakes etc etc. I want to feel like a winner again, I want to be respected again. 

I’m taking a “sick” leave tomorrow. I’m going to sit in the library and think of my next move

1mp9ab8,Consulting or Steady Job?,"Hey guys, I'm tinkering with the idea of going solo and wanted to see what everyone thinks about starting a consultancy vs having a steady job - in terms of career security.

I'm an RFP specialist who also has some experience with GRC work (risk assessments, security questionnaires, trust center implementation). 

Any how I'm an offshore worker as they call it - a South African working for a US employer. My reason for wanting to go out on my own is two-fold: 

1. I make considerably less than the average RFP specialist after 18 months in my role (they trained me).

2. There has been a lay off culture seeping in and RFPs just don't bring much revenue to a private SaaS entity who doesn't work with Gov.

I have no qualifications but tons of skills, including 3 years of professional writing and real estate sales. (On top of the above) and my concern is that if I stay put, the rug is going to be pulled and I'm going to have to compete for another full-time gig. 

Contrast that to UpWork that seems to have an abundance of postings looking for people exactly like me, offering double what I earn and demanding less hours, and I'm starting to think the employment contract I worked so hard for isn't as safe as I thought. 

I have a baby on the way, and the company is already not going to give me paternity leave, and does not cover any benefits above my salary. On top of that they continue to lump on more roles into my title like ""enablement"" and ""analyst"" - without really offering the salary that goes with it. So im thinking if I'm so dependable maybe I'd be better offering my services privately.

1mp98oa,GM (37m) How to move forward and grow income,"General Manager (37m) at a small (25 employee) company.

I’ve been with the company just over 15 years. I started in 2010 as a field level helper. Gained some professional certifications, moved through the ranks etc. and in 2023 I finally took my last step to acting General Manager. I operate under the sole owner who is reaching retirement age and whom I see or talk to once or twice a week when he pops in. 

I look after all operations of the company including sales, HR, staff management (hiring / firing), performance reviews etc. in my first 2 years in the position I have increased gross revenue from 4.8-6.5m and from an overall business perspective I would say things seem to be running

My current remuneration is 150k, new vehicle every 2 years, fuel card, and an annual bonus of around 10-15k. I haven’t had a formal contract since I’ve taken this new position, the owner seems hesitant to create one. 

I have no formal post secondary education other than some business management courses I’ve taken on the side. I hold professional certifications relating to my current field of business.

I occasionally receive job offers from competitors with similar remuneration packages.

I’m looking for suggestions on how to move forward with my career and grow my salary from my current level? ",witchhunt_999,1,1.0,3,1755102667,2025-08-13 16:31:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mp98oa/gm_37m_how_to_move_forward_and_grow_income/,8,2025

I’ve worked for the NHS for 10 years and would like to leave and change my career because I’ve been dissatisfied in all my jobs working in corporate businesses like the NHS. Pure admin based roles do not suit me and I’m looking for something that suits my values but given the fact that I don’t have previous experience other than admin it’s difficult.

I’d like to get into support/mentor/mental health support work, something that makes a difference in peoples lives possibly with younger people to young adults I work full-time and it’s difficult for me to do any courses that aren’t part time. I’m wondering if anyone can advise how to get into that that line of work I haven’t got a great deal of money but I can do some courses. What I do have is about 25 years of personal experience with mental health and receiving my own therapy. I’m very well informed about mental health and the effects that it has on peoples lives.

Finances are fine no debt at this point, spouse is going to keep working and I’ll go on their insurance. Background: Our team is a revolving door of leadership. I’ve had over 10 bosses and one was around for 6 years so that skews the average time. I’m not a good fit with the team anymore, I’m tired, burned out, and it’s simply time to go. Performance reviews are good, but raises are a joke. I’m a pushover and have become a dumping ground, that’s my own fault. I have no back up and my job is oddly complicated. it’d take a full year to go through the whole cycle of year end, new year, and there are situations that may arise only once a year and sometimes maybe only once every few years. there are more exceptions to the rules than there are rules - so it’s not like someone can follow a defined procedure.

1mp5ugx,How do I deal with jobs calling my previous employer without permission instead of just my previous employer before that?,"I am running out of jobs to apply to that are close enough to afford to Uber. I have applied to over 15 jobs and have either nothing or automatic rejection letters. Even from Sam's club which is owned by Walmart which hires everyone. 

This isn't normal. Last time I looked for a simple retail job I got several call backs right away. Which means that it is either A) they are calling my last job without permission and listing to the manager talk shit about me; or B) it's because I'm female which I don't see that being too likely because I live in a Blue State 

If I leave my last job off my resume there is then a 4 year gap in employment which isn't explained away by a simple white lie ""I was talking care of a sick family member"" like a year gap would be. 

My mom thinks I should just leave the job with bad management that harassed me constantly off my resume and just say that I was taking care of a sick family member.

I know I didn't come back from my lease of absence but what was said before I left was the breaking point and I tried to get the union representative to transfer me both because of the harassment and because I moved to far away to Uber and she didn't address the harassment and only said ""you live to close to the store still for a mandatory transfer"" and stopped replying to my emails.

There are two places I refuse to work because of how they treated my friends but other than that I've applied to pretty much all the stores in the area. I just need one stupid minimum wage job so my mom's boyfriend stops yelling at me about not paying bills. Is that really too much to ask? 

How do I handle this? A) Leave job off resume and follow my mom's advice B) Keep futility applying to jobs C) write some kind of cover letter or D) theaten to see previous employer unless they transfer me because I'm still in the system as employed since I never came back from FMLA.

Currently I'm interning as a Data Analyst at a startup as well (they are very willing to offer me FTE at 3-4LPA complete WFH).

Now I got a mail that I am selected for Supply Chain Fellowship Program in a well known startup (nutrition & fitness brand, product-based). It is a 1 year program, non-technical role, & 7LPA compensation WFO. After fellowship, if I continue, I may be offered junior manager role.

Initially I was planning working as Data Analyst for few years, then transitioning to Data & Analytics Manager sort of roles. But this will be a different field. And I don't know whom to ask apart from GPT, and Internet. Can you please help me make an informed decision.

2. **Salary growth** \- Which option is likely to be better in the long term?
3. **Career direction** \- Will it be challenging to transition back into a technical/data-focused role after completing a non-technical managerial fellowship?
4. **Path -** What are the typical career paths of people in supplychain roles? Is this is better role than Supplychain Analyst?

Worst Cases - Worst case for pwc will be that they dont offer me FTE, and I can start job hunt again (since already in hometown so not much to lose as well), and will have Data Analyst exp to show for the 6 months.

For a long time, I’ve had plans to pursue my master’s, and I even started the process. I resigned from my job and everything. But with the current job market, my age, and family concerns, my family isn’t happy with my decision.

The job I resigned from gave me a lot of stress due to a toxic work culture and office politics, which left me mentally drained. I usually don’t shout at anyone, but with all that stress, I even ended up showing my frustration to friends and family, often unknowingly. Now I’m also confused. I don’t even have a job at the moment, and I’m not sure if this is the right path for me. I feel stuck, with no motivation, and there’s not much time in my hands because of family pressure to settle in my career.

I’ve also been feeling unfulfilled with the work I’ve been doing, like nothing I do really excites me anymore. Sometimes I feel like no one truly understands me. Fortunately, I do have people who are there for me most of the time, and I’m grateful for that, but there are moments when I still feel lost, depressed, unhappy, and empty. Most of the time, I just sit and cry silently, overthinking everything, and I can’t seem to focus properly whether it’s office work or even simple tasks at home. I even find myself crying for no reason, and I honestly don’t know what’s wrong with me these days. Basically, I feel like I’m alone in this huge world, trying to figure everything out on my own.

It’s been miserable here and my bills are going up. I’m not getting any recognitions or any promotions while the last few coworkers I started with have made their way up to management (around the same age). I’ve even been criticized by former coworkers and friends for still working while I’m at. I have a degree and graduated back in 2023. There’s been a lot of job openings where I’m from I applied to and by surprise they’ve been wanting interviews. My mom thinks it’s a big risk to leave my job I’m at now because I’ll be working in a new environment and not know the risks. She’s been fired before but back in her day had more opportunities.

1mp3sd1,Need help choosing a niche where I can attract quality clients,"Hey everyone

I need your attention for a minute and some honest suggestions.

I’ve realized that trying to target everyone doesn’t work, so now I want to focus on a specific category where I can attract clients who need real custom solutions.

I previously tried reaching out to photographers. I sent 53 emails to photographers in the US. 15 of them viewed the emails and 7 clicked on my links multiple times. But I still feel like this niche isn’t the right fit for me.

Here’s why I think it didn’t work:

* Most photographers use Wix or other drag-and-drop tools
* I’m experienced with React and Node.js, so that setup doesn’t match what they need
* Photographers often have lower budgets

Now I’m thinking of switching to a niche where people actually need custom functionality that can’t be done with tools like WordPress or Shopify.

For example:

* Custom booking systems
* Membership portals
* B2B order platforms

I’m a bit confused about which niche to go after. I want to target people who actually need complex web apps or advanced websites.

Can you help me with some ideas or suggestions?

Thanks in advance!",Early_Dirt5402,1,1.0,0,1755090035,2025-08-13 13:00:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mp3sd1/need_help_choosing_a_niche_where_i_can_attract/,8,2025
1mp3fo9,Help Deciding Between Two Good Job Offers,"I realize I’m keeping things vague and this is long. I also fully realize I’m in a very lucky position and this is 100% a first world problem. I’m not really looking for specific advice but I’d love any general thoughts to help me make a decision between two job offers.

I’m late-30s and have made a career in sales for commercial construction materials (I have an engineering background). I’ve been in a sales leadership position of some sort for about a decade, but have always kept some customer accounts to keep my skills sharp.

I was promoted about a year ago to a sales management position after my company was acquired and merged with another company. At the end of 2025, my total compensation should be about $450-500K. My compensation is about 1/3 salary and the rest is commission and bonus. Compensation in my industry is largely performance based (most sales positions are 100% commission) and I’m used to that pressure and fluctuation of income.
I recently hit the end of my rope and realized I hate my job. There are employees that came from the merger that are extremely difficult to work with and I would’ve never hired myself. HR is making it extremely difficult to do anything about it and thus I’m bearing the daily burden and mental load. I think I’m a pretty good leader/manager but this mess will take years to untangle and I’m not up for the task at this stage of my life.

I’m now in the enviable position of having two new job offers from other companies in the industry. Job 1 came from a headhunter who reached out to me, and Job 2 came from an easy phone call to a competitor. I conveniently do not have a non-compete agreement to worry about.

Job 1:
Business development for a national player owned by private equity. Base salary of ~$220K with a projected year end bonus of 30% if we hit our target. Bonus can go higher if we exceed our target (technically unlimited bonus). I think I can negotiate a guaranteed bonus for the first year or two. This would be a remote position with moderate regional travel - probably 2 nights a week for 3 weeks of the month. This is a new group/project within this organization.

Job 2:
Vague sales position for a direct local competitor of my current company. There is not an open position. In their own words, they want to hire “A-players” and then figure out how to best utilize them. It may turn into a leadership/management position with time. They are an ESOP and have a long history and strong reputation. Pay would be a guaranteed $300K for two years and then likely 100% commission after that. This would be a hybrid job but mostly in an office with a commute.

I’m having a very hard time with the decision.  My gut is not telling me anything. I don’t like being in an office and commuting, but my wife is not crazy about me traveling. They say “Happy wife, happy life,” but what about “Happy dad, not be so sad.” 

Job 1 will be more corporate but may have more opportunity to climb the ladder with time. This does not necessarily mean it will pay more than Job 2. Yes there is travel but I expect more freedom when home to spend with the family and have a clear mind.

Job 2 will be less corporate, but potentially higher pressure. There is no travel but I expect to finish the workday with tasks on my mind and things to do. The best salespeople at Job 2 make into the 7-figures but they work very hard to do it. Unless I hit a jackpot with a unicorn account, I’m happy with mid-6-figures and a moderate amount of stress/time commitment.

It does feel good to be pursued. I have a lot of connections in the industry (one reason I’m being so vague), so I feel confident I could slide to something new if either of these don’t work out. My industry and region have been relatively immune to recessions in the past. Unfortunately most of my industry connections are too closely related to one of these companies, so it’s hard to get objective feedback. That’s why I’m posting here!

Any things to consider that I’m missing?",JuJuJuJJJ,1,1.0,0,1755089081,2025-08-13 12:44:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mp3fo9/help_deciding_between_two_good_job_offers/,8,2025
1mp1qfv,Help for a PhD scientist that got RIFed,"Some context, I was one of the thousands who was RIFed from the US government as a Scientist. I have about 10 years of experience within the following: data processing, management, and analysis as well as conducting reviews and overseeing regulation of scientific manuscripts, statistical analytical plans, clinical trial registrations, and additional products for grantees and stakeholders. I have advanced proficiency in SAS, R, Python, SQL, and SUDAAN. However, I also have the following:

1) I haven’t stayed at a job for longer than three years. Between when I started ten years ago to now, I’ve had to switch due to being a contractor where it was managed between different companies. It was the same job, with the same responsibilities and clients, but because my paycheck came from different companies, it’s often listed on my resume as three job experiences and different job titles.

2) After those years of being a contractor, I became a full-time scientist for the U.S. government. I was incredibly lucky to have had two promotions. I was promoted to a higher-paying role after my first year, then promoted to a senior role my second year, which was my last role. That role lasted less than a year due to being RIFed. 

3) I was also going for my PhD awarded from my university’s Epidemiology and Biostatistics department while I was a contractor and working for the U.S. government. In that time, I gained additional skills such as refining my R and Python skills as well as working with clinical data and claims data (from CMS and MarketScan) as well as dummy versions of electronic health records (from MIMIC-III)

As a result, I’ve been trying to trim my resumes/CVs to either one or two pages for roles such as Data Scientist, Biostatistician, Statistical Programmer, and Epidemiologist. I’ve gotten 9 interviews so far since starting my search in February, but only 1 that went beyond the recruiter/screener interview. Some of the feedback I’ve gotten include not being the right fit, I didn’t have the the right specific experience they were looking for (e.g., even though I have experience with working with claims data, I didn’t have experience working with that data through Optum). I’m aware that employers can be as specific as they want to be, but Im afraid I’m not going to be a “perfect” fit in time before my burn out my emergency savings.

Any advice would be appreciated. For one, would it be better to have my resume as one page or two? I know 10+ years tends to be the agreeable cut-off but I’m just under that. Also, I’m curious to hear how to reduce my work experience when you’ve been with one employer for <4 years with three different titles and different employers/titles for the same position/responsibilities. As-is, my resume is two pages with ~850 word count thanks to this extensive work experience.

1mp1biv,Leaving a toxic workplace after 10 years and nervous,"Hi there!

So I wanted to learn from those that have left careers whether it was worth it. I’m currently working at a workplace that has been toxic, and only getting worse. We’re understaffed, stressed, our managers work from home almost all summer. We’re often dealing with issues with the public on our own.

Theres a job in my field and a new workplace, but it’s a 50 minute commute, and a bit of a lower pay to start. However, it’s full time permanent in a position that will be lighter in the long run. I’m nervous, but I’m seriously debating on applying for it. This job has been taking its toll on my mental health. I’ve been at this place for 11 years, but it’s hard to find full time permanent in my industry. 

If you’ve moved on from toxic jobs, have you found it to be worth it in the long run? Former employees that left before me think it’s a great idea, but I am nervous about the commute, cause as of right now, I’m 2 mins from my work. Id love to hear from you guys.

1mp13cx,Tempted to quit and find part time work at a coffee shop!,"Is this normal for a first job in marketing?

I need to know if this is a typical marketing job, or whether I’m getting totally shafted and abused for my services. I am tempted to quit and find some part time work local to where I live; there's a lovely coffee shop nearby currently hiring, but I could do with some advice regarding this. Here is an outline of my current role:

Job Responsibilities:

\-Run company social media on my own - including scheduling, content creation, data analysis, etc. Multiple posts a week.

\-Design all company artwork, both internal and external.

\-All product data analysis .

\-Organise trade shows. Includes finding stand contractors, designing stands, gathering products for the show, finding the shows, and attending the shows.

\-All internal and external literature. I write all the blogs, design the newsletter and catalogues, and any other literature comes through me. There are no proof-readers or copywriters so it is solely my responsibility.

\-Sales analysis. Look at the full product range and analyse sales for each one. There is no existing data so it is up to me to create and analyse this.

\-Handle product clearance, which involves weekly updates and stock takes, in addition to the graphic design aspect of designing the clearance posters.

\-New product setup - regulate the setup of all new products.

\-Create all company presentations.

\-Manage and set up all customers for our online ordering.

\-Design product FSDUs to be displayed in store (including artwork, weight, what products to include, pricing, etc).

\-Ensure the warehouse and showrooms are kept clean - this is our responsibility.

\-Be the ‘ go to’ person for all product knowledge - which involves time consuming admin work non-marketing related.

\-Gather all samples - which involves going into the warehouse to get them, packing them up, and organising for collection.

\-Control and liaise with courier services to organise all parcels coming in or out.

\-I also have to take regular calls from customers to handle any queries relating to a specific product.

\-Organise and conduct all company photoshoots and wide media material.



For context, the company has an annual turnover in excess of £10m and employs over 200 people, and I earn just over minimum wage. I am in office 5 days a week, which includes a nearly 2 hour commute each way. In all honesty it is making me quite regressive and depressed, but I don't want to 'go backwards' by leaving? This is my first ‘marketing’ job, and it took a LOT of hard work just to get to this point.

1mp0gy1,Advice on moving from private wealth to fintech (UK),"Hi all. I’m currently in a front-office role within private wealth/wealth management in the UK (North). I’ve just turned 30, built solid experience in a client-facing advisory role, navigating regulated environments, and have built a decent size client book. Problem is I’m honestly bored, a bit sick of corporate culture, don’t see myself doing this forever, and struggling to grow my book further (also slightly concerned about the future of the industry). 

I’m therefore looking to pivot into something more entrepreneurial and fast-paced, ideally in something in fintech or adjacent industries. I don’t have an extensive knowledge of the tech industry but some sort of operational, strategic, or product related role might be interesting.

I’m not technical in the coding sense (I did do a VERY little bit of coding at the start of my career in an unrelated role), but I’m commercially minded, financially literate (have a Chartered Wealth Manager qualification), and comfortable working with data, clients, and complex systems. I am looking for something that’s closer to the action — solving problems, contributing to a company’s growth and success, and working in an environment that’s more innovative than traditional finance.

Would really appreciate any advice on:

* What roles might suit someone with this kind of background
* Whether a move into fintech or tech ops/product is realistic
* Where to start asking, looking, researching
* How best to position myself if I don’t come from a traditional tech path

1mozy97,Looking for a Hands-on/Creative Career,"Hey guys. I am very lost and need some help, I'll try to keep it short. 

I'm 20, I  have a diploma in 3D/VFX with a specialization in Game Art. I picked it because I love creating, technology, and art. But I've slowly realized how much I hate sitting inside at a computer all day. I feel sad knowing what it will do to my body and mental health. I've realized how important moving around and being outdoors is to me. I feel really uncertain about changing my mind now, and really don't want to accept that I've made a mistake. But at this point I am just procrastinating and it is time to move forward. 

I've done a lot of thinking, and I want a career where I build things. I love working with my hands. I love fixing things, using tools, working with a variety of materials, but I also love being creative. I am good at math and I find satisfaction in being really good at a software or program (I just don't want to be at the desk *all* the time). I like designing things. I don't mind physical work, I am a Landscaper right now and I love it. (I absolutely adore plants). I don't mind inconsistent or non-traditional work hours. (Like 4 12s or something). I don't mind rain, snow, cold, heat, etc. I love solving problems and being useful. I want to be the expert others come to for advice and help. Basically I just love creating/building, and I really want to do something where I can always learn more and strive for mastery. 

I keep doing career quizzes but I just get disappointed when it gives me anything other than a hands on/trade job. Which maybe is a sign lol.

Some of the things I've considered are: 

Landscape Architect or Designer, Architectural Designer, Architectural Visualization (desk job, unfortunately, but could use my diploma so considered it), Cabinetry and Furniture Technician (big on this one), Carpenter, or some sort of designer? industrial designer? Also drawn to a lot of trades just for the problem solving, hands on aspects of them. 

Some concerns/conditions:

A bit worried about long-term effects on my body from a physically demanding job. So maybe something where when I get older I can move up into a supervisory role or something. 

Work life balance is very important to me. I am big on adventuring and travelling so want good PTO, or a job that takes me places.

Cannot stand the corporate world of unpaid internships, networking on LinkedIn, endless zoom meetings, and all that. I would like to stay away from that lol.

  
TL;DR - I love building and creating and do not want to sit at a desk for the rest of my life. Help lol.

1mozrqh,Should I be scared?,"Hi everyone, I wanted to get opinions on whether the scenario is a red flag to be worried about.

Context - I work in sales, I started off as one of the 4x junior colleagues and there are 4x senior colleagues. There are 2x senior advisers based and 1x junior adviser based in the same branch as my manager. Everyone else works across different offices in different states 

I make a really large call volume, I care about my job, don’t love it, don’t hate it. I do put in early hours here and there and I try my best always. I don’t mind staying back if it means securing a sale and I do check with my manger to make I comply with lead etiquette Adam respect for the whole team

There is that whole dynamic that has died down a little (I think) where my manager and one of her long standing employees are close friends, let’s calls them A . Their husbands are friends, and A  would get more applications and sales to convert and got away being marks, stealing leads etc. A year went by and myself and two others juniors didn’t meet the first half yearly target. I was last on the leaderboard.

We are now in our next sales period. I maintained contact with one of the juniors that left who had years of sales experience, let’s call them B. 1 month ago, I had my first informal chat about targets- my manager was concerned about my targets, she asked how genuine I was in my role. I was gutted. 

Now I’m doing better. I’m working even harder than ever before. I was working hard, I jumped up by almost 10-20 sales - I’m no longer last in the leader board. I’m second last but not so far from the junior adviser based in the same office as my manager. Despite the jump im still a behind from others in the number of overall sales. My manager has been super happy and impressed in one on one meetings. We have one of our quarterly promotional events in September and no one had replaced B, upper management said they were not replacing her position.

For some reason, my manager announced she is coming to my state for the event. The logic we have is why is she coming to my state where there is no one in my team based in the state B used to work in? Should I be worried? B told me she thinks it’s in my manager’s interests for my colleagues in the same brand office to do better because it reflects better on her. I have had the odd application passed onto an adviser based in my manager’s state. She is nice to me directly, but I have had her say comments I’m team meetings , like, “I was going to pick someone but they weren’t available to take on this application but you” or like you seem to have some lucks in getting sales with the new SMS system that we have” 

Am I over worrying? Is she planning on firing me? Is she planning to assign new leads to the colleagues in her branch so I don’t win and she fires me. B says she cannot afford to fire me if the company has not replaced her position?

I recently interviewed for a 6-month contractual Data Analyst role at PWC (in my hometown), where I may get a full time offer after the term. They haven't offered anything but I'm very much positive about me getting selected for the contractual role. Currently I'm interning as a Data Analyst at a startup as well (they are very willing to offer me FTE at 3-4LPA complete WFH).

Now I got a mail that I am selected for Supply Chain Fellowship Program in a well known startup (nutrition & fitness brand, product-based). It is a 1 year program, non-technical role, & 7LPA compensation WFO. After fellowship, if I continue, I may be offered junior manager role. And they did say it is a non-technical role and I may not need to do any technical work at all (unless I want to). And now I need some guidance as this is a major decision and I will be taking a huge step!

Initially I was planning working as Data Analyst for few years, then transitioning to Data & Analytics Manager sort of roles. But this will be a different field. And I don't know whom to ask apart from GPT, and Internet. Can you please help me make an informed decision.

1. **Overall growth** \- Which path offers better prospects for career advancement?
2. **Salary growth** \- Which option is likely to be better in the long term?
3. **Career direction** \- Will it be challenging to transition back into a technical/data-focused role after completing a non-technical managerial fellowship? 
4. **Path -** What are the typical career paths of people in supplychain roles? Is this is better role than Supplychain Analyst?
5. **Worst Cases -** Worst case for pwc will be that they dont offer me FTE, and I can start job hunt again (since already in hometown so not much to lose as well), and will have Data Analyst exp to show for the 6 months. Worst case for supplychain fellowship is that I may not like the role, invest 1 year into a fellowhsip instead of a full-time job, no technical exp to show for the same, though I can work on side-projects",Lower-Candy6711,1,1.0,0,1755075857,2025-08-13 09:04:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mozd54/data_analyst_at_a_big_four_servicebased_company/,8,2025
1moz1vi,I (25M) fear I have ruined my chances at succeeding in life and need help.,"I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I'm a little desperate and thought I'd try my luck.

A little about me, in 2018 I joined a top 20 university in the world for my engineering major.  But with covid and depression hitting hard, I spent 6 years trying to complete the degree. In the end, I failed an exam once more than I was allowed to, and was kicked out. It was the worst time of my life.

Thankfully, a decent-ish university in my home country offered to accept me as a transfer student directly into the penultimate year of study, in the same major. I'm doing extremely well in the course, but I can't help but feel like my entire life has been irreparably damaged. When I apply for internships in my country, my education history shows that I have spent 8 years and changed 2 universities to complete this degree. I have some good internships from my old university under my belt, but I fear it's not doing enough to sway companies to give me a chance.

So what do I do now?
I've contemplated master's, but will any good university accept me with this background? 

For internships, I have been advised to remove any mention of my old university along with any internships I did in that period to give me a better chance. Is that a good idea?

I appreciate any advice. Thank you for reading.",ThrowawayTruth10101,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1755074645,2025-08-13 08:44:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1moz1vi/i_25m_fear_i_have_ruined_my_chances_at_succeeding/,8,2025

1mowt5v,6 Career Lessons From a Cynical Employee,"After close to 15 years of working, some things have remained fundamental to survival and peace of mind. I learned some of these lessons the hard way, and some through the mistakes of others.

**1. Email is your friend** \- Document all important discussions and points. Politics is inevitable. When the crap hits the fan and everyone starts pointing fingers, this is the only thing that can help you.

**2. Allies maybe. Friends not really** \- Good colleagues are a blessing, and some can be allies in a common cause at work. But when it's a question of preserving one's paycheck, no one is anyone's friend. 

That being said, I'm in touch with certain ex-colleagues even after several years, and we've gone on to become friends.

**3. Loyalty is outdated. Look out for yourself** \- It doesn't matter if you worked weekends, missed birthdays and sacrificed your personal life. If they have to let you go, they will without a second thought.

It's worth sticking to the right place and building if it checks all the right boxes (pay, culture, learning...). But if you get a better offer that also checks all the right boxes, think hard about it.

**4. Efficiency is great. Being overly efficient is detrimental -** Meeting deadlines establishes you as an efficient, reliable person. But there are no prizes for completing work well before the deadline. You could end up getting other people's tasks as well, which is a blessing for slacker colleagues.

**5. 'Above and Beyond'. Sure, but within limits** \- There's no harm in staying *a little* over time, or taking on some work that goes beyond your role. This actually helps you just about stave off the rubbish 'accusation' that you don't go above and beyond. The trick is to not make your manager think they can start dumping more work or tighter deadlines on you.

**6. Take your days off. You deserve it** \- There are no prizes for not taking time off either. There is a whole world out there beyond the office. Spend time with family, travel, read - that's what matters.

**What would you add to this?**",Yeda_Rogue,132,0.9900000095367432,25,1755066045,2025-08-13 06:20:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mowt5v/6_career_lessons_from_a_cynical_employee/,8,2025

1mov1kw,Is self- employment really all it's cut out to be?,"I'm nearing 50 in a few years, so I'm like 15 years or less away from retirement!!! (To show I'm not just starting out in the working world).

Dilemma: Stay at my salaried job with excellent benefits, a state pension, but upper management headaches & budget cutbacks ( no raises or growth opportunities). I will say at this point in my life & career, I already paid my dues & already climbed the corporate ladder, so I don't nessicarily need anymore growth potential. I'm fine where I am, but the biggest drawback is burnout from being overworked due to them cutting junior members positions and making us pick up their workload & from corporate bueuracy. Golden handcuffs essentially. 

OR starting my own business ( doing what I do now, just in my own). The only advantage I see here is growth potential and control ( no corporate bueuracy). BUT realistic I would make about the same but without the excellent benefits & pension & I imagine my workload would be just as large if not bigger due to being a ine- woman show with less infrastructure. 

I'm not really sure it going solo is a good idea in this situation. Thoughts?

1mov150,Advice for quitting a job where you are not on great terms with your boss? And the implications of quitting will be quite bad for the organization?,"Hi there, 

I’m booking in a meeting for tomorrow or next to quit my job. I’ve only been here about 8 months but the job is not the right fit and I’m very unhappy. I got a really good job offer elsewhere (field pivot which I think will be good for me, and way more money) and I accepted it and now need to quit. 

My boss is remote for a while so I should quit over zoom (would love to just do an email but zoom is more respectful and immediate I feel)

I do not think my quitting will be taken well at all. There is another 10 months left on my contract that I won’t be completing (already checked and there is no clause regarding consequences for not finishing). They will have a very very hard time replacing this role as it is a management role with a lot of direct reports, and very niche in terms of the multitude of skill sets and experience you need to have (to do all the tasks within the job description, to manage all the wide variety of  staff roles and departments underneath the role). AND because the FT staff comes back in 10 months so it would be a short contract ..

Any advice on how to handle this situation? I’ve quit jobs before but always on much better terms (ie 
: had been there a while, and was leaving for growth reasons, this is the first time I’m quitting for health/mental health). This will be the hardest one I think as it will be both surprising, and VERY challenging to deal with the repercussions

1mouwgj,Insurance Career Advice,"Hi guys, I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this question but here I got, I need some career advice in the insurance industry. 

So I live in South Africa, I currently have 6 years experience working in a call centre and doing insurance administration work. I'm also almost done completing two insurance related qualifications so that I can work as a claims adjuster or insurance underwriter because I want a better salary. However, I've noticed that claims/underwriting/policy administration roles get paid pretty much the same or close enough salaries to claims adjusters and underwriters. I really enjoy administrative work and the whole reason I was focused on becoming an adjuster or underwriter is because I wanted more money - but if administrators get paid the same or close enough to the same, then I feel like I might as well stay in administration right?

I'm currently paid very little because I work for a call centre, but once I've completed my qualifications in the next month really, I plan on looking for work at an actual insurance company where the salaries are much better. My only question is, can administration be a long term career? Is it unambitious because some people see administration as low skill work. I'm thinking long-term here, I want a career that I can work in till I retire at like 65 or something, and I know many people see administration as just a stepping stone to a bigger role. But is it actually possible to have a long career in administration alone? Is it wise to stick to that since I enjoy it and it pays well enough for me, or should I go ahead and try to become an adjuster/underwriter?

1moumzi,SHOULD I CONSISTENT WITH THIS OR NOT?,"Since childhood, I've pursued everything in a unique way, driven by a love for being different and trying new things in life. However, as I progressed to sixth and seventh grade, I began preparing myself to become a doctor. At that time, I realized my love for the field of medicine and understood that pursuing a career as a doctor would allow me to excel, given its alignment with my personality, skills, and interests.

I love interacting with people, helping them, elevating their well-being, and making them feel okay. Overall, I love being in this field because I think I can fulfill my purpose in serving people. There's no escaping from this passion – I've had excellent grades until now, and my trust in studying medicine will never fade away.

Encouraged by this passion, I chose science in my higher secondary education, opting for the pre-medical track. Now, as I prepare for university entrance tests for MBBS, thoughts circulate in my mind: After securing admission in a university, am I truly in the race? Am I following a path trodden by thousands or millions of people? Why am I not trying something new at this stage in my career, despite having the same passion for being a doctor?

These thoughts and questions lead me to wonder: Is it really worth doing it? Am I following the same note as many others? These thoughts come to my mind again and again. Does anyone else feel the same?

Do I include that 10 years of other experience, or will that make me seem overqualified?

\- summarise it as e.g. '2014-2020 Various roles in project adminstration etc etc insert relevant key skills here', or

\- do I select specfic, most-relevant jobs from that time, which would leave it looking like I have a CV gap, or

Not because I dont have the passion for it, but because of everything that is going on right now,  live in the US, cutting of funds, wanting to take down the whole education department and whatever else they trynna do, to make lives miserable. Plus teachers have always been under paid. I'm terrified of the kids, they are rude and disrespectful and much more. 

Also my financial situation right now, tuition keeps going up and my aid keeps getting lower. I keep having to take out higher loans and I'm already over 15k in debt. And I dont see the point anymore in getting in dept to do something I unfortunately wont get to enjoy. I keep thinking I should have gone to trade school to either become a mechanic or electrician, since I would also like to do those things. I have no experience in either, Ik how to change oils and fluids in my car buts that's it.

Ik it's possible to transfer from university to trade school, Idk if my school does it tho. I'm just thinking that for the amount of one year of university, I could have gone and completed trade school and probably have a stable job. 

Should I keep going and graduate University and just stay with being a teacher? should I transfer? Or should I do both things? Finish Uni and then go to trade school become an electrician? Doesn't even have to be electrician, can I become a carpenter how do I go about doing that?

1mosaji,How do I get my foot in the door? (accounting),"Hi all,

I’m looking to start my career in the accounting field in New Zealand, specifically in the Wellington Region, but I’m finding it harder than expected to secure that first role. I admit, I am only in my first year of uni, and thus do not expect to actually get anything this year, or even particularly far into next year, but I would still like try.

I’ve been applying for entry-level positions like accounts assistant, AP/AR, and junior accountant, I even reached out to some local accounting agencies about a possible internship, but it seems most companies are asking for “3-4 years’ experience” even for beginner roles. I’m not sure if there’s another route I’m missing.

If you’ve worked in accounting here — or recently broken in — I’d love to hear what worked for you. Are there particular recruiters, job boards, or companies that are worth targeting?

Any advice, personal stories, or even reality checks would be massively appreciated. I’m ready to work hard; I just need to figure out where to start.

1morubd,"Manager got promoted, hiring a new middle manager to run my team. Underpaid what to do","Currently at level 7, boss just got promoted to level 9 and is now hiring a level 8. New manager level 8 won’t be on boarded before middle October at earliest. 

I’m certainly not qualified for the level 8 yet.  They need someone with a ton of experience and I’m not there yet. They also posted a peer position for me paying 25k over my salary, so now I have that as a bench mark.

I’ve delivered and gone above and beyond over and over, and was planning on asking for a raise anyway but now with the new manager how do I do that. But only been here 18 months. I’ve saved the company roughly 400 MM in that time.

I’m on new bosses team, who didn’t hire me, the level 9 did. lm asking for 12% which puts me in line with peer companies and the peer position. I really don’t want to leave, I need stability now, getting married in April and don’t want distractions.  But willing to do that if they stonewall.

How do I play the politics here. 


1. Go to new boss despite them not knowing me, the company, the culture, the system. Ask for 10% explain why, xyz. Don’t engage level 9, trust new boss will do the right thing and communicate that up. 

2. New boss all the above but also level 9 after I give new boss a heads up? If this how do I give the heads up that I’m taking to level 9 regardless of the current convo.

3. Level 9 only circumvent the new boss.

1morrgd,Gen X Tech Leader / Job Seeker Concerns,"I'm a Gen X tech leader considering a career change back to an individual contributor role, and I'm facing some unique challenges.

First, I'm older than most job seekers (particularly the roles I'll be applying to). Second, I'd like to find individual contributor roles rather than management positions. Without going deep into my work history, I haven't been below an executive leadership role for a long time. The other big issue I'm facing is I'm somewhat well known in my industry and my local market as a ""tech leader."" 

I'm not a unicorn founder or anything like that (though I've had a couple successful exits), but I've been heavily involved in the innovation and tech community in my home city for over a decade. I'm a tech and entrepreneurship advisor and guest lecturer at a few universities. My state government has sent me to international conferences to represent our local ""tech economy."" Anybody that does a basic search for me is going to come across a lot of recent news and radio interviews, articles I've written, white papers I've published, videos of me speaking at conferences, etc. 

Several months ago, I applied to a few job, and got pretty far with one role in particular that I was interested in. Ultimately during the final interview - with the VP of the division (I was curious why I was even meeting with someone at that level given the position) - we got through some basics and then he finally got around to asking why someone with my experience would want to ""take several steps down"" to the role I was interviewing for. I answered honestly - that's the type of work I enjoy and I'd like to get back to doing more of it rather than managing. He pushed back on this, asking wouldn't I miss the leadership role. I said no, I never really wanted to be in those roles, it was always something I had to do to move my companies forward and while I'm always available to help, I prefer doing more of the hands on work. His attitude and expression seemed to turn after that. Needless to say, I didn't get the role, and didn't get any feedback as to why. 

My core question is: how do I navigate the job search and interview process when my public-facing 'tech leader' persona conflicts with my desire for an individual contributor role?

Side note - I need to keep the job search out of view of current and prospective consulting clients.",OneNight9284,1,1.0,0,1755050047,2025-08-13 01:54:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1morrgd/gen_x_tech_leader_job_seeker_concerns/,8,2025

First off, I’m 24, and I’ve never had a job, always had everything I wanted when I was a kid and I’ve been living comfortably with my father’s inheritance since I moved out to college.

Been 2 years now since I stopped going to college (didn’t finish it) and I find myself in an endless cycle of searching for potential autonomous careers, typically photography or filmmaking, start learning the craft as well as searching about the market (mainly if the market is profitable) and giving up after finding out its not.

But it just hit me, I think i’m “scared” of not earning good money… and not in the way of being scared of not living well, but rather because of my ego. As finicky as it sounds, i believe its really something thats keeping me stuck. I prefer not to do anything, just to not have to tell anyone what I do, than doing something and earn little money from it. 

And I don’t want to be this way. I want to change. I’m not the most ambitious and I am kind of lazy but I want to do something with my life that I’m proud of. In my heart I don’t care too much about the money, obviously I want to be rich, everyone does, but it’s not something I’d sacrifice my mental health for, but in my head, this stupid fear keeps me stuck… I’m not sure if it makes sense.

Here’s what’s actually worked for me:

I optimized my LinkedIn profile with keywords recruiters are actively searching for, after doing this, I started getting 3–5 more recruiter messages per week on average. I joined industry-specific groups and commented on posts. Did you know comments can boost your visibility by up to 60%? This simple habit got me noticed by people I’d never connected with before. I used niche job boards like Dice, Mediabistro, and Idealist to find roles tailored to my skills. For remote work, I leaned on platforms like We Work Remotely and FlexJobs, and made sure to highlight my virtual collaboration skills, this directly led to 2 interview invites in the first month. One thing I’ve learned? Over 80% of jobs come through networking, not cold applications.

1moo0o9,Tips/ Guidance on transitioning from Field Engineering,"
Hey everyone,

I'm hoping to get some advice from this community. I've been a field engineer in the semiconductor industry for a few years now, and I absolutely love what I do. I have almost four years experience combined with (inline and final probe w. experience on MDP tools as a Engineering Technician). The technology is fascinating, the challenges are always new, and the pace is incredible. It’s an industry I’m passionate about.

However, the reality of the travel and the demanding schedule has been harder on my family than I ever anticipated. I'm missing out on too many ""firsts"" with my kids and quality time with my fiance. It's a tough decision, but I've realized that I need to find a role that allows me to be home more.

My educational background is an ECET degree and a B.S. in Computer Engineering Technology. 

I'm currently looking to pursue my true passion, which is to become a Process Engineer. I am entertaining the idea of applying for an online nanotechnology graduate program to help me achieve this, which I believe is the perfect stepping stone.

My question for all of you is: What is the best path forward? How can I leverage my field engineering experience to land a process engineering role? Do I need to finish my master's first, or are there entry-level process roles that will consider someone with my background and career goals? Are there any certifications I should obtain in lieu of getting my Graduates degree?

Any advice, personal stories, or tips on navigating this career change would be incredibly helpful. 

Thank you all for listening.",TimeAttackTalon,1,1.0,0,1755039967,2025-08-12 23:06:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1moo0o9/tips_guidance_on_transitioning_from_field/,8,2025

I’m two months pregnant and feeling overwhelmed. I’m financially struggling, in debt, and barely making ends meet. I know things will get tougher with the baby on the way, so I need to make a change – fast.
For some background, I worked at Tesla for 6.5 years and for the last 1.5 years of that time, I was an engineering technician working with HVAC systems. However, I never went to school for this and don’t have any type of degree. Unfortunately, I was affected by the mass layoffs at Tesla about a year and a half ago. Now, for the last 6 months, I’ve been working as a server at a casino. I make the majority of my money from tips, but it's not consistent.
I’m not necessarily looking to stay in the same field—I’m open to exploring new career paths—but I wanted to share my experience in case it helps narrow down recommendations or maybe could help me in the long run. I’m looking for something that would take less than a year that will help me land a good-paying job, something stable that can support me and my growing family.
If anyone has recommendations for fields or programs that fit this description, I’d love to hear your suggestions!
Also, if anyone knows of scholarships, grants, or financial assistance for pregnant women, I’d really appreciate any leads!

I know if I jump again it’ll be for more money but idk if I even have the skills to market myself like that at this point. Thinking of joint the air national guard to repurpose myself and try something new. Otherwise I can’t see myself doing this forever let alone another 5 years. Would love some feedback on people switching roles or finding resources to pinpoint their new careers or “life’s purpose.” Cheers.

1mokj0o,How to study and become great without AI (CS inquiry),">

*I am thrilled to announce that AI has taken over our minds, and (I'm sure that) hundreds of thousands of people have become infected with the great pandemic known as AI. Beware that this disease only affects juniors in the Software world, and it strips them of the ability to turn over anything meaningful without the help of AI writing their code, and more importantly, relying on it for research instead of actually manually learning the art of research and self-study.*

Now that we have this out of the way, I want to lay down a couple of points to my person:

\- I might be wrong about AI turning our brains smoother than a scoop of ice cream when it comes to studying, but I have come to the realisation that, in my view and experiences, I have become greatly dependent on ChatGPT for my research. I ask **Gipiti** sooner than **Google** when I have a question, and I let it teach me when I have a problem with my code sometimes.

\- I know that AI has its place in our modern world, and it has great applications; for example, when I tell it to give me a study plan, or if I ask which everyday foods have the most electrolytes, or to summarize a text for me, it's perfect for that.. But we shouldn't go farther than simple assistant duties, summaries or a bit of Googling.

\- I am 21, I come from Europe, and I want to become a Software Engineer from self-studying without a degree, but I don't know which way I should specialize towards yet (maybe automation), so let's just stay at that.

This post is a simple question which I would like to get answered by the people who are way ahead of the game or simply have a ton of experience in the field.

**The Question**:

How should I study? Which study hacks might you very smart people have for me to absolutely minimise or, better, completely eliminate the use of AI in my study-journey? I have a list of 25-ish certifications, which cover almost all possible points in the broad meaning of working in the field of IT.

**I simply don't want to be too dependent on the AI to study (and work in the future) instead of me or use tools which do the work for me, for I want to be the one who does the studying and the working; I want to be the one whose brain cells are multiplying, not the AI's.**

This includes using code editors which heavily integrate AI into the workflow, and / or any future Software Development tool which I might find myself studying or working with in the future.

So? What should or shouldn't I do? How should I start?

Thank you in advance.

1mok4ws,Considering an offer from Warner Bros. Discovery- any thoughts on long-term stability?,"Hey folks,

I’ve been offered a job at Warner Bros. Discovery, and the pay bump is impressive. The catch? I’m a bit worried about the company’s long-term stability over the next three to five years.

Here are the things that have me a bit uneasy:

Heavy debt load. WBD has reportedly carried tens of billions in debt since merging WarnerMedia and Discovery.

Ongoing restructuring. They’re planning to split into two public companies, one focused on streaming and studios, the other on traditional TV and networks.

Shifting strategy. While the split might sharpen each company’s focus, it also comes with execution risks and potential instability.

I’d love to hear from anyone who knows the entertainment industry, has firsthand experience at WBD, or has seen companies pull off splits like this successfully or not.

Some specific questions:

Is WBD likely to be a safe place to work for the next few years given all this debt?

Could the split lead to layoffs, culture shifts, or internal uncertainty that would affect employees?

Or is this a smart strategic pivot that could actually make things more stable?

1mok4jl,How stupid it is to give an ultimatum/negotiate hard for a promotion?,"You have heard stories similar to mine a million times, but here we are.

Boss is ignoring efforts and value I am generating in the company, delaying as much as possible a promotion. I have two options:

1) push with clear intention that no promotion means I will immediately start looking into a different (internal) position, with the risk of losing one of the team member with the highest experience and knowledge.

2) ignore, do not negotiate, and look for something else internally and move once I manage to find a position of interest.

The issue is going on since a while, so I have some pressure to make a move. I have discussed promotion and backed up with measurable impact I have generated and can generate by moving up. The answer is always that there is “something still to fix, still to learn, visibility still to be created”. If I follow the guidance, it just looks like a never ending road, with “still something else that must be done before going up”. 

I didn’t go fully on option 2) because I couldn’t find anything of interest for me yet. I don’t want to change company because I like it quite a lot, it is great.

1mojgb7,"Guilt, leaving FT with benefits for PT","I left a super stressful job in higher education for what I was hoping would be a less stressful job. It is better in a lot of ways. Decent benefits, generous PTO.  But I am working in HR and I think I hate it. I am constantly doing things that go against my personal beliefs and morals. I've decided to get an accounting degree online and try a new direction that pays better. I already have a Master of Education in Admin & Supervision in Higher Ed, but I do not want to work in that field anymore.

In the meantime, I also run a small retail business with my husband. We are struggling and I think it would make a big difference if I could be around to help out. I am considering quitting my full time, benefitted job that I don't like, then finding a part-time job I don't care about so I have more time to work on my degree and business.

For one, I feel really guilty leaving the job I have. I have only been here 10 months and have become fairly critical to the operation. I have a couple of work friends that I will absolutely leave high-and-dry if I resign. I am the only HR person onsite for a warehouse with 100+ employees. I order supplies and handle all our catering for major meetings. I've also done a lot of good around here for employee engagement programming and I think all that would stop if I left. Not to mention, this company's systems are horrible and it takes 6 months or more to get someone comfortable in this role. They hired me expecting me to stay a few years. The pay isn't the worst but it's also not very good ($25/hr).

On the other hand, I am being made to compromise my morals fairly often, and my boss has us doing some things I think may be illegal (e.g. questioning people on the nature of their illnesses to gauge whether absences could be excused under FMLA). 

The next biggest issue is insurance. I have been in jobs with benefits for so long, I don't know how people get reasonable insurance outside of work now. When I look at Marketplace, the cheapest plans are $350 or more a month, but I've talked to several people who pay less than $100-$200. 

I guess I don't know what advice I need. I am a good employee and I feel guilty leaving, but I also work for a giant corporation who could do better by their employees and chooses not to.

I am currently working as a Clinical Research Coordinator and have previous experience as a Clinical Trial Associate. While I enjoy the coordination and stakeholder management side of my work, the biotech industry I am in is highly funding-dependent, meaning job stability can be shaky.

* Lots of experience in multi-site coordination, vendor management, and regulatory submissions
* No formal “project manager” title yet

They said you'd have to walk 5-10 minutes after finding a lot and then pay for the lot and they don't reembursed. They're also paying only 68k. The area is also an iffy area for crime. It's near a casino, the courthouse and a rehab facility.

1moilsj,Looking for experiences from entrepreneurs who imported a tool/business model from abroad to their local market.,"Hey everyone,

I've been thinking a lot lately about business ideas that already work well in other countries, but have not really taken off in mine (I live in Mexico btw). I'm curious to hear some stories from entrepreneurs who have actually tried importing a tool, service, or concept from another country / region into their own.  
One specific example that baffles me is the lack of digital architectural blueprints in Mexican architectural companies. I'm talking about easy-to-access, well-made, digital floor plans for apartments and houses. Companies like Matterport are a good reference, they create incredibly high-quality 3D renders and virtual tours for real estate. In Mexico that is often not the case and has not gone mainstream... it is not the norm.

And that's not even going into the possibilities: renting a warehouse as a physical showroom for difrerent types of apartments / towers is another thing I do not see in Mexico, with some sort of VR integration so that potential buyers can ""walk through"" spaces that don't even exist yet.

I can't help but feel like the local architecture and real estate industry is lagging far begind the U.S. in these areas.

Maybe there are some elevated operational costs idk. I'd love to hear success stories! (*cautionary tales are invited as well!)*

1mohdgc,Stay in a safe position that is going nowhere or change jobs?,"Hi there,

So I am currently in an unofficial management position that will become official by the end of the year (European bank, they only change their hierarchy twice a year, so any official promotions have to wait until those dates). I work directly for a someone who is directly underneath the C-Suite. It's a large regional bank that doesn't pay very well (none of them do), but my boss tried to soothe that pain with a personal bonus that went beyond the usual union rates (it's still not a lot, but I won't suffer either). I was hired only in 2023 for a specialist position and since my former boss and colleagues quit, I was the only specialist in that field left. I will describe it broadly by saying that it involves sales and a lot of competition. My former colleagues leaving has nothing to do with the job and everything to do with them. My position will be that of a team leader, but, given the position my boss is in, I have direct access to the C-Suite, which means that my unofficial position is much higher than my official one and will continue to be so. I am invited to important meetings and have a hand in strategy.

I got my position because they didn't have anyone else. I also received permission to build an official team, something they didn't have when they hired me. My boss holds me in high esteem and I got the highest points in the yearly evaluation of his whole area of responsibility.

Now to the issue: the bank isn't actually ready for what I do. There are three components to being successful in this area, and my bank doesn't perform well in any one of the three, so that its difficult to get business. I have basically been told by my customers, who are all professionals, as I work in a B2B capacity, that they enjoy working with me and find me very professional, but that my bank sucks.

I have tried to change things, but we are talking about an old regional bank. Conservative thinking dominates and the decisions about which direction to go and what risk to take on aren't taken by those people who act, i.e. sales, but the people in the back office, who have never gained frontline experience, meaning that they are not only overly cautious, but they also expect customers to just appear out of nowhere (as they have in the past), while they have completely slept on the market becoming digital, meaning that customers are more likely to be much better informed than they were. I have been told in no uncertain terms that this won't change. That means that I lead a team that has very little to do and will make just enough money to cover expenses, but will never amount to much because the bank isn't ready for what I do. Nor will I gain special rights that will allow me to make more money. I will be busy enough, as they are giving me projects and the like, because who doesn't like a busy body you can drop all your annoying stuff on?

My CV isn't exactly filled with long stints, nor have I had much success in academia. I am a great worker, I push where other give up and in a B2B setting I earn full marks from customers, who find me believable, reliable and honest to boot. In the past two years I have torn down as many walls as I was able to and reorganized what they allowed me to reorganize. But that's it. Nothing left to change and I am becoming disillusioned, as having actual success by making money for the bank is what I am supposed to do, but can't do, because the bank won't change.

I realize that two years isn't a lot of time, but I have risen quickly in that time and have reached everything I can currently reach. I am well regarded, so I am ensured a position, but I won't be able to change more than a hundred years of thinking enough for me to be successful in my area. So I can stay in my safe position that isn't going anywhere, put a management position on my CV, try to find something in my private life that will distract me and hope that my more exalted position will yield a better position somewhere else in time. My patience, never very enduring, will make this difficult, but I could spent the bank's money to collect some training courses and the like which will provide me with some certificates, further polishing my CV.

Or I can start applying for other jobs, which, given the current economic climate, won't yield another management position any time soon.

I won't make quick decisions, but I still wonder what to do. What do you think?",Anachron101,1,1.0,1,1755024669,2025-08-12 18:51:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mohdgc/stay_in_a_safe_position_that_is_going_nowhere_or/,8,2025

Now it seems they have both decided to try and get me and my team on their side, to prioritize their projects over the others. They also each has started to bad mouth the other to me and ask me to change things behind the other's back.

I don't like office politics, and I don't think it's wise to pick a side here, either of them can get me and my team in trouble. But trying to please them both is not possible either as there's simply not enough resources.

1mog66w,Tested 3 certified Fiverr resume writers – here's what worked and what didn’t,"There is a HUGE difference in resume writers on Fiverr. I was skeptical at first because the prices were so much lower than what I was used to paying, and there's been hit or miss feedback on Reddit, but I took the plunge and ended up buying 3 different resumes. Because why not?

I contacted 4 writers, and bought services from 3. The 4 I contacted were Charmaine Pocek, Richard Lambert, Cameron G, and Julia W. I didn’t end up working with Julia W. as she is based in Romania. No issue there, but I wanted my resume written by a native English speaker. So the 3 I went with: Charmaine Pocek, Richard Lambert, and Cameron G. I didn’t apply to the same jobs with the resumes I ordered, so this isn’t exactly a controlled experiment. But I heard back from the jobs I applied to most quickly with Richard’s resume. Charmaines was a quick second. I never heard back from any jobs using Cameron’s resume.

Some takeaways from my experience on Fiverr:

If you’re doing your research, make sure you find a writer who is certified. I had to check the PARWCC site directly to confirm CRPW certification. Something I learned the hard way. It seems Fiverr doesn’t screen for this and anyone can claim they are certified. The 3 writers I ended up working with were certified.

A very important factor to not overlook is the focus of the writer. Are they there to give you what you want or are they there to get you hired? The more customer-service oriented writers (Cameron G. and Julia W. (again, I didn’t work with Julia but I did chat with her) were nice enough but I got the feeling they were ‘acting’/‘pretending’ because they wanted me to be happy more than anything else. The serious ones (Richard and Charmaine) had no problem telling me ‘no’, or ‘I wouldn’t do that if I were you’. I get why the ‘pretend’ writers were focused on customer service. It’s a sale after all with a review at the end. But I was there to get traction in my job search above all else. The ‘serious’ writers attracted me with their expertise and guidance. They were both super efficient, which I appreciated.

Avoid the actors. I can’t recommend them for people who are serious about their job search.

Don’t skimp on time either. Put in the time to connect with a writer. Write to them, see if they vibe with you. And better yet, see if they push back on you a little and know what they’re talking about. This was a signal to me that I was working with a real professional.

1mofgg4,"Should I take a lateral job offer with high scope creep, stay where I'm at, or keep searching for better opportunities?","I’m weighing a lateral move from my $100K cloud admin role to a newly acquired private equity–backed company offering the same pay. While they claim financial stability, they asked questions from broad technical range they expect—from VMware and Hyper-V to Cisco ASA, FortiGate, Sonicwall, and Linux—suggests a potentially overloaded “jack of all trades” role. I asked the interviewer and he made it out like I wouldn't be pidgeon holed and would learn new things. Since it's a company owned by PE I'm worried about having to stretch myself thin and being let go.

My current position is a cloud migrations role which demads extra goals including certification completion, 80 hours of linkedinlearning training, 6-15 process improvements, provisioning ticket calls, 2 presentations, all while managing meetings for 2 to 8 cloud migrations projects simultaneously. The goals can be done yearly but it still feels like a lot The main draw was the possibility of better coworkers and a reduced workload, but neither can be guaranteed.

I feel like they're almost rushign me to take to the job too. Because I told the recruiter it was hard to tell if I'm a system admin, network admin, or devops guy because it sounded like the role wanted a little bit of everything. I've worked in understaffed roles where I had to do the job of multiple people before with scope creep. He said that taking tickets is just the responsibility of the job, I'd be learning more by not being pinned to one role, and that I'd never be bored and there's 4 other people on the team. So, idk what to make of that lol. 

My current job also has a lot of goals so that's what has me considering leaving. Interviews have been hard to come by the last 2 years as well, and idk how I'd get the time to interview going forward with how much meetings I have to do at work.

1mofe10,Am I entitled back pay for working outside graded above my station?,"Hi all,

I work for a large company within the UK. 

I’m currently wondering if I can claim pay back for working outside of my pay grade, without knowing. 

I was taught a skill at work, this skill requires the higher pay grade. However I was never notified of this. 

I completed the work for 5 months before taking a 2 week holiday. 

Upon my return I can see that I am no longer skilled in this area and they removed it without telling me. 

I waited 2 weeks before asking just to see if they’d tell me. They didn’t, I had to ask. 

Upon asking they told me they removed the skill as it is of a higher grade and I shouldn’t be doing it. 

My question is, do I have grounds to ask for the difference in pay for the months I completed the work? 

The whole situation is very shady and management are reluctant to give me the time of day in voicing my concerns. It goes to my line manager and no further.

I currently work for a financial compliance firm that specializes in third-party work for banks. I am an AML analyst.

However, I would like to pivot either HR or IT, preferably HR. I have been told I am very personable and outgoing and feel like I would be good in HR. I am good with conflict resolution as well.

I have no prior certification or education in HR or IT, and I have only been working here for about 4 months.

After 6 months to a year, is that enough time to try to make a transfer happen? How do I do that? I’ve been thinking about emailing HR straight up and asking if there’s any entry level work or any extra help they need that I could do to try to pivot that way.

1moe851,Accounting vs Xray/CT/Mri in healthcare,"Hello, I'm presently trying to decide between a career in accounting or healthcare.  
I'm 45 years old and currently run a small business on Etsy.  
I'm really interested in learning new things and starting something new.  
I've worked in Accounting before (entry level), and I really liked the work.    
But what mainly has me conflicted is the schedule and the pay.  With running my business for the last 10+ years I've really grown to love the flexibility in my schedule.  The thought of having to work a 9-5 Monday to Friday at an office is not it for me.  Also, to make decent money in accounting I would need to get education because it seems like entry level still does not pay well.  I really don't want an accounting job where I'm a high level manager or something.. I like being a paper pusher and actually doing the work vs analyzing it or whatever managers do.  
I started thinking about healthcare and the ability to have differing schedules, even work 12 hour shifts for 3 days.  I'm considering doing Radiology Technician (Xrays, CT, MRI).  It's a 2 year program and pays well afterwards.  (more like a 3 year program by the time you do pre-req's and apply)

So, I guess my question is for those who have worked accounting, is it easy to find a job that is not M-F 9-5 in an office?  Are remote/hybrid or flexible jobs out there?  Are there any jobs that actually pay well?",Many_Log4886,1,1.0,0,1755017829,2025-08-12 16:57:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1moe851/accounting_vs_xrayctmri_in_healthcare/,8,2025
1moe4b1,Should I pursue a career in IT or Radiology?,"By Radiology I mean working as a X-ray/MRI technician. Its a 2 years University degree which will cost me £20k+ (and by me I mean the government). But this is in the UK so student loans repayments are lenient. I will start on low £30k / year with the possibility to progress to £60k (over 10 years), which is basically what it caps out at working in healthcare in the UK.

Alternatively, I was considering a career in IT. I got offered an interview for an IT helpdesk role (also at a hospital), the starting salary sucks, I think its £26k/y but with specialization, experience and certification you can become a Network Engineer + Cyber Sec and all of that, with the salary cap being potentially way higher, something like £100k in an ideal scenario.

I'm not particularly passionate about either - though not dispassionate. I enjoy doing a good job, being appreciated and being paid well enough for a comfortable life.  
  
I'm 30 years old, my previous job was in VFX (too unstable)  which was basically computer work. 

Both of these choices were based on practicality. My main goal is to get a foothold in life and build a nest. Healthcare will always be in demand, and Network Engineering is a non-flashy, kinda boring field (sorry) that is also practical and pays well. 

I'm leaning towards radiography because its an easier start, I basically get funding and can begin uni very soon. But.... I don't know. What if I change my mind? IT seems like a really good career in the private sector with many specialisms... and again, I'm thinking about the pay. 

My main worry is IT will be too fast paced, I can be sorta slow sometimes. However, I'm a good problem solver and have experience troubleshooting/debugging and can find answers when I need them. Basically I don't have enough experience to know whether IT or Healthcare will fit me (and more importantly my cognitive profile). I can be quite squeamish with blood, gore and sh\*t, but, I'm a soldier by disposition and can power through anything... other than superiors screaming at me for screwing up, which I am quite sensitive about. The adrenaline junky side of me leans a bit more to healthcare. The idea of being on the ground and moving around helping people appeals a bit more than abstract work. 

If you ask me about passions I don't have any. I do game design in my spare time. I also have a spirituality side quest into non-duality. That's it. 

Thank you for reading this rant, any clarity would be appreciated. ",RizzMaster9999,3,1.0,2,1755017597,2025-08-12 16:53:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1moe4b1/should_i_pursue_a_career_in_it_or_radiology/,8,2025
1modnon,Thinking of quitting after 2 months in,"I changed job just recently into a new company, which was a MNC. While I have hopes that this will be a step up for my career, something seems to bother me a lot. 

At first my initial expectation before joining the team was to have flexi work arrangement because I was working abroad and my family was back in my hometown. This was communicated to the interviewers and manager during our interview session. This will enable me to have more time with my family with the arrangement. During my first day of work, the boss told me that he did not want to make exception in allowing this sort of arrangement. This made me a little bit uneasy as I felt that the time spent with my family will be reduced a lot. Another concern that I have after spending time with the team is on the process that we have to go through just to complete a task, which involves a lot of mundane procedures.

I feel that in both these senses my previous team seems to fit me more, and my ex boss did ask me to contact him in case I felt like going back. The dilemma that I have is that will I been seen as irresponsible to leave the new team so soon? And how will the current team view me if I decides to leave and go back to my ex team?

1modj2x,Job History/Tenure Concern,"Hello! 

Several months ago I left a job at a filtration company doing production maintenance to move closer to family, after a divorce in addition to some mental and physical health issues. I started my current job last October, over time I've noticed some things with my current job at an auto parts manufacturer again doing production maintenance that concern me.  Two months ago I applied to a open role for the same position on a different shift so I could change my current shift ""third"" to first shift, since third has been impacting my overall health and was advised to do so by my primary care provider at a local hospital. A few weeks go by and my manager took me aside to tell me he didn't think I was ready for first shift and to go tell HR I was withdrawing from the position. I never did I just gave up on it and kept working without pushing the issue. During my frustration did ask other co-workers if this was something they thought was true or a load of crap, all of them confirmed they thought I'd be a good fit and it sounded like I was fed a bunch of nonsense. When I started everyone told me in the summer production spikes and we get crazy hours. This never happened I also get a sense of stagnation with company growth,  there are a low amount of orders coming in for parts and other colleagues have made comments about that. Saying things like that it's been slow and things will pick up eventually. I should also note that we have been affected by tariffs for raw material/metals and we had a company wide meeting that said we would possibly slow down and they were looking into way of cushioning the blow. In maintenance I also see that getting things ordered like parts needed is not easy I feel like I have to fight tooth and nail for any part over 10-50 dollars. All this combined with very poor benefits such as no PTO, no sick time, 4 vacation days a year and low pay made me look elsewhere. Well is paid off and i was given a job offer at a better company but with a 40 minute commute my current drive is 10 minutes. Everything is better but i'm a bit concerned that switching to another job so soon will make my resume look bad. So my question is would leaving this job for another look bad on my resume?

1mod6sr,I want a new job but i graduated as a dental technician,"I just finished my master s degree in dental school as a dental technician, been working as a intern in a lab for 2 years and now im on my second year as an employee and im not satisfied with anything this job has to offer.

To start off in my country (Romania) the working schedule is f up, as in the majority of labs are paying the techs by the case (your salary varies depending on the number of cases you do) so you re pressured to work more than 8 hours a day if you want a medium income ( 1000 euro). 

For example last month i worked minumum 10 hours a day just to make 1200 euro for that month. There is also a stress problem because doctors rush us to do a lot of cases in a small time and if we cant do it they just go to another lab to their cases and it gets pretty exhausting after a while. 

The income is not declared as you are pushed to do tax evasion by the employer if you want a higher pay. 

Lastly is the working conditions, it s a lot of dust, lots of dangerous chemicals and lots of injuries because of the rushed pace in which we re working.

Now i want to change jobs, to try something new that may give me a future assurance that im gonna be able to live normally and one day make myself a family that i can support.

The problem is that my only skills are hand crafting, managing and team working, i tried learning 3D modeling but i just get really unhyped because of the rapid AI take over and im afraid that its another thing that will be useless once AI is more advanced.

So i want some advice, maybe from some former dental techs or from someone that had gone through the same fear that i have.

1mocefb,options when promised growth doesn't materialize,"So I began my job with a big real estate company in 2023 as a coordinator. Although the role was advertised as having a range of typical responsibilities, due to our extremely lean staffing, my daily work has consisted almost entirely of processing invoices and checking vendor statements in an inefficient system, often for 60-70 hours a week. I literally just click through hundreds of invoices per day to see if they can be approved for payment. All day, everyday.

I had previous experience as a manager, and joined this company hoping to get my foot in the door with a bigger organization. Also, on the surface, running ""lean"" meant I'd have more opportunities. And my manager told me there would be growth opportunities, and dangled that carrot for a long time. But promotions were held up by the company's inability to backfill positions, and very high workloads and poorly configurated systems to work with resulted in high turnover. We had backfills quit 2 weeks into training. 

Eventually, I received an offer for a manager position elsewhere with a $15K salary increase. My manager, shocked by my intention to leave, matched the offer and promised me a promotion, detailing a plan to hire two additional team members from India to help with the invoice load and allow me to expand into new responsibilities. There was even a team realignment to retain me. I was told that I was going to be dropped from invoices entirely. 

I decided to stay onboard. 

A year later, I regret the decision. My role has not changed; I am still doing primarily invoice processing despite discussing my interest in management, analytics, and more strategic tasks. The India hires did not succeed. And we're not backfilling them, so I'm still just doing invoices. All day, everyday. Our team has also decreased from 5 to 4 and we're not hiring a 5th. 

Though I am respected internally and have positive performance reviews, the lack of meaningful work and career development is now impacting my job satisfaction and performance. The skill erosion is real - I've had to youtube certain excel formulas that I knew like the back of my hand. I literally don't even get to use Excel much anymore because all I do is click around on invoices... 

My manager has explicitly stated that wants to keep me as a successor when he leaves, but I’m concerned about being left with a problematic account. I don't want to be promoted to captain of the Titanic as it's sinking. I know I can make a positive impact in a broader FM role, but the current situation is causing significant dissatisfaction and it's likely become noticeable to others if it continues.

Should I have this discussion with him? I don't know if he can do anything about it at this point; they don't have anyone else to take on the invoice processing.

1moca2u,"Please help: I’ve been lost in life and am trying to find my way again, how do I choose just 1 career path? Can I/how can I choose more than 1?","I’m 25 years old in the U.S. and have had a very hard life. I was lucky enough to get a BA graphic design (illustration concentration) in 2023 thanks to family, scholarships and financial aid, but I, for a long time have been in a state of survival due to my childhood, and have distracted and flew through life focused on the wrong things in a subconscious effort to cope. I wasn’t focused enough on myself and my studies and figuring out who I am or what I want to do with my life, I was in constant fight or flight and was diagnosed with PTSD last year. I have had codependency issues for a long time. I’ve realized just how badly I’ve messed up because of all of this and am getting help in therapy.

I fear I’ve wasted my youth and my education. I’m not in any debt and do have some savings. I want to get my life on track, I want to live happily, I want to accomplish my goals and find who I am and heal. I potentially want to go back to school. I haven’t been able to find a job with just this degree, and honestly, don’t want to just go into a graphic design job for the rest of my life. 

The issue is, there is so much I want to do, that I am really interested in and love. I don’t know what route to choose especially if I go back to school. There’s so much more I want to learn. I fear I may look lost due to the varying paths I want to take, but the one thing I do know about myself is what I am passionate about and love in terms of my interests and hobbies, so please be kind when reading my seemingly random list and know that I’m here looking for help organizing my path/s and figuring out how to choose:

I’m interested in creating/helping create an indie video game, creating videos/streams online, running a business potentially creating merchandise similar to what I enjoy collecting or a restaurant or selling my own art, participating as a merchant/performer etc. in renaissance faires and similar conventions or potentially running something similar of my own (have a big idea for this but don’t want to drag this on too long), artisan/cultural work in Japan, helping restore an old/nearly abandoned town/village (common in several countries currently). When I’m much older I’d love to have a sanctuary/farm for rescue animals

I do want to move to Japan and have been learning Japanese, and very much love learning languages and about languages in general. I don’t want to live in Japan forever and would like to go to Europe for a more permanent home when I’m a bit older.

In terms of potentially furthering my education, I’m unsure if I should go straight for graduate studies or start from scratch. Or both. Some loose thoughts I’ve had with potential education is art history, art conservation, or something similar in the arts, archeology, something related to animals/marine life (I have scuba diving certifications and love animals, swimming, conservation efforts), language/linguistics/japanese, business, video game design/concept art, some sort of further design education such as a type of merchandise design, or even just up and leaving and training under chefs/artisans of Japan in everything I’d like to learn there. 

If you’ve made it through this post thank you for reading. I know it’s a lot, but I could really use some help in figuring this all out and how to move forward and choose. I know realistically I won’t do it all when it comes to actual career, but I’d like even some help in figuring out separating potential career paths from what I may be able to find happiness in as a one time experience/hobby.

1moc4n4,Burning out during critical time,"**Context:**

>About a year ago, I was hired as a software engineer (first job as employee, I was previously freelance), office available but mostly full remote. Quite fast, I figured I didn't align that well with company organization (lot of bad practices piling up, no real software engineering culture, long meetings, very scarce written documentation and lot of info transmitted orally, which I struggle to catch), and was hired well underpaid (first thing I did when I arrived was save them tens of hours of human work by resolving an issue no one knew how to deal with). 

>To keep me, they agreed to let me improve our work on documenting the systems -as well as code quality/review processes/etc- and promised increased pay -which took effect about 6 months later. I told them the increase was not up to my expectations to match market, so I would leave before eoy. Since I already built a good part of the workflow for the previous system merger we did -that I designed with the bigger merger in mind as well- I figured I'll stay to help with the second merger as well.

Fast forward a few months later.

My company is currently in the middle of a critical merger of our two IT systems into one, with a set deadline that does not allow setbacks in just a few days.

Management decided to use a no code online automation tool to do the data part of the merger. My manager skipped all our 1:1 meetings for almost 2 months beforehand, and did not read or answer my messages (I understand he was himself under too much pressure/work). Our work on the previous merger was not considered tho.

While I could mostly avoid working on the no code tool for my own parts (some other team members did as well when they could), my whole squad is on vacation (HR asked us to take vacation around this time, and our management only told us not to 2 months beforehand, so people had already planned) -except for one whose contract was forgotten, therefore he left- and I'm feeling the weight of ""urgent unfinished work we need to do before the merger"" that keep piling days beforehand and I don't feel capable of succeeding. Some key management was also on holidays for weeks just before the deadline.

Also there were no prevision of the cost/time it would take to run the merger itself with the choosen solution, leading to in-extremis optimizations required to be able to run it at all that are being figured just now, with uncertainty of the outcome (things we did for the previous one like full test run before the deadline are not possible with the choosen solution).

I'm struggling to have people read and answer important messages in the merger discussion channels, lot of information being exchanged orally only again, which I'm not good at catching, and that already led to a few confusions.



Since the atmosphere, until recent months, was quite ""friendly"", and feeling the need to not let down the team, I feel really useless and failing at my job.

Lately, a mix of ""I'm working the weekend and I don't complain"" and similar from people with stakes in the company, while put with the fact that I'm still considered very junior SE and paid way less than other team members contributing to the merger -hourly rate (supposedly with lower responsibility) when the whole team is daily rate- had me kinda broke up.

Right now I'm really struggling to sleep and focus at all, so it makes it way worse.",Economy_Substance942,1,1.0,1,1755013198,2025-08-12 15:39:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1moc4n4/burning_out_during_critical_time/,8,2025

1moc1kq,"Job starting soon, but just got interview at top choice employer","Hey everyone,  
I’m in a bit of a career dilemma and could use some advice.

A couple of weeks ago I interviewed for a role and was offered the job starting **18 August**. I haven’t signed the contract yet, but it’s a permanent role with a **3-month notice period**, even during probation.

Before I got that offer, I had applied to several other places, including one of my absolute top choices. They’ve just now invited me to interview on **20 August**, which is *two days after I’d start the first job*. The interview is four hours long and will take most of the day.

I’ve already told the first employer I can’t work that day because I have a “medical appointment” (yeah, not my proudest move, but I really want to attend the interview).

Here’s the dilemma:

* If I take the first job and get an offer from the second, I’d want to leave quickly — but the contract says 3 months’ notice, even in probation.
* I wouldn’t need a reference from the first job and don’t care if I lose some pay, but I don’t want to cause unnecessary drama or legal trouble.
* Waiting to sign until after the interview feels risky — they might withdraw the first offer if I delay.

Has anyone here started a job and then left within days/weeks for something better? How did you handle it, and what’s the real risk of just quitting early during probation?",Far_Application1553,2,1.0,4,1755013008,2025-08-12 15:36:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1moc1kq/job_starting_soon_but_just_got_interview_at_top/,8,2025

1mob8qn,Promotion advice,"I’ve been at my sales job for the past 6 years and have been consistently been the top 1&2 performers of the company just depends on the year. I’m also one of the younger salesman (33 now) at the company so they hired me on for below market rate at the time of competing companies. (I only had 2 years of prior industry experience so accepted the salary offer as I didn’t have much to argue anything higher at the time and was OK with it as it was $10k higher than the competitor I came from and hated working for them anyway so wanted to make a move).  Fast forward to today, they want to promote me to a directors role to build out a new territory and hire a sales team below me. Within those 6 years I’ve steadily received merit raises but my current salary is still below the older sales team members which are much lower performing (by at least 50-60% of my volume) and have much less responsibility. (I accidentally saw a paystub one new hire left open when he asked for some computer help. I was $45k below him and another guys I was $25k below his and we’re equal job status).  Upper management doesn’t know that I know this. That being said, I feel like a directors role should naturally be paid higher than the highest salesman role.  I haven’t seen an official compensation offer yet but I’m assuming they’re going to try to adjust my salary minimally and I’ll still be below the salesman that I’m currently $25k below. How should I approach the compensation conversation before officially accepting the role?

1mo8sui,"New job making me sick, mulling over taking a leave","Work in higher education, took a job as an academic advisor working with at-risk students about a little over a month ago & it has been stressful to the point where I have been getting sick. I came from a different office that wasn’t as busy, and didn’t realize it’s a bit more focused here and there a lot of “fires” that have to be dealt with in our program on a daily basis. 

I joined at the busiest period of the year so far, and was given 3 days of short trainings before I was given my caseload on day 4. Mentally I’ve been super stressed because I’m new to advising here, but have still been expected to meet with them as they don’t know I’m new. I spoke with my supervisor and alerted them that I was overwhelmed, and the message I received was: “from what I know about you, this isn’t the worst thing that you’ve been through, and everyone else is also stressed out so suck it up.” So, I have been trying my best.

I caught COVID from one of the students during my second week and was out for a period of time to recover. I came back after being out a week & a half, but am still dealing with some of the symptoms of long covid now a month later. Once I came back, the vibe was a little weird from coworkers because I had been out for such a time & they had to cover me while also doing their own work. I went back to meeting with students until programming ended Friday and it got a little better. 

I’m normally a healthy person, but my doctor believes that the stress that I’ve been under since starting this job has affected me in why I’ve still been sick. My usual coping mechanisms just have not been helping much, and it’s affecting my sleep patterns (I wake up about 3 times a night now). My partner wants me to quit and my doctor has also stated it would probably be better if I either take a leave or resign and find another job. 

HR told me I am eligible to take up to a 3 month leave and I would not need permission from my office, but I should notify them that I would be out. Financially, I would be okay to take the leave, and it sounds like it would help me a lot. But I know that it would not go well with my office as they are gearing up for fall semester which is when it will be busy again (busier than summer let my coworkers tell it). Not to mention, someone would need to cover me until I came back, and from the vibes I have gotten… I don’t think it will be an ideal situation for me to return to. It almost makes me wonder if I’d be better off just resigning, but of course I’d want to keep my benefits and still be able to see my doctor.

1mo83i9,Ivy league masters a waste of time / money? SpecificallyOrganizational Leadership.,"I have a Penn undergrad (later in life after the military, graduated with top grades) and a $200K+ role in NYC in a niche industrial repair industry.

I was accepted to multiple top-tier MBA/EMBA programs, including Brown/IE, but with zero financial aid — $150K–$200K out of pocket felt excessive. The Brown/IE EMBA appealed to me for its unique curriculum, but even there, promised aid never materialized.

Recently, Brown offered me significant funding for its new Master’s in Organizational Leadership — 50% tuition covered plus additional military aid — making it nearly free with my employer’s contribution. The program is brand new, and Brown has said this level of financial support likely won’t be available beyond the first couple of cohorts, which makes it a unique opportunity. It’s not an MBA, but it adds the Brown name to my résumé and the subject matter is appealing.

My question: Will this degree meaningfully help me move from a $30M company (where I’m top leadership) to senior management at a larger firm, or is an MBA still the better bet? One option I’m considering is taking the Brown master’s now for the brand, then doing a BU Online MBA later at low cost.

1mo6k03,Stabbed in the heart by a museum.,"I graduated with my master in museum studies this may. I want to be a museum registrar at. I’ve been volunteering at a medium size cultural museum for over a year cataloguing and assisting with collections needs. I’ve made sure to help with registrar esq things for my benefit. The museum doesn’t have a registrar. They have a curator and some guides. They know I wanted to help with collection things and that I was looking for employment. I went above and beyond in the museum. I even created a cataloging instruction sheet for the volunteers, and collections forms. I received volunteer of the year. They have told me repeatedly they had no money to hire me. I believed them as I was very close w the staff. 
I walk in today find out that an intern from many years ago had been hired to catalogue and help with collections things. 

I’m gutted. It feels like a bad dream. I’m confused. I’m unsure where to go from here. Do I stop going? Do I ask them if her duties will interfere with my duties? I assume they will because is already assisting the curator. I assume I’ll just be put on the back burner.

1mo6091,Am I overacting or am I reporting to a horrible boss?,"I’ve been in this role for 10 months. When I started, there were two of us doing the work… and even then, we had to stay late just to keep up. My teammate quit recently, and now it’s just me — same deadlines, same unrealistic demands, twice the workload.

The fun part? My boss. She overpromises to upper leadership, dumps all the fallout on us, then takes all the credit when things go well. When things are late, she schedules “coaching sessions” to lecture us about “lack of effort.” Some of the stuff she assigns isn’t even in my job description or skill set — it’s literally her job, but somehow I’m doing it.

She clocks in at 9, clocks out at 5, but expects me to stay late every night. If I dare ask for help, she “documents” it in an email saying I ask too many questions and I’m not independent enough.

So now I’m managing double the people, doing double the work, with zero extra pay or support, while she gets all the praise. Am I losing my mind, or is this just corporate life in 2025?

I’m not really passionate or deeply interested in anything, so trying to create a career goal for myself is hard. I don’t know what to do.

1mo3yxl,When the client doesn't have a clear request?,"Hi, I'm working as a part-time music producer on Fiverr.

I've got some orders to produce music and doesn't find yet how I should deal with the situation the client doesn't have a clear request.

For example, a client wanted me to make a tropical house song. I asked them to send me some reference songs to make sure what they want. I got the reference songs from them but they say ""I like the songs but need to change something. Please just make somethings like them.""

To make sure what ""something"" means, I asked them some questions like bright or dark, soft or hard, bouncing or stable, any specific sounds they liked in the reference songs. I didn't ask them about any music theory things like chord progressions or scales because I know they are not music professionals.

Although their answer was ""Not sure. Just make a demo and I'll think about it later"". I had a bad feeling that they would ask me to change a lot after I made demos. But I couldn't ask them anything anymore so I made some demos to find out what they want. And it came true...They asked me to make a completely new style. It was when I was a completely beginner there so I accept it to get a review. It was tough though.

So my question is, do you accept an order even if the client doesn't have a clear request yet? Keep it not get started until you can make sure you can do for them? Or do you charge additionally if they would ask you to change a lot?

The tough thing is that most clients don't have any knowledge about my speciality and that's why they place an order on my service. I'm trying to ask some questions to them with easy and not technical words to clarify their requests. I know it's one of the skills as a professional (seller) though, it's hard when the client says just ""make something like this"" and ask me to make a completely new stuff.",K-Frederic,1,1.0,0,1754990662,2025-08-12 09:24:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mo3yxl/when_the_client_doesnt_have_a_clear_request/,8,2025

1mo113k,Left a great job for “career growth” and regret it… how do I ask to go back?,"Throwaway because too many friends know my main account.

About 6 months ago I left a job I really liked for what I thought would be a smart career move. Now I think I made the wrong choice.

Old job:

- Cool, engaging work I was really passionate about
- Team I loved working with and considered friends
- Only downside was a manager who could be frustrating at times

New job:

- Totally different type of work, still a somewhat interesting mission
- Manager is great, team is just okay, 95% of the team works in another city/state, and the 3 other people that work in my city/state are only in the office 1 day a week, so I feel like I go sit in an office alone all day and all week
- I spend most of my time alone in my office with nothing to do (despite asking for more work)
- Company has amazing internal opportunities after a year, but I’m not sure I can sit idle for that long

Why I’m thinking of going back:

- I think I was happier at my old job
- In hindsight, the issues I was having were not that terrible, and could be fixed by making some lifestyle changes or just having tough conversations with my boss that I was afraid of
- They’re swamped with work, but the company recently had layoffs so no openings are posted
- My old team lead has said they’d love to have me back, but they are not the one to make the hiring decisions

My concerns:

- Don’t want to seem desperate
- Don’t want them to think I’d just leave again
- Not sure if I should reach out now or wait until there’s a posting

Has anyone been in this situation? How do you ask for your old job back without making it awkward or burning bridges?

TL;DR: Left a job I loved for what I thought was career growth. New job is boring with no work to do, and overall I just don’t think it’s a good fit. Old team is swamped but not hiring due to recent layoffs. My old lead wants me back but nothing is posted.

1mnzdhg,One Semester into my Masters Program and I Think I Regret It,"So…..yeah. I’ve spent years of my life working a dreary corporate job that I hated just to pay bills. Hated commuting, hated wasting almost all my time away just working and being too tired to even want to do my hobbies at the end of the day. I finally got a therapist and basically expressed how I wanted to do something more interesting than this and worked out a plan to go back and get my masters. However….now that I’m here, I feel conflicted. I don’t dislike the stuff I’m learning but it is a LOT of work. 

And here’s the real point of this post being in career advice….in order to do my masters full time I switched over to freelancing for my current company (ya know that dreary corporate job). I only work like 12-15 hours a week now. And I get to do it fully remotely, bc I told them it would be too demanding to come to the office when I also need to coordinate getting to class. WELL turns out, I no longer hate the job. In fact it isn’t half bad. Going freelance finally took so many tasks off my plate and gave me freedom to set boundaries. They were forced to hire a replacement for my full time job who I know have authority over assigning my tasks as needed. I find myself wishing that instead of using those extra hours of free time to do school, that I could finally just engage fully in my hobbies.

Now I’m very confused and feel like as much as I enjoy learning new stuff in school, my real happiness might come simply from not working a 40 hour job. I am now sometimes fantasizing about quitting my program and just staying freelance. It’s dumb, the program is only 1 year so I will finish it out, but I don’t know if I’m even going to want to enter the field I spent all this time studying in. It honestly doesn’t sound half bad to me to just work freelance a couple of hours a week and then do what I want to do. Create art, play video games. Maybe even sell art or stream as ways of turning those fun hobbies into a side gig.

Idk, ultimately I’m just feeling very confused about my future and not sure what I should do or feel right now",Different_Reading713,6,1.0,5,1754973590,2025-08-12 04:39:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mnzdhg/one_semester_into_my_masters_program_and_i_think/,8,2025

1mnz2we,"Accidentally lied about my skills, what should I do?","Earlier this April, I (19M) was applying for work-study positions at my university, where I saw that many positions required molecular biology lab skills. So, I decided to take a laboratory course to gain new skills and improve my chances for the next work-study application period in the upcoming Fall semester as a third-year student (starting in September).

I made my first CV afterwards, and it included the skills highlighted in the course syllabus (that I hadn't learned yet) so that I could apply during the Fall semester (I would've completed the course by then). However, I ended up having to drop the course due to a conflicting schedule with my full-time work as a clinical assistant. Furthermore, I forgot to edit my CV and ended up applying for a hospital position with skills I didn’t have yet, because I was focused on highlighting my clinical skills. When I went in for an interview, it went great, and they even discussed making a work schedule around my studies (this was an informal job opportunity). However, the doctors asked about my molecular biology lab skills, and I couldn't answer them properly, which probably made them think that I was trying to lie about my skills.

It has been months now, and since this was an informal position that I only got an interview for because I requested one, I wanted to reapply for the position. I already tried emailing them after the interview and tried to get one of my doctors (in my workplace) to vouch for me, but I got no response.

How do I go about this to try and land a position at the hospital?

1mnylwm,How to ask for a raise when I’m also asking to go fully remote soon?,"I recently found out from a coworker that I’m severely underpaid. I make $50k as an Account Manager with 3 years of experience at a small marketing agency. I currently do not have bonus eligibility for account growth (I just learned I have to ask for that!). My coworker has 3 YOE and was just hired for the same position at $62k. So of course, I want a raise. I know I can’t use that as a reason, and I have a long list of valid reasons/contribution examples I can give for why I deserve a raise. I’m thinking of asking for $60k and bonus eligibility effective 2025. Is that too much?

Here’s where things get tricky. I’m moving out of state in early December and am going to ask to go fully remote. It shouldn’t be a problem as a third of the company is fully remote and we’ve had a couple employees recently move and become remote. They already have an employee in the state I’m moving to as well so there shouldn’t be any tax issues. My plan is to ask for a raise at the end of September, after a huge client presentation that will be great leeway for a raise. Then, I’ll tell them about the move in late October/early November. Is that a bad move? I love my company, so I want to make sure I do this right, but don’t want to jeopardize a raise by telling them about moving first.

1mnxrx0,am i being underpaid?,"i have been a barista at a local small town coffee shop for about 3 years. recently, i graduated magna cum laude from college with my bs in business admin with a minor in management. right after i graduated, my boss offered me a position as an “evening team leader” (he wouldn’t call it a manager) and i took it. he asked what i wanted to be paid and i, being fresh out of college, said $20-$21 an hour. he agreed on $21. the manager and assistant manager are both making $22. we do not make tips or receive any kind of benefits. when i accepted the position, i was told i wouldn’t be doing any hiring, firing, or discipline. my job was, essentially, to watch the evening people and help out and cover shifts where needed. we also discussed me working with the catering team and doing inventory. 

long story short, i am fully involved in the hiring and firing. i’ve already had to conduct multiple interviews, fire people, had people quit on me, and disciplined multiple people (given write ups, etc.). the first time i had to discipline someone, i told the assistant manager i was uncomfortable doing it and she told me “well i know we said you wouldn’t have to do any of the hiring or firing, but i want to challenge you.” i also often get calls at 6 am from morning shift when neither of the other managers will pick up. i have to do a lot of the marketing and go pick up supplies often. my hours are 1-9pm and i also have to work weekends as well as catering events, often driving up to 30 miles away. i am required to be on call (unless i have approved time off) in case someone calls in, but do not get paid to be on call. 

for reference, this coffee/ice cream shop is in the rural midwest. there are two locations (mine being the bigger of the two), and we bring in roughly $70k a week in revenue (VERY rough estimate). our normal baristas get paid anywhere from $9-$15, with around $12 being the median (plus tips, which average out to around an extra $4 an hour) i am the only person with a college degree in the building. we have around 50 employees when you include both locations, but im only responsible for 30 at mine. 

i bring in around $2600 a month after tax working full time. also, side note, i was told when i started that i had to let my boss know when i started looking for other jobs. i’ve been looking and haven’t told him. should i? am i being underpaid? is this job even worth it?",Financial_Evening582,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1754968652,2025-08-12 03:17:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mnxrx0/am_i_being_underpaid/,8,2025
1mnx0tm,Delusional co-worker,"I’ve been with my current company for 3 years. coworker, who I’ll refer to as J, started 6 months or so before me. 

J and I worked in the same department for about a year and became good friends, I’d hang out at his house and with his family regularly. He transferred to a different department, and about 3 months later I was promoted to the job that I originally applied for. 

Things started falling apart then. J believed that was supposed to be “his” promotion, even though he had repeatedly said I was more qualified and he didn’t want to work the required shifts/hours. I was more qualified, since I had prior experience and schooling in the subject.

I was promoted again around 1 year ago, and J pretty much stopped being my friend. He told me that going above and beyond at my job makes everyone else look bad and I’m not a team player. 

J was promoted 2 months ago, after threatening to quit twice. He regularly calls off work, arrives late, or goes home early. He generally sucks at his job and I’ve kept my mouth shut. I stopped hanging out with him outside of work, and talk to him only as much as required.

Thursday evening I made a mistake and didn’t move the forklift after it was parked with the forks raised (if you know anything about forklift safety, this is a pretty big deal). 

Friday, J reported this to the safety officer, who sent a long email to all the managers to remind their staff of forklift safety. J called me to apologize for “accidentally snitching” on me. 

Here’s the thing! I wasn’t even the person to use the forklift last! And when my manager talked to me today, he already knew that.

1mnwkf8,Got job offer with high paying salary,"Hi guys,

I’m in need of some advice on a career decision and could really use your perspective.

Quick background — I used to work in banking, starting as a teller and then being promoted to banking advisor. I didn’t enjoy the banking advisor role because it was heavy on compliance and sales. Later, I became an investment advisor over the phone, which was even more detail- and compliance-focused. I’m not naturally detail-oriented, so I struggled with the compliance aspect and didn’t enjoy it.

Eventually, I decided to switch careers into recruitment, which was a much better fit for my extroverted personality, and I did fairly well in it. Unfortunately, I was laid off 6 months ago and have been on EI since, receiving the maximum amount.

Recently, I applied to a few jobs and accidentally applied for a Client Associate position. It’s very similar to my old banking roles — working with wealthy clients, moving their money around, and heavy compliance. I went to the interview just for practice, thinking I had nothing to lose.

They ended up being very impressed and offered me $65K (I made $64K in my last recruitment job). The location is only 10 minutes from my house. Initially, I wasn’t interested because I don’t want to return to this field, I prefer working in recruitment, and I’d rather work in the city (my area feels too small and quiet for me). I told them I had another offer, and when they asked how much, I randomly said $75K, thinking they wouldn’t match it. But they did — and now I’m in a dilemma.

I have some recruitment interviews lined up this week, but those salaries are max $65K and not close to home. Even though the $75K offer is tempting and close by, this type of work stressed me out before, I made mistakes in it, and I think it might burn me out again. It’s also a very small family office with only 5 people, which sounds like it might be boring and not aligned with my career goals.

So my question is:
	•	Do I accept the $75K job and plan an exit once I find something in my field?
	•	Or do I pass and keep interviewing, hoping for a recruitment offer?

I have 6 months of EI left, so I still have some financial cushion, but I’m worried about making the wrong move.

Thanks for any input!",Embarrassed-Carob178,4,0.75,7,1754965180,2025-08-12 02:19:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mnwkf8/got_job_offer_with_high_paying_salary/,8,2025

1mnuzkd,Top 5 Best Career Aptitude Tests,"Firstly there is a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation around what a Career Aptitude Test is. Many personality test and interest tests are lumped in as Aptitude Test, but they are not.

A real aptitude test uses objective measurement of putting a user under time pressure to complete a task - which is designed to measure an inborn or innate ability/aptitude. These tasks are researched and scientifically normed against hundreds of thousands or millions of comparative users, meaning is a user scores highly, there score is based as a percentile of all people who took the same exercise.

95% of tests that claim to be aptitude test (MBTI/DISC/Big5/StrengthsFinder/Holland/Career Explorer) are subjectively measured, meaning your score is based on how you feel or think about something. Most of these are measuring personality, getting you to rank interests, or respond to how you think your would respond in social situations. These are usually fun, but have no place in Career or Life planning. In fact they cause more harm than good when people take them as real science based tools. Social Scientist Spencer Greenberg recently did a research analysis on the most popular test in this area and scored them almost equal to a horoscope: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wWUxvFv0y0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wWUxvFv0y0)

There are really only a handful of serious science and research based Career Aptitude Test available and 100% of them are paid products because they require ongoing research and development and staff to maintain the integrity of the testing.

Here are the Top 5:

1) Johnson O'Connor ( [https://www.jocrf.org/](https://www.jocrf.org/) ) - JOC is the godfather of Career Aptitude Testing. Founded over 100 years ago and built on continual research the Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation sets the standard for measuring natural aptitudes and how they relate to work and careers. Testing is only done in one of their research centers in the US and is monitored by a psychometrician. This is a high value product but comes with a high time and money cost. Cost is around $800 to $900 USD, can take two days, and is only available in person in 10 US cities.   
2) Natural Ability ( [https://www.naturalability.com.au/](https://www.naturalability.com.au/) ) - The NAE or Natural Ability Explorer is built from the JOC test and has been normalized to accurately measure the aptitudes. It is available globally via online delivery. Natural Ability has taken the aptitude testing to the next level by incorporating modules measuring Values/Interests/Strengths/Limiting Beliefs and Goals to deliver a complete Self-Discovery audit which considers the whole person when making career and life decisions. This is a high value product which represents the best value for money and measures more depth than any other product available. Cost is $149 USD and is delivered online. Follow up personal consultations are available.  
3) Highlands Company ( [https://www.highlandsco.com/](https://www.highlandsco.com/) ) - The HAB or Highlands Ability Battery is another test built from the JOC test. Highlands was the first company to make this calibre of test available online. Highlands has over 300 trained consultants who interpret the testing results. The HAB is scientifically normed and accurate. The model requires working with a consultant and cost from $350 to $600 USD.

Note: One powerful feature of the three programs above is they look at the aptitudes/abilities in relationship with each other, meaning the real story comes from how the abilities work together in blends of two, three or four, versus just focussing on the characteristics of one single aptitude, which can be misleading.  
  
4) Morrisby ( [https://www.morrisby.com/](https://www.morrisby.com/) ) - Morrisby is a UK careers testing company which objectively measure aptitudes and offers a range of guidance tools. Popular with schools, because of a lower price but is ultimately a stripped down version of the programs above and thus not considered as accurate. Does not present blends of abilities, only single interpretations of abilities but does a good job of associating careers and jobs to consider. Costs range from $35 to $600 USD.  
5) Ball Foundation ( [https://www.ballfoundation.org/ball-aptitude-battery/](https://www.ballfoundation.org/ball-aptitude-battery/) ) - BAB or Ball Aptitude Battery is also a rough spin off from JOC, using the early pencil and paper testing from JOC to make their own test. They have since computerized the testing and developed other tools around the instrument. The test is objectively measured and normed to be accurate.  They have programs available through their company Career Vision ( [https://careervision.org/career-readiness-program-2/](https://careervision.org/career-readiness-program-2/) ) and cost range from $450 to 800 USD)

There are a few other objectively measured aptitude test in the marketplace and some are very slick and professional looking and relatively cheap. Tests like YouScience, Career Avenues and others use cut down exercises where the aptitude is only measure to about 50% of max, which means a person can score very high in an ability on these test, be told they have a very strong ability, when in fact they same person would be measured in the 50th percentile on the more comprehensive tests above. This can lead to false and dangerous guidance.

Overall:  
 JOC is the GOAT, simply because they are the original, but are expensive and somewhat outdated.  
NAE is probably the best because it is the most comprehensive of all the programs, modern and represents the best VFM.",Reasonable_Winner676,1,1.0,2,1754960866,2025-08-12 01:07:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mnuzkd/top_5_best_career_aptitude_tests/,8,2025

I also gave up in life many times because I didn't have any moral support from others. I also never believed in myself. My low self esteem has ruined my social skills. No wonder why I don't have any social exposure. In last year of high school I started applying random no experience jobs like fast food near my area. I was lucky enough to land one job but just to find out I silently quit after 2 weeks. I didn't graduate high school because of taking care of health issues of family. But I managed to get high school diploma afterwards. I later picked a night shift but it only lasted I think 7 months or so. But I was let go of that job because of absence.

1mnudep,Feeling Lost in My Career – Struggling with Finding Passion and Direction,"Hi all, I’m a 23-year-old female who graduated last year with a degree in social work and Spanish. I’m currently working as an advisor for a college access and success program, but after a year in this role, I feel stuck. My biggest challenge is that I just don’t feel passionate about anything. I don’t feel driven by the work I’m doing, and I’m struggling to figure out what I *do* want to do.

I know I need to make money—there are financial goals and personal aspirations I want to achieve—but it’s hard to stay motivated when I’m not excited about the career path I’m on. I’m coming from a financially unstable background, and the pressure to make a change is real, but I also feel a bit lost since I’m not sure what’s next for me.

Has anyone else been in this position? How did you find direction when you weren’t passionate about anything? Any advice on how to start figuring out what I *could* be interested in, or how to find balance between financial needs and career satisfaction?

1mntx4w,Surviving Corporate,"Hi All!

I have been working my first corporate job since I turned 22 (March of this year) and have really liked it!

The only thought I usually have sometimes is, am I getting laid off anytime soon or am I next?

My only reasoning behind the thought is that the responsibilities I am given and often do, I usually finish pretty quickly. 

I always ask my supervisor for more work to do and always say yes to anything she needs help with.

To note, these tasks that I’m given are not that hard and I’m able to finish them.

I have great communication with my boss and my supervisor.

What are some tips you would suggest to help play this game and play it right? 

Thanks! ",Ok-Raccoon5845,2,0.6700000166893005,5,1754957964,2025-08-12 00:19:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mntx4w/surviving_corporate/,8,2025
1mnsu5t,What to do about a bad job offer?,"TLDR below

So I work as a pediatric occupational therapy assistant in the Texas area. I’ve been working for 4 years, and I have 14 years of experience working in early childhood. Im very good at what I do, and when I had an interview recently, they heavily acknowledged how educated and qualified I am. And then I got a job offer where the base pay is $24. I wanted to scream. For context, I’ve been making $34 an hour, but am trying to leave my current company for a variety of reasons.

From what I knew about the new company, I expected pay to be a little on the lower side, but not a $10 an hour difference. I can’t financially afford that, but I really wanna leave my current position. So what do I do?

They tried to make their compensation offer feel higher by showing potential bonuses, equipment stipends, as well as their contribution to Medicare and SS, among other things (like health insurance and their contribution to my 401k if I put the max in). That’s not guaranteed money or things that I would be paying for anyways. But they added it on top of the $50,000 base pay, which eventually brought the total to $68,800. During the interview, I requested between $65,000 to $75,000. Experienced therapy assistants in my area make between $30-36 and hour. $24 is entry level, and actually what I made when I first graduated four years ago! I want to bang my head on the wall.

TLDR, I asked for $65,000-75,000 in an interview, got an offer for $50k that is considered entry level, which I am not. I want the job but feel very stuck",Opposite_Insect_7340,0,0.5,5,1754955129,2025-08-11 23:32:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mnsu5t/what_to_do_about_a_bad_job_offer/,8,2025

I’ve been a **Support Engineer at a trading firm for 5 years**, with prior experience as a QA & Testing Engineer. I currently make **$160K/year plus $25–30K bonuses**, and I’ll be **laid off in 12 months** due to automation.

I want to start preparing now by **studying certifications or possibly a master’s degree** so I can transition into a stable, in-demand role that won’t be hit as hard by layoffs. I’d like to maintain my current pay range if possible.

Some key points:

* Strong experience in **incident management, trading platform support, QA/testing**
* Familiar with **AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Python, SQL**
* Looking for **non-automatable** roles in tech or finance
* Open to **SRE, cloud engineering, technical project management, or other high-paying paths**
* Want to know **which certifications, degrees, or skill areas** are worth investing in for my background

If you were in my shoes, **what path would you take**? Which skills or certs would give me the best shot at keeping (or increasing) my current salary in a more secure role?

1mnqbgn,"Choosing a Degree: Comp sci vs Data Science vs Accounting (worried about automation, outsourcing, saturated job market, etc)?","Hey everyone, I'm trying to choose a degree and my main priorities are: automation resistant from ai, is relatively transferable/not niche, decent pay and stability. To narrow down my options, if it can be self taught I'll avoid it.

I'll list my options below, please correct my incorrect assumptions. I have done some research but I'm posting this as I'm overwhelmed and some pointers would be nice.

Option 1: cloud engineering/cyber security/network engineering Pros: Low risk of automation, huge demand. Cons: Seems like I'd need a computer science base, im worried as from what ive seen the feild is quite saturated. BSc in Computer Networks & Security is too niche for an undergraduate imo. Plus apparently there are comptia certs so the option is always there to self learn and I dont necessarily have to have a background in it/comp science? If anything is can get comptia certs for these sort of things with an unrelated degree, or is that not really realistic?

Option 2: data science Pros: In demand, good pay Cons: You often start as a data analyst, this might get automated in the future, making it harder to get experience and break into mid-level roles.

Option 3: accounting Pros: seems to be in demand, seems relatively safe from automation. Easy to branch into consulting, FP&A. Cons: Mixed opinions on automation risk - some say it's safe, others think entry-level work could be outsourced/automated. This way its harder to gain experience to then access mid level roles.

Would love to hear from people in these fields:
How is the entry-level job market now? Is/will outsouricng/automation be an issue?

Lastly, am I just overthinking this all, advice/pointers from absolutely anyone would be greatly appreciated",Strange-Strength-870,1,1.0,0,1754948953,2025-08-11 21:49:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mnqbgn/choosing_a_degree_comp_sci_vs_data_science_vs/,8,2025
1mnqb90,"Do I go back to company I left, or stay at my current cush (but sometimes frustrating) job?","Mid 2024 I left the job I had been at for 12 years. They were bought out by a big corporation, and everything about my job changed for the worse (endless bureaucracy, more responsibility, less enjoyable tasks, having to manage 4 people reporting to me, which I could not stand). The job was paying me $95k + pretty good benefits at the time I left.

I left the big company to go work for a small company (2 other employees) founded by a friend of mine.  It was great to get out of the super corporate setting, he started me at $99k which has since been bumped up to $105k. Its a very chill job, I get to work fully remote, never really have any deadlines or difficult tasks. But the tasks are not very fulfilling to me (i am an industrial designer). I am basically just a yes man for my Friend/Bosses vision since its his company. I have very little say in what our end products look like. There is a lot of grunt work, and travel on the weekends to events. He has a very strong personality which is sometimes hard to deal with. The job also has no benefits, so we have to pay them out of pocket. In California with a wife + 2 kids (12 & 9 yrs old), its extremely expensive. My wife and I want to buy a house (or at least upgrade to renting a 3-bedroom house), and I don't see this as being realistic any time soon at my current job.

Now, my old company is trying to hire me back because they are extremely in need of my skillset, and they say they would put me back into a design-first role (no management). At first reaction, I thought there is no way I could go back to that place, with how frustrated I was in the final few years before I left. But the role they are offering me is very enticing. I would get my good benefits back, but it would be hybrid, not fully remote, with a 30 min (1 way) commute 2 or 3 days a week. We have not talked salary yet, but I feel I would need a huge raise (up to $120 or 130k? More?) to basically do a U-turn on my career. I would also leave my good friend out to dry after he made a big commitment in hiring me just over a year ago.

1mnqa5e,Letter of Apperception,"My current boss is a great guy who’s relatively new to his role and has completely turned our department around. I’ve known him personally for several years, even before I started working here. I’ve decided to switch companies for personal reasons that have nothing to do with him.

However, I’m worried that he may be on thin ice, and that my departure might cause his supervisor to blame him for not being able to retain employees.

Would it be a bad idea to write a letter to his supervisor expressing my respect for him, even though I’m leaving?

For context: I’m leaving because I’m not getting the experience I need, the pay isn’t great, and there’s no room for growth here. One of the main reasons I’m leaving is also due to a second supervisor, whose behavior has been a major issue.

In the last three months, four other employees have quit because of him, but the department heads haven’t done anything to address his behavior. Honestly, he’s a dick, and the department heads’ typical response is, “I’m not going to tell him to be nicer.”

My first role was a consulting internship as a project manager. I didn’t really know what I was doing, had trouble getting clear feedback, and didn’t get a return offer. Then I took an IT job right out of college, working long hours for low pay in a toxic startup. I pushed myself to make zero mistakes, burned out, and was eventually laid off.

After a month off, I decided to try sales to get out of my shell and figure out my career path. I landed at a great tech company with amazing people, and I genuinely enjoy the work. I’m learning a lot, handling rejection better, and feeling more social than before.

The problem? I’m struggling to hit quota. I’m three months in, and for two of those months I’ve been below target. I’m making more calls than most, sending tons of emails, even skipping lunch to work more—but still coming up short. Meanwhile, some coworkers hit quota halfway through the month while I’m losing meetings to cancellations.

Money isn’t my main motivator, but I don’t want to be laid off again. I’m giving it my all every single day, but if I keep missing quota, it’s hard not to wonder where I actually fit in.

I know I’m just bellyaching right now, just wanted to get it off my chest. In the end of the day I just have to keep trying and fix whatever I’m doing wrong and learn from the people around me.

On week 4 I was given an internal newsletter to draft (by person A), which I did but I forgot to tell them until now (week 8). 

There was no deadline given and they said do it whenever you have time. I made a mental note to do this in week 5 which I did. 

As I also had a 1-1 scheduled in early week 6 with person A on a different topic, I thought I will run through the newsletter I have drafted with them then.

This 1-1 had to be rescheduled by Person A twice and eventually got cancelled. I forgot to tell them about the newsletter and they forgot to follow up as well. 

Person A then went on holiday and is returning tomorrow (week 8).

For context this newsletter is not important for the business. It gets sent internally once a quarter, and was for updates on social responsibility (charity fundraising events) that the team has been upto. 

For person A, I have done 1 other piece of client facing work and delivered it on time upto a good standard, as well as all other client work. 

As I’m aiming for a return offer, do I either: 

1) Own upto my mistake and take Person A through my thought process and hope they don’t talk to my manager about it. 

2) Don’t do anything, hope they forget they gave me this piece of work and not remember for another 2 weeks until the end of the internship.

I didn't see any listing for a full time position in the department - and I would have because I'm checking job boards multiple times a day. Two team members (me and another) were laid off last year. And now they're hiring someone brand new while I'm on my *second* contract? 
I'm frustrated, I'm hurt. I feel like any hope I had of being extended or rehired has been destroyed. I don't know if I should or how i should talk to my boss about this. I'm tired of this game and I feel like I'm going to be unemployed for the rest of my life.

1mnlr2h,Should I apply for a new job?,"Need some advice to make sure I’m not over reacting.

I recently took a new job at my company about a year and a half ago. It’s been going very well and this year I’ve had multiple conversations with my manager expressing my desire to be promoted and grow with this team. It seemed like he was on board and said he would try to get me promoted by the end of this year.

About a month ago, a coworker of mine left the company. We’ll call him Frank. He had the same job profile as me but was 1 “level” or title higher. When he left, I expressed my desire to assume his role. My manager said that was an option but his first priority was to hire someone else that he had previously worked with. We’ll call this guy Ted. I was a little upset over that but understand why he wanted use this opportunity to hire Ted.

However, I found out during this process that my manager presented both options to his manager. Option A was to hire Ted. Option B was to promote me and backfill my role. Option C was to post the job for anyone to apply. His manager apparently said that if option A didn’t work out that he was hesitant to promote me because I’m relatively new to the team and there are other people at my level who have been on the team longer. This ended up not mattering because option A worked out. However, it tells me that I won’t be getting a promotion anytime soon on this team because I’m still relatively new. Even if my manager is advocating for it, it doesn’t seem like his boss is gonna let it happen.

Fast forward to now, Ted just recently started. Ted already worked at my company and was 1 “level” or title ahead of me. So I expected him to be hired as the same job profile as me but 1 “level” higher than me. Keep in mind, that’s what Frank’s job profile and title were. However, Ted was hired under a different job profile than me (and everyone else on my direct team). This job profile is a higher payer title too. So not only did I not get considered for a promotion, they backfilled Frank’s spot with a higher payer title.

So now I’m thinking about looking for a new role within my company or maybe even looking externally. Am I overreacting to all of this or is this reasonable?

They told her a month and a half ago  that her store location would be shutting down. After which they told her she would have a job at a nearby location, so she's been telling her customers that she will be at that location once her current location closes. But today her higher-ups called her and told her that she would not have a job at the nearby location because they do not have a position open for her.. they have three employees two full-time who have been there 5 plus years and one part-time who is only been there for a few months. But they told her that the only way she could keep her job is if she takes a position at a location that is 45 minutes driving from her home and that it will only be part time if she takes it. They told her if she does not take this position they will give her 2 weeks severance pay and they will part ways. So now just a couple days before her store closes they told this putting her in a very tough predicament. What can she do about this?

1mnkknx,Asking for What I Need,"Recently, I asked my new boss for a raise. It was stressful—so stressful I almost didn’t do it. I had already started looking for other jobs that paid more and offered better benefits. But then I paused and asked myself: *You just got this job. You actually like it here. So what would make staying worth it?*

My answer: a raise and two days off.

So I built up the courage to ask for exactly that. My intuition told me he’d work with me—he saw my value.

Here’s how I framed it:  
**“What can I do within the next 60 days to earn a raise?”**

He looked at me, curious.  
“I’ll give you an answer Friday,” he said. “But will you stay if you get the raise?”

I told him I’d commit to a full year if I got it. That promise did two things for me:

1. It gave me a chance to practice follow-through.
2. It lifted the burden of job hunting—for at least a year.

Turns out, I didn’t have to wait until Friday. He had a meeting with his boss that same day and came back with an answer: a task list we’d work on together to prepare me to run the store solo when needed. Then, right there, he gave me a raise. Not the full amount I’d hoped for, but something—and he back-paid me from my start date.

I was floored. It was *that* easy.

The contrast with my old employer was stark. And it taught me something valuable:

1mnk0o8,What do I do ??,"I am pregnant (heavily, 30 weeks)

My employer is 100% trying to manage me out of position, that process has already taken effect, and demote me before I take my leave. Which would cost me half my benefits. Therefore I am trying to go ahead and initiate my leave. I have an accommodations request saying I can't work more than 40hrs a week and lift more than 25 pounds.

If I hand in my accommodations do we think they'll actually accommodate me or tell me to go ahead and apply for leave considering that what my accommodations are less than what is listed within my job description.

I ask because my Dr has essentially told me that we have no medical reasoning to write me off of work. And again, the plan is to 100% demote me before I take leave. If this happens, I will take a pay cut, I will not receive leave at 100% pay anymore, I will lose 6.5 weeks of PTO, I will lose roughly 6k in stocks that have yet to hit the vesting period that would. I am at a loss of what to do if i cannot get my leave initiated. HR is in on this so that is not really an option for me, and really as long as they don't mention my pregnancy through performative action then legally they're covered.

1mniw5l,Got offered a UX/Product role in AI — zero experience. Should I take it?,"Hey everyone,

I (28F) have been living abroad, working in tech PR. I’m moving back to the U.S. for the first time since college, leaving PR (burnout + wanting to be more of a *doer*).

Here’s the curveball: my boss offered me a **UX/Product role** on their AI product for marketers. It’s tempting… but I have **literally zero UX/Product experience** outside of a Google course I took once.

**The setup:**

* **Bosses I trust** — one’s highly technical, the other’s strategic, both well-connected. Not sure I am bias, but I think real potential here 
* **Salary:** $70k (not a dealbreaker but def low as ideally one day I'd love to live in CA).
* **Downside:** Employee #1. Completely solo. Day one = Googling “how to be a UX designer” 😂
* **Safety net:** Been saving for months, will live at home, planned to be unemployed to focus on myself. That said, I wouldn't mind passing up on this
* **Big question:** (as previewed above) If I invest 6 months in learning + networking, could I aim higher later (e.g., $120k) instead of locking into $70k for a year?
* **Career direction:** Not sure I want to do UX forever — also considering law school, MBA, or a bigger-name company eventually.
* **Network concern:** My professional network would still mostly be abroad, not in the U.S. where I want to grow.

I know pivoting into Product/UX (esp. in AI) is tough, and some people say “it just happens.” This could be my “it just happens” moment… or a detour.

Would love thoughts on what to weigh here — take the leap or pass?

1mngtuu,"Doing Business Analyst–level work in Ops, but stuck in same role — how to move forward?","I was hired as an operations analyst about 3.5 years ago at a wealth management firm. Although, over the past year and a half I've taken the initiative to build automations in Power Automate, Power BI, Excel and Power Automate Desktop that have saved my team hours of work every week. I took the initiative on all of these projects as I wanted to learn some new things(because i dont learn anything new in my daily task) with the goal of refining processes and improve efficiency. I also thought this would be a good way to prove to my employer that I can make a significant impact as a business analyst. I’ve basically been doing business analyst–level work, on top of all my daily work as an operations analyst. Which is literally the most brain numming shit you could imagine. Here are a few the automations I’ve built:

* Automated missing document reports (5 per month)
* Automated document filing (\~60 documents/month)
* Automated weekly compliance reports (32/month)
* Created UI RPA flows to automate the creation of 300 contacts in this obsolete software that we use.. 
* Worked with the senior operations analyst to create macros and refine her processes to leverage excel power query ect which has also saved her a ton of time.. 

Despite these projects, I’m still in my original role, and my company will not give me a raise or give me a date in which they will move me to a different position.. I have been trying to leverage this work to get a raise but my boss just says that she cant do anything because my pay is capped based on my job description. I've feel as though my company does not realize how big of a deal alot of these projects are nor do they care at all. Like i dont even think I got a good job or anything. 

They've verbally promised to move me out of operations but they will not give me a date or anything..

I think something like 80% of jobs are filled by someone the interviewer already knows these days, so I mostly did it to get my name out there. I'm currently a contractor at my organization and basically it was my first application to try and get a full time position.

  
They ended up interviewing and telling me they think I'd be a perfect fit for a different role they will be posting next week.

  
So a week later I found out I didn't get the first job, and applied to the second one. The interviewer told me he wouldn't have me interview again for the position.

  
My wife gave birth about a month ago and I let them know I'd be taking off all of August.

  
The interviewer called me about a week after I applied and just confirmed I was taking that time off. I told him I have in the books with my current position to the end of September, but have no problem being flexible and coming in a bit early. He responded something like ""it shouldn't be a problem to strain the team a couple months so you can bond with your child. I have two kids myself."" I said okay great. Then maybe he felt odd about making it sound like a sure-win for me? I'm not sure, because then he backtracked a little and said something like 'of course I am not guaranteeing you the position"".

Well the baby was born 2 weeks early. When that happened I emailed him to let him know my current leave now only goes to mid September. This was 3 weeks ago.

  
I was hoping he'd say SOMETHING about the position but all he did was congratulate me.

  
It's been 3 weeks since that email, 4 weeks since they posted the position. Should I email to check in? The posting was taken down from their site but my application still says ""In Progress"".

  
He could just be taking his time because he knows I'm still out for another month? But I'd really like to know if I got it or didn't get it because I want to brush up on some skillsets if it's the former, and I want to apply to other positions if it's the latter.",ExtendedArmGesture,0,0.5,2,1754926585,2025-08-11 15:36:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mng9wi/should_i_email_to_ask_prospective_employer_if/,8,2025
1mng32z,Should I question my boss about a promotion right after receiving a raise?,"This will be long.

Background: I'm 27 y.o., have nearly 6 years of experience in my field, started as an intern in 2019 and currently I'm a mid-level analyst. 

In these 6 years on the field I've been in 4 different companies. 

In the starting years I was eager to grow salary/positions, and never stayed more than 1 year and half in each company. In one of these rushes I made a bad move and changed to a company that had more pay but a terrible boss. I endured another year and a half there, but couldn't bear it and quit without another job in line. This is where my story with the current company starts. 

I was unemployed for around 3 months, deciding if I would pivot my career or continue in the field. I decided to prioritize financial stability and continue. So I started applying for jobs again, and got the position I'm currently at.

The thing is, after they hired me, they hired another person a month or so after, for the same position as me. This person had crossed paths with me in another company, and we had equal experience. But she hopped from job to job, and had a referral, while I didn't have anyone supporting me and was unemployed. Chatting with her I found out her salary was around 1K higher than mine (Monthly salary). OK, tough to be aware of it, but I dealed with it fine. I put my head down and continued to do my best on the job. When I was getting to around 1 year on the company I told my boss about this whole salary situation, how it made me uncomfortable, and if she could do anything for me since I was getting quite a lot of positive feedback on projects I had worked on, from both her and from my peers. She managed to give me a raise, and my salary became almost (but not quite) the same as the other person (The other person later had some negative feedback and left the company in less than a year and is probably earning even more now, but this is just me being bitter).

OK, all good. Another year goes by, I continue to give my best on the job, my former manager (who gave me a raise) got promoted and so I changed teams and got a new manager, but the positive feedback continues the same for me. Last week I had my performance review and my current boss showered me with compliments and told me they managed to give me another raise (This time I didn't ask for it). Everyone on the company will get a 5% raise due to goverment laws and they'll give me 5% more for my performance. I understand that just giving me this raise was probably very difficult because the company is not doing well financially at global levels, and only a few people received recognition. I have a colleague on my team who's been on the company for 4 years and she's still not getting promoted. Another one is also always complaining about her position, so I know there's quite a lot of competition and peoples desires to manage.

The thing is: I'm happy to be recognized, but given this whole background I've stated, I still feel a little left behind. All in all, it took nearly 2 years to make my salary only slightly higher than what they paid the other person they hired alongside with me straight away. I know I was in a lower position, unemployed, with no references, and that it's harder to change salaries once you're in than while negotiating during hire. I know the company (and the whole world) is not doing so well. I'm grateful for everything my superiors have done for me. But when I look around, my close friends are all coordinators, supervisors, senior analysts, while I'm still mid-level. The truth is, like everyone on earth, I want higher pay and a higher position, and it's taking a tool on my selfsteem that I'm stuck on the same position for so long, as I feel I'm behind my friends.

I'm quite comfortable at this current company. I'll complete 2 years next month, which is the longest I've ever been at any place, and if they gave me a higher position I'd gladly stay longer. But I'm not sure this will happen given everything I'm seeing. 

My question is: should I tell my current manager everything I just stated here, stating how I feel, my expectations, and asking him how does he sees my future in the company and if a promotion is viable?

I'm really unsure if this is the right move because: 1) I don't want to seem ungrateful, and he just gave me a raise and 2) I feel like maybe he'll just tell me what I already know: that he appreciates my efforts, but he cannot promise me anything, as we don't know how the company will perform financially on the next months and so on. On the other hand, I feel like if I don't ask, it will never happen. And I don't want to leave him on the dark about how I feel, and for it to be a surprise if I end up findind a better job and leaving next year, cause I feel that would also be ungrateful (even though it's just how the market goes and blablabla, this one has been my best experience so far, and I don't want to burn bridges). 

Honestly, I think I just needed to vent. 

Any clarity, reality checks or advice on this would be really appreciated.",Any_Spinach_4001,3,0.8100000023841858,8,1754926126,2025-08-11 15:28:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mng32z/should_i_question_my_boss_about_a_promotion_right/,8,2025
1mng10e,Are there still any creative jobs worth doing?,"I(22M) feel so frustrated and lost beacause it seems like everytime i go in a career direction i fail. For context I wanted to be a prop maker when I was 18, but everyone I talked to in South-Africa(where I live) said you'll regret it, its a dying industry, and to just get an engineering degree.

 Then to try and play it ""save"" I studied graphic design and the graduates I talked to said it was impossible to find a job. I considered vfx but then It came out that studios were underpaying and overworking everyone. During this time I found blender and got good at it. So this past year I put my head down and  tried to do freelance product visualization. Turns out nobody here knew what 3d even was. By the time I actually got some clients, more and more youtubers I watched for advice on how to do freelance 3d said that they were stopping beacause clients were asking too little beacause of ai.

On the corporate side of things it also feels like any creative position either needs years of experience or a job description that names every creative skill under the sun as somehow one job.

 Now it just feels like any creative job worth doing will just be done by ai unless you're already an established artist and I'm stuck with a useless degree and all my skills being replaced. I don't know if I've been doing something really important wrong,though I obviously have some regrets.

Sorry if this seems whiny, I'm just looking for some recommended career paths or advice from someone from the outside in.

1mnfv70,What degree to shoot for after 22 years of Airforce aircraft maintenance?,"TLDR: What engineering related careers have good outlook for a 22yr Airforce Aircraft Structural Maintainer besides Aerospace engineering?

I know there's no sure fire answer and this might be asking a lot, but I'd like to hear insight from others that might have that linchpin advice that will click for me.

Background:

I'm a career Air Force maintainer with about 10 years left before retirement. I've worked the last 11 years on 5th gen aircraft (F22/B2/F35) paint and structural work, and this last year I've switched to 4th gen aircraft with more sheet metal work. I've already reached the point where I'm entering more of the management side of the rank structure as an E6.

Something clicked recently and has me looking forward to more than likely retirement in 2035ish and moving on to something that I should have more than a CCAF for. The question is what degree to shoot for,  or more accurately what career path to seek out that I can use. I don't want to continue Aerospace, but I do love engineering as a general field. Looking at Electrical, Mechanical, Biomedical, Civil, and Computer to lead to something in the Colorado/Wyoming area. Any advice, statistics, and/or life lessons welcome.

1mnfiwb,I don’t know which option to choose,"I (F34) recently got offered a new job. My current place is good enough. I’m not the biggest fan of my manager, as he’s not always very nice, can be a shovinist, incredibly socially awkward, and quite frankly - no one knows what he does on the day-to-day basis, other than sending everything “down the line”. I work in Business Development. There were weeks when there were just the two of us in the team, and I would work on 11 proposals in a week. He wouldn’t even take one from my pile, but he would be happy to drop by my office every couple of minutes to ask if I’m fine (I’m not exaggerating. I actually started counting it at one point, and between 9:34 and 10:12, he was at my office four times. Each time, to ask if I’m okay). We were an extremely understaffed department, and it took my manager nine months to hire additional people for our team, after previous person left (stating in her exit interview very clearly, that’s she’s leaving because of the manager). He hired a manager (technically above me, although I’ve been told we’re at the same level — I just don’t have the title. Bullpoop, I know.) and a senior coordinator.

I was fairly happy with the new job offer I had received. My biggest concerns were the lack of an annual bonus and the fact it was a 12-month contract rather than a permanent position. However, it came with a two-level promotion, a significant pay rise, and the chance to escape my current manager. So, I handed in my resignation.

Then my current company made a counter-offer: a one-step promotion, a pay rise, two extra weeks of unpaid annual leave, and an annual bonus worth around £9k. They even involved senior employees who emailed me asking me to stay. I received a lot of messages, which really made me second-guess my decision.

I went back to the other company, explained that my current employer’s offer was financially stronger and came with job stability, but that I loved their team and would be happy to re-apply if they had openings early next year after I collect my bonus.

That was on 31 July.

I told my current employer I was staying, withdrew my resignation, and things have been calmer — my manager is easier to deal with (probably due to the summer workload being lighter, and perhaps the reality check of my initial resignation). Senior employees have been sending me thank-you messages for staying.

Fast forward to today: the other company has now offered me a permanent position, a £5k signing bonus, enrollment in their annual bonus scheme, plus the same two-level promotion and pay rise they had originally offered.

I truly like the other company, but I also know what to expect in my current workplace. I also feel incredibly bad for re-resigning… I’m torn — should I stay or should I go?",Swimming_Low_6680,1,1.0,1,1754924861,2025-08-11 15:07:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mnfiwb/i_dont_know_which_option_to_choose/,8,2025

But finished the degree somehow and luckily i passed the last sem with barely 2 or 3 marks for mathematics analysis (which was the worst).

Then I wanted to do something that didn't require Math. And I chose programming (Boy i was wrong). Thanks to  youtubers.

I went towards web development since that's the easiest for someone who is starting out coding. HTML was easy, CSS was colorful, Javascript was good.

But turns out Javascript was just like math but with no numbers. It pokes my brain from inside just like those integrals did. They two are like those twins that doesn't look the same.

I won't say Javascript is as bad as maths but i'm no good at it cause it's pricking my brain too.

So I would like to get some career options to consider, from you guys. Something that doesn't prickle my head.

I'm currently thinking of UI/UX since i already know HTML, CSS which may come in handy and will justify for the 1 year i wasted  
on Full Stack. But these AI tools  and Canva like software is what am worried about.

1mndw3k,Feeling Stuck and Out of Place in My First Full-Time Job — Did I Make a Mistake? Should I be here?,"I’ve been struggling with my first full-time corporate job, and I’m wondering if anyone else has been through something similar.

Here’s some background: I started at this cooperate America company as an intern in summer 2023. My mom helped me get the internship as she is an assistant of the VP in our section of the business, and while the work was pretty minimal, I figured that was normal for an intern. I didn’t mind too much — I thought once I became a full-time employee, things would pick up and make more sense and that this was just a learning experience. The two years that I was an intern I created lots of meaningful connections with the other interns even to this day as I would say I am a person who thrives off connecting with other people.

I graduated this past December and officially started full-time in February. Pretty quickly, I realized I wasn’t happy. I felt disconnected, isolated, and overwhelmed. I struggled to understand the work, and I honestly just felt like I didn’t belong. The intern connections that I made in the past moved on to other companies or are still in school. I had ""quarter life"" crisis as you might call it and broke down at my desk wondering if this is really what I want to do for the rest of my life sitting behind a desk all day every day? I thought maybe I was burnt out, so I talked to my manager and was able to take a 3-month mental health break (thankfully, it was approved).

The break helped, and I came back last week. Ironically, it was also the last week of the summer intern program. Everyone around the office seemed very excited to see that I was back and in office. I connected really well with the one of intern on my team even if it was just one week, and for the first time in a while, I felt a little more like myself as I another person my age was on my team. But now that the intern is gone, I exchanged contact info with her but still isn't the same. Today is the start of my second week back to being surrounded by coworkers who are much older and harder to connect with.

I’m starting to feel the same anxiety and self-doubt I had before my break. There’s not much work being given to me, which makes me wonder if my team thinks I’m a failure or that I’m just a ""personality hire"" who’s only here because of my mom. I know I hold myself to such a high standard that any mistake feels like confirmation that I don’t belong I also have this feeling that I have to always prove that I belong here. Even with barely any workload, I feel stressed and disconnected.

I know I shouldn’t compare myself or overthink, but it’s hard not to when I feel like I’m not growing, not contributing, not fitting in, and even if this is the job for me. I've had a past in selling/reselling cards as a part time job, but I let it go because it didn't feel like a ""real job"" I could do for the future. I’m not sure if I just need to push through this rough patch or seriously start looking at other paths.

Has anyone else felt this way early in their career? How do you know if a job just isn’t right for you — or if you just need more time to adjust?

1mnd5ip,"Accidentally got two jobs, need to quit one","TL;DR - Better job said they’re laying me off and so I got a shitty job for the bills. Better job changing its mind and now i have to choose between the two, plus a new company is expressing interest.

Hey Everyone! 

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I understand its long and this is a decision only I can make but it is hard to figure out difficult career situations. Quick note, I understand this strays into ‘overemployed’ territory but i’m really trying to not do that whole thing so I posted here.

I work at a great company doing contract work and in early June I learned my contract was being cut as part of the DOGE stuff. This wasn’t performance based, but I learned that the company was beginning layoff procedures. To take care of myself, I immediately started interviewing for new jobs. One local company that I didn’t like offered me a job and though I would normally say no to what they offered in a heartbeat, I took it in order to pay the bills and support my family (i’m the sole income earner). Its much worse when it comes to pay and benefits (much less pay, worse medical, in person 5 days a week, 30 minute commute, culture resistant to change) but people are very friendly, its simple, the business case is very very interesting, I’m a big fish in a small pond, and I believe i can transfer into a more lucrative role elsewhere with this experience ~ a year and a half from now. Also noteworthy that I’d have time to get a professional certificate.

Perhaps this was a mistake in hindsight, but I kept my original job because its full time remote and I expected an odd 2 week period where I would start my new job and where i’d be officially laid off with minor severance benefits (thought if the company was screwing me over then I need to look out for myself). They also hinted new roles might come up and this company is way too good to just walk away from - I might not have this opportunity again. Well, I’m two weeks in the new job and my remote one just announced that a multi week professional development training seminar is scheduled a few weeks from now and they want me to attend. Talked to my boss about the seminar and he said that they’re prepping employees for a new contract that they believe has a good chance of being signed, but definitely isn’t a guarantee. 

On top of all that, another relatively prestigious hybrid company in my local area is expressing interest and I believe I have a good chance at landing the job.

So, do I bite down and stay at this newer shittier job which is guaranteed income, might be translated into a higher paying job later, but would barely pay the bills, or do I take the riskier path and either hope my og job pays off in a BIG way, but risk losing all the job prospects.

To any and all who may have read this, thank you for your time and understand I want to do the right thing. I don’t know what to do as I was told I was being laid off and acted accordingly but it just never happened.

1mncug4,I have ruined my career due to terrible uni choices (3rd worlder),"I’m from Algeria.

I graduated high school with a score of 18.21 out of 20, which is considered excellent. I got almost perfect scores in my main subjects for the science track, but my grades in the less important subjects lowered my overall average. Because of that, I barely got accepted into my country’s top computer science school.

I was accepted into a prestigious engineering school in the capital but decided instead to enroll in computer science at a large public university (USTHB) in the standard bachelor’s track, not the more competitive engineering track.

I could have applied to private universities here that have strong programs and partnerships with foreign institutions and industries. They often make it easier to study abroad later. I had the money and the ability to enroll in those programs, but I didn’t know they existed at the time.

In my first two years of university, I performed very poorly. In my first year, I averaged 9.5/20 and barely passed. In my second year, I averaged 10/20 (8/20 first semester, 12/20 second semester). I failed because I was upset about not getting into the top CS school and ended up in a program where students could get in with much lower high school scores. I was irresponsible and unmotivated.

Now I’ve realized that to study in France, I need:

Strong grades

To pass all three years of my bachelor’s without failing any classes


If I apply to study in France now, I’ll almost certainly be rejected. I still have failed courses to make up for, and my grades are terrible.

My plan is to become the top student in my final year. But if I apply after I graduate, I’ll have to wait a year for the results. And if accepted, I’d have to repeat my last year in France. That means I would graduate with a master’s in 7–8 years instead of the usual 5–6.

I’ve missed many opportunities and feel like I’ve ruined my future. By the time I finish, some of my friends will already have master’s degrees from France and be working in their fields.

One of my friends got a much lower high school score than me but is going to study in France this year because he enrolled in a private university here that’s connected to French institutions and maintained decent grades.

I feel hopeless. I keep thinking about all the years I’ll lose and the possibility of still being rejected. I had so many chances, but I wasted them. If I had been responsible and made better choices after high school, I could already be studying in France right now.

I keep feeling regret everyday which just completely destroys my willpower to do anything for the day. I don't know how to deal with this.

Note: I say France because it's the easiest (easiest not easy) to move into for education from Algeria, but I generally mean just studying abroad in any country that provides quality education and job opportunities after getting my diploma.",OriginalRGer,2,0.6700000166893005,0,1754918534,2025-08-11 13:22:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mncug4/i_have_ruined_my_career_due_to_terrible_uni/,8,2025
1mncsd7,"When your company asks you to switch tech stacks at 36, what would you do?","Hey folks,  
I’m in a weird career spot and could use some honest opinions.

I’m 36 with \~9.5 years of experience:

* **Backend:** PHP, Laravel, CodeIgniter, MySQL (major focus)
* **Some years:** Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
* **Frontend:** jQuery (a lot), some React.js

Until recently, I was working remotely for a company in another city. They said they have no PHP projects anymore and didn’t want me for full-stack MERN/PERN roles — maybe because of my background.

They offered me a chance to move into **Salesforce** so I could stay longer, and I agreed. I’ve started learning it, thinking it could be good for the future.

Now there’s a new project in my city, and they’ve got another Salesforce dev with 6+ years of experience. My boss treats him as the technical lead, and I’ve been told I’ll be a **coordinator for the L3 support team** with some dev tasks. Honestly, I’m feeling more like a junior again — which is a hit to my confidence.

My choices seem to be:

* **Option 1:** Resign and find a new role in my core stack (PHP/Node.js), but many openings want immediate joiners.
* **Option 2:** Stay, keep learning Salesforce, swallow the ego hit, and aim for long-term growth. Friends say Salesforce is a solid career move.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do? Stick around and skill up in Salesforce, or start job hunting now?

1mnblyg,Redirection of life,"Hello! For slight context I have been in an ongoing PIP for almost a year. It’s the most bizarre and unprofessional PIP I have ever heard of and my first. 

1. Last November it was 30 days, signed by my manager and me. 
2. Second one was an extension of the 30 days no written only verbal. That one never ended and I was just monitored the whole time.
3. This last one started end of July because I went through crisis in May-July and my work took a hit so I was put on a final PIP. This one was in workday. My manager stated it was out of her hands which means the guy I work with decided to bully his way up to corporate. 

Part of the solution was to have weekly meetings with my team and manager. Well my manager took MONTHS and I sent follow up after follow up meeting. We finally had meetings, the following year.

The guy I work with? Zero meetings and refuses to talk to me or acknowledge I exist. And I can tell what kind of day he’s going to have based off emails. We are only 4 years apart which is :)

Im not sure if this is how all corporate works but I feel really burnt out and I’m not even 30 yet.

1mnbdsj,"First 8 weeks at job, going terrible","Got my first job post graduation and I am sucking terribly at it. About 8 weeks ago, I started as a coordinator for the legal department at a sports company. Responsibilities include note taking, sitting in on interviews, memo writing, creating slide decks, organizing, sending out calendar invites. 

I think I have fucked up at every task I’ve been assigned. The first one was creating a slide deck for a presentation (I formatted it terribly out of nerves and looked really stupid). The second one was an announcement poster, and in creating the first draft I used the wrong announcement body message. In creating a spreadsheet of data I had error to video links. A lawyer asked me for notes I took during a meeting and I sent them like 6 hours after.

I seriously don’t know what’s wrong with me. Everybody knows I’m doing a bad job in the office and I feel embarrassed. I’m not particularly passionate about the work, but it’s not even hard work for me to be consistently fucking up.

I keep telling myself that I only have to stay for one year, and then I can reevaluate but I feel pretty bad and ungrateful going into work every week. The team is relatively nice, it’s a very cool job and here I am complaining!! There was a week of overlap with the past coordinator, and she was amazing at the job. Extremely organized, well-liked, personable and everyone spoke very highly of her. She’s two yrs older than me (spent a bit less that 2 yrs in this role) and is going to law school.

1mnazdl,Is this a red flag?,"Married 31 female. I’ve recently joined a new office that requires us to be in the office full time. I currently work part time 3 days a week and have my other business which I do 2 days a week. I unexpectedly found out I was pregnant a few weeks ago, but started bleeding and assumed I miscarried. However bleeding continued and I am now being monitored for an ectopic pregnancy. Due to being fairly new I’ve not told any of my team about this, as I feel they would judge me for getting pregnant so early into my role. However, I now need an urgent appointment tomorrow for a scan and bloods to assess if this is indeed ectopic. I told my boss I needed an hour or two for the appointment mid morning and didn’t tell her exactly what the appointment was for, just that it was at the doctors. I said I was willing to work later that day to accommodate the time lost. She then asked me to reschedule or take the day off tomorrow and come in later on one of the days I normally have off. I tried to be accommodating so agreed to take the day off tomorrow but I feel like that’s really unfair. What’s everyone’s thoughts on this? I understand it’s hard as an employer when people need time off, but I have only been in this job 2.5 months and I’m now concerned that anytime I need a doctors appointment I will be forced to take the entire day off and work another day I am not meant to. 

I really hope I am going to be ok, but ironically, if this is an ectopic, I will be forced to take much more time off, which I don’t think will go down well.

My baby isn’t due until March. However, my husband and I have recently decided that I won’t be returning  and will be a stay at home mom. I was going to continue to work, but after recent events at work, we’ve made the decision to stay at home. I won’t go into details but my boss (who is also the owner) was very nasty/unprofessional about my pregnancy announcement.  There is no HR or anything I can report this stuff to so it makes the situation complicated. We work with clients and have to plan things in advance which is why I’m nervous to tell them I’m leaving. What we do is very niche and it’s hard to find someone who has experience. I’m the only one in my office who does certain things. My coworkers all have other obligations. 

I feel as if there are two options :

I thought about telling them now so we have 7 months to hire and train someone new. My husband believes they’ll fire me on the spot. 

Or not say anything until I leave and then let them know I’m not coming back. Which would leave them and my coworkers in a bad spot. 

Any advice?

1mn5hb1,Advice needed: Night shift role 23 km from home with limited transport,"I’ve been offered a night shift position located about 23 km from where I live. The company only provides a one-way cab, so I would need to arrange part of my commute myself.

The pay is higher than other offers I’ve seen, but I’m torn. I’ve been struggling to land a job for a while, and part of me feels I should grab this opportunity. At the same time, I’m concerned about:
	•	Safety and convenience of traveling that far at night
	•	The long-term impact of working night shifts on health and lifestyle
	•	Whether the higher pay is worth the commute and schedule challenges

As a fresher, I’m wondering if this is a smart stepping stone or if I’d be better off holding out for something more sustainable.

What would you do in my situation?

1mn4g26,Exploring a Career Shift: Combining Law with Tech for Long-Term Stability and Earnings,"I’m 27 with 3 years of experience in software product design, and I’ve been thinking a lot about my long-term career path. I’m planning to work in tech until I’m 40 or until the field saturates. My main concern is the impact of AI and how tech jobs might change over the next 15 years, especially as AI automates more tasks. Given that, I’m looking for something that offers long-term stability as I approach my 40s and beyond.

Here’s the plan:

* I want to pursue a law degree part-time while continuing to work in tech. Once I finish my law degree, I’m considering cyber law, intellectual property (IP) law, or legal tech.
* The goal is to combine legal expertise with my tech background to work in areas like data privacy, AI ethics, or tech regulations—fields that are growing and aren’t as susceptible to automation.

# My questions:

1. Earnings Potential: Between continuing in tech (especially in leadership roles) vs. moving into cyber law or IP law, which path generally offers better financial rewards in the long term, particularly after 40?
2. Stability & Flexibility: Given concerns about AI and job automation in tech, which path seems more likely to provide long-term stability and opportunities to work remotely as I approach my 60s and beyond?
3. Legal and Tech Intersection: Does combining law with tech expertise create a solid career path for the future? How does legal tech compare to traditional law in terms of growth, demand, and earning potential?
4. Other Career Ideas: If anyone has other suggestions for cross-career combinations that blend existing skills and provide stability and growth, I’m all ears.

I’m genuinely looking for feedback on whether combining law and tech is a good direction for long-term security and earnings, especially given the changing landscape of work.",Venisha_,2,1.0,3,1754889465,2025-08-11 05:17:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mn4g26/exploring_a_career_shift_combining_law_with_tech/,8,2025

1mn38v1,"Lost and need help (Whining, sorry in advance)","(TLDR: I can't find a job as a 2D game artist, and too old and too useless to find another career path. Any advice?) 

 Check out my [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/phuctranbao) and [Behance](https://www.behance.net/phuctranbao), and please refer me to anyone's hiring.

So once upon a time in 2017, I got accepted into university with a Computer Science major. It took me less than a year to realize that not only is this not what I wanted to do, but I also struggled with every class. Meanwhile, everyone else in class got internships, scholarships, foreign exchange programs, etc. Peer pressure was hell, to say the least. 

I wanted to change. But I live in Vietnam, and at the time in Vietnam, if you're going to change major, you have to drop out, do a whole lot of paperwork to re-apply, wait for the next national entrance exam, study for it, and take the exam again, even though all of the things you learn in the test has absolutely nothing to do with the things you are going to learn in university. It's just too much. But I can't be someone with no degree, so I pinched my cheeks together and sat through countless mental breakdowns. And then, in 2021, with a lot of effort and help from all the friends around me, I finally graduated and was liberated from whatever that was.

I started pursuing art, which is my actual calling, ever since I realized I am not made for CS. Not the classical gallery fancy art, just the office 9-to-5 job 2D game artist art. And for whatever reason, I just couldn't find a job. I apply everywhere possible, but I either fail their test or pass the test only to fail the interview. And now, it's 2025, I couldn't find an internship, and the game art industry is either dying or oversaturated with artists, or both. And the blasted AI didn't help. (Switched to an entirely new career path during the height of a pandemic, and wonder why I can't get a job. Genius.)

So my question is, what do I do? I wasted half of my 20s on a job that is never gonna come, I can't apply for any other job because all of my skills and experience are tied to art. I can't start over again. My poor parents can't take it. I wouldn't know what to change to anyway. Who the hell is going to hire a 26 yo with no skills and no experience? My friends finished their master's degrees, are doing PhD, are married with kids, and the only thing I'm good for is whining to strangers online just to pass the time. 

I'm still working on improving my skills, but it's so hard to keep moving.",Square_Fox_2416,2,1.0,1,1754885387,2025-08-11 04:09:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mn38v1/lost_and_need_help_whining_sorry_in_advance/,8,2025

1mn2okn,Should I quit for my mental health?,"I’ve worked as a medical assistant for 2 years at an ophthalmology clinic. I was full time for 1.5 of those years, recently became part time this Jan. I was getting paid $18 then they gave me $19 ($1 raise) after a year. It took me a lot of convincing them to give me a raise. Anyways, I became part time bc I started working part time at a primary care clinic. They don’t know that tho and I just informed them I’ve been working on my application for school (which I am also- so I’m very stress lol) Anyways, ever since I’ve become part- time the manager has been a B to me. I got a probation for being constantly late ( I have since corrected this; Ik this is my fault) then she would decline a lot of my time off. Once she approved it and then rescinded it. Then while I was sick I slacked them that I couldn’t make it to work and she put me on probation bc I should have messaged her directly. She says that she doesn’t have the same problems with anyone else, just me. And she constantly puts me on schedule on the days I can’t work so we constantly have meetings. She even said that I’m not a team player for not coming in when help is needed, meanwhile she’s approving other ppl time off and that’s why we are short staff. She’s doing it again bc all the 5-7 ppl she hired are part time students who can’t come in for 2 weeks. Like why is this my problem? I’ve messaged her stating that my contract switched since Jan ever since I went part time, letting her know my availabilities and now she wants to talk in person. She even makes me feel bad when I have to go attend an important family health issue or if I’m cramping. I love what I do, the doctors, most of my coworkers and patients. But I’ve started to dread going to work bc of her, even my coworkers wants me to stay but will support if I leave bc of the treatment I’m getting. I feel like I know the answer is to leave, the thing is I don’t really have a job lined up and I was considering leaving the other primary care job bc AI is taking over and it’s also so far from where I live now. I’m also worried about letter of rec, but I think the doctors will understand and can still send me one? I do help pay with house bills like rent and other stuff and I just don’t know if I should continue tolerating her disrespect?

1mn15g2,Fired for being introverted and quiet?,"(21F) just got fired for the first time seemingly out of no where. I’ve always been an overachiever. Never had performance issues at any of my other jobs before. 

About 4 months ago I got hired on to work at this brand new small business. This is the first time I haven’t worked for a corporation in my life and I was excited! 

This was also. my first job out of beauty school and for the first two months I was doing a lot of training and such to get ready to open. Once we opened for business I started to realize some issues. 

At this job there were only 4 employees. I was the youngest, the rest were all women that were significantly older than me. From day one I knew I was going to be the odd one out. I don’t have a partner or kids, I live with my parents while I’m trying to get my feet off the ground. I’m also super nerdy, into anime and stuff. But I know how to tone things down for work. 

I didn’t really start to notice things were off until a few weeks ago. They moved my clients to the other provider and didn’t tell me, my aunt had referred a few friends to book with me specifically and they told them I wasn’t available that day (I was) and then proceeded to book them with the other provider. 

Then I noticed that on the online booking my schedule was grayed out. I brought it up to them and they told me that I could work front desk if I wanted hours. I told them it was fine but I didn’t really want to do that since I was there to get hands on experience. I thought a client must’ve left a bad review or something. 

Working in the beauty industry I know there’s drama. The 3 of my co workers bonded instantly. They were super close. I just came in when I was told and gave my clients the best service I could. 

I didn’t want to talk about the issues going on at home, my mental health, relationship issues and such. I also didn’t want to talk about my interests because I didn’t want to seem weird, and this obviously wasn’t the nerdy type of crowd. I knew if I opened up they would talk about me behind my back. 

And on top of that I’m just a soft spoken person overall. I can be energetic and bubbly once I warm up to people but I was only at this job maybe 5-10 hours a week at this point. 

So I brought up the schedule change to my boss. I had a gut feeling that they didn’t like me because I am more introverted and quiet. I felt a disconnect partly because of the lack of communication and also just age difference. I’m also a POC and all my coworkers were not. Based on all the comments they’ve been making I knew they didn’t vibe with me and just wanted to hire someone else but didn’t have a reason to get rid of me. 

So when I’m talking to my boss she responded by saying “I know you’re introverted but…” and she told me she didn’t think I was a good fit since I wasn’t as bubbly as the other girls. She told me I exclude myself(which isn’t 100% true since the other girls would go out to lunch together leaving me to watch the front, had a group chat without me etc.) she then also brought up that I had no called no showed one day(I had 0 clue about this. They never called me) the then brought up some other issues like some computer work I had genuinely forgotten to do earlier in the week. And that I wasn’t selling enough. 

I feel like all the issues could’ve been an easy fix. She could’ve just had a chat with me about the computer work I forgot to chart that day. At no point was I given a sales goal. I had 0 idea I was having performance issues. 

They just started cutting me with no coaching or warning. We also didn’t have a scheduling app or anything. I was literally texting my boss about hours and there were days when she wouldn’t respond to me. Being a new business I was just trying to be mindful of payroll but I guess it came off as I didn’t want to be there? 

I also don’t understand why I needed to be super close with my co-workers. Granted they instantly clicked and would talk outside of work, get drinks after etc. I was friendly when I was there but I didn’t feel the need to gossip or overshare about my personal life and relationships while I was on the clock. 

My boss told me she didn’t like that I was shy. I honestly didn’t really have a problem with my coworkers I just didn’t want a relationship outside of work hours. They aren’t my friends and I thought that was fine. They also babied me a lot and constantly gave me unsolicited life advice. It made me feel excluded since they did talk down on me for being single and the youngest. 

Also these said coworkers were “bubbly” but would loudly use vulgar language and play TikTok’s out loud in front of clients trying to do paper work. They would loudly overshare details about their romantic life in front of clients(no one wants to hear that) they would talk and giggle so loud you could hear it down the hall and in my room with the door closed. 

I feel so conflicted. Like I said I’ve never really had performance issues, and the things they brought up could’ve been fixed with a quick chat or reminder. Especially knowing I’m new and young I don’t know why I was expected to just figure everything out with no direction. Especially when they wanted to start moving clients around and gaslighting me about it I just got so completely lost on what my role was there. 

I’m going to go in tomorrow and get my things. This is disappointing because it was my first job in the industry after searching for 8 months. It’s making me rethink all my career choices so far. 

Every other job I’ve done has had some kind of point system to track any attendance or performance issues. It feels like they’re just firing me without any other reason besides I don’t fit in with their little group. 

I am honestly distraught and shocked. I was bullied a lot as a kid and that’s why I tend to be closed off and quiet. I wasn’t aware that that was a fireable offense! If I was aware I would’ve put more effort into being more bubbly but I didn’t know this was an issue. I had a job in the past where I overshared and dated someone from there and it turned into a big mess and I also didn’t want a repeat of that. 

TL;DR Fired from the beauty industry for being introverted and quiet. Kept to myself to avoid drama. No client complaints, boss just thinks I’m not a good fit and doesn’t have solid proof of performance issues. Wasn’t aware that being social was part of my performance review.

1mn0v6f,Need to repay my mother but stuck in med school,"
Hi all, 

Just needed some life advice, mentally in a bad place.

To cut a long story short, during COVID I had lost mine and my mother's savings in the stock market (thousands). I am now due to start medical school in September and have a scholarship which I originally intended to use to pay for publications and conference fees etc but now after reflection really do not feel it is right for me to use this scholarship on the publication/conference fees. I'd much rather start paying my mother back throughout the duration of my degree (scholarship is a few thousand for every year of my degree).

I collaborate with a professor from a top three university in the UK and usually requires 800-1600 GBP per publication and for the specialty I wanted to get into I am required at least 10+ publications.

I've looked it up, to publish in Lippincott or high impact journals etc require thousands. And for hypercompetitive specialties like neuro, cardiology etc it's been said the more publications you do in med school the better the chances you get into your specialty as it is impossible to get published during FY1 and beyond?

Would appreciate some advice on this.",Spirited_Driver_2164,2,0.6700000166893005,11,1754878125,2025-08-11 02:08:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mn0v6f/need_to_repay_my_mother_but_stuck_in_med_school/,8,2025
1mn0ds2,Will it look bad to employers if I take a gap year after graduating college?,"I'll be graduating college in May, hoping to go into working in newspapers. I've had two newspaper sumer internships so far.

Money is really tight for me at the moment, and I'm not sure I'll have enough by the end the summer (or sooner) to move somewhere else and start over. All my savings are being wiped out by this last year of tuition and student loan payments are set to start right after the summer ends.

I've been freelancing for my local newspaper for a few months now and will continue to do so until May. I also pay really cheap rent right now (only 650/month) so it's a pretty okay gig.

I'm thinking about taking a gap year after I graduate college, staying in my college apartment and working somewhere and freelancing for the local paper during that time. The goal would be to save as much money as possible to eventually have enough to make going into my first job a little easier.

Would this look bad to employers once I do start applying places?

For the first few days, my manager told me to come in at 9:30 AM, but he also scheduled an 8 AM meeting that I missed because I thought it wasn’t mandatory.

Right now, I’m eager to make an impact and contribute meaningfully, but I’m not sure what’s expected of me over the next few weeks or months. My coworkers have shown me some parts of the job, but they tend to be introverted and not very open to small talk, which makes building rapport difficult.

1mmyhlm,Academic/Career pivot,"So I just graduated with a bachelor’s degree in political science from an American uni in Europe a few months ago but finding a job in the humanitarian (and tbh every other loosely related fields) has been a pain! This is Ofc also due to my immigration status as a person with a very weak passport in Europe.
As there is much discouraging evidence of international organisations shrinking, quality of governance declining and the job field being even more fierce, I am currently contemplating of taking on a more technical master’s degree as my route to getting even an internship experience within Europe has been disconnected. 
I currently have Agriculture/rural dev, geoinformatics and cybersecurity(managerial side) on the table and I want to make a decision based on career prospects upon graduating. This included transferability of skills I might acquire and field impact.
I would love to hear any insights and I am soooo open to other suggestions too. Thanksss!

1mmy7th,"Need career/education advice, almost done with my BA but should I switch paths?","I’m two semesters away from finishing my BA in Business. I’ve been in school on and off for over 10 years, mostly because I couldn’t decide what I wanted to do, changed my major a bunch of times, and then had a baby.

Two years ago, I switched to Business because it seemed like the most versatile option with a lot of job opportunities, and I could finish it while working full-time (which was a must at the time).

Now I’m in a different place in life. I’m engaged to someone who makes good money, so I don’t feel the same pressure to just “pick something practical” out of desperation. I’ve also almost maxed out my federal student loans, and to finish the BA I’d have to pay $10k out of pocket this year on top of using the rest of my loan eligibility.

I keep reading stories from people with similar degrees who can’t find good jobs, and it feels like a bachelor’s doesn’t mean much these days unless it’s specialized. I’ve been looking into other options like Dental Hygienist or Ultrasound Tech. Both are 2-3 year programs, pay really well right away, and have strong job security.

So now I’m torn-

Do I suck it up, finish my BA in Business, and be done with it? Or do I cut my losses, skip the BA, and use my remaining loan eligibility on one of these specialized programs that might lead to a better-paying job faster?

Has anyone been in a similar spot? What would you do?",Desperate_Bobcat_862,1,1.0,2,1754870609,2025-08-11 00:03:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mmy7th/need_careereducation_advice_almost_done_with_my/,8,2025
1mmy0g1,Masters Degree/Career Change?,"Looking for some advice.  I worked for a large company almost 12 years in various management/leadership roles.  I hit a wall where I was basically told it would be hard for me to continue to climb the ladder without a degree.  I got married and resigned to finish my bachelors and start a family.  

I got my bachelors in healthcare administration, and now want to pursue a masters.  I originally thought Public Health would be good as it aligns with my interests, but being pragmatic I figured an MBA or masters in HR would fit my experience (I have zero experience in the healthcare field but again, wanted to pursue something that I was more interested in, the last company I worked at was insurance sales).

I was browsing the HR sub and seems like the general consensus is a masters in HR isn’t worth it, and experience matters most.  So now I’m torn on what to pursue, either way I want to pursue a masters as its a personal goal of mine, and for so many years I felt a lot of shame because I didn’t have a degree, and then being told by many that I’d never get ahead without one…I want to go as far as I can.  I have the support now to where I can do that, but I’ve also been out of work now for 4 years, will be 6 after getting a masters.  I’ll be 41 when I finish.  I feel like I’ll have more job opportunities with a decent salary if I go MBA or the HR route, versus healthcare where I have zero experience.

I guess I’m looking for input or advice or hear from others who were in a similar situation",Life_Spinach_7738,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1754870039,2025-08-10 23:53:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mmy0g1/masters_degreecareer_change/,8,2025
1mmwsh9,Taking a job offer with less pay than my last job?,"
I have been in sales for about 5 years. I’m in my late 20s, and live at home, very good relationship with my father. I pay bills but no rent, and I’m going back to school to finish a business admin degree with a concentration in finance.

My last role I was an SDR. I made $60k base and about $70-75k OTE. I was laid off in late May, was honestly so burned out and wasn’t given much training, and didn’t understand the product that well. Was honestly relieved that I was let go.

I’m pretty good on the phones, and think I want to stay in sales. So I’ve been looking pretty hard for the last month or so, and actually ended up landing a job offer.

The pros:

It’s remote (huge deal for me)
4.8/5 product market fit on repvue, meaning it’s a great product.
Seems easier to understand and sell

The cons:
50k base (I made 60k base since 2023)
70k OTE (although 5 of 7 reps ads hitting quota
1% 401k match (pathetic tbh)
Very mid benefits (2k deductible, about $190 a month)

I currently have over 100k saved, and 4 months left of unemployment that pays me $3k a month. I am however paying COBRA $935 a month for benefits from my last job (very good benefits) and also 1k per month for school.

I’m pretty money motivated, and taking a step back in base pay sounds awful. I’m also not guaranteed quick promotions. The goal is to become an AE (account executive) as fast as possible, because that’s where the real money is, but that would prob take me at least 2 years at this place, where some places are closer to a year if you do well.

Do I keep hunting and bet on myself? Or do I take the job?

1mms7z9,Is this reasonable? Plan on staying 5-7 months.,"I recently just got a job as a dock clerk in July which was right around my 21st birthday. So far, it’s definitely not a bad job! All i do is sit around, answering emails, help the drivers unload freight from their trucks, label/direct the right postal package to a person who works in our large building, and than deliver the mail to them via cart. Rinse and repeat. 


   The only gripe i have is that there is extremely limited upper mobility. There’s only one management position in our office since it’s smaller and above them is our QA manager. There’s no room from growth and long term I need a career that will offer growth, a marketable skill set, and of course better pay. I make $17.50 an hour which isn’t bad considering I still live at home. 

But to my question, would it be reasonable to leave this position around January-February if I find something I’m genuinely interested in? I’m considering either the post office (which actually translates well from my current role) or becoming a CNA due to the demand this role has.

1mmp5ie,"Asked for manager-level grade last year, denied for ""no direct reports"" - now they want me to ""act like a manager"" for major project crisis","Last year I received a competing job offer to negotiate for a raise. I specifically requested to be moved to a manager-level grade based on an existing role within the university (I work in Higher Ed). To be clear, by that point, I was a manager in all but name, with roughly 115 people that I was managing. However, because those 115 employees were not direct reports in our system, I was not given the manager role and put on the grade 1 level down.

Fast forward to now: we have a major project that is completely on fire. Leadership is asking me to step up and ""act like a manager"" to handle the crisis. I'm being asked to coordinate teams, research the job market to see if we can hire contract help (ironically giving me a pretty good idea of what my actual market worth is), manage project timelines, and basically do everything a manager would do -- except I'm still not getting paid like one and do not have the true authority of one.

The irony isn't lost on me. When I wanted the title and pay that matched my contributions, I was told I'm not a manager. But when they need someone to manage a crisis, suddenly I'm the person they turn to. And of course they would -- I wrote my own JDF when I negotiated for the raise, specifically with the idea in mind that I would be moved to a manager grade.

Here's the kicker: my current supervisor, while supportive, honestly doesn't have the ability or capacity to manage the level of work I'm doing anymore. I'm handling work at the same level she does at this point, and frankly, I should be reporting directly to the dean. My supervisor has made it clear that she doesn't believe I should pursue anything without a competing job offer, but here's the thing - with the uncertainty around public loan forgiveness programs, the main incentive to stay really is just loving the work.

We're talking about maybe $6k to put me at midrange of the next grade up - this isn't some massive leap they can't afford. But if I get another competing offer this time (and I could definitely find something paying significantly more), I'm not staying. The research I'm doing for this crisis project is making it very clear what my market value actually is.

I love my job and feel like I make a real impact, but this whole situation feels like a slap in the face. I'm planning to request that my job be re-reviewed for the manager grade, especially since I'm now being asked to perform managerial duties.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you approach asking for a grade/title change when you're already doing the work? Any advice on timing and approach would be appreciated - especially in higher ed where bureaucracy can be... challenging. I believe I should request to meet with the dean directly given my supervisor's stance, and I have it planned to ask in the next month or so (if I should) once I've put out the first fires and moving on to phase 3 of my 'definitely-not-a-manager' project plan.

1mmovb4,From Chasing Online Gigs to Landing Real Freelance Work — The Small Change That Turned Things Around,"I’ve been down that online hustle rabbit hole — surveys, micro-tasks, random writing gigs, Fiverr profiles gathering dust, even hanging around freelancing Discords hoping something would click. For months, I kept trying to figure out how to actually make money online, but it hit me — if you’re not offering something real and visible, people just won’t take you seriously.

Then I tried something that felt small but ended up being huge: I created a simple personal portfolio website. Basically my resume, but in the form of a clean, customized webpage. Nothing fancy — just a space that clearly showed who I am, what I do, and a few samples.

Whenever I applied for freelance work, I included the link. Almost immediately, things shifted. People actually responded. One even said, “This looks really professional — let’s talk.” That had never happened before.

Since then, I’ve helped a few friends build their own sites — especially those struggling to stand out despite having solid skills. This isn’t a sales pitch, but if you’re stuck like I was and want to know what I did or how I built mine, just DM me. I’ll happily walk you through it or share what worked for me.

1mmo97z,Considering switching jobs at 17 weeks pregnant,"Hi! I'm not sure this is the right place to post, but worth a shot. 
I've been at the same job since I was a teenager, and tend to do very well there. I live in MA. I am now a general manager at a well known fast food establishment. I make 62k a year salaried at 45 hrs a week, plus bonuses. It would equal out to about 70k a year overall. 
I am pregnant with my first child and really struggling with the work life balance and taking care of myself especially due to events that have happened recently. 
Last week I went home from work sick, and within hours of going home received a phone call from my boss where they were very upset with me for the state of my store and the staffing level. I was very sick with fever, body aches, and intense sore throat. I felt like I was going to pass out from just standing up for too long. 
Despite all of that, I later received a group text with my boss and her superior where they told me that I needed to figure out my store or else I was going to have a very big problem. I told them I was on my way to urgent care, and their superior demanded not only a note, but a diagnosis from a doctor which I believe is illegal. This made me extremely upset, and caused a lot of unnecessary stress. 
I went to the doctor and I have Covid. I sent my note in, and received no text back from the superior, only a (what felt like a backhanded) ""I hope you feel better."" from my boss. They put me out of work for a total of five days and I could tell they were NOT happy about this outcome, even though they demanded the diagnosis to begin with. 
The thing here is that I have had another job offer on the table for a while, and a position is open there currently. 8am-4pm, Mon-Fri mostly, no whacky hours and more guaranteed work like balance. I'm nervous about making the leap in my second trimester and wasn't originally planning on it until everything went down this week which just showed me how they will treat me in the future if my child is sick, or something out of my control happens with my family. it would also be a pay cut, I would still be making somewhere between $22-$24 an hour but at around 38 hours a week. If i get the new job soon, I will be off the probationary period before I give birth and qualify for all their medical benefits (which are also much better) and sick time / PTO. 
Is it worth sticking out this awful job, who clearly doesn't care about me? I'm very nervous about maternity leave because in my state mothers get 20-26 weeks PAID leave and I don't want to interfere with that, but I am also nervous for mine and my babies health if I continue to stay where I am. 
I need some advice, words of encouragement or discouragement and why? Should I stick It out for the next 20 weeks? Or should I bail while I still can? 
If I left anything out that anyone may need to know, please ask questions! I'm really torn here. I love my job, but the pressure, lack of empathy, weird hours, and work life balance are really taking a toll on me.

1mmo2q0,career advice?,"Hi All, was wondering if I could get some advice on careers. I'm currently a student that is about to finish a bachelors in psych and completely and utterly indecisive about what she should do. I have always wanted to do nursing, and still do. But I keep getting worried I'm going to fail and waste my money on classes just to fail or get mediocre grades. (ALSO I'm based in CA so keep that in mind)

My options are:

Nursing (Nursing school) (50% confident in)

DMS (sonography school) (60% confident in)

Business (management/project management/HR manager) 80% confident in)

Get a masters and stick with psych and  be a social worker (70% confident in)

My main problem with me being indecisive is that I don't want to end up taking community college classes, and not getting As or Bs (because nursing is extremely competitive As are the standard). Or even taking these classes and taking the entrance exam only to not get into Nursing school because I'm so bad at science. AND on top of that get into nursing school and just fail classes in nursing school (generally anything under a B 80% isn't ideal and in some cases failing). 

This goes for DMS as well. But not as much because DMS is hands on and not a HUGE amount of science like nursing. The problem is that there aren't a lot of accredited programs that do only certificate. Because I don't want to start over and get an associates,  which is what 70% of programs make you do. 

And for the last two options, I feel confident in. It would just require a lot of jobs to get experienced into, as well as pay won't be that great until 3+ years of working/experience. 

So its safe to say that I'm most confident I could be successful in the last two options, I just love nursing, and its been my dream job for years. But I need to be realistic. I have a family I need to care for and provide for and I want to make good money to care for myself, as well as family. 

I was actually thinking, let me just finish my degree, go to MA (medical assistant school), which is a 12-18 month program, so I can work and get experience in BOTH administration and clinical, while completing nursing and DMS clinical hour requirements. During me working, I would take classes at community (because I need 5 prereqs). During my hypothetical MA job I could potentially decide whether to get into health administration (Health care HR/health care PM/etc.) OR actually nursing with patients instead. 

I would love to hear what others think, should I try to go for nursing? should I simply get a master and stick with psych, or no more studying and just work in business by going up the ladder of experience and slowly making more money as time goes?

1mmn31f,Registered  Nurse or Radiology Technologist?,"I am 30F and currently work in mobile/internet sales and am not great at it. I am on the autism spectrum so I struggle with small talk/eye contact. While I can mask well I still come off as a little bit awkward or quiet. I am extremely friendly and polite, but I struggle with meeting sales goals. 
I am married and we want to start a family in the next couple years so I need to study something that I can support a family on since my husband is low income as an entry mechanic also. I also need to keep working full time while going to school, and work about 10 hours a day right now since we can’t afford less or we have to start cutting things like the gas/water bill to make rent. I wanted to study IT, but it’s too saturated, and I live in an area where the only healthy market of decent paying jobs is healthcare jobs. 
I have been considering studying being a registered nurse, and I have an aunt and a cousin that were nurses + a big hospital about 2 miles away from me. But I am also interested in studying to be a radiology technologist, it peaks my interest more, and frankly just seems like it would be less bullshit. But I am worried about AI and how it will impact the field. 
Both seem to have a healthy amount of job openings around here, and pay the same. One drawback though is while checking out my community college, the radiology technologist program only accepts 16 people a year, and next start is not until July next year. It seems to imply it’s very competitive to even begin and I am someone who has a GED and no other higher education/healthcare experience other than a vet assistant cert. Which doesn’t make sense to me because considering the amount of job openings for radiology techs here, it seems they are desperate for workers. 
Are there other options for schooling like partially online with this kind of work, if I have to drive to another city on my days off to do the other half on-site? And/or should I choose the path that seems more stable from AI but interests me less?

1mmm490,Company’s lawyers wants to interview about toxic exec – am I just digging my own grave? (Singapore),"First time dealing with this so I’m looking for advice. Based in Singapore.

About 6 months ago, my company hired a new C-suite guy who reports directly to the CEO, let’s call him “AliBaba.” Within weeks, he’d earned a solid rep for being rude, arrogant, condescending and just freaking toxic.

Two months back, I get an email from a local law firm. CC’d in CEO and HR Director. Email said:

* CEO/HR is aware there are “grievances” against AliBaba
* CEO/HR hired this law firm to “investigate” Alibaba's conduct
* They know I’ve had run-ins with AliBaba and want to interview me about my experience

So I do the interview with the law firm (CEO/HR were NOT present), dump all my complaints on the table, even send them a written statement. I ask where this is headed but they dodge by saying they need to “gather evidence” first. A bunch of my colleagues also got grilled.

Since then its just radio silence for 2 months. Meanwhile, AliBaba’s gotten even worse LOL just last week he sacked a mid-level manager in front of her whole team.

Now the same law firm emails me after 2 months, asking if I’m free for a second interview.

Here’s the bee in my bonnet:

* Why isnt Alibaba suspended on Full Pay while this ""investigation"" is ongoing?
* If I say stuff that could hurt company ops, do these lawyers HAVE to report it to management, aka their actual client?
* Could that hand them ammo to fire me for “misconduct” or some other BS?
* Is anything I say to them kept confidential from management, or does it all go upstairs? Since I'm not their client and their client is the company...
* Is this just a farce for the CEO/HR to help Alibaba weed out people who doesnt like him? Cuz no one will be brave enough to inform the CEO/HR directly about Alibaba's conduct for fear of losing their job.

If you’ve been through something similar in Singapore, what happened? Did it help clean house or did it blow up in your face?

1mmm1ag,"50% salary bump offer, but not excited about the new company. Is it worth taking?","I’ve been a data scientist for several years, the last five at a mid-size company. My pay feels low for my YOE (low 90s), though the workload is very light. The company’s had multiple layoffs over the years, the product isn’t great, the vision shifts every six months and my team hasn’t had a real roadmap for a while - we build machine learn models, but visibility is low. It’s comfortable, but I don’t feel safe.

After 6 months of job hunting, I finally got an offer: a data analyst role at a much smaller company (startup). The pay is 50% higher (high 130s), but I’m not impressed with their product or reputation, they’ve had layoffs too and I’d be the only data person, so more responsibility, more chaos, higher visibility and expected to produce a lot as the only data person there. Outside of the money, I don’t see much upside.

Part of me wants to take the raise and ride it out while I keep looking, part of me worries about leaving an easy (but stagnant) job for something more stressful and maybe less stable.

1mmkyu9,Extreme career switch,"Hello sub, 
24M here, completed my btech graduation in 2023 from a tier 2 college and got campus placement as a SE in a company in Bangalore. It’s been almost 6 months that i have left the company for pursuing a long standing dream for aviation, right now I’m preparing to become an airline pilot. 
(One of my main motivating factors for this switch was a friend who has also done btech but didn’t get a job and took 1yr for preparing to get into flying and is on the path right now). 

Looking back at the tech field makes me feel like switching back to the same coding field as most of my friends are there doing the same thing that we were for the past 2yrs. but it also looks kind of stagnant and quite literally boring to think about going back there; at the same time, pursuing aviation to get my flying license is gonna take a good 2yrs best case scenario, and the aviation market in India is currently going through a down time it looks like but it is supposed to open up by the time I am done with all my requirements ie 2027. 
All I am here for is a 3rd person opinion, whether what I am doing is stupid or ambitious or maybe over ambitious. 
(I have spoken to a number of CPL holders but I’m not able to get a clear picture, I use ChatGPT for inputs but all it does is agree with what I have to say  and my family has no aviators so o will be the first one to do so, so basically no one to ask.)

I subsequently applied to graduate school locally, but the process was disappointing. I plan to withdraw this year, and I'm increasingly disillusioned with continuing to work in experimental and data analysis fields. I'm desperate for a fresh start. Compared to other major countries, the work environment in mainland China is generally stressful and poorly paid, making me pessimistic about continuing my career there.

1mmgxfl,"Anxious about the future, regretting the past - need some perspective","
I’m a 29F and I’ll be turning 30 soon. 

I completed my postgrad in 2020 and started my career remotely. My first job was in a big MNC as a marketing generalist, and my second was at a mid-sized IT services firm as a social media manager but I ended up helping with email marketing, demand gen, brand marketing, internal comms. Pretty much everything except actually running paid campaigns (though I did design the ads and write the messaging).

My boss at the time called me his “right hand,” but in reality it meant I did a lot of the groundwork for things he didn’t want to touch. I’d research, plan, and set things up, then hand them over. But there was a major issue: my boss had a habit of threatening PIPs for even small mistakes. When he was in a good mood, he’d praise me, but looking back, it feels like the constant cycle of praise → threat → praise chipped away at my confidence.

And for the last year the team kept shrinking, people were fired or pushed out, and eventually the whole team was forced to resign, which even though it’s increasingly becoming the industry norm hasn’t helped my confidence. 

Now I’m in a niche startup leading marketing. It’s totally different, no one to report to in-fact I have people reporting to me, full autonomy, nothing has gone wrong… but I still feel like I’m doing things wrong or about to mess up. 

On top of that, I’ve never worked at a startup before, so I’m extra anxious about my future career path.

I guess I’m just looking for perspective, anything especially from anyone in marketing would be great. I feel so anxious I think it’s only a matter of time before it bleeds into the work that I am doing now.

I have found this is a good place to share struggles I am facing in my career as there are good souls keen to helping me out. So my background is I have graduated from one of tier 1 colleges in India, and have 3+ years of experience at 2 Big 4s and currently working in one of them. I am a D365 ERP consultant, though my background is good I am stuck in a technology which do not have many great opportunities to offer and because of which I feel stuck. On top of that the work pressure is a lot right now handling 2-3 different projects simultaneously taking upon work more than my experience and CTC. I have tried a lot switching the domain but have been very unsuccessful in doing so. After a lot of thought I have listed down best options for my career.

1. Continue as a D365 ERP consultant and look for opportunities abroad. I have been extensively searching for opportunities abroad for the last 3 months. Though I have found some companies that might offer me jobs abroad, as they have hired few of folks from India. But have denied posing different reasons, some have mentioned they are not looking to sponsor right now, some are not hiring right now, some are hiring but for senior roles and some are looking for native language speaker. 

2. Switch domain and try for something in Azure field. Previously I have tried to switch to SDE roles, but due to no experience in that domain it had been difficult for me to switch. As my current field is closely related to Azure I am looking to explore it more, earn some azure certifications and work on some good projects. Then try to switch in this domain may be as a cloud developer or Azure developer. 

3. Go for higher studies. As I have consulting background I can look to do my MBA, though it is a costlier option for me at the moment.

I would really appreciate your thoughts, though I have lot of options in my mind I feel I should try more for the first option as may be in few months I might get a opportunity abroad but that is purely my gut feeling and it is very uncertain because of the job market right now.",Sea-Fun-5287,1,1.0,1,1754820581,2025-08-10 10:09:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mmet9m/stuck_in_my_career_need_advice/,8,2025

1mmdybc,Should I take this promotion for a relocation away from family and friends?,"I was offered an elevated role in my company just recently that would require a relocation. I work for a mid sized commercial construction firm on the business development team. Relocation is not a very far distance - I live in Cincinnati and would be moving to Columbus (about 100 miles). Initial offer is about a 25% raise, 60k relocation, and 100k over 3 years into my 401k. Importantly - it is also an expedited path to an executive role, maybe 3-5 years where my path to executive if I declined would be longer and more unclear. The offer is pretty fair, it is everything else I am struggling with.

My wife and I are both 31, and just had our first baby less than a month ago. We live in the same school district as my sibling who has two cousins of my daughter, and my parents just retired from out of state and moved into our town as well. I have my whole network of friends here, some of which I’ve known for over a decade and are walking distance from us. Furthermore, we built our forever home in a town and school district we love just this year. We have been here for a decade and are so comfortable and familiar with everything, it was not even a thought that we’d move ever until this popped up. 

I am so torn on this. It is 100% the right career move but 100% a hard personal move.

1mmdsb1,How to recover political capital after a workplace dispute?,"I have been in my mid-market SaaS sales role for under a year. I quickly built a reputation as a hard worker, a textbook team player, and have sourced and opened a couple of big deals for other reps.

Our written policy states that if I split a deal beyond a certain size with another rep in a different team but the same region, we split the revenue a certain way. I had such a deal. The other rep insisted it was dead but I recently found out it closed and he got full credit.

Because of a recent restructure I now have a new manager. When I brought it up my new boss seemed caught off guard. The other rep’s manager called me and basically danced around it, saying they would “cut me in” on future deals but without giving any details, Salesforce links, deal size, or anything in writing. I had a former manager help verify my facts but it was still textbook stonewalling and gaslighting. I also confirmed the regional director was aware but had not acted.

Following company policy I emailed my regional manager and then forwarded it to HR. HR initially said they do not get involved in sales disputes and tried to do the minimum. When I politely pushed back they escalated it to the regional director’s boss. I eventually got the credit, but on the follow-up call the regional director was clearly annoyed and made it feel like I was the problem for escalating.

Now the dilemma is that a trusted colleagues said I have “poked my head up,” that I am “on some folks’ radar,” and that I should move like I am on a quiet PIP by overdelivering, avoiding drama, and rebuilding relationships. One seasoned AE friend says in sales you get your “bones” before rocking the boat. Another with 15 years in HR says this can bounce back if I execute. Another very trusted colleague is telling me I’m worrying and overthinking.

How do I protect myself from future deal thefts while recovering political capital so I am not seen as a problem?",ObjectRecent9357,3,1.0,6,1754816648,2025-08-10 09:04:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mmdsb1/how_to_recover_political_capital_after_a/,8,2025
1mmdkdw,Feeling lost and behind,"Hi,

I used to work as a self-employed real estate agent in Singapore, which meant I had little CPF contribution as my earnings were purely in cash and commission-based.

The only CPF contributions I did were my mandatory Medisave Liabilities because I was self-employed.

A little bit of context is CPF means 'Central Provident Fund' and it's mandatory for employees to contribute up to 20% of their salaries every single month if they're employed. As for self-employed, it's mandatory for this group of individuals to contribute their Medisave account after every Financial Year.

I worked as a real estate agent for 5 years so I had little CPF contributions but alhamdulillah despite the savings I had inside my CPF account, my wife and I still managed to buy a 2RM hdb in Singapore.

My current situation is I'm working full-time and have healthy CPF contributions every single month. However, I'm worried and thinking ahead if my wife and I would have enough in 5 years time to purchase a 4RM/5RM in Singapore, looking at the current housing market.

What can I do to add more income per month so I can stay on track?",NiceCandle8529,1,1.0,0,1754815792,2025-08-10 08:49:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mmdkdw/feeling_lost_and_behind/,8,2025
1mmd84f,Interviewing Internally...I feel like VPs and Directors are bringing drama,"Is this normal? I’m a manager with many VP relationships, aiming to transfer from the UK to the US. Leadership knows. I applied for 2 roles with support from the new team’s VP, who I’ve known 5 years.

After telling my current VP and Senior VP, rumors started that I needed interview prep (I never asked). The Senior VP told other directors, who then insisted on “helping” me. One director even told me I’d done my first interview wrong. My gut says they wanted brownie points.

At my mid-year review, my VP blamed me for not accepting help. For round 2, I had to schedule calls with that director who started the rumors, her prep didn’t feel authentic. I didn’t get either role. Feedback from hiring leaders: great in round 1 (authentic, friendly), but round 2 answers didn’t always match questions, likely from following their advice. I had the answers in front of me to reference back, because I was so worried I won't answer something correctly.

Now my team thinks I’m bad at interviews. I hate this “support” because it distracts me, creates drama, and wastes mental energy. I want to tell my leader I applied and don’t want my team’s help, while staying formal.

I already get advice from VPs and directors I trust. Others in my team apply without this bs. I do best with minimal prep as it keeps me authentic, which is how I got my first and second roles here.

1mmd5lw,My whole team's involvement is distracting...interviewing internally,"Wanted to check in with people here whether anyone else feels the same or this is normal? I am a manager, but have many relationships with VPs in the business.

* My goal is to transfer markets from U.K. to US. My leadership knows this. I applied for 2 roles with the support of the new team’s VP - built a relationship with him for the last 5 years.
* When I applied for the 2 roles, I was preparing myself for the interviews and updated my current VP.
* I also wanted to update the Senior VP of my team - I have a good relationship.
* At the time, I havent had an interview for 3 years because I havent been looking
* My problem: When I met with the Senior VP, rumors started that I need interview prep support, which I haven't asked for
* This Senior VP then has been telling other directors in my team that I need support, apparently told my VP too
* I did the 1st interviews before all the drama by myself
* One of the directors in my team scheduled a meeting with me, I didn't know what it was and straight up started telling me what I shouldn't answer and answer at the interview. I havent asked for help and they dont know the team I applied for. And telling me I did wrong on my 1st interviews.
* This made me feel like I am doing something wrong.
* My gut feeling was telling me the whole reason for this ""support"" is for them to earn their brownie points with their VPs that they ""helped me to get my new role""
* On my mid year review (happened to be at the same time) - my VP blamed me for not accepting the support, I didnt even know it was that serious
* 2nd interview invitations came in
* I had to schedule calls with the said director to get her support. She helped me with my answers but it didn't feel authentic. I listened, went for the 2nd interviews and that was that

**I didnt get both roles.**

Feedback from the hiring leaders has been:

* you did great at the 1st interviews and we felt that you were authentic and friendly. On the 2nd interview, some of your answers were not as related to the question. (I had the answers to the questions they helped me prepare with on my screen to reference back)

  
My whole problem with this is that my team labeled me that I need help with interviews and now will blame me whenever I dont get a role to be because I am not good at interviews, which is false

I absolutely hate getting support from people especially during interviews because it distracts me, creates drama and unnecessary mental work to deal with bs.

Can anyone help me how can I stop this drama? But still be formal with my leader that I applied for roles and don't require anyone's support from my team. I get very distracted when there are too many people involved in something

I got support from the people I believe have the best intentions including other VPs and directors I know in the business, but dont want to be involved with my internal team.

When other people in my team apply for new roles, they just tell their leaders and that's it, they let them go through the process without distractions. It's doing more harm than good for me.

I do well at interviews when I also barely prepare because I am my authentic self. That's how I got my 1st job in the company and my 2nd job, just giving authentic answers instead of by the book.",EbbAvailable4338,1,1.0,0,1754814129,2025-08-10 08:22:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mmd5lw/my_whole_teams_involvement_is/,8,2025

1mmcogk,Need advice about how to shut up or answer better to questions,"I know it might sound weird, but I just started a new job, I hadn't been in an office job for years, and I tend to talk about my life too much when asked. 

Basically the issue is that I have a pretty alternative life+I am a pretty sick person, but I don't want my coworkers or my employer to know because it's none of their business and I learnt in past jobs, years ago, that all that information only plays against me because these people are not my friends and they won't ever have my best interest at heart, so last Monday I started this job with all the intention of saying the very least about my life, and I can say with a full chest that I... suck at it.

I'm ok at doing the job, but if they ask a question about me, I answer with too much honesty. Like ""do you have any siblings?"" and instead of just saying ""yes"", I said ""yes, but I don't speak to him anymore"". I don't know why I am this stupidly oversharing person, but I am.

Then one of the managers had migraines and was having an issue with feeling her legs properly, and I had a similar issue last year with a medication for migraines, so I tried to be like ""I know of some medications that do this"", then eventually she asked ""is this a medication that someone takes or you take?""(I know she shouldn't ask this, but it felt kind of natural in the conversation) and I ended up saying ""me"". I could just shut up about it and let her handle this with her doctors, but no, I had to talk about it and end up disclosing that I have migraines, something I did not want to disclose.

So I know this post may be taken down because it does not belong here or does not make sense, but I am desperate looking for advice because I don't know how to shut the f up with my coworkers and I am afraid it's going to hurt me in the end. There are more things I could spill about my life, my past and my health that I truly don't want them to know, and I don't want to go with ""I don't feel comfortable talking about this"" because that feels shady, and I want them to feel like I am... normal?

Please help if you can.

I would hate to take the leap and drop out if it doesn't work out and I cant even find a job as a fashion buyer. However, I also don't want to always wonder what if and hate whatever I decide.

1mm8o97,"26F machinist in NE, IDK what move to make","I am a machinist making $25/hr base pay in NE for a well known aerospace company. I have 3 years of experience so far.

My goal is to increase my pay by either getting promoted machinist levels, using my SAP and assembly experience to management level, or finding another job/career. I am unhappy and I know the job market is shit right now, so I am seeking advice as to whether I stay or go.

I have been continuously passed up for opportunity after opportunity in this place, I have way higher quality and efficiency, therefore a proven record that would qualify me over the other candidates, but they keep sticking guys who don't make it, in machining spots that I apply for. They don't show up, they crash machines, they lie about their experience, and they get hired into level 3 spots and get promoted. Reminiscent of Office Space.

I run grinders but that doesn't level me up fast in my current spot. I want to do more and be more experienced, but like many others before me, it doesn't happen. I have good relationships with several people in management and I don't understand what is wrong with me learning more if I can. It doesn't make sense.

Production is slow sometimes and they still don't move anyone, which is backwards and ridiculous. I am professional, and do things by the book, and have never had a disciplinary action against me.  I understand they want to keep people on machines to get parts out but when there are material shortages, it doesn't make sense to not move people and not utilize them.

I have had several people say they'd train me on lathes or mills, because they comment on my ambition and willingness to do the job right, but when I follow up to management, they give a non answer and the position is already for someone else. I must not have the pull certain people do, and I am feeling dejected because productivity and efficiency don't seem to matter. 

So that being said, I accepted an assembly position in April, because my predecessor died before he could properly train his replacement, so my trainer is also inexperienced. They had 12 years to figure it out and they never did. It is a difficult position, but I am told I am doing good at it so far in training, and I am also machining on weekends to help fill gaps.  But I am so stressed out doing this position. Nobody else wanted it, but I said yes because it gave me an opportunity to do something different and I could get off 2nd shift (which is terrible if you have a husband and 3 kids you never get to see). Now, If I revert back to my old spot, I lose day shift and a good home life, as all machinists there less than 5 years don't get days. My situation is abnormal, but they need me on days to have proper engineering support. 

The other stressors are that my husband has a hip replacement in his early 30s and he will most likely not be able to work more than 20 more years. We have 3 kids and I don't want to leave them with the poverty I came from. We both work overtime as much as we can and are aggressively saving for retirement and paying off debts.  This also is the first real higher paying job I have ever had, and the benefits are great. 

I'm noticing more that every time I walk in, because assembly is held to such a high standard, I get tense and nervous because I am wondering if there is a mistake I eill find with my work. I recognize that it is a me problem but that's why I am asking for outside help. 

In an attempt to do better and not simp out for 3% below-market raises, I want to go for an industrial engineering degree with the company paying for it, but the condition is that I work 2 years there after I graduate. I want to save 12k so that if something happens, I can pay off the degree and not be held up. But I am anxious that I won't have a job if they keep laying people off, and it is getting worse, despite having a massive Boeing contract to fulfill. The production is there for right now. 

People recently have left in droves for the competitor 50 miles away, making more pay, but it is union and you'd be starting at the low end of the totem pole again. I have never worked union, and one of our union sites was recently on strike, and that has ended badly in the past. However, the pay would be higher, and the drive slightly longer for me, as it is out of town either way. I was trying to capitalize on those spots not filled, but here's the bottom line:

Do I stay and keep trying for the degree?
Do I take certifications and pivot to another role within the company?
Do I keep machining and assembling until something else comes up?
Or do I GTFO and take a pay cut?
I don't know what to do, and I am stressed the fuck out and want to do what's right for my family.

TL;DR:
Stressed tf out at my job and feel like I am drowning, but the pay is the best in the area given no college degree. 
Keep going for engineering degree in aerospace field?
Keep machining/assembly?
Use my experience for something else?

1mm8ncl,"Got promoted, but salary doesn’t match the role or expectations – how to negotiate now?","Hey folks, I’d appreciate some advice on how to approach this situation professionally.

I work at a startup and genuinely love being here. The work is challenging, and I’ve had a lot of flexibility and ownership — it’s the kind of environment I thrive in. That said, the compensation side of things has been frustrating.

Here’s the full context:

I joined at 5 LPA.

5 months in, my senior backend developer resigned, and I became the only one managing the backend.

I handled everything end-to-end, put in a lot of hard work, and was appreciated for it — eventually got a hike to 7 LPA.

Later, the company hired another senior dev at 11.5 LPA, but he underperformed and was let go.

After that, I asked my manager about a hike. He said to wait for the next cycle and that I’d be considered for a promotion and salary increase.

During the review discussion, I brought up that I’d expect at least parity with the previous hire (11.5 LPA).

He told me they didn’t want to just give a 1–2L bump. Instead, he would evaluate me for a lead role, and if I completed a checklist, I’d get more than what I asked.

That was around 45 days ago.

This week, HR called me and told me I’m promoted to Senior Associate, and my new salary is 9 LPA.

She also mentioned that the bandwidth for this role is between 8–20 LPA.

I asked her if this was final or if I could still talk to my manager, and she said I can definitely talk to him.

Now, here's where it gets tricky:

My manager (who is also the architect) hasn't been very involved lately. It’s a small startup where each department has just one lead, and the founders are focused on other businesses/jobs.

When I spoke to him, he told me:

“I’m not involved in financial decisions anymore. I pushed for your promotion and followed through to get it done. But salary decisions were made by HR and the CFO. If you’re not happy with the hike, you should talk to them.”

So while I appreciate that he supported my promotion, I now feel stuck — promoted, but still underpaid compared to a prior hire who didn’t perform. And despite being told I’d get more than I asked, I’m now offered less than I expected.

To add to this, we recently hired someone more junior than me — I actually interviewed and helped onboard her. During a casual chat, she mentioned that her previous salary was 7.5 LPA, and that she’s now making a little under 10 LPA, meaning somewhere around 9+ LPA.

That’s basically on par or slightly more than my salary after promotion — even though I’ve been here much longer and have taken on much more responsibility.

My question: How do I approach HR/CFO about this now, without sounding entitled?
I’ve been transparent, patient, and loyal — and I want to stay, but I also want fair compensation that reflects my role and responsibilities.

Would love to hear from anyone who's been through something similar, or who has tips on how to approach this conversation tactfully but firmly.

Toronto: great salary (\~$85K CAD), strong accounts, and my manager + director are the best I’ve had in my sales career. AMS market is not doing well, lots of reps left recently = more career opportunities. However, still I’m on track to pay off half my debt this year.

But… high cost of living = I don’t go out, barely see friends, and I’m *really* unhappy here. So unmotivated and uninspired. Since 2023, I've spent minimum 2 months away each year. Last year 5. & seem to always have better performance traveling (?).

Spain: lower cost of living, better social life, closer to BF, and I could actually enjoy my days. But pay would drop to \~€45–50K + commission, rent might be high, and the UK/IR market I’d likely cover is oversaturated + slow right now - could mean another year of low performance (rather than building on what I've done in AMS this year).

Lease is up Nov 1, could extend to Jan when my company restructures teams (could help me align a move + keep momentum).

My manager warned me not to stay *just* for good industries since they can change anytime.

I’ve tried to see if I can stay in AMS while living in Europe on EST hours - HR said no, but strong performance could give me leverage. I’m really unhappy here.

I'd also mention, more often than not, I'm not **happy** in my current team. It's frustrating more than it is rewarding, and dealing with so many corporate politics. The KPI's associated, relationships and responsibilities that AE's, AM's and Renewals have are so wild that there are so many roadblocks for AE's here.

Other career possibilities with my company are BDR manager or Renewals.

Do I:

1. Stay in Toronto until end of **next** year to build leverage, reduce debt, and see what restructure brings?
2. Push for Jan/Feb 2025 Spain move sooner for quality of life, even if it hurts my career short-term?

1mm742j,How to share salary expectations without triggering an “HR round rejection” in the Indian market?,"I’m in Pune, 17 years into my software career, working as an Engineering Manager and currently looking for similar roles. Recently, I’ve cleared all technical rounds at 5 different companies - only to get rejected in the HR round of a couple of them

Here’s the frustrating part:

Before even starting the interview process, I ask for the budget for the role. I proceed only if their range aligns with my expectation.

After clearing all rounds, in the HR round they ask my salary expectations again (and sometimes about existing offers).

HR usually says “Looks good, we’ll check with leadership and get back”.

Next day: rejection email. No reason given - but my gut says it’s about compensation.


I’m wondering:

1. Is mentioning my existing offers and asking them to match/beat it what’s killing the deal?


2. Should I just say “as per company standards” in the HR round and negotiate later, instead of sharing numbers upfront?

1mm6vv4,Future job prospects in finance with a criminal record (after 7 years of experience in corporate banking),"In mid-March, I was indicted on a state jail felony arson charge in Texas. I threw a cigarette butt in a trashcan inside of the bathroom at Whataburger. Unbeknownst to me, this caused a small fire which did little damage. I was still charged with arson after the state argued that it was reckless

While this was stupid, the fire was not intentional. I decided to take a plea deal and am now on deferred adjudication (probation) for a maximum of four years with the ability to have the probation terminated after two years if I comply with the terms of the probation over the next 24 months. I have technically not been convicted, yet this will still appear on my record until it can be expunged (5 years after the date probation is terminated).

Additionally, I pled nolo contendre to a petty theft misdemeanor 1.5 years ago. This is on my record and is essentially a conviction. The theft was under $5. It was a donut from 7/11 that I ate in the store around 2am.

Due to being in county jail for the past 6 months while awaiting trial for the arson charge, I defaulted on 3 credit cards and my credit score is now about 500.

I have since lost my job in corporate banking (I was a VP Underwriter at a publicly traded regional bank).

I am aware that these three issues will cause me significant trouble in my search for another job in the financial industry. That being said, I have a strong background with more than 7 years of experience in various credit and underwriting roles in corporate banking where I started my career in 2018 (all roles in the DFW area). I am 30 years old.

I have a Bachelor's degree in financial economics and a Master's degree in finance from a top 25 business school.

Over the next 6 months, I am planning to find a temporary job that can provide stable income while I attempt to rebuild my credit and secure housing (I also lost my apartment, but should have housing secured next week after putting down 6 months rent in advance). I am looking at anything from a retail job at home Depot to a finance or accounting role at a small private employer, possibly hourly. In the short term, I just need something that provides income. My main concern is long-term job prospects.

I have decided that I will study for the CFA exam with the goal of sitting for level 1 in February 2026 to enhance long-term job prospects.

I have ruled at searching for a job in the banking industry when I attempt to re-enter finance 6-9 months from now. I believe that my best move going forward will be to break into corporate finance w/ FP&A as my target.

If I commit to the CFA and pass level 1, what are my chances at breaking into FP&A sometime next spring? This should show some initiative.

In the long-run, I will do whatever I can to become a charterholder within the next 3 years. I am hoping that the criminal history will have become less of an issue with the passage of time; however, the arson charge will not be eligible for sealing / expunction from my criminal record for at least 7 years.",Salty_Spray_4822,1,0.6700000166893005,7,1754792310,2025-08-10 02:18:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mm6vv4/future_job_prospects_in_finance_with_a_criminal/,8,2025

I'm a senior software engineer working in a pretty volatile industry. Projects are short usually around a year, maybe two at most and then there's often a lull for a few months, usually followed by layoffs. Turnover is pretty high across the board.

Luckily, I'm in a permanent position and haven’t been affected by any of that. I feel comfortable where I am, but honestly, the work has gone stale. There’s not much room to learn or grow, and to top it off, I haven’t received a single raise or appraisal in the last three years.

Recently, I cleared an interview at another company, and they’re offering better pay and better projects. But I’m a little hesitant given how unstable the industry is, I’m worried that if there’s turnover at the new place, I might end up being part of it.

My point is should I include that experience in resume or not? I belong to engineering background and i dont think my part time experience is adding any value to my resume.

1mm05ou,Strange Situation,"Hi,

I recently went through a hiring process for a part time position at a University that left me feeling pretty confused and uneasy, and I’m trying to figure out if I’m overreacting or if this situation really was off.

The initial interview felt very unstructured. The person interviewing me didn’t ask many questions and mostly made some casual odd deeply personal remarks about knowing my current supervisor. It rubbed me the wrong way so I kept the limited conversation on the work the best I could and I kept talk of my supervisor professional. There was no clear explanation of the role or expectations, and it honestly felt like the decision had already been made and the interview was just a formality. I sent a polite thank-you afterward but didn’t expect to get the job based on how it went, so I moved on.

After being told I wasn’t selected, I found out my application materials were shared with another department without my knowledge. Someone from there reached out about a different position I hadn’t applied for. At first I was worried this might have been a scam but I verified that this was an official email. Wanting to be polite, I clarified some key details about my background that didn’t match the role. This person insisted we should talk. There was no official job posting or clear info about the position. I received a pdf of a job description but that was it. 

What made me really uncomfortable: I was invited to meet at a locked building during a time it wasn’t open to the public and given a personal phone number to text to be let in if I arrived early. The meeting was called an “interview,” but there was no clear structure or details. I decided not to go and sent an email declining the offer. 

Overall, this felt unprofessional and like I was being passed around without clear communication or respect for boundaries. It also left me wondering if my status or availability had been misrepresented internally.

Has anyone else experienced vague or odd hiring situations like this? How would you handle it? Am I justified in feeling uneasy or am I overthinking it?

Thanks for any advice.

I’m 22M and just graduated from a top 30 UK university with a first-class degree in International Relations. Since finishing, I’ve been a bit lost about my next step. I’m not sure which career path I want to pursue, and although I considered a master’s, I never found a program I felt passionate about.

Recently, a job offer fell into my lap for a trainee insurance broker position. I’d start out doing car insurance sales over the phone. The company is a large global insurance and finance firm with many potential career paths once I complete the insurance training.

Meanwhile, my close friends (with similar qualifications) are starting graduate schemes in M&A and private equity. It makes me wonder — should I try for something like that instead? I haven’t really applied to other jobs yet, so I’m not sure what my options might be.

My current priorities are:
	•	Building experience for my CV
	•	Figuring out what I actually want to do
	•	Setting myself up for growth in the next few years

Pay isn’t my main concern (this role is minimum wage to start). I’m more interested in whether getting some CIIs (insurance qualifications) and entry-level broker experience is a solid first step — or if I’d be missing out on “bigger” opportunities by not exploring other options first.

Would love to hear your thoughts from people who’ve been in similar situations.

1mlzwlu,Dream job turning out to be harder than anticipated,"Throw away account 

I am currently (23) working my dream job. I found out recently that there is not enough money at my current job to raise me to salary despite me doubling the intended goal set by my department. 
When I asked further about this I was told I was only receiving a 3% increase, essentially 60 cents and truthfully I’m devastated. I’ve worked so so hard this past year to take me into working more hours but I’m not getting a huge raise or an increase in my hours. 
I have several other small jobs that I do on top of this one including teaching one on one lessons which is about $60.00 an hour. I have a list that ranges from 10-15 kids a week which is roughly $720.00 a week. I genuinely love what I do and my job but I’m also feeling massively burnt out, taken advantage of and want to just be paid fairly. Should I stay and try to negotiate or should I consider less hours so I can teach more lessons. I genuinely do not want to leave my job but am feeling burned by this. Help!

1mlwjpj,"After 200+ applications on LinkedIn & Indeed, I found a few job sites that actually work for entry-level positions","I realised that applying to jobs on Linkedin, Indeed and Monster usually means competing with 500+ other applicants per posting. And of those, maybe 5 - 10 applicants will be called for an interview.

I found that many entry-level jobs aren't on LinkedIn. Most startups and smaller companies can't afford the LinkedIn/Indeed tax 😅.

* **LinkedIn job posts cost $300-500+ PER LISTING** (more in competitive markets)
* **Enterprise ATS systems run $5,000-15,000/month** for companies
* **Indeed sponsors cost $150-500/day** to get visibility
* Small companies hiring 1-2 junior roles can't usually justify these costs

A few job aggregators that I found helpful over the past:

1. Simplify.jobs - Aggregates from company career pages. Found 3 startups here I'd never heard of.
2. First Jobby (firstjobby.com) - Job board that only shows roles that need less than 3 years of experience.
3. EntryLevelJobs.me - Strictly filters for 0-2 years experience. Limited number of options but I think you could find this helpful
4. BuiltIn - My favorite job portal! The filters for job level ACTUALLY work...

**University/Student Specific:**

1. Handshake - Not sure if this works outside the US. I got access to this after getting an admit from USF.
2. Barefoot Student - Tough to find tech jobs on this but could be helpful to some

**My response rates:**

* LinkedIn: 2-3% (competing with 500+ applicants)
* Specialized sites above: 10 - 15% (competing with 50 - 100 applicants)

**My strategy:**

* Check these job sites regularly and setup alerts
* Apply within 24 hours of posting
* Use LinkedIn for networking, NOT applying",Initial-Hunt-6376,1,1.0,0,1754764110,2025-08-09 18:28:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mlwjpj/after_200_applications_on_linkedin_indeed_i_found/,8,2025

I’m currently in a very specialized role handling high-stakes, complex work that I genuinely enjoy and excel at. A new management position is opening soon that would be a promotion in both pay and title, but it involves leading a team that handles much smaller, fast-paced, high-volume work.

While the leadership aspect interests me, I’m concerned that this type of work doesn’t play to my strengths and might drain me. I’d much rather lead a team doing the kind of complex work I do now. There’s likely to be a leadership opening in that area in the next 2–3 years when someone retires.

1mls259,health science background and physical limitations - what to pursue next?,"For context, I am 24 and have my bachelor’s degree in movement science (biomechanics, exercise physiology, motor control). I really enjoyed my undergrad courses in this realm, but also have experienced some significant physical setbacks for the past few years.

I had multiple surgeries due to a nerve injury in my leg and am still dealing with residual issues related to pain and mobility. For now, as I navigate this injury, I am just working for one of my former professors in education-related research (do not planning on going into education though). But I am really flailing to figure out my next steps. The past few years I have been so focused on getting through school while also managing pain and injury, and now I find myself without any definitive path.

I love physiology and always saw myself in some sort of healthcare role. I have considered pursuing an ABSN (if my leg situation improves), although honestly I do not see myself working bedside, but would be interested in perioperative or clinic settings. But I am also wary of a physically demanding career, because even if I get to a point where I can handle that, I really do not want to risk backtracking with my leg. I have considered more administrative roles but I like the medical/scientific aspect of clinical roles… if anyone has any advice for me, it would be appreciated, because I am kind of going insane with my lack of direction!

I have also considered just pivoting not going into healthcare at all but my strengths (and interest) are really in the life science realm, and I am not sure what to pursue outside of that.

1mlpk6v,How the world and money work: the other side of the coin hidden by the elites. There are two groups of people: exploiters and pawns,"

1. Universities are places for producing workers to meet the needs of companies and corporations. Professions are taught according to what corporations demand.
2. College professions like software engineer, nurse, doctor, vet, accountant will never make you super rich. These well-known professions are designed for peasants to fulfill the needs of corporations and the system. They’re at the bottom of the ladder.
3. The only way to get rich is to create your own profession that isn’t guided by a curriculum. You must define it yourself, create your own unique business that hasn’t been taught in university and hasn’t been created by anyone else you must name it. Business people are the rich ones because they aren’t limited by rules or flooded by copy-paste graduates from colleges. That gives them an advantage they can’t be copied.
4. College graduates are copy-paste. They’re the last link, produced and educated for business owners and capitalists. They are submissive workers, perfectly shaped for the needs of business from the start of the school system. Bussines along with government have a common deal to produce copy-paste workers.
5. Rich elites often don’t go to college or drop out because college turns you into a copy-paste pawn whose future is to be a slave to business owners. That's below their status.  You study in college because you are being prepared as a product for the market to serve business owners’ needs. Later, you’re hired as a submissive 9 to 5 worker for the rest of your life. In that work you will never advance to super rich elite.
6. Business is freedom for elites. Another side. Being a business owner means you contribute to the economy and create jobs for the pawns studying in college. That’s why governments often fund business owners to create jobs for the peasants being produced in college.
7. In the era of AI, businesses see college graduates as redundant because AI optimizes profits. These graduates end up unemployed and flooding the job market. There’s no obligation to hire them they’re disposable resources.
8. A college educated person’s career is limited because they’re ordinary workers like many copy-paste products who completed the same curriculum. They will never earn the same money as free business owners, for whom the sky is the limit. Workers are limited by labor laws. That’s how they see you.
9. Never dedicate your career to being a servant for a company. Try to direct your skills and education toward becoming an independent business owner so you don’t depend on companies. For example, a nurse is not independent because they’re limited by law and by where they can work and earn money. If health institutions don’t exist, nurses are not needed.

So the conclusion is that your college education is copy-paste you’re crafted like a factory product to serve the needs of business companies.

Exploiters live off the exploitation of pawns. They are free, live life fully, and are aware of exploiting the pawns because they don’t see them as people they see them as gray mass they can exploit because pawns are  stupid and manipulated that one day their hard work will advance them to elites. But it will never happen. Exploiters are often intellectually not very smart, but they have capital hoarded that allows them to exploit peasants.

Pawns are the working people, college-educated individuals who work for other companies. They are dependent their lives depend on whether they have a job. They don’t have capital to become exploiters. They will probably be exploited at work from 9 to 5 for their whole lives, drained of energy and deprived of opportunities.



The reason they disrespect pawns is because elites and exploiters are not intellectually capable. College educated pawns, like a mathematical genius hired by a corporation, have unique skills that exploiters don’t have because exploiters won’t dedicate their own lives to learning hard, intellectually demanding skills.

Nevertheless, less intellectually capable exploiters have more money and assets than the super-genius pawn. This is why exploiters don’t respect pawn because pawns are, in some way, “stupid” for not valuing their skills more and agreeing to work 9 to 5. Why? Because there are many copy-paste versions of them being produced constantly by universities.

Elites and business owners guarantee a constant supply of copy-paste intellectual pawns, so there’s competition between them, and their value stays low. So, having capital not intellect is the real advantage.






Inflation, paper money, and the whole monetary system are designed to sustain that dynamic. Inflation and interest rates are used to control the peasants, to prevent them from advancing their status, and to always keep the distance between elites and peasants.",FantasticEffect10,0,0.3799999952316284,0,1754746417,2025-08-09 13:33:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mlpk6v/how_the_world_and_money_work_the_other_side_of/,8,2025

I started with a salary of ₹5 LPA and, after 10 years, I'm now at around ₹30 LPA. The work-life balance is excellent, and I still find the work interesting. However, I can't help but feel that my salary is on the lower side given my experience, especially considering the high cost of living here.

1mlo9lq,Opportunities for the future that will make you money - women centred products,"



Right now software engineers are about 80% male. It’s a very male dominated field. They create their games according to their own vision. I guess females are outnumbered users in apps like TikTok and Instagram, but there’s a huge niche in other types of apps. So I believe women focused apps are a huge opportunity and  goldmine.

Take that tea app it had its downfalls and controversy, but the demand for that kind of app was huge, whether you agree or not.

I expect you might disagree because, according to statistics, Reddit is also a male dominated community. I’m a heavy user of this app, and a lot of threads that are women centred get downvoted.

So if you’re a male thinking, ""Oh, I want to create a SaaS app"" and you’re considering something like a car rental tool or web scraping tool, I’ve observed these SaaS communities where men are trying to build something innovative, and from my perspective, it’s pretty much all copy-paste.

I’m a female engineer, and I’m happy to be in the minority because I know the mindset of women very well and understand their needs unlike many men in tech. I see enormous opportunities in that field and problems women face that can be solved by apps focused on women.

Currently I’m developing a women-centred app, and I tell you, female customers are very pleasant to work with. If I tell them I’m writing an app to address their problems, they get excited because the need to be seen has been so strong, and they are super eager to support me. Because they strongly belive in these idea.

And when I tell them about the solution I’ve invented for the problem, they feel super excited that it has finally been noticed. They’re eager for it to launch, want to be the first users, and even get actively involved in its creation.

Men downvoting female focused content is just confirmation when I post something about female problems or needs in male dominated communities, I get downvoted, but when I speak to a female audience, there’s huge enthusiasm that they’re finally being seen.

Here’s another example of a very successful app the roblox game  Dress to impress a very simple game created by a teenage girl that’s just about dressing models and fashion competitions for girls. Yet it’s very successful, and this teenage girl made millions from that simple idea.

But think about other games for boy car racing, history games, fighting, boxing, etc. there’s an abundance of them. Female centred apps and software are a huge niche. Women are also heavy users of the internet, but there’s still massive space and opportunity for products that address women’s needs.



I’m telling you, the excitement women have for a product that focuses on them and their problems is unbelievable.

Having the mindset and understanding the needs of female customers in a male-dominated tech space is a huge advantage that allows me to address a niche male engineers don’t recognize because of their mindset, worldview, etc.

When you wonder why dating in 2025 is becoming more and more difficult men complain about women, women complain about men it’s because they have different needs. Men don’t fully understand women, so they’re not great at solving their problems, including creating apps centred on them.


And men are like, “Ewww… what a stupid app, a girly app… what crap,” especially if it promotes women’s independence that doesn’t align with their personal beliefs. They totally don’t understand the female customer’s needs, or sometimes they don’t want to address them because it goes against their beliefs. And I think that makes this field super niche with huge potential.


Because male engineers from the beginning opt out, as they can’t separate their beliefs from business, and they are not at the centre. The customer should be at the centre with their own needs.And many men still hold patriarchal views so strong that they can’t put women’s needs at the centre, or they understand them very little.

That gives a huge advantage to people who actually understand them.

1mlo1m2,"25 years leave job to be closer to home, and less pay?","I've been at my current job for 25 long years, i only have a GED and it's a entry level job, i have no desire to advanced or do anything else to move up through the company. I was 25 years old when i started now i'm 50. I only spend about 3 hours a day actually working on average the rest of the day is just looking busy. No one there stays very busy as it's a small company and the owner is never there we only have 9 employees.

I am a mechanical assembler and make $49,000 a year we work 9-5 and get a hour for lunch so we only get paid for 35 hours of work a week and i am on salary we never have to work any overtime.. The biggest benefit of this job is free health insurance we don't pay anything. That is the only benefit besides the lack of management nothing is structured. There is no 401k no HSA, no pension.

Being there for 25 years is the only reason i make 49k a year, i started at 27k a year but then things where a lot cheaper! Being on salary is nice as i can miss a hour for a doctors appointment and still get paid but i rarely miss any time.

The big down side of my current job is the commute it is 45 miles to work and 45 miles back home so it's about a hour 10 min commute each way and that is when the traffic isn't backed up so i spend about 2 hours 20 min a day just driving. I bought a hybrid car just for this reason and i get 43MPG so i only spend about $30-25 a week on gas and i always bring a lunch so i don't spend anything on food.

  
Doing my line work there are very few job opportunities so that is my biggest fear, i enjoy being a assembler and my current job has been trying to get me to do other things like shipping and receiving and cleaning them when they come in as they are covered in oil.

  
This new job offer pays 45K a year and is 24 miles from home about a 30min drive. The job is 9-5 and they work 40 hours a week and i would be on hourly pay starting over it is a mechanical assembler job for another small company looks like around 20 people work there just going by the parking lot.

They have a 401k plan and a HSA that they contribute to, the vacation time is the same once you have been there for 3-5 years. I would have to pay my health insurance with them so that would really reduce my pay i'm guessing it would bring my pay down to around 40k a year.

Can i afford to loose 10k a year? sure but i don't really want to, there is also the possibility of my current employer offering me more money to stay but who knows.

This job has been available multiple times over the past 2 years makes me wonder why as i worry about it not working out and not having any where to work as a mechanical assembler there is no other jobs doing that.

What would you do at age 50? 40k a year is not much these days.

1mlnf0g,Rejected for salary… now a second chance?,"I’m in kind of a weird situation.

Backstory: About 3 months ago, I interviewed for a role at Company XYZ. The interview went great—HR even told me I “checked all the boxes.” Then we got to the dreaded salary question.

The posted range was $89k–$138k. I currently make $110k, so I figured asking for $130k was reasonable. Apparently not—because a week later, I got the rejection email.

Fast forward 3 months: the job stayed posted for a while and was just reposted a few days ago. I decided to reapply, not expecting a callback… but they called me!

Now I’m stuck. Clearly $130k was too high for them last time. I suspect they might be looking for someone they can “grow” into the role. That said, I’m making $110k now, so I feel like anything under $120k wouldn’t be worth the move.

Questions:

What salary range should I give this time?

1mlmvop,Looking to pivot?,"I spent most of my career in the private sector, working in the transportation business. I decided to make the leap and become a teacher and I loved it. It was deeply rewarding on a personal level. Very successful. I got my masters, went into admin looking to help make big changes and tackle big problems in the field of education. Instead it's endless tedium and box checking. I saw the need for leadership, and I stepped up to pitch in. Got a job with a state agency. Everything I do is micromanaged and run through committee, and picked apart. I am not having the kind of impact that I want, and I don't think I ever will where I am at now. It's turning into 'just a job' real fast. Every job I've ever had previously has been a 'figure it out' kind of deal, and I really loved that. The kinds of things required a lot of deep involvement and work in the trenches. That sense and ability I have is NOT needed or wanted where I am at now and it makes me sad.  

I've run companies, managed people, developed curricula, taught, created lesson plans, created business plans, pitched business plans, raised venture capital, I've rolled out new product/services. I want something that is more dynamic, that allows me to use more of the skills and talents I have, in a less stifling, rigid environment. I'd like to stay in the education field IF I can, but I really need something that will allow me leverage my strengths. I've thought about EdTech/educational sales, it sounds fun and I like the idea of earning bonuses. The truth is, I don't know what I don't know, so I don't really know where I should start my search, or what options I should consider. 

I am very much a people person, and I can walk into a classroom tomorrow, but...I want something that will allow me more control over my earnings and the chance to leverage my whole skill set (or at least more of it).

1mlluk7,"Looking for Career Guidance, Side Hustles, and Skill Building as an 18 years old","Hi everyone,

I’m 18 and currently still in College. English is my second language (B2 close to C1 in CEFR, C1 in EFSET, IELTS 6.5 overall, 7 in speaking/writing, 6.5 in reading/listening).

Over the past 2 months, I’ve been volunteering as an English tutor in 3 organizations:

1. 2 months volunteering locally, teaching 4-skill group class (5 adult students, A1–A2 level), still ongoing(1 month left)
2. 1 month volunteering for an international NGO, teaching 1-on-1 speaking class for an A2 adult student, still ongoing(2 months left)
3. Starting this week, volunteering for another international NGO teaching a 4-skill 1-on-1 class for A2 adult

All of these are unpaid volunteer roles, but I’ve received good feedback from my students.  
I want to start making an income as a college student, but opportunities for people my age are rare in my country, and many people here focus only on school until they graduate. I just got a free TEFL certificate recently.

My college schedule is light (about 4 hours a day, 3–4 days a week), so I have time for a side job. I plan to get a paid TEFL course within a year, but right now I have these questions:

* How much experience or what certificates do I need to get paid for online teaching jobs
* What platforms/organizations could I apply to right now with my current qualifications and experience
* What other career paths or side hustles could I explore alongside tutoring to build skills, earn money, and gain work experience
* How to keep progressing in tutoring so it can eventually become a reliable income source

I’m an introvert, but when teaching, I’m confident and energetic. I want to connect with more people, build my network, and create my own opportunities partly because I don’t have a strong family background to rely on. I’m willing to start small, even if the pay is low, just to get my foot in the door.

I’m open to any honest, constructive advice you have!",Accomplished_Cut1474,1,1.0,0,1754734001,2025-08-09 10:06:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mlluk7/looking_for_career_guidance_side_hustles_and/,8,2025
1mll6vz,Meta Manager went Wild (during the interview),"I recently interviewed for a Data Scientist role at Meta. One of the interviewers was a manager in London. She was in her early to mid forties, with bleached shoulder length blonde hair. She had a Russian name and accent. The interview was over Zoom and was their ‘Analytical Execution’ round. 

The interview started getting strange right at the start. During the usual round of intros, I noticed she had a black pen which she started to move near her mouth. I didn’t pay much attention. 

She started with some probability questions. I think I did quite okay. She continued looking down at the pen and rubbing it on her lips. She started smiling at me, looking amused. 

Then she started moving the pen up and down, looking down at the pen (and me) as if she was giving a blowjob. 

At this point, I was struggling to keep a straight face and concentrate. She started getting impatient when I couldn’t answer the question and started snapping at me. By now she was nearly sucking the pen.

1mlk22h,Okay to send to supervisor?,"So the email provides most context, but my supervisor asked me to do something at 9:00 a.m, and have it by midday, two tasks. One was a priority because we were waiting on another department and were delayed so I knew I had to do that, so I made room. Then, I said “no I don’t have time for that today” for another task that I had to learn and then pull, she then grilled me about what tasks I had, asked me to give her a list etc. I did that, and basically she didn’t care.

This is also the FIRST time I ever said no. I didn’t like it, and here’s what I want to say:

“Hi Maggie, 

I wanted to follow up and share a few concerns about how today’s situation was handled and what it reflects about shifting priorities.

I had structured my Friday around Salesforce checks, contact list updates, and #### work, tasks you’ve emphasized as needing to stay accurate at all times. I was also focused on Asana tasks, following the guidance not to move tasks unless absolutely necessary. 

So, when a last-minute request came in that required shifting all of that, it felt contradictory with what is consistently communicated to me.. It was also confusing given past conversations about avoiding mass emails for PI submissions in favor of the custom “#######” blasts with said link.

You and many others on this team have said it’s okay to say no. But on Friday, the one time I did, that no was challenged and dissected. Being asked to complete something by noon after I’d clearly communicated my capacity made me feel like my planning, time, and boundaries weren’t being taken seriously.

Since the event isn’t until the ##, I’m not clear on why this was urgent on a Friday. If there was a time-sensitive reason I wasn’t aware of, having that context would be helpful in the future. It would allow me to respond with, yes, this is a priority, just like I did with the article edits because I knew we were already super behind on publishing. From my perspective, this seemed like something that could have waited until Monday.

I’m always happy to help when I can, and I always do my best to be flexible and roll with the punches. At the same time, when I say no, I need that to be understood and respected. That is very important to me. 

Thank you, “",GreenIntelligent2407,2,0.7599999904632568,9,1754726624,2025-08-09 08:03:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mlk22h/okay_to_send_to_supervisor/,8,2025
1mlk1h5,I went to work after burnout. I had to quit after 3 weeks. Looking for answers why that happened.,"I experienced a burnout in 2024, during which I didn't work for a year and a half. My initial idea was ""never go back to the office"", or do things in the field that I was involved in over the last 5 years. I promised that to myself.

Fastforward to May - June 2025 - I could not find any alternatives fast, and so I thought if I only do 32 hours in the same field again, with a short commute, 1 day work from home, and easy responsibilities, I should be good. After all, my savings would not last forever. So I got a job (that was not too difficult as I am experienced).

I keep journals, write down what I feel, so on day 3 of my job, my journal already said 'I am exhausted, I am drained, I look terrible'. Then another week (around day 8 or 9), I was so tired, I could hardly walk around (and that was my day off). I had to cancel my haircut appointment - I was so unwell. I was in bed for the rest of my day off.

My sleep became interrupted again, and many signs of my first burnout came back instantly. And then came the brain fog. Or something I was not familiar with - I experienced difficulty just talking. Talking to people over the phone - I could hear them and understand what they said to me, but when I responded, it was like another person talking. That scared me. Soon I resigned.

This time, I call what happened 'express' burnout. But I am not sure what I need to learn from it? Did I not rest enough? Is the office not a place for me? Or going from zero hours to 32 is a big step, and better do it 16-24 first. What do you think? I will appreciate the advice.",BigHappyHippo,6,0.7599999904632568,2,1754726560,2025-08-09 08:02:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mlk1h5/i_went_to_work_after_burnout_i_had_to_quit_after/,8,2025

1mlh7n6,iCode Teacher?,"As we can all agree at the current moment, the job market is terrible. I got laid off May 1st and have been unemployed and looking for work ever since. I have decided to go back for my Masters, as I’ve wanted to do that for a long time, and as much as it sucks being on unemployment, it just seems to be the way of things at the moment. 

Fast forward to yesterday, I was looking for part-time positions while I’m at college, just enough to bring in income, when I ran into a posting on Handshake called “Coding Instructor for K-12 Education”. It sounds cool, but most likely not a position I want to stay in. It’s for a company called iCode and the franchise is located 30 minutes from me. Minimum wage for the job - $16/hourly. I would be teaching children how to program, which sounds cool. 

I reached out yesterday, and the owner called me at 7PM, I said it was okay since I’m a night owl, but asked me to come in today to iCode. Cool, did that and everything. I was nervous before (job interview jitters) but it wasn’t too bad. Walked in, sat down with the owner, and was basically told throughout an entire series of stories that he is looking for commitment (instructor of course so duh), and something along the lines of “Once you stay long enough and we have around 75 students, then you will be getting around 10% of the company,” or something like that. 

It just kinda seemed like an “ick”? Just sketchy. It doesn’t seem like there’s a problem with the company, or the owner (after a deep dive) though, so it could just be all in my head. I got an offer letter today, keep in mind I just went there today and barely did anything with the kids but at one point I was left alone with the kids and the parents - I had no idea what I was doing and didn’t even know the passwords to the computers which I was suppose to be using to show kids what to do regarding a Roblox build. 

Everyone seems nice, I’m just getting an uncomfortable feeling, especially when the owner texted me to ask why I took adderall, and if it was prescribed. I know I should take the job, unemployment sucks and everything. And I need to give an answer by tomorrow. I just would appreciate some feedback.

1mlh7ci,Seeking a career change and not sure what to do.,"I (M37) have worked at my company(Mostly welding) in a factory for 13 years.  I'm finding myself getting really burnt out really fast.  It is a decent job and the pay for my area is amazing.  I dont want to work there or in a shop/factory for the rest of my life. I was thinking some sort of IT job or something would be a better alternative, but SW virginia doesnt have hardly any demand for that.  Part of my problem is I still dont know what I want to do for the rest of my life.  If I do quit my job I can use my profit sharing to pay off all my debt so I can get my monthly bills down to where I dont need to make the amount of money I do now.  My job has a 1 year leave to return and im sure if I can't figure something out then I could end up going back to work there if I have to.  Another part of my problem which is probably my biggest problem is that outside of work I am terribly unmotivated. I've found that at work I am 100% committed and go above and beyond to learn my job as fast as i can, become as efficient as possible,  and overall do my best.  With this I thought some sort of apprenticeship would be best.  

     I know it's a ramble so thank you for reading, any advice is greatly appreciated.

TLDR:
-Welding/factory background dont know what I want to do
-Looking for a change, no motivation outside of work.
-Leaning towards wanting to do something possibly IT related but no IT job demand in area

1mlgfn0,Seeking Career Advice: Lateral FAANG Offer vs. Current FAANG Promotion,"Hi everyone,

I’m at a crossroads in my career and would love to hear your thoughts!

**Me:** 15 YOE, 10+ at current company, level capped but very close to getting a promotion to a Manager role. I've been doing it for the past 6 months as coverage since my manager left, I expect to get a formal offer next week.

**Context:**

* **Offer from new FAANG:** I’ve received a lateral offer from a new FAANG at my current level with a 20% pay bump. I’d be one of the first hires on a brand-new team, which means a lot of potential for growth as the team is expected to expand hard in the next 12-18 months.
* **Promotion at current FAANG:** I’m close to a promotion at my current company where I’d become a manager of my current team. My total compensation would be roughly the same as the new FAANG offer, but I’d be level-capped and there would be less room for further growth because of the company/team's maturity.

**Key Considerations:**

* **New:**
   * **Positive:** Chance to build and expand a new team, broader runway for career advancement, no layoffs, great management team, change of scenery is exciting after many years at the current employer.
   * **Negative:** New company, new team culture that can be a hit or miss, possibility to become a manager is on the horizon but not guaranteed, area is new but not core to the company, worst equity/benefits package.
* **Current:**
   * **Positive:** I’ve been with my current company for a while, have a strong brand there, I'd be taking on a Manager role for a considerably large team, I already do the job and know that I can do it well, good benefits and WLB.
   * **Negative:** No real room for growth past Manager role, been doing the work for a few years so excitement got a bit stale, manager role opened a few times in the past and I was always passed over for it but this time was a bit of a fire drill and they didn't have other options so I got it.

I’m passionate about moving into a people manager role, I've been chasing it for a few years now (as observed by my post history) and it feels amazing to have actually landed it. But I’m also intrigued by the growth potential and the challenge to build a new team from scratch, the leadership team at new FAANG is top notch and my manager would be a really close friend.

I’d appreciate any insights from those who have made similar career moves in the past and how it panned out, I didn't expect these opportunities to surface at the same time so I'm banging my head against the wall to make a decision.

Thanks in advance for your help!",SnooSuggestions6071,1,1.0,1,1754713419,2025-08-09 04:23:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mlgfn0/seeking_career_advice_lateral_faang_offer_vs/,8,2025

1mldoc1,"I (22F) feel weak for wanting to quit job a week in for being ""too tired""","Hi everyone! I would appreciate any advice given :)

I graduated college in May with a B.S. in Biochem and French and moved back home with my parents. Most of the summer, I was hanging out with friends in the area and research internships/fellowship for recent grads. All my friends started up their programs/grad school/study abroad/clinicals so I have a lot more time on my hands right now.

I'm on a gap year so my plan was to get a part-time job for now to pay off my credit cards in a couple months and get a fellowship position for the fall in my city. My big goal is to apply for Fulbright 2026-27 as I'm currently trying to get into international business/global diplomacy and would love to live abroad.

**Here's the problem**: I got a job as a barista last week. The work isn't terrible and I love my coworkers. It's $16/hr but I don't get tips until I complete training (don't know when that is), **but I am so** ***tired***. I am opening everyday and scheduled easily 33+ hr/week with most of the time staying until the customer rush slows down. I am working 7 days in a row, then I'll get 1 day off, rinse and repeat. It's also a more upscale coffee shop and the customers are constantly racist/demeaning and we can't do anything about it.

When I come home, I am so drained, I'll fall asleep, make dinner, shower, and go to bed. I can't find it in myself to apply for more internships or work on my Fulbright application. I was training for a 5K and now my legs are too sore to even go for a run. On top of everything, I'm currently getting my Driver's license (don't judge, Covid shut things down in high school then I went out of state for college and couldn't practice) and am having a hard time finding days I can be on the road. 

My parents have offered for me to quit and they would pay my minimums on my credit cards because they don't like how irritable and miserable I am, even on days I'm not working. There's a small window of time I can apply to fellowships post-graduation for ""recent grads"" and they're afraid I'm going to miss opportunities or not have enough time to work on my Fulbright. 

*I just feel so weak*. People work more intense jobs, longer hours, and still manage to go back to school or have a side hustle. It's so early in the job, and it's not terrible when I'm actually on the clock. I think it would hurt my pride to quit but I'm so miserable afterwards and I am anxious about applications and such. My parents didn't have any familiar support so they don't want me to suffer through the same challenges but I almost feel like I need to push myself. This is such a 1st world problem and I just need to get over myself. 

Is there any advice for better time management or a helpful mentality? I understand plently of people are in similar situtations and push themselves through it.

!!!Resume in the chat!!!

I am a graduate student in Business Engineering, graduating in 2025, and eager to start my career in London in digital transformation, consulting, or strategy. However, I often get rejected without even getting the chance to interview.

I suspect this is partly due to my CV and partly because I require visa sponsorship, which I understand is not always ideal for graduate-level positions. I would greatly appreciate any constructive feedback on my CV and tips to improve my chances in the UK job market.

This summer I volunteered for a good cause, walking 500 km across Japan and raising €2,500 for mental health programs. Would including this on my CV strengthen my profile, or is it better to keep things purely professional? I sometimes feel it may not be the most ethical thing to highlight, but I notice many of my peers do it.

I get off at 5pm, my commute is an hour if I’m lucky, the last classes are normally 5 or 5:30 start time, and there’s only so many Saturday classes. 

I feel stuck because if I don’t leave this job I’ll never be able to grow in this career or pursue what I want. But if I leave I’m still stuck because I won’t be able to finish the schooling I need to develop bc I have my #1 priority of paying the bills. Tbh everyone I know hasn’t finished college and is living paycheck to paycheck so I don’t really have anyone to go to for advice. 

So would it be dumb for me to quit my current job and just make less money? Is there some way for me be able to afford paying bills in such a way? To clarify it’s just stuff like rent, car, credit cards, etc not tuition costs. 

Any advise please? ",BerengerxBerenger,1,1.0,2,1754693012,2025-08-08 22:43:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ml9ede/would_it_be_dumb_to_quit_my_job_for_a_job_with/,8,2025

1ml924r,Seeking Advice: Changing career into HCM/HRIS analyst and/or implementation.,"I just found out that in two months my current project will be ending, and I’m trying to figure out my next move.

Quick backstory: I’ve spent more than a decade in full cycle HR, from recruiting, performance management, leaves, employee relations, compliance, training, terminations, and more. Around 2020, after years in non-profit with limited growth and some pretty bad management, I hit burnout. It was more than just being tired. It turned into over two of the lowest and scariest depressive years of my life.

The one bright spot in that time was HRIS work. Because of COVID, we had to rapidly expand the system’s capabilities, and I ended up diving in configuring workflows, rolling out new modules, building reports, integrating with other systems. I realized I loved it.

Currently: That led me to a Business Systems Analyst role, and for the past two years I’ve been with a consulting firm on a large public sector HCM project. My work has included mapping current processes, documenting system integrations, creating future state plans, helping with vendor RFP scoring, developing demo scripts, coordinating presentations, and supporting contract and pricing negotiations. It was challenging yet exciting, and for the first time in years I felt like I was doing exactly what I should be doing.

Here’s the tough part. Due to budget concerns, the client isn’t moving forward with us for implementation, which is exactly the part I was most eager to experience and learn from. I’ve taken database management courses, earned Oracle badges, and I’m working toward my Workday certification, but I know it’s not the same as hands-on experience, which is required for all of the positions I have seen (even JR associate ones). I don’t want to lose momentum or go back to transactional HR. I’m willing to take contract work, short-term projects, or even a lower salary if it means staying in this space and building my skills.

So….. I would love to hear from you. If available to share, I would love to hear about your experiences, tips, or advice. If you know of companies or opportunities that give people a chance to break into implementation work, I would be grateful to learn about them as well.

 

Thank you,",Inevitable_Map7575,1,1.0,0,1754692135,2025-08-08 22:28:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ml924r/seeking_advice_changing_career_into_hcmhris/,8,2025

1ml8d9p,Never thought I would consider quitting without another job.,"To frame the situation I have a very well paying position that I love. I’m also in my 50s so I know that finding something comparable would not be easy. Yet I’m still considering quitting because I can’t stand my boss see no way out. She is abusive and has never been wrong about anything. She accepts no accountability and does not hold professional boundaries.
Six months ago she insisted I promote one of my managers. I pushed back stating she wasn’t ready. She basically threatened my job if I didn’t. I did and of course it’s been a nightmare since. Of course all of it is my fault because I haven’t prepared this manager well enough. Did I mention they are friends outside of work? 
She belittles me in front of staff and made a comment to one of my managers asking her what we discuss in our one on ones “Besides our Gay Daughters”.  This was in front of 5 other managers.  She routinely says things like idk what Tina is doing but obviously no one is paying attention (even when the task is complete but she’s unaware of the new process) .
The issue is she’s a corporate powerhouse and has value so if I go to HR it’s career suicide. I just see no other option than to leave because she takes NO feedback.

1ml50ld,advice for transitioning to social work from the medical field?,"
i am currently working as a CNA at a hospital and i’m looking for a change. I was planning on to go to nursing school but am realizing this is not what i want to do. i like helping people but don’t enjoy helping them with all their bodily functions, risking exposure to disease daily  and how physically taxing it can be for me. 

my real interest has always been psychology/mental health but i went for medical because of the higher pay, short schooling and only working 3 days a week. now i’m realizing those benefits don’t make up for doing a job i absolutely hate. social work aligns more with my interests, values and strengths so i’m strongly considering going back to school for it. 

the thing is, i don’t have any college credit so i’d be starting from scratch and i’m already 26. i have only worked in the medical field but i don’t see myself being able to stay as a CNA for 6+ years while i go to school. are there any jobs i could get with no degree and only medical experience that would be good to have during school? either something more relevant to social work or just something that would be easy to balance with school.

 i’m also just kinda curious about the pay. i’ve heard that social workers have very low pay, but it’s kinda hard for me to grasp how bad it really is. i know state can affect that: i live in texas right now but the plan is to move to california. i don’t care about being rich but i don’t want to be struggling to afford basic necessities my whole life either. can anyone give me some insight on these things? thank you!",hypotheticalsewage,1,1.0,0,1754682267,2025-08-08 19:44:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ml50ld/advice_for_transitioning_to_social_work_from_the/,8,2025
1ml4wwv,Seeking Advice - Cannot Trust Coworkers with their Work,"Hello,

Throwaway for this.

tldr at bottom

  
I am in a bit of a predicament and looking for some advice. I moved over to a company in the industry I'm in that buys and sells raw material, and I'm having a pretty tough time working with my coworkers due to their level of work. Basically I have to make purchase and sale contracts and transport product around, but I have 3 specific issues that I find are hindering my ability to perform to the level I was at the more ""refined"" companies I was at before that were a lot more organized and disciplined:

1. Our client territories are mixed up and jumbled, and basically all the things I buy or sell intersect with people who work here because old accounts I had are sitting as mostly dead weight on these coworkers desks. Nobody fills out the CRM so I do not know who to call to make business, and if I know there is an open account and I want a coworker to work on the other side of the deal, I regularly have to persuade them to make the calls in order to satisfy my side of what would be one deal. A couple of times I assumed a client was tagged to someone but dead, but upon lining something up and disclosing it publicly in team meetings I got reprimanded even though nobody did business with them for months to even a couple years in one case. When I pursue something with a colleague, this ends up not being followed up on or deals just get missed because a lot of my colleges are not in the office, or are not answering their phone. So if I have opportunities to buy from ""x,"" I can never do much because ""y"" client is on the other persons desk and getting a hold of them is pretty much a futile endeavor, let alone explaining the opportunity in the market.

2. When deals do get reasonably close, their contracts details are sloppy and there is so much room for error. It's a very much ""just trust me"" sort of thing where definitive language does not exist, so I basically cannot trust them to know exactly the spec of raw material they are selling because they do not line it up with the specifications of my side of the deal. I have seen many instances where loads get rejected, or quality issues destroy the profitability of a deal causing a loss which I definitely do not want to pass to my clients(or have on my performance) because I thoroughly qualified my end of the deal. I try to explain this but it gets brushed off if the specs seem to be too much work to discuss or something, but these specifications due to quality, how things are paid, etc. are important, and I do not want me or my clients actively getting involved in shitshow's especially when they can simply be avoided due to good due diligence and communication before they are inked on both ends. 

3. We hired a logistics guy with ""experience"" that is supposed to get rates, execute things, manage contract numbers etc. and I for months basically have to walk him through everything after all details are input. He is more of a service provider than proactive and it is just doubling my work, when he emails my clients for pending shipments he spells their names wrong, not once but 5 emails in a row one time! I do not know what logistics experience he had because even though I am pure commission, I have had to train him on all the types of freight we use here so I end up doing things myself because I can't trust his rates as he outsources the accountability to me so I basically just say what's the point of using him then. Trucks for example require more than a single quote to understand a market lane and be safe when calculating a deal, he will get a quote or 2 without negotiation, not define the haulers capacity, not know how many loads are outstanding, etc.

  
This sounds all too whiny which I apologize for, but to put it into perspective, where I used to work was like a well oiled machine and this feels like a chaotic jungle with no standards. The performance of workers was on average probably 3X what it is here, and upon hiring I negotiated my comp using those metrics but as I have been in the system I understand why this is, but my coworkers who started off here do not at all. My manager also started here and does not really get it and let's a lot of things slide to maintain the peace, but it sort of corrupts things in the business; he was not in an IC role ever really so leveling with him does not help because he doesn't see these pain points and the status quo must be what is normal.

If there is anyone in a sales/management/any position who can relate or offer advice on this I'd really appreciate it. Sort of looking for how I can either maybe induce some change(if that is even possible) or navigate this sort of business and sales landscape to make something work and perform within the team. They know they are struggling with profitability overall but as a newer(but senior) guy, it just seems like hard changes would have to be made that disrupt how people have been comfortably operating and that pain is more than the pain of disorganization or lower profit and performance. Thank you!

  
tldr: new coworkers and boss are seemingly disorganized and difficult to rely on or work with; account fragmentation causes forced interaction in a commissionable job structure geared around individual performance where individuals mostly rely on each other. I came into a structure with accounts that can almost only be utilized with coworker cooperation. Used to a different system with people who were more efficient/organized and performed at a higher level. Want to figure out how to work with more trust or change things in some way systemically to be able to perform.

1ml4vkq,I just got fired and I feel a little hopeless,"I’ve been let go from every job I’ve ever had (except internships) and I feel like such a failure. It started with my first part time job in high school, my closest friend passed away and shortly after my job told me they felt like I was distracted and not doing a good job due to my loss and they’d be letting me go. Then in college, I had a part time job at a library. I was feeling overwhelmed by all of my school work and responsibilities and I forgot I had a shift one day. I didn’t end up going until the shift was almost over and out of fear of getting in trouble I didn’t tell my supervisor. I ended up getting fired for not telling them. 

My first job out of college I was laid off (Covid hit, airline industry) but I felt like I wasn’t performing well at the job and that’s also why I wasn’t one of the first to go. 

My second job I actually stayed at for nearly 4 years but after 10 rounds of layoffs I was let go. I feel like by the end of my time there I was burnt out and not performing well. I had been promoted multiple times at that company but part of me always felt like I was just tricking people into thinking I was good at the job and they finally caught on so I was laid off.

I searched for a job for 6 months before finding my next role, which on paper was a perfect job. Unfortunately I lost another close friend right after starting this job and I know I was distracted and not my best self. I was placed on a PIP, which I passed. But after that it felt like no matter what I did I couldn’t be seen as a good worker. I was constantly being blamed for things that were not my fault or being accused of making mistakes I didn’t make (I always pushed back and provided proof of it). I think my manager at that point just didn’t like me anymore. I didn’t receive more official feedback but I had a feeling I was going to be let go soon because I was being asked to start creating guides on the work I do (clearly for my replacement lol). 4 months after the PIP I was let go. 

I feel like there’s genuinely something wrong with me and I’m never going to find true success in life because I ruin all the opportunities given to me. I’ve been told I suffer from executive dysfunction by therapists before and maybe getting that treated would help but I get so overwhelmed it’s hard for me to focus on work while also focus on helping myself. If anyone has struggled like this before and managed to turn things around I’d love to hear about it :(

1ml4sh7,"Turning 18 soon, college, trade school, or military","I graduated and turn 18 in a couple weeks, and honestly have no clue what direction to go in. I originally planned on going to college for nursing, but I backed out last minute. The idea of being overworked and underpaid for the emotional and physical toll that comes with nursing just didn’t sit right with me.

I have a decent home life, but my family won’t really be able to support me through college outside of letting me stay with them over the summer or helping in emergencies. So I’d be mostly on my own financially.

I’ve thought about going into a trade like electrical work. It seems like a good path, but I’m worried I’ll have to work 60–70+ hours a week just to not even break into the six-figure range. I don’t mind working hard, but I also want a life outside of work, and I’d rather not be killing myself just to make a living. At the same time, I worry that I’ll regret not going to college, especially because I’ve always done well in school and had decent grades. That said, I’ve never really worked with tools or done hands-on stuff, so I don’t know if trades would even be a good fit.

The military has crossed my mind too, mainly because I could use the GI Bill to help pay for college. But I want to be sure I’m not just jumping into something because I’m panicking or unsure of what else to do. I do not want to spend more than 4 years in the military. 

 I’m looking for paths to make a really good living without having to work 60+ hours. I’m just really confused on where to go right now as I don’t want to work at my retail job my whole life.

1ml49ys,"18, First job, got fired (kind of) after giving in my 2 weeks. What to do next?","Backstory: This is my first job, and it’s a contractual job that is supposed to end at the start of November. When I got hired, I told my manager that I could only work until the end of August due to school. He agreed, but I wasn’t careful and I signed the contract saying that my work would end in November. It’s also important to mention that my good friend recommended me for this job, and her family member is my manager. 

Today I gave him my 2 weeks notice and he said that he couldn’t accept it, and that I had told him that I could work part time alongside school. I did not say this, and I remember clearly that I said I would consider it, not that I agreed. 

Basically, he got angry and called me a liar. I sort of lost my temper a bit and called him a liar back for twisting my words. This is where he got very angry and started yelling at me, continuing to say that I was a liar, and that I was a bad employee. Things got heated and we went back and forth, which ended when he cursed at me, and told me that I was fired. During this time, I did not curse at him at all, but I do acknowledge that I shouldn’t have raised my voice and should’ve kept my cool. 

Our argument was pretty loud, and the owner of the company came over and asked what happened. I asked to have a conversation to explain what happened between me and my manager. 

My manager, kept telling the owner about my contract and how I signed the agreement. I didn’t really know what to say because I have never dealt with these types of contracts, so I told her about my verbal agreement about leaving in august when I got hired. She kept asking me why I would sign the agreement if I planned to leave in August. I kept saying that I he agreed to letting me leave when he hired me.

 I also told the owner that my manager cursed at me, and my manager apologized to me, saying that it was out of character for him. I also apologized for raising my voice. Then, the owner explained to me that it would get very busy in the coming months, and that it would be very difficult to replace me, so she and my manager offered to let me stay until the date that I had originally planned or longer.

I’m not sure if I should stay or not, and I’m also scared that if I leave, it could affect my relationship with my friend. What should I do?

1ml475d,have an interview? Use 1 interview to unlock 3.,"nowadays, interviews are extremely scarce. so if you ever do have 1, use it to get more.

when i was at google, our average interview cycle took 2-3 months. but 1 candidate went from screener to final in a single week. why? they told us they had salesforce and meta interviews wrapping soon. we sped it up because we knew they were about to make a decision.

that’s the play. manage the power dynamic. share your timeline. create urgency. your value goes up when more people want you.

this works even if you only have 1 interview on the books. that first interview is your proof. you use it to reach out to other companies even cold and let them know you’re moving.

Templates candidates have used on me (and I've used myself)

**dm to recruiter or hiring manager:**  
hi \[name\], quick timing heads up. i have an interview with \[company a\] on \[date\] and expect feedback by \[day\]. your \[role title\] is a top choice for me. if it helps, i can make time this week for a screen or hiring manager chat. what’s the fastest way to move forward

**email to a recruiter you already spoke with:**  
subject: quick timing update  
hi \[name\], i’m interviewing with \[company a\] on \[date\] and they plan to decide by \[day\]. i’m very interested in \[role title\] here. if we can set up the next step this week, i can hold time. do \[two options\] work

**last call message 24 hrs before a decision:**  
hi \[name\], i expect a decision from \[company a\] tomorrow. i want to keep \[company b\] in play. if a same day screen or hiring manager chat is possible, i’ll make it work.

how to run the play:

day 0: first interview scheduled at company a → same day, send this to 5-10 companies you want to interview with (jobs you already applied to or new ones

day 1-2: follow up with anyone who hasn’t replied. every time you book another screen: repeat with a fresh set of companies

stay calm and direct. no begging. no flexing.

1ml3hv3,From combat boots to business studies – need advice on post-MBA industry pivot,"Hey folks,

34M here, Army vet. Did a BBA in Banking & Insurance, quick stints at Bank of America and EY… then traded spreadsheets for driving battle tanks and scaling high altitude mountain patrols. Spent the last 10 years leading troops at high altitudes, managing operations in some of the toughest conditions on the planet.

Now I’m swapping the uniform for the classroom, starting my MBA at INSEAD in Jan ’26 while also facing a conundrum to figure out where to land next.

Consulting is the obvious INSEAD play.... which gives broad exposure, steep learning curve, solid brand. But I’m wary of the grind and the lifestyle cost.   
Product management excites me... so did an online 4 month long course on it as well ....building, problem-solving, owning outcomes..... but I’m not sure if it’s the best first jump for someone coming from my background.

So I’m throwing it to the hive mind:

\--> If you’ve made the leap from military to corporate, where did your skills translate best?

\--> Which industries actually value leadership + operational grit + decision-making under pressure?

\--> What roles should I realistically target right after b-school?

\--> With the advent of AI in almost all walks of life, how do you suggest someone of my background should navigate to stay relevant and with the curve. 

Looking for unfiltered, experience-based takes — the stuff which is beyond generic advice like your MBA will teach you where to go kinds..... I want to assume control and take informed decisions.... work towards the decisions I plan to take.

1ml2u6l,Need Advice Leaving Company,"Hi all, I am 21M in DFW,   
  
I have worked at a small IT company for a little under a year, in this time, I had to take maybe about 6-7 days worth of PTO due to family emergencies in very little short notice and my team has been super forgiving and I have put many hours of unpaid OT as a way to show gratitude.

Recently however, we had laid off a half of our team, I was expected to absorb the workload with very little help and I fought for a raise because of this,

They actually did end up giving me a large raise (48k -> 65k), but still being well under market rate for what I do.

I started interviewing for other roles and I have a few offers all 75-85k+ with a lot more upward opportunities than I have here,

But because of past events, and lack of experience, I feel extremely conflicted to leave my team, I know I will leave a large hole on the operations side of things and everything makes sense to leave besides the fact I feel bad.

Can anyone offer some advice on how to deal with this? It is honestly slowing me down alot more than it should.

1ml2jze,Feeling unsure about jog change as sole source of income.,"Hi everyone. 

I’m a solo parent to a 5 year old little boy. I work as a house manager/housekeeper for a private family. I’ve worked for them for 5 years. They pay very well. The job has provided a nice life for my son and I, and much needed stability. 

However, over the last 5 years, they have continued to become more and more toxic to work for. Their expectations are insane for one person. And I often feel mentally/emotionally exhausted dealing with them, their mood swings, and their mistreatment of me and other employees. The last 6 months have been really bad and the stress, anxiety and feeling of walking on eggshells has started to bleed over into my home life. I have less patience, less motivation and am just generally on edge all the time waiting for the next crazy thing they will be pissed about. 

Before I worked for this family, I ran a business on my own, doing the same kind of job for multiple families. When my son was born, I wanted something a little more stable, which is why I took this job. My love for him and devotion to giving us a good life is what has made me stay. But I really need out. And I’ve been thinking about going back into business for myself.

The thing is, I’m scared. Building up a clientele may take a little bit. We’re in an okay place savings wise, but I definitely couldn’t afford to cut my income in half for more than a couple of months. 

I think it could be the right move long-term. But part of me is feeling… Selfish? For making this decision. For possibly taking away a job that has provided me and my son stability for these years. All because of my own feelings? I keep feeling like I’ll regret not just sticking it out for the sake of our finances/lifestyle but gosh, I’m miserable there. 

What do I do? I can’t really grow my own business again while working there. I just don’t have the time as a single parent. But staying there Feels like a prison sentence. I just can’t shake this feeling of guilt for making a change that might not be as steady for a little while.

1ml22j0,My SEMESTER bill is almost 13K for a masters program in CLINICAL PSYCH! AND they want us to take 1-2 classes IN THE SUMMER,"Before the actual bills rolled out, the yearly tuition estimates were lower. The price for this program was already ridiculous, but this is just absurd, 26k for the first year and then 26k for the second, PLUS the costs for the classes in the summer - and that’s IF you finish early, since the program technically extends into a quarter of a third year. and this DOESNT account for HOUSING, FOOD, and whatever other other necessities… ANDDD the Stafford loan offered to me through FAFSA doesn’t even COVER the whole cost 🙃 (only 20.5k loan amount year)

Is it worth it? I was going to become a licensed professional counselor (get my LPC, become a therapist…)…but at every turn, this screams stupid to me. Like I want to help people, but did you know that therapists can get paid as low as $18???????????? I always laugh it off like “people are dumb, that won’t be me settling for that low ass wage after all of this” but wtf do I know? I’m currently not a therapist so all I can do is hope people are lying on here when I see that sometimes- and then there such a disparity on Therapy Reddit - there’s either people that get paid more than 80k a year as therapists replying on Reddit forums or the ones that get paid less than 50k replying—like what is happening - this field seems like a straight up gamble

I already made the first mistake of getting B.S in Psychology thinking for some reason that I would land a job worth living from, in a field that interests me, and found out quickly just how stupid I really was for entering this field. I don’t want to work my ass off for scraps, even if I’m helping people - I’m struggling enough as it is - and that’s no way to live unless you go all the way for PHD or PSYD - which I’m NOT doing ever

I need honest people please. Not the 1-5% of people with survivorship bias that made a career in therapy work or people that you heard of that made it work. I pretty much knew what it was after getting my BS in psychology and jobsearching, but wanted to still try and make a career in psychology work since I made it this far already…so that’s why I applied to the program (classes start late august.))

BUT, I was considering nursing as pivot. That way, I could still help people, and actually live my life without scraping for fucking quarters. 

But I’ve been wrong and misled in the past, so I need to more certain of things now—do more digging. What do you guys think???

Is this program worth the loans/the struggle? Should I keep with psychology but pursue a different angle? It seems like a nursing program is cheaper and reaps better benefit financially?

1ml1tc0,New Job - Red Flags,"Hi Folks,

I am fairly new to the workforce and have been at my current job for about four or five months. I work as a senior analyst in the finance department for a small college in the Midwest. However, I am noticing some things that seem a bit strange that I am flagging/looking for some insight on.  I am not sure if some of these things are normal or if they are legit redflags to be concerned about. I also included some Green(ish) flags.  Any thoughts you have are much appreciated.  Thanks!

 

Redflags:

1.      On my first day, my manager (Finance Director) was providing some onboarding information and just talking to me in general about how the finances/structures work at the college.  In the middle of our meeting, the (interim) CFO pops in and pulls the Finance Director into a meeting with him as apparently he needed him on the call to help answer some questions. I assumed he would be back within 10 minutes or so.  However, he was away for almost 2 HOURS! I was sitting in that room all alone for almost two hours, since I wasn’t even shown where my desk was yet.  Me, him and the CFO were also the only ones in the office that day since Mondays are typically most people’s remote day.  Like, couldn’t they just explain to whoever was on a call that a new hire is starting so Finance Director can’t stay on the call long?! 

2.      I have been provided basically no training.  I mostly rely on the person who was in this job previously, as thankfully, he still works for the college, just in a different role.  But, my manager (Finance Director) has barely shown/explained anything to me.  There have even been several instances where he just tells me to ask the guy who was in this job previously.  

3.      My Manager barely speaks to me most days or invites me to meetings  - despite me asking him to invite me and him saying he would.  I’m kind of surprised he wouldn’t want to invite me to meetings since I feel it would be a good learning opportunity and a good chance to build relationships with people.  It just seems like he doesn’t really care about those things

4.      Over the past year and a half, there have been major budget cuts/hiring freezes.  Enrollment and endowment $ is wayyy down.

5.      My Manager is not very personable. He never asks about weekends, hobbies, etc. I have seen him ask others, but never me.

6.      As I previously mentioned, the current CFO is only interim.  But, he has been there a while, so, he threw his hat in the ring to be considered for the permanent CFO.  He did not end up getting the job.  They went with someone completely external for it.  I find that to be a bit odd…

Green(ish) flags:

1.      People for the most part seem happy and have been there a while.  There isn’t very much turnover.  Although, since I have been there it seems like some turnover has started to pickup in certain departments.  But, the finance department remains low turnover.

2.      The salary is pretty high. Although, how they were able to afford this salary, was by getting rid of the Assistant Director Position and just hiring a senior analyst instead.

3.      The Job is fairly straightforward, but I don’t really do much.  As I mentioned, I’m not really included in on many meetings, training opportunities, etc. This means I am getting paid a lot to not really do much. But I just feel like I would rather me learning and contributing more. I just wish my manager was more interested in that for me as well.

1ml11dx,Looking for Advice: Navigating a Sudden Pay Cut After Corporate Acquisition,"
Hi all,

I’m currently working as an OSP (Outside Plant) Designer in the fiber optics industry, based in the U.S. I started with my company just under two years ago—first in a field surveying role for 9 months, then transitioning into my current designer position, which I’ve held for almost a year now.

Originally, I joined a locally owned company with a smaller, close-knit team and a performance-based (unit) pay structure. I was producing enough work to be on track for around $80k this year, and things were going well.

Recently, however, we were acquired by a large national corporation. While my day-to-day team and office haven’t changed, the organization and policies around us have. Most significantly, our pay structure was overhauled—switching me from unit pay to hourly at $18/hr. That’s more than a 50% pay cut, and understandably, it's left me very concerned about my future here.

When I raised the issue with my manager, I was told, “We’re working on getting raises for you guys.” While I appreciate the acknowledgment, I’m not confident that what comes will be competitive with what I was previously earning.

Aside from immediately quitting, I’m trying to be thoughtful about my next move. Has anyone here been in a similar position after an acquisition? How did you navigate it? Are there steps I should be taking internally, or is it time to start job hunting?

Any advice would be appreciated—especially from those in telecom, engineering, or any role that’s experienced a shift like this.

1ml037z,An emergency made me call out 10 minutes before my first shift at a new job. Where do I go from here?,"I (23F) got a trial shift as a part-time bartender. This shift was unpaid and designed to train me behind the bar and see if I could handle the environment. I was originally meant to come in at 7:30, but they pushed it back to 8:30. I am a student and this was a job I was meant to balance with my studies until my program ends. 

I have been dealing with some health issues and was recently prescribed a new medication. I ate about an hour before my shift and took the medication with it (it wasn't my first dosage). Right before I was meant to leave, I ended up throwing up and passing out. By the time I came to, my shift was meant to start in ten minutes and I was covered in vomit (I had fallen into it when I passed out). I immediately called the venue, apologized, and explained the situation to them (editing out some of the grosser details). I was likely not very coherent on the phone--I wanted to give as much notice as possible (although it was still 10 minutes) and had literally just gotten myself up off the floor.  

About 30 minutes later I was feeling well enough to the point I could have come in, and pretty much back to normal by the hour and a half mark. I took a shower and scheduled an appointment with my doctor for the next day. I've had similar reactions to other kinds of these medications in the past---I am okay, but I knew it was the meds. 

About two hours later, I emailed the manager to apologize again for missing the shift, acknowledge that calling out last minute was unprofessional, reiterate the circumstances, and ask if they would be open to reschedule. 

I'm not sure if I handled this the best I could.  In the future, what could I have done better? Would it have been better to change my clothes and come in late, even if I was in an unwell state? Or was it best to call out given the circumstances? (I was quite worried about smelling like vomit while handing drinks.)

Is there anything I can do at this point to salvage my relationship with this employer? I know I caused them a headache and did not make a good first impression. For context--this position is for a bar at a strip club. I'm just hoping turnover is poor enough they can look past this and give me another shot. 

I guess my biggest concern is that--while this is not an employer that will make or break my future career--I want to make sure I an exercising good working practices now. I am worried that I acted with poor judgement and that if I do not adjust this going forward it could have worse consequences.

I have a 2nd interview this afternoon for an executive assistant role at a tech/analytics firm, but I’m kind of spinning my wheels on how to frame why I (desperately) want to leave my current position.

I’m currently a consultant working on a large ERP transformation project that was supposed to last a little over a year. We’re almost to year 3. This is because the project leader is awful - his mismanagement of this project and refusal to take any responsibility by scapegoating our project partners is why we’ve missed so many previously planned Go-Live dates. It’s exhausting. I’m over it. I can’t take another year of trying to implement more structure and organization and having that work ignored.

 Now, confusion is creeping in because over the years I developed love for Science and the potential it holds especially with the advancement of a.i I am feeling that I should pursue b.tech in this field or I will miss out all the developmentss.

 I am so confused. 

I have all the pros and cons lined up but to find my inner calling seems impossible without a proper guidance. 


Pros of B.A: overlapping syllabus 
Will Save my prep time (probably) Provides better depth knowledge of my optional 
Less rigorous than b.tech

Cons- Missing out with the current going world events in the field of tech 
Less job opportunities
 Not so fulfilling

Waiting for your wise words :) Thankyou",Dry_Atmosphere7567,1,1.0,0,1754668108,2025-08-08 15:48:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mkysr3/what_is_better_for_upsc_btech_or_ba_from_a_local/,8,2025

1mkxwir,Nurse practitioner. High earner. 3 jobs. Want to work an administrative role.,"I currently work nights in two different ICUs. First job is w2 $222,400, second is 1099 $1200 a shift plus per diem (30-40k a year pretax), and the last is a “hemodynamics assist device assistant” which is a whooping $20 an hour and some call pay. 

Obviously the last job is a secondary role/responsibility I took on to try to impress the hospital for advancement. I also took on several unpaid roles including being on the Midlevel credentialing committee, local Midlevel lead and I help new providers with billing.

I am well liked within the organization, both the private equity company I work for and the hospital that employs us. I want to advance my career into a more administrative/development role but I feel I’m essentially topped out. I applied for a traveling position within my company that helps start contracts and training at hospitals but was passed up. I spoke with my “boss” through my 1099 job and he’s opened several conversations about a similar role within his company but nothing has materialized. 

Generally physician can joint a practice on a partnership tract and slowly transition over the course of their career. I’m hesitant to take on any more unpaid work as it cuts into income I could make 1099, and I’m doing more than my peers currently. I can’t even find jobs to apply to. 

At this stage in my career I’m unsure how many doors an MBA or DNP would open. I am considering the possibility of returning to school. I don’t have the MCAT score to get into a mediocre med school and my test results are certainly outdated. The ROI is also poor as I would loose 7-10 years of income, I’m already old, and have some school debt. It’s basically not an option. 

I’m also worried I won’t move up within my company because I’m “too valuable to production” because I’m wearing all these different hats and they don’t want to find someone to replace me. 

I was offered an equity stake in a “med spa” I could buy into, but slinging ozempic, boner pills, trt, and lazering housewife’s wrinkles isn’t going to be fulfilling. 

I would like to start on a path to becoming a CNO of a hospital, in utilization/optimization, or in bringing new programs to a facility.

1mkxsqg,Thinking of Quitting Software Dev – Is It Time to Pivot?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working as a Flutter dev for almost a year now, and honestly… I’m starting to feel stuck.
	•	The work feels incredibly repetitive — mostly UI stitching and minor logic.
	•	I’m not learning anything meaningful anymore — no real architecture, no deep backend integration, no growth.
	•	The pay is also very low.
	•	And let’s be real: Flutter roles aren’t very lucrative, especially long-term. Most of them are MVP factories or outsource gigs with low ceilings.

To add fuel to the fire, AI is rapidly eating the kind of stuff we do. I’ve seen GPT-based agents build full UI apps in minutes — I don’t want to be replaced by a glorified code autocomplete bot in 6 months.

⸻

I’m seriously considering a switch. These are the paths I’m exploring:
	1.	DevOps / Cloud / SRE – seems more in-demand, higher-paying, and less replaceable.
	2.	Data Engineering / Analytics – Python, SQL, pipelines. Plus I’ve got a solid background in finance.
	3.	Fintech / Quant Dev – got a postgrad in Computational Finance and wondering if I should lean into it.

⸻

I’d love to hear from others who were in a similar spot:
	•	Did you switch from mobile/software dev (Flutter or otherwise)? What was your path?
	•	Is Flutter dev still worth sticking to in 2025?
	•	Any advice on switching stacks or fields without starting from zero?

Let me know your honest thoughts.

1. **Backend SWE role** at a service company (safe bet).
2. **MLE role at a startup** for around 2 years, 

then pursue a Master’s in Data Science, im thinking about getting a Phd as well but im not inclined to get into research.

During these two years, I also want to work on more research papers to secure strong letters of recommendation for my Master’s applications.

* Backend (stable, in-demand, but less directly related to ML), or
* MLE at a startup (riskier, but more aligned with my long-term goals).

1mkwb86,[Urgent] My mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Cancer. Need support for my mother's aggressive cancer treatment (Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma).,"Asalamualaikum,

​I am writing this post in a moment of sheer desperation and hope.
​A month ago, my mother fell ill. After a stressful month of going from one hospital to another, she has been diagnosed with Stage 4 Cervical Cancer. The specific type is Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma, which the doctors have told us is very aggressive, meaning it grows and spreads much more quickly than other types.

​I am student and my father is the sole earner in our family. He works ironing clothes and earns between 10,000 and 15,000 a month. This is just enough for our daily survival, and the cost of cancer treatment is something we could never afford on our own.

I am turning to the Reddit community for financial help. Any contribution, big or small, will go directly towards her medical bills and give her a fighting chance. If someone can even lend for a long period of time that will also be helpfull.

Verification : 

I understand that trust is important. I am ready and willing to provide all medical reports, hospital documents, and any other details to anyone who is able to help. Please send me a private message (DM) for verification.

​I have chosen to post here instead of on Facebook or Instagram. I am afraid and don't have courage to show my face and also, This is out of respect for my father’s wishes and to avoid the toxicity of certain relatives who are quick to question (""why did you need to upload online, why didn't you tell us?"") but slow to help. Right now we need genuine support, not judgment.

​I really, really need help. Your support could mean the world to my family and my mother.

Guide: Attract Rejections, and it gave me a fresh perspective. We often measure success by acceptance-but this chapter reminded me that rejection plays an equally important role.

Rejection means effort. It shows we stepped out, tried, and made ourselves visible. As someone still navigating the early phases of my career, this idea encouraged me to stop fearing rejection-and start learning from it instead.

I've realized that every ""no"" carries its own value. It teaches, redirects, and quietly builds resilience. Growth, after all, doesn't begin where things are easy -but where we choose to keep trying.

1mkrpda,Help me make a career decision,"I’m trying to decide between two senior roles in legal marketing/business development and would love some outside perspective. One is a Director role at a midsize firm (around 300 attorneys), where I’d oversee a small team of 5. It’s a 20-minute commute, offers a true 9–5 culture, and would give me significantly more work-life balance and time with my kids. The downside is that it pays about $90K less than the other option, and the culture is unknown — I wouldn’t really know what I’m walking into until I’m there.

The other is a promotion at my current large global firm (700+ attorneys), where I’d lead a 40-person team and oversee the entire BD function. I’d get a big pay bump and the chance to reshape the department, and I already know the people and the internal dynamics.

Would you choose better balance and a fresh start, or more money and title in an environment you already know?

1mkr28b,I went back to work after burnout. I had to quit after 3 weeks. what do you think happened?,"So I had a burnout in 2024, I did not work for a year and a half. My initial idea was to never go back to the office, or do things in the field that I was involved in over the last 5 years. 

I could not find any alternatives fast, and so I thought if I only do 32 hours in the same field again, with a short commute, 1 day work from home, and easy responsibilities, I should be good. After all, my savings would not last forever. So I got a job (that was not too difficult as I am experienced). 

I keep journals, write down what I feel, so on day 3 my journal already said 'I am exhausted, I am drained, I look terrible'. Then another week (around day 8 or 9), I was so tired, I could hardly walk around (and that was my day off). I had to cancel my haircut appointment - I was so unwell. I was in bed for the rest of my day off. 

My sleep became interrupted again, and many signs of my first burnout came back instantly. And then came the brain fog. Or something I was not familiar with - I experienced difficulty just talking. Talking to people over the phone - I could hear them and understand what they said to me, but when I responded, it was like another person talking. That scared me. I resigned.

I call it 'express' burnout. But I am not sure what I need to learn from it? Did I not rest enough?  Is the office not a place for me? Or going from zero hours to 32 is a big step, and better do it 16-24 first. What do you think?

1mkqjvl,How to use another offer as leverage.,"Hi all,

I’ve been offered an internship with a company I really like. The role could turn into a full-time job after the 3 month internship ends, but they’ve told me they can’t make any promises right now.

At the same time, I’ve been offered a full-time position with another company. I’m less excited about it, but it’s a guaranteed full-time job. Ideally, I’d like to take the internship, but I’m worried about being left without work if it doesn’t convert. 
I’m wondering if it’s possible, or wise to use the fact that I have this other full-time offer as leverage to get more certainty from the internship company without coming across as giving an ultimatum. The internship is part time and I would accept part time employment afterwards if it got me in the door.

1mkqjqn,Need insights: Field Service Representative role at Tata Advanced Systems (via QSS Global) for CSE fresher,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 2025 B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering graduate and recently got contacted by a recruiter from QSS Global for a Field Service Representative position at Tata Advanced Systems Ltd (TASL).

Some details:

The original JD mentioned Electrical/Electronics Engineering graduates, but the recruiter said they are also hiring CSE graduates and freshers.

The role involves on-site client visits (defense, aerospace, homeland security) for installing, configuring, troubleshooting, and maintaining systems.

Clients might include Indian Armed Forces, DRDO, ISRO, and other defense/aerospace organizations.

Some sites may be high-security zones, and the JD states willingness to travel.

My background is in software (Java, OOP, Git, Linux, basic networking) and I have no hands-on electronics hardware experience beyond academics.


I’d like to know from those with experience:

1. Typical day-to-day work for a CSE graduate in a Field Service role like this.


2. How much travel is usually involved and how it’s arranged.


3. Learning curve for someone from a non-electrical background.


4. Whether this role leans more toward hardware/system maintenance or still involves a lot of software work.


5. Work culture at TASL and experiences working via QSS Global.



Any advice or firsthand experiences would be really helpful.

Thanks in advance.

1mkq0re,Need Guidance on Future of my Role,"Hello,

Im an IC who has worked at the same company for the past 8 years. I’ve always scored very well on reviews either excellent or top performer, and I started floating the idea to my manager last year about taking on additional roles and setting some obtainable goals so I can be promoted. I come to find out that another team member just recently got promoted, which is great for him. Unfortunately for me however, that more than likely means I’ll be stuck at my level, since there are already too many high level workers.

I will say that the past couple of years I’ve become a little jaded with the office politics and the new upper management who only want yes men(which I am definitely not, and I will often voice my displeasure with changes), so I think being passed up for promotion is in part to that. I haven’t gone to any of the company BBQs or events the past couple of years, instead I focus on doing my work quietly, while the recent promotee has been doing stuff that is high visibility and being social.

I used to be more involved with day to day operations and often made suggestions, but the past couple of years, I’ve felt every time I try to help the team, it’s not appreciated and gets ignored or I get reprimanded for trying to “run the shop” that I no longer see any reason to stick my neck out. Recently my manager told me I have an impatience problem in a 1 on 1, that I tend to want to jump into the work and make things happen, that I need to slow down and not get frustrated. I should have asked for a specific example because I’m not entirely sure what she means by it, but I think she doesn’t like it when I take initiative on tasks, maybe she would rather I let the job fail  or stop if things aren’t ready who knows. I just know that’s she’s been cold with me the past year or so, also with some of the other team members, and it almost seems like there’s favoritism going on, it wasn’t like that before. I even heard from my lead that she doesn’t like dealing with me and a couple of other guys. I find that to be incredibly un-professional what do you mean you “don’t like dealing with them” boo-hoo lady it’s your job! Doesn’t help that the work environment is toxic and some people snitch on each other and talk smack behind our backs.


Clearly, I’m no longer in her good graces, which is fine, I don’t like her either she’s grossly incompetent at her job. I just wonder if I should read the writing on the wall and leave or just keep my head down and continue to do my job and work on upping my visibility in some way and hope for a promotion. I’m considering looking at internal transfers, but I could also try to remedy the situation with the manager at the next 1 on 1. I do like my job and planned on working here for the next 30+ years but I don’t like the fact I’m being excluded from meetings and high visibility work.

My gut tells me it’s time to leave before things get worse.

If you read this essay I appreciate it lol I just didn’t want to leave out key details! Thanks for any input

1mkptpz,Accepting a Non-Engineering Job as a Recent Engineering Graduate?,"I got my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from a very well regarded American university in December of 2024. I LOVE engineering. I’ve always wanted to be an engineer. My peers and friends agree that I am a very talented and knowledgeable engineer.

I have been struggling to find a job and am barely living paycheck to paycheck. It’s now been 7 months since I graduated. I have been working part-time at a mechanics shop, as an engineering mentor and tutor for high school students, and I attempted to start my own startup in high-voltage devices (R&D is complete on a complex device, funding and investment has been fruitless). Other than an internship 4 years ago and 2 years of university robotics lab research, I have no work experience.

My goal is to end up in robotics or aerospace. Ideally I want to be a project manager or to start my own firm. I also absolutely love the technical parts of engineering (Math, CAD, Code, Mechatronics, Manufacturing, etc).

I just landed an interview for a great paying job in my favorite city in the US. Issue is, it’s not strictly speaking an “engineering” role. I would be working for a bank. With this job, I would be able to pay off all my school loans and credit debts within 6-8 months. Let’s say I work there for 12 months.

Will getting and accepting this job ruin my future career goals? Will I be considered a no-experience applicant for engineering roles in the future? Will it help my resume, or will the time working this job hurt my resume? Is that something I should be taking seriously with my current financial situation? Should I keep searching for an engineering role?

I have been “seriously” applying for 3-4 months. I’ve sent around 200 applications and have gotten two interviews one offer that I chose to reject (due to pay and location).

1mkphea,Guidance Needed: MS Abroad vs. MTech in India + Career Roadmap,"Hey Redditors,

I’m fairly new to posting here, so forgive me if I make any mistakes.  
I’m a 21-year-old CS graduate with an internship experience at Nvidia. Starting next week, I’ll be working at a FinTech startup, where I’ll be contributing to the **FPGA component** of their product.

I’ve always planned to pursue a Master’s degree in the future. Since I come from a lower-middle-class background, my idea was to first work for a few years, save money, and then support my higher education myself.

Initially, I was aiming for an **AI/ML-related course**, but with all the recent news about the decline in certain parts of the software industry, I’m not sure if that’s still the best choice. I still want to work in tech, but I’m confused about **which major** would be the safest and most rewarding in the long run.

I also want to get some **foreign exposure** for personal growth, but given the global situation in 2025, I’m not sure how realistic that is. For context, I’ve always been an “above-average but underconfident” student who’s looking to push beyond my comfort zone.

So here are my main questions:

1. **Savings** – If I plan to start my MS in about 3 years, how much should I aim to save?
2. **Specialization** – Given the current software industry trends, which major should I consider?
3. **Location** – Which countries should I look at besides India? Or would an MTech/other relevant Indian degree be a good alternative to an MS abroad?
4. **Roadmap** – What would be an ideal 3–5 year plan for me in terms of skills, work experience, and preparation?

Any insights, personal experiences, or even cautionary tales would be super helpful. Thanks in advance!",Vegetable-Common-857,1,1.0,0,1754640783,2025-08-08 08:13:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mkphea/guidance_needed_ms_abroad_vs_mtech_in_india/,8,2025
1mkpdxn,11 months unpaid of taking over duties.,"I work in the US at unsaid manufacturing plant making medical devices. 
My previous boss (production manager) quit 11 months ago after he didn't get a title change when he absorbed the plant manager duties who quit title. 

A few months after that after they laid off the quality supervisor. 

I absorbed all of the quality supervisors duties. Half the production managers duties. Was put into the faculty leadership team. And have a direct line to the director. 

And to top it off the quality manager died of a heart attack 1.5 years ago and they didn't backfill him until this month. Even still half of quality still reports to me. 

I've asked for clarity in my role, a title change. I said I'd be okay with even being an assistant manager to show I'm in training. I've given many ideas for flexibility.  It's always delayed or not taken seriously. I formally complained to HR. They talked to him and it changed nothing. Their solution was to ""try again"". The director feels like an empty shell of a person. He has a nickname of ""king npc"" referencing non player character's  in video games. Because he's so robotic.

I'm fully dependent on my income or I would've quit a long time ago. My girlfirend and i barely get by financially.. I've been applying for jobs for a year but I can't seem to get an on site interview anywhere. I'm underpaid in my state as a production supervisor in my actual title as it is. Not even considering I've absorbed prpduction manager responsibilities.  Literally 2$ an hour of a pay cut would cause financial issues. So I'm trapped.

I'm in need of direction as my mental health has completely tanked. Cant sleep for work anymore. I dont want to wake up and be gaslit anymore.
 Everyday is turning into questioning my own sanity because of how unethical it is. Even coworkera who arent friends with me pull me aside like ""why the fuck havent you been promoted? This place is fucked I'm sorry man."" 

It sucks because I love all my employees and coworkers. Its just this director won't do the right thing. It's happening to our main sales woman too. I'm even introduced as an overachieving supervisor who's going above his role to help out when we have corporate visitors.

So my performance isn't bad. Its like I'm just good enough to perform the duties of a production manager but not good enough they want me to do it permanently. But they are also too cheap to pay me on the higher supervisor end. It's lunacy. What we do is technical and I have outperformed others who held my role as I started as an engineering technician so my problem solving capabilities on the processes is far greater. I've read some books on lean and taken six sigma training on udemy. And can list examples of execution in interviews If I get that far. I just can't get past the recruiter screening and filters.


I just don't know what's wrong with my resume and don't know where to go to get help. Im very good at what i do, but i dont know how to market myself. This is the only manufacturing job ive had and ive worked from the bottom up in my 6 years. I list lean and six sigma in there. All my project management experience. Idk what else to do.  

I need out of there but have to get another job first. I simply have no family and I'm on my own so I can't afford to make less or be unemployed.  Can anyone point me to resume services for manufacturing? Can't find anything online that seems reliable and I'm having no luck. Can you hire personal recruiters? I'm willing to spend up to 500$ on resume writing or help landing interviews.

Or just advice in navigating this. The current director retires soon. So how do I communicate this without the doom and gloom to the new guy to see if he can fix it. Or without seeming unprofessional. For context other process engineers just got promoted so there's other people getting paid there. I also had no issues discussing these type of things with my previous bosses.

TLDR: should I tell my employer I was still paid during my unpaid leave and return the money? 

I took a month of unpaid leave (not medical or extenuating circumstances). I told my supervisor and it was approved and all good. I see I was still paid for the time I was off on unpaid leave. Verified the pay slips and dates - yes they paid me despite the leave being unpaid. 

Say something or no? I like my role and have a good and respectful relationship with everyone. No drama or issues. 

I did not inform HR/finance of the unpaid leave. I assumed (yes my error here) that the supervisor who approved the unpaid leave would inform them and tell them to not pay me for that time period.

* Using practice tests to measure readiness and identify weak areas
* Taking notes and creating your own quick-reference sheets

1mkn0ng,It is worthy for me to switch mechanical engineering To CSE? (INDIA),"Hi Everybody I Completed My 10th at 2020 then i went for deploma in mechanical engineering, and this Deploma course around 4 years (3 Years Study + 1 years internship) in there i learned about mostly practice like how to operate CNC , VMC , LATH, DRILLING AND MILING Machine, After my 3 Years I got internship at aerospace company, but in there is work culture is so bad , i traumatized and depressed, even one point i decided to even take my life but Thankfully i leave the company and also got Re-internship At big Automobile MNC. This MNC PAYS ME Around 3.50 Lacs per years, it's Good compare to my friends, but after 1 years internship and 10 months of work i decided to resignation that company for Study, 

In here i have confusion i don't like mechanical at all , so that's why I decided to join CSE For Degree but right now job - market and also Ai evolution, Compitition, this all results me to rethink my disition, because in mechanical engineering Job Where i completed my internship is very good and also have free time at home to just relax, but here in Cse i think I have to Learn continuous for more upto date to market and technology also i feel like mechanical job is like Government Job , Not Tention At all,

1mkmweu,Unsure about my decisions,"Hi everyone.

So, I have been in my current work for approx 8 months. Since I joined I have been doing a lot of crazy stuff in my current work. First month in I created a macro on excel that validates between eight data bases in seconds for changes we are asked to do, reducing the time of validations from 15 mins to like 1 minute.

In the second month I started to doing side projects with every manager aside from my superior. Also our yearly objectives I finished them at six months. I'm constantly being asked about stuff, integrated on projects and if something needs to be done I'm the first option for the managers and directors. Also our job is kinda support+ticket things I'm really fast and managers always prefer to work with me. I'm also pretty knowledgeable about how this Enterprise work, and found how to do another validations that took even hours for doing so and people who were here before me had no idea. In this eight months I have been really working my ass off.

I have also been creating relationships with another areas(this company has like 30+ areas) that help me reach faster and better all the objectives.

The last projects I have been doing is BPMN 2.0 process of everything (this area is 3 years old but had no oficial process, even thought this company is a big empire since this area is ""new"" they were not here) and Im developing an onboarding for new employers with all the concepts that not even the managers know + videos case examples and everything I would have wanted to learn when I was here.

Today I got really sad/frustrated. I know I haven't been here for a long time, I'm also someone who likes to do stuff since I can use that on my portfolio and curriculum. But I'm so frustrated cuz I have been doing A LOT of things and also have been really good at my normal functions and I heard the director said that he was ok if we leave. Not like I want him to be my friend, but I'm just getting like 750 dollars a month and I was thinking I could probably get more since i have even more expertise, experience, contacts and stuff than some of the new managers hired by the director. Also I can move to another areas after I reach certain time in the company.


I have been even thinking on doing something by myself. I have been eating courses like crazy, learning alot of stuff and trying to get better and doing things. Currently I'm on my way to finish SQL and Tableau courses since I want to head towards data science but I'm just burnt out now since I haven't been getting a bigger pay. I would like to get the double or the triple of my current now but seems like a long path now.

Idk what to do but waiting... Cuz I also know that the less time you stay in a job isn't good in a CV cuz it doesn't show stability. But I outgrown my current job and I'm frustrated...",AbbreviationsWeak707,2,1.0,0,1754631203,2025-08-08 05:33:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mkmweu/unsure_about_my_decisions/,8,2025

(36/hr was the max they offered I wanted 38/hr but they said that was more of a tech II pay) I currently am on a 5x8 schedule making around 70k salaried including bonuses have the same benefits pto, holidays, 401k, etc as the offer essentially. I've been at the company for 2 years now and see what they do to those who stay (My coworker has been there for 5 years and was making less than me and was given a single day extra of pto). Not to mention they basically hold our bonuses every year and add some bs to get it. And no inflation adjustment. I'm getting 3-4% pay increase with the offer after a few months and promotion after about a year. Not to mention I really don't see growth at my current position but with the offer there's a lot of options opened to me. I would have to move and break my lease which wouldn't be covered by the company. Essentially the pay increase would cover the move. I'm just hesitant since my current role is a lab engineer and I'm going into an field service tech role (high voltage utilities). But I see engineers (with degrees) on linkedin in this position. The experience I feel is invaluable and could be used to even get my PE (professional engineer). As of now I'm probably moving forward with the offer and applying still elsewhere. Maybe entertaining a counter offer from my current company.

1mklxtj,"I still keep making many mistakes at my job a year in, what do I do?","I keep making small mistakes at work and it's been giving me a ton of stress, especially since it's been so long already!

I work as an accounts administrator for a very small company and it's my first proper full time job. There's 5 of us in total. I'm the only person handling invoicing, quotations, recording purchases, inventory count and chasing customers for late payments. The job is actually pretty relaxed, so I don't think it's the workload itself that's stressing me out; My mistakes drive me insane.

It's a lot of carelessness and/or a ton of horrible memory that I started noticing since I started the job. Examples include:

\- Boss asked me to write a quotation for one of our products, he told me to follow the previous invoices I've written for this product where we included the extra battery pack in the invoice. I checked our older invoices and it did not have any mentions of extra batteries, I followed the invoice format and the company called later asking why the additional battery was not clearly listed in the quotation.

\- Customer company called asking why the serial number on the delivery did not match up with the actual serial number on the product. This is my bad, I added an additional zero in front of the numbers when I print out labels for products. My boss didn't know and he was the one who wrote that delivery order.

\- There was a delivery order I was supposed to only invoice later when I receive a purchase order from the company. One day my boss asked about it and I forgot that that delivery order even existed, but I did put it away in my stack of 'bill later' orders. I had only put it away the day prior!

\- A customer came to pick up their orders and I didn't write a delivery order for it. I had (wrongly) assumed that it didn't need to be billed because it wasn't mentioned to me and we do repairs as well, and if it's under warranty we don't write an order or invoice them.

\- Whenever my boss asks me about previous orders (within the week or the month) or incoming orders that he had told me before, I can't remember them.

\- I struggle to even remember my mistakes right now.

But safe to say I've gone through mistakes regarding writing the wrong address, accidentally keying in the wrong number, wrong pricing, forgetting orders and whatnot. I've been trying to remedy all of this with more verbose excel sheets with data and tracking, and it has helped immensely with not missing out on orders to quickly checking older ones. But without my excel sheet, alone I'm pretty goddamn terrible because of my memory. Nothing at work sticks!

I'm not sure if it's *that* many things to remember either? I write delivery orders in the morning, then bill the previous day's delivery orders as invoices. It's not like I'm dealing with hundreds of them, maybe ten or twelve at most.

It really sucks that each time I think to myself ""I've been doing stuff right, finally!"" and then I get an email or a call and find out that something I did yesterday or last week had an error. It's incredibly demotivating that whenever my boss asks me something and I reply, both him and I are both unsure of whether I said something correct, until I go check and pull up the data.

Is it my anxiety causing even worse memory? Or is my memory just that shot? Am I just not detail orientated at all and this job isn't for me? I don't know what I'm doing wrong and it's been driving me insane. My boss treats me very, very well, but he can get pretty high strung and ""ugh come on pay attention more"" whenever mistakes crop up.

1mkk6i1,"jack of all trades, master of none, computer engineer bs degree in USA. Am I cooked?","Hi, all. Like the titles say, I graduated in last December with a Computer Engineering degree. I was alway curious at various topics outside school and I did some cool project(at least I think they are). I'm still trying to look for IT/ tech/ technician job. This may be a bit long, but any advice will be appreciated.  
  
The school projects I have done was like game theory of a catan board game for a MATH graphics class, history of telecommunication(basically 1G to 5G) for my history class, some music band fan page(tons of research on how they write their music and their philosophy, but not the top on graphics design), as well as a school project helping a company to build a device to receive input from a computer to our PCB board so it controls the switches for the signals. FYI, I also done one FPGA class so i learnt a bit about that as well. 

On my own project side, I built a simple arduino keyboard that basically turning shift key into shift lock, and I learnt stuff like ghosting. I also do some soldering/ desoldering, weilding(from like a blacksmith class in the summer, not sure if it helps with anything). A simple game project which involves airconsole API(html, css, js) and unity(C#). Last one is a so called ""encoding algorithm"" basically based on a 3x3 rubics cube logic.   

For my ""work"" experience, I helpped a professor doing data collection, from csv, with some filtering formulars on his book, to build a little data to charts software. Right now, I'm volunteering for an office for a threater, I just built an automatic email draft tool for the manager with like google excel draft programming.

I think I have quite a wide range of programming experience, as well as hardware. I'm more confidient at C, the lesser ones are html, css, js, python, C++.  I think I can present to people that I'm detailed orientated, but I'm not particularly good at any one of them. I had one interview screwed up because I forget which one is deadlock(meaning I know it when I looked back but I forget this is deadlock at the time). Also I got a low GPA. 

My question is, how do I represent myself in this job market, if you were in my shoes? Also, FYI, I'm international student so I need to find jobs related to my field. Currently I lived in Washinton state. I tired shotgun method on sending resumes(basically if the job post seem fitting for like 70% of what I can do, I apply). I aimed for like Oregan, Washington, and Idaho, but I'm thinking about widening the search area. The problem then becomes, the job hunting is already soul grinding for me. So, any advice you see from the above would be really appreciated, from widen the search, narrowing down . Lastly, if you read to here, thank you for your time. I'm not sure if I was clarifying everything here so if you have any questions, I will try to answer it.

1mkjrnr,"Scared to share a major life update because of people who sabotaged me, would you post it?","A few years ago, I worked under someone in a leadership role who made my life miserable. This supervisor mocked me, blocked opportunities, stole my work, and created such a toxic environment that I eventually cut ties. Not long after, a journalist reached out to feature me in a piece related to my work. She seemed genuinely interested and told me she would speak to my former supervisor who works on similar issues. However, after she spoke to my former supervisor the situation shifted. After this, she retracted the interview and later published an article on the exact same topic, giving him all the credit. They’ve been collaborating ever since, and she never contacted me again.

Now she’s freelancing for a major publication, and he’s still very famous in his respective field. I’m making a big career shift and starting a journalism program this fall. I want to post about it on LinkedIn to mark this new chapter, but I’m honestly scared they’ll somehow try to block opportunities again like before or ruin my name somehow in this new field. 

Would you post on LinkedIn you were me? Or wait? I hate that it still feels like they hold power over my future. Unfortunately they follow me on all social media platforms and it would be weird to remove them and perhaps make the suspicious. Any suggestions on how I can break free from this feeling or experience would be greatly appreciated.

I am watching him face rejection after rejection. It is tough to see his confidence drop day by day. I feel helpless because I am not sure how to guide him.

\- jobs are generally in the middle of nowhere

1mkgp6e,Introducing FirstImpressionAI: Smart Resume–Job Match Analysis and Tailored Cover Letters,"

*Ready to stop guessing if your resume hits the mark?*  
[**FirstImpressionAI**](https://firstimpressionai.app/) helps job seekers focus on the right things by showing where they stand — and how to improve — before they submit their application.

# Why Resumes Get Lost in the Void

Today, almost all medium and large employers use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to manage the flood of resumes they receive. These systems automatically parse and score resumes against job descriptions, looking for specific keywords. Studies show that **more than 75 % of resumes never reach human eyes**[finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/75-resumes-never-read-human-174855340.html#:~:text=Three,list%20recruiters%20never%20find%20you). This means you can be perfectly qualified and still be rejected if your resume doesn’t “speak ATS”.

According to industry research, nearly **99 % of Fortune 500 companies** and about **70 % of large companies** rely on ATS platforms[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=The%20ATS%20Market). **Seventy percent of resumes that don’t match an ATS’s criteria are removed**[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=The%20ATS%20Market). This is why tailoring each application matters — but doing it manually for every job is exhausting.

# Meet FirstImpressionAI

[FirstImpressionAI ](https://firstimpressionai.app/)solves the ATS problem by combining artificial intelligence with human‑centred design. Instead of guessing which keywords matter, you upload your resume and paste the job ad. Within seconds, our GPT‑4o‑powered engine:

* **Calculates a match score** — shows exactly how well your resume aligns with the role.
* **Identifies gaps** — pinpoints missing skills, experience or keywords.
* **Generates a personalised cover letter** — not generic fluff, but a letter tailored to address your specific strengths and bridge the gaps.

It’s like having a career coach, hiring manager and AI assistant rolled into one. You see what employers see before you apply, and you get guidance on how to improve.

# Built for Scale and Security

As a cybersecurity engineer, I refused to take shortcuts. FirstImpressionAI is **entirely built on Microsoft Azure**, with serverless functions handling processing and secure AI deployments:

Security comes first: JWT-based authentication, rate limiting, encrypted storage, input sanitisation and continuous AI-assisted vulnerability assessments are all baked in. You can trust us with your data.

# Why We Skipped the “MVP”

Many founders launch a stripped‑down minimum viable product, then rewrite it later. After years of building secure systems, I realised that **building for scale from day one** doesn’t necessarily take more time; it just requires smart planning. So we built FirstImpressionAI with production‑grade architecture and real security. Auto‑scaling and zero technical debt mean we can focus on features instead of fire‑fighting.

# How to Use It

1. **Upload your resume** (no data is stored after processing).
2. **Paste the job description.**
3. **Get your match score and gap analysis.**
4. **Generate a tailored cover letter** that highlights your strengths and addresses any missing requirements.
5. **Iterate** with instant feedback.

Your first three cover letters and fit checks are **free** — no credit card required. If you like what you see, unlimited access costs less than a couple of coffees a month.

# Roadmap: Even More Value Coming

This is just the beginning. We’re working on:

* **ATS‑friendly resume generator** — craft a new resume based on your job match analysis.
* **Analytics dashboard** — track your job application performance over time.
* **Interview prep tools** — generate custom questions based on the role and your experience.
* **Recruiter tools** — help recruiters identify top candidates and connect them directly with job seekers.

1mkfifc,Did I Blow It?,"For reference, I started a new job about 3 weeks ago. The first 3 weeks entailed new employee orientation, such as reading/signing off on procedures, pin the tail on the donkey, building legos as a group…you get the idea. 

Today I started the hands-on training as a production tech.  Also for reference, I have about 10 years experience as a production tech. However, every new job entails job shadowing and qualification activities, no matter how much experience one has. I was told to job shadow today, then complete qualification activities later in the day. Ok, that seems a little quick but no problem. 

In addition to this, I was told I would be moved to another shift after today because the guy training me today is an extreme introvert and doesn’t like people or training. I thought, “Ok, I can muddle through it”. Then the job shadowing starts. He rushes through everything super fast, tells me a few things, and doesn’t tell me where essential items to complete my job are located. He then tells me he will leave me a list of samples to pull for my qualification and says he will check everything when he gets back from lunch/maintenance. I freaked out because I’m going to be judged on these qualification samples.

I called my supervisor to explain the situation. I suggested that I do my qualifications next week since I can job shadow a different production tech. He agreed, but then wanted to know what I plan on doing all day. I explained that I have new training listed on my ITP that I can focus on. He agreed, but I have a feeling he didn’t like it.

So, did I blow it? I feel like I’m “damned if I do, damned if I don’t”.

1mkfex9,Have You Ever Encountered A Jealous / Envious Employee ?,"I typed in jealousy and envy in the work place and all I saw was threads about ‘my boss is so jealous of me’ ‘my manager is so envious of me’ ‘my boss is so threatened by me’. It’s intersting actually how it’s mainly employees speaking about how jealous their bosses. 

These stories are valid however I’ve not found any of bosses who have had to deal with envious or jealous employees or reports ?! 

I believe this is not spoken about enough. As you never hear managers hear managers speak about this.

Have you ever dealt with an envious or jealous employee?!

How did you move past this?

I will only have about 2.5 days of PTO accrued by then. My husband’s family is from India and in the past we have always gone for 3 weeks (as my previous position had a more generous leave policy). I live in the US on the west coast so obviously it’s a very long trip. I’m thinking of going for about a week and taking maybe 5-7 days off (which would give me like a week including weekends and minus travel days). I was thinking of waiting til the end of August to ask so as to continue making a good impression.

1mkdxwm,Advice please?,"Hi,

Im a 31 year old male and I drastically need to improve my situation.

For the last 5 years I've been doing warehouse/production work, forklift truck driving and a bit of shipping co-ordinating.

Personal issues and other areas of my life have been more important to me over the recent years but I'm realising in my early 30's that if I do not get out of my current position, I am going to be stuck doing this kind of work for the rest of my life and I could not think of much worse,

I'm going to be going to some careers guidance meeting and do some searching as I'm not sure specifically what job I would like to do, so I'm open to almost anything at this point.

I have a couple of friends who have advised me to get 'xyz' qualifications to work on construction sites, learn to operate certain kind of trucks and they pay in the region of £20ph / £38,400 p/a. This is an upgrade from where I am at.

I've also spoke with an engineering surveyor that came in to my job this week and he's advised me that if I were to pick up some NVQ qualifications in engineering and mechanics, I could acquire an apprenticeship with his company starting at £35,000 p/a and after a year or two I'd be on around £55,£60,000 p/a. This sounds like my best option right now.

I'm obviously looking for something well paying and attainable, I don't want to work 5+ years on a low wage before I start earning decent money when there are faster options out there.

Does anybody know of any fields where you can do some quick learning before landing in a well paying position?

Or do you know of any jobs that are particularly satisfying, enjoyable and/or rewarding that I could lean towards?

I don't do much social networking and I dont hear of many good opportunities so I'm really trying to do some digging.

1mkblm0,Career tips needed,"Hi Everyone!

Italian,28 years old, degree in quantitative finance with 3 years experience in consulting (mainly software provision to financial institutions, so a function analyst/ data analyst/engineer role. Very repetitive job especially in the data analyst role). I got sick of it last year and quitted without a clear alternative, just a plane ticket to Thailand.

I came back more confused than ever, I can’t find what I really want to do. Seems like a typical 1st world problem, but hey it is stressing me out.

I’m here as in a sort of brainstorming, every critical suggestion can be helpful, so if you wanna participate, I would gladly thank you for that.

I kind of like data (as in Excel/Python), as I felt pretty satisfied when I completed my thesis in matlab. It was a mix of creativeness (testing trading strategies) and technical constraints. However I don’t wanna spend the entire day looking at codes.

I like writing, and I thought a copywriter role might fit that. However, I studied a bit, wrote an article, but already got sick of it. Probably the lack of “analytical rigor” is what it is missing.

I would like to work without time costaints, scheduling my own time (and hopefully one day getting enough money per hour so that I can work 4-5 hours a day)

Seems like I am a spoiled child with lots of request, that doesn’t understand how the world works. It might be true, but I wanna try some last shots before surrendering and getting a 9-5 job and stop complaining.

Do you have idea how one can get a mix of personal satisfaction, some decent salary and freedom to enjoy his own passions in this world ? What are the possibilities ?

1mkb80y,You’re not getting interviews because you’re not niched down enough,"In a more competitive job market, you HAVE to stand out by niching down your target role.

It’s not enough to have a resume that’s good for any and all analytics. It has to be more specific to a specific function of analytics:

- Data science? Better have some modeling experience on there.
- Marketing? Need to have marketing terms like reach, engagement, ROAS.
- Financial? Needs to have financial terms.

The more tailored your resume is, the easier it is for recruiters and hiring managers to picture you in the role. If your resume reads like you’re “kind of” a fit for 10 different jobs, you’ll lose to the person who looks like a perfect fit for just one.

So, pick your lane. Adjust your keywords. Show the results that matter for that field.
You’ll stop blending in and start getting interviews.

1mkallj,What would you do? Needing career advice.,"I am at a loss and looking for some ideas or advice on how to handle my situation.

I am a full time caregiver for my husband with ALS, I am a mom, head of household, and in an executive role at my company. Throughout my husband’s diagnosis, my company has been supportive with time that I have needed for appointments and working Hybrid so I can care for my husband most of the week. 

Here is where my dilemma begins. My company has gone through many changes in culture and engagement. They have been cutting left and right, my team went from the size of 60 to 28 in the last year and a half. Some in the company have been jumping ship and when they do, the higher ups will say terrible things about them, such as traders, people who I have seen poor blood sweat in tears into our company over the years and help them get to where they are now. 

Everyone has become stressed, angry and quick to point fingers since everyone is so short staffed. They used to be a company of support, synergy and team work. Now all has changed. My leader of a year, has not been supportive, shooting down ideas and opportunities before even getting a chance to share. Expecting some more cuts before the end of the year. I really don't think we can afford cutting further if we want to keep up with sales. I feel stuck, sad, and just so frustrated with how everything has changed. I am no longer happy, and feel pained at the thought of waking up everyday and having to be in this environment. 

I feel terrible with how supportive they have been with my husband, and allowing me to work from home. I understand I may not have flexibility somewhere else. With the stresses at home, this is adding a whole other element of an emotional toll. Do I chance it and go somewhere new? Is there advice on how to discuss with C-suite leaders?

1mka1xm,Morally conflicted on new project- what to do?,"Software developer here- I got put onto this new project recently. The gist of this is the CEO is planning on layoffs and also expecting some resignations before the end of year, and so the project is to develop systems designed to do the work of those they're planning on losing. The information is confidential to a handful of people, including my boss' chain of command all the way up to the CEO, as well as other people working on it (in total, probably less than 2% of the company are in the project).

Reading through the documentation for this project, they are trying to get this done as fast as possible to avoid the affected laid off teams from getting wind of the project before the layoff announcements. It also details ""how to lie"" about the project when others ask, and since not all of my team is involved, I've been asked to lie about what I'm working on during team stand up updates.

Morally, I feel terrible about the project and have no desire in being involved in having a hand in layoffs. I also don't like the idea about lying to my team members not in the know, but now I'm not sure what to do. Am I overreacting? If I tell my manager about my concerns, I'm worried they could do a couple things: they could either move me off the project but potentially face retaliation such as no promotions; they could have me keep working on the project and I'll feel miserable throughout; or they could fire me since I already know. I've considered resigning but I've only got about 3 months of emergency funds (plus another 2 months of investments I'm willing to sell). I'm worried with the tech sector right now, it may be a while before I find something new. If I stay while looking for the next opportunity to leave, the project might already be done.

Over the past few years, I've grown passionate about systems and data-driven HR.

During my current role, I’ve gained experience in:
Policy writing & implementation, DBMS understanding, Power BI for HR analytics, Advanced Excel (dashboards, reports), HR project coordination and Transitioning from manual HR operations to HRIS

One major project I led was implementing performance productivity criteria and assisting in the shift from manual HR processes to HRIS software.

Now, I’m seriously considering a career shift into the HRIS domain.

My question to the community:

Is it worth transitioning into HRIS from a generalist HR role based on my experience?

Should I gain more hands-on skills or certifications before making the switch?

What HRIS-specific tools/skills should I learn?

How is the career growth and pay scale in the UAE (or Any other country) for HRIS professionals?

I have no preference for either position, but the interview would be for a position that's starting pay is $20k higher than the position I accepted. I was open with the recruiter that I was interested in the interview, but they were clear that they would not be able to move the process any faster to account for my existing offer. This job offer came after 6 months of being unemployed, so I don't exactly want to throw it away for the chance at better pay. That said, I'm unsure of how to proceed.",ThrownException123,3,0.7099999785423279,13,1754594367,2025-08-07 19:19:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mk9ao8/interviewing_while_onboarding/,8,2025

All she does is unnecessary talks and waste time on last min got a second meetings. Those got a second meetings always happen last min just before I am about to log out. They last sometimes 30 mins to an hour and when demanded OT as per our union agreement she made me feel guilty as if she's paying that from her pocket. I got fed up one day and decided to ask agenda before getting into one. She responded with resounding nothing and I ended up declining respectfully.

1mk77j3,Interviewing after accepting a position?,"Hey y'all, looking for some advice during weird job market times. 

I accepted an offer yesterday for a role that's only funded for a year (with hope but no guarantee to move elsewhere in the org later). Today, I got an interview invitation for a different role that's presumably permanent. Both are great organizations. The one I accepted is smaller and local, but a manager role. The interview is for a nationally recognized org, assistant role.

My questions are:

1. Do I accept the interview? And if so, should I be honest with the interviewer that I accepted another job but convey the potentially temporary nature of my current role?
2. If I really like them and they offer me a job, then what? I don't want to back out of the current role. I like them, I'm invested, and I care about my personal and professional integrity.
3. I've heard the ""always be interviewing"" advice, and I planned to keep applying for the next year just in case. But how do I approach interviews?

Some context: I'm do advocacy / nonprofit work, so job stability is questionable at the best of times. I've also bounced around a LOT, but for reasons that were largely not my fault (bad culture, temporary funding, etc), so I'm a little worried about seeming like a flight risk. And the spaces I work in are really small, so a trustworthy reputation is really important.",unordinarybadger,1,1.0,1,1754589644,2025-08-07 18:00:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mk77j3/interviewing_after_accepting_a_position/,8,2025
1mk6ypy,Stuck in career limbo post-acquisition — how do I rebuild my confidence and move on?,"I’m in a tough spot career-wise and would really appreciate some perspective.

A few years ago, I joined a mid-sized manufacturing company as a business systems analyst. Before that, I was an implementation consultant for SaaS companies. When I started this role, it was everything I was looking for. We reimplemented our ERP, mapped processes, eliminated inefficiencies, and documented everything for the first time. It was high-impact work, and I was thriving. I was promoted to manager, given a small team to manage, and flying high. 

Then about a year and a half ago, we were acquired by a much larger company. It was a portfolio-level merger, not a typical buyout. The two companies came from completely different industries, and honestly, the employees from the acquiring side have made it clear they aren’t thrilled about the integration. There’s no effort to feign excitement. From what I can tell, they see us as less profitable, less efficient, and not worth their time. It often feels like they assume we’re dumb or bad at our jobs, and that attitude has made the transition even more demoralizing.

We had to fold all our newly built processes into the parent company’s existing systems. They already had a full team doing what I used to handle alone across areas like manufacturing, inventory, procurement, and sales. I assumed I’d be laid off after the transition, and honestly, I was okay with that.

But I wasn’t.

Instead, we completed the integration project, and then my two junior level employees were reassigned to other managers, and then my boss, who I had a strong relationship with, resigned. Now I report to her boss from the acquiring company, someone I’ve only had one real conversation with. In that conversation, I said I assumed I’d be let go. He told me I wouldn’t be, not because of my skills or experience, but because they are under a hiring freeze and need to retain headcount.

I’ve been told I’ll eventually be assigned a new role once the department’s new org structure is finalized and approved by the CEO. That has been dragging on for months. In the meantime, I sit in the office all day with no defined responsibilities, no projects, and no training on the new systems. I get occasional questions from coworkers, but I can’t help much because I’m no longer involved in anything operational. I feel like I’ve been quietly pushed out but still expected to be physically present.

To make it harder, I’ve always tied a lot of my self-worth to my job. I loved being the person people came to for answers. But now, without a clear role, I don’t feel relieved. I feel anxious. I have moments of panic where I feel like I could get in trouble for anything, even though I technically don’t have responsibilities right now. I was involved in a lot before the acquisition, and now that no one has told me what I am or am not accountable for, I feel constantly exposed.

I’ve been actively job hunting for months. I’ve had a few interviews, but nothing has worked out yet. The longer this goes on, the more it chips away at my confidence. I’m doing everything I can, but it feels like I’m stuck and slowly fading out of relevance.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you regain your footing or shift your momentum? Would really appreciate any advice or perspective.",Upvotegetter69,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1754589088,2025-08-07 17:51:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mk6ypy/stuck_in_career_limbo_postacquisition_how_do_i/,8,2025
1mk6xvf,Boss says I’m ineligible for rehire because I called off,"Hi all, 

To make a long story short, I recently put in my 2 weeks at a job I worked at for ~6 months because my hours are insane and it’s simply not something I have time for right now. However, I did not want to burn any bridges with this job. 

On Tuesday, I was in Philadelphia to pick up a family member from the airport. I must have picked something up while I was there because Tuesday night and yesterday I was feeling under the weather. I called off yesterday because I work in a hospital and did not want to get any patients sick, and of course to take a day to rest. It was not my last shift- I work again tomorrow and fully intend to be at work tomorrow.

Soon after, I received a message from my boss stating that “calling off during my 2 weeks does not meet the request of a 2 weeks notice to be eligible for rehire within the organization at a later date”. 

This comment seemed a bit like retaliation due to me putting in my 2 weeks notice, and my workplace has a strict no-retaliation policy. In my time there I was a dedicated employee, and while I do not anticipate being employed there again, it is important to me to be eligible for rehire, especially if I aim to use them as a reference. I also asked if there was anything I could do to mend me not being eligible for rehire over 24 hours ago, to which I have not received a response. 

Should I escalate this situation? What should I do?",Parking_Syrup3548,69,0.8600000143051147,92,1754589038,2025-08-07 17:50:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mk6xvf/boss_says_im_ineligible_for_rehire_because_i/,8,2025
1mk6sh7,Stepping down from a leaderships role,"Hi all,

I'm (31M) currently the most senior member of my team, which is made of 3 other colleagues. I work in a department that isn’t the most exciting or interesting, but I do have a decent amount of responsibility and a good work-life balance.

Recently, I’ve been offered a role in another team within a different department. This new role is much more interesting and would allow me to develop new skills that could really strengthen my CV.

However, accepting this offer would mean stepping down from my current leadership position and reporting to another team lead. He’s an okay person (definitely not my favorite in the company) and he’ll be evaluating my performance.

There’s no salary increase at the start, but the potential for higher earnings in the future is very high.

Also, my current role doesn’t involve many hard skills, so it’s been difficult to consider moving to another company—it’s the kind of position that usually develops internally.

I’m inclined to accept the offer because it’s more technical and challenging, but at the same time, I’m very comfortable in my current position. My current boss holds a very senior role and mostly leaves me alone, which gives me a lot of space and freedom.

Have you ever been in a similar situation? Do you have any advice or recommendations?

I made the move mostly to learn something new,not for the money, since the salary increase was like 5% at best (so basically nothing). My previous company had an amazing work-life balance, solid pay, great benefits, and just a good overall vibe. I left thinking I needed to challenge myself more because I’m ambitious by nature… but now I feel like I made a huge mistake.

This new place is just toxic. We have a team lead who’s constantly talking in daily meetings about how he worked late until midnight and finished xyzand the worst part? The management is proud of that behavior. It’s like burnout is a badge of honor here.

In the last 5 months, I’ve been working anywhere from 8 to 12 hours a day, almost every day. The workload is insane, everything is always “high priority,” and we’re such a small team that nothing ever really gets done properly.

I regret leaving my old job so much. It was honestly perfect, and I didn’t realize how good I had it until now.

I live in Madeira Island with my parents, and I’m in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (M29) who is Indian and living in the Netherlands. We’re getting married in India this January, and I plan to move to the Netherlands around April or May next year.

Until then, I’ll be working two part-time jobs — one at the post office and another at a pub — to support myself.

I have a bachelor’s degree in Design and have completed two traineeships: one in graphic design and another in project management and communications. I’m a communicative, easy-going person who genuinely enjoys customer service. I've worked for a year at Pizza Hut (at the airport) and briefly at Sixt, which I left due to harassment.

My goal is to get a 9-to-5, Monday-to-Friday job in the Netherlands so my partner and I can have a similar schedule. Ideally, I’d love something in the creative field, but it’s been tough — I’ve applied for many jobs and faced repeated rejections. Some say I don’t have enough experience; others say it’s because I’m not fluent in Dutch (I only know the basics so far).

I'm hardworking and passionate, but I feel like I can’t make progress while I’m still in Portugal, especially since salaries here are so low.

**My questions are:**

1. Is it possible to get a Monday-to-Friday, 9–5 job in the Netherlands outside the corporate world?
2. Do I really need to learn Dutch to increase my chances?
3. What can I do in the next few months to prepare and improve my opportunities?

I'd really appreciate your best advice on how to move forward.",helloooitsmeeeeee,1,1.0,0,1754580661,2025-08-07 15:31:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mk37t0/feeling_stuck_at_24yo_trying_to_prepare_for_a_new/,8,2025
1mk33qc,Extended Internship offer compensation negotiation,"I’m entering my final year of college and recently received verbal news that my IT internship will be extended into the school year! I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity however I’m not sure if I should speak up about the compensation.

Although I’m just an intern, this summer has shown me that I’ve taken on responsibilities beyond the typical description of the role. I’ve been involved in team projects and even initiated new ones that departments are using.

My manager mentioned that my pay would be increasing by $2 in the extended year. At the time, I thanked him for the update but didn’t express agreement or disagreement to the pay because this is the first professional setting I’ve been in. After telling my family the news, they brought up the idea to negotiate, especially given that I’m performing duties similar to full-time employees at intern pay. They like me to contribute later in the school year. I was going to accept the raise but my family’s words got to my head. Of course my family is bias of course they think I’m a hard worker so they think that but now I’m not sure.

That said, I’m a little nervous about speaking up. I don’t want to come off the wrong way or seem ungrateful. My siblings believe in me and my work ethic, but I’d really appreciate hearing what others think. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you approach it?

1mk2ocf,Should I ask for my old job back?,"Last week I (25F) started a new job and I’m already feeling unsure about it. For context, I work in the field of international higher education recruitment.

I left my previous role after 3+ years for three main reasons:
	•	Money: I was the lowest paid on my team and in our pay band.
	•	Growth: No room for promotion or advancement to a managerial level.
	•	Burnout: I was juggling full-time work, heavy travel, and a master’s program. After finishing my degree, it felt like a natural time to make a change.

I actually really liked my old team and had a great manager who listened to a lot  the concerns I voiced and made changes where she could. The low pay and lack of advancement weren’t really her fault, it had more to do with how the role was structured, since I was based in a different region than the rest of the team.

The new role came with a higher title and a $15K pay bump. On paper, it seemed like a good move. Same field, just at a new institution. But after a week, I’m not loving it. This is my pros/cons list.

Pros:
	•	Exposure to new systems and perspectives
	•	Learning higher-level skills (forecasting, budgeting, event management)
	•	More money

Cons:
	•	The institution feels more corporate than educational. It’s very KPI-driven and less student-focused, which makes the work feel less meaningful.
	•	More office time: It’s hybrid 3 days a week, 9–6. My old job was hybrid 1–2 days a week, 9–5. When I got the new job, I expected it to be 9-5 as well, but they recently got a directive from the higher ups that they need to work until 6 PM.
	•	The team is smaller, and while nice, I’m not sure I fit in. There’s a very noticeable vibe shift when the manager is around, which feels off.

There are other factors too, but those are the big ones. I’m technically still on vacation from my old job for the next week and keep wondering if I should ask for it back. I can’t tell if I’m just overwhelmed from the transition or if this new job truly isn’t right for me.

Any advice? ",pinkzw,1,1.0,1,1754579430,2025-08-07 15:10:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mk2ocf/should_i_ask_for_my_old_job_back/,8,2025

I don’t have any money behind me but my girlfriend said to me today why don’t I look into becoming a Personal Trainer. I’ve been on a fitness journey myself the last 1.5 years and I’ve learned a lot in that time and being in the gym is somewhere I love being. 

Im just wondering if anyone has any advice for someone wanting to change career completely. I know personal training isn’t something that is sustainable as a steady income straight away and you have to build your way up from the bottom but will the risk of leaving a £500 a week job to start over again worth it if I’m not happy.

1mk2m7s,Advice on job-hopping to improve salary?,"Hey all,

I’ve always struggled to find a career that really fits me. Around 70% of my past roles have been retail based, but I’ve finally got lucky and moved into something more specialized recruitment marketing. I handle reports, run & optimize campaigns, build proposals, and manage a very hefty workload, but I'm financially struggling a bit.

The thing is, I’m still stuck in the bottom 10 25% salary bracket (\~£24.9k/year), (See the imgur for 2024's average annual salary brackets https://imgur.com/a/xlrabLr)  
And honestly? It feels god awful. I’m trying my best to improve my financial situation and long term progression, and I’ve noticed a lot of people seem to increase their salary by job hopping even within a year or two.

I’ve started learning software engineering in my free time, but it’s a long road, and I don't think i'm that intelligent, so will take me some time to land a entry level role.

So I’m wondering:

* What fields or roles are easiest to “hop” between to level up pay?
* How do you handle the anxiety of switching jobs if the other job backs out at the last second and you're stuck unable to pay rent?
* What if you keep applying but nothing lands? How do you deal with that mentally?
* Any success stories from others who broke out of low-income work this way?

Any advice, especially from people who’ve made jumps from similar pay levels, would really mean a lot.

To start my husband has had this job for 2 years now, fairly hard working. put his efforts to use kinda guy. When he got the job he informed them he smokes weed and was ensured that would not be a problem.(I don't think he emailed about it cause he is reluctant to paper trails and that ""extra"" work) He indeed failed his drug test and was still hired. 

Now 2 years later he recently bumped something with his hilo no damages no pain just bumped! They told him over phone he was being sent to the clinic to ensure he was ok. I told him send and email but to my avail he trusts companies to much. Low and behold he was sent for a surprise drug test no physical exam... Failing for weed again like the first time he is now told do rehab or loose his job. Mind you we are in Michigan at will hire fire bull crap. But this feels like it should be on the company not him.

1mk1lmi,How do you deal with the pressure to be “fake nice” at work?,"Hi everyone,
I’m doing an internship right now and trying to understand how workplace communication works  especially when it comes to being “polite” or “diplomatic.”

Sometimes, when I ask questions just to understand something better, people say I’m arguing or overthinking. I don’t mean to argue I genuinely just want clarity. But I keep getting told things like, “Don’t ask too much,” or “Just do what you’re told.” That makes me feel like asking questions itself is seen as wrong, which is frustrating because I thought asking was part of learning.

Another thing I don’t fully understand is why I’m expected to reply to every polite message, even when it feels unnecessary. For example, if someone texts, “Thanks” or “See you tomorrow,” people say I should reply with something like “Thank you” or “Sure!”  even if I don’t really feel like it. They say it’s basic etiquette and part of playing the corporate game.

But my question is:
If I don’t feel like replying, and if I’ve already acknowledged things in person, why should I still respond over chat? Is it okay to leave it unread, or does that come off as unprofessional?

I’m not trying to be disrespectful. I just don’t want to be fake. I want to be authentic while also understanding how to function in a work environment. Is being diplomatic about doing small things even when you don’t feel them? Or is there space for neutral silence?

Would appreciate your perspectives  especially from those who’ve interned or worked in similar environments.

Hey,help me decide. So I had to choose whether BSED chem or bsn. 
I'm a incoming sophomore in BSED chem in a high standard school, tuition free and quality teaching. If I plan on continuing this course I will probably continue my side line and invest on it and able to save some money to travel my family in other places in the Philippines. My parents is a vegetable vendor, I had a sister who has work and my older bro that is still in college 4th yr plus his in private uni and I'm the THIRD and I have two other younger brother one grade 5 and one is grade 3. 

Since I've been sometimes want to continue nursing I sometimes find myself, find ways to find uni that is affordable that my parents can afford, every after one semester I find my self longing for it but sometimes not. So I enroll myself in BSN BUT this school is not that high standard they only have two building which is kinda weird but they have a bg of 30% passing rate for bsn which is probably not but plus they are affordable though in we only have 3 rooms available which in this rooms we are almost 100+ students inside and we can like probably talk to each other and do some cheating if you want(but I wouldn't since I want to take it seriously) they don't have a quality but I cant complain cuz they are very affordable but almost all the students there is not christians so I really needed to Isolate myself but I do have some friends like freshmen's. And right now idk what course to continue. If I continue nursing my parents will struggles like they have to work hard for me and I kinda feel guilty for it OR should I continue being a BSED chem though I may sometimes cry for it thinking about the future.

IF everything goes well, I should graduate in mid 2026, although I’ll likely be a few months behind schedule. 

The thing is: I'm still passionate about what I'm studying, but I don't think my degree will take me far. Political science is a mix of History, Economics, Statistics, Sociology, ecc. without diving deep into none of them. This method is useful for those aiming a future in diplomacy/institutions. But for someone like me, who isn’t pursuing that path, it ends up being just a blend of general knowledge. 

Now: I’m closer to 30 than 20, I’ve almost run out stamina as a student and I want to change my life and start building a career. Right now, I work a super basic job at a movie theater that barely earns me €10k a year (which is the reason why I still live with my parents).

1mjz4v8,Deployed an AI SaaS using Azure Static Web App → Azure Functions → Azure Foundry – Here's the full setup - FirstImpressionai.app,"# How I Vibe-Engineered FirstImpressionAI: From Idea to Scalable, Secure SaaS Product

\#saas #azure #ai #security #career

Hey, I’m Divin!

A while ago, I was helping a mate apply for jobs—and watched him drown in resume tweaks, endlessly trying to tailor his resume to vague job descriptions. He spent hours crafting cover letters without knowing if his experience even aligned with what the role needed. That’s when it hit me: there has to be a smarter, faster, more personalized way to do this.

I'm a cybersecurity engineer and indie developer based in Victoria, Australia. I love building products that help people, especially when those products leverage smart technology and a security-first mindset. Today, I want to share my journey building FirstImpressionAI—a SaaS product designed to make the job application process painless and effective through smart resume-to-job match analysis.

# FirstImpressionAI – What's the Vibe?

https://preview.redd.it/6h0e2y1r5ygf1.png?width=2700&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec26117bc0fb29d6a00e2c54a57bcadea925c198

FirstImpressionAI is an AI-powered application that lets users effortlessly create tailored, impactful cover letters and instantly analyzes how well their resumes align with specific job descriptions. What makes it unique is our smart resume-job match analysis, powered by GPT-4o. This feature became the heartbeat of the app.

https://preview.redd.it/6ohau8iu5ygf1.png?width=2648&format=png&auto=webp&s=62e466e803242b54426846422d8f0a9e277f0d7c

This isn’t just another ChatGPT wrapper. The smart matching became our secret sauce—giving users real, actionable insights they can't get anywhere else. It’s like having a career coach and hiring manager rolled into one AI experience.

More than the feature set, FirstImpressionAI embodies something I call **""Vibe Engineering.""**

# What is Vibe Engineering?

“Vibe Engineering” is more than a method—it’s a mindset. It's about building software where creativity, AI collaboration, and technical intuition guide every decision. From architecture to UI flow, from security to scalability, I let the vibe—and the data—lead.

This involved:

* 🧠 **Vibe Software Development:** I wasn’t just coding—I was collaborating with AI. I used GPT to help shape the UX and UI, refactor logic, and explore component structures that made the product feel right.
* ⚙️ **Vibe Infrastructure Engineering:** I co-designed a production-grade cloud architecture with AI's help—no shortcuts.
* 🔐 **Vibe Security Engineering:** With my cybersecurity background, security wasn’t an afterthought. I ran AI-assisted pentests, modeled threats across the app flow, and built security into the foundation.

https://preview.redd.it/04gib0ln5ygf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=dda8a18d20143555ec846fceab27a8e36f65809d

# Why I Skipped MVPs and Built for Scale

Here’s my controversial take: building a scalable, production-ready product takes about the same time as building a “quick and dirty” MVP. The real difference is whether you plan smartly and build with the future in mind.

With Azure’s serverless infrastructure and a security-first mentality, I had:

* ✅ Auto-scaling baked in from day one
* ✅ Enterprise-grade security
* ✅ A clean, maintainable codebase
* ✅ Zero technical debt

Security and scale shouldn’t be afterthoughts—they should be your foundation.

# Tech Stack and Architecture – Built to Last

FirstImpressionAI is hosted entirely on Azure and designed to be production-grade from launch:

* **Azure Static Web App:** Global CDN + performant React frontend.
* **Azure Functions:** Serverless backend logic with GPT processing.
* **Azure Foundry:** Seamless GPT deployment, no DevOps headache.
* **Supabase:** Robust authentication and PostgreSQL database.
* **Stripe:** Easy, secure payments.

Here’s the simplified deployment:

    az staticwebapp create \
        --name FirstImpressionAI \
        --resource-group production-rg \
        --source https://github.com/
        --location ""Australia East"" \
        --branch main

# Security-First Mindset – From Day Zero

With my cybersecurity background, a ""security-first"" mentality was baked into every layer:

* 🔐 JWT-based authentication via Supabase
* ⚠️ API rate limiting at Azure Function level
* 🧹 Input sanitization + validation for all AI inputs
* 🛡️ Encrypted storage with automated backups
* 📉 AI-assisted vulnerability scans + threat modeling
* 📈 Real-time monitoring and alerting

This not only saved future rework but gave users immediate confidence.

# Growth Strategy – No Gimmicks, Just Sharing

My best marketing? Being real and building in public:

* 📹 YouTube walkthroughs of the smart match feature
* 📝 Blog posts about the architecture and vibe process
* 🤝 Active in dev forums, LinkedIn, and Reddit—sharing insights, not just links

It’s been organic but energizing. Turns out, when you solve a real pain with solid engineering, word spreads.

# Monetization – Clean and Honest

From day one:

* ✅ Free tier with 3 generations to feel the magic
* 💳 Paid tiers via Stripe for unlimited access and features

The conversion rates have been encouraging because the value is immediate.

# Future Enhancements – More Vibes Coming

* 📄 **ATS-Friendly Resumes** based on match analysis
* 📊 **Analytics Dashboards** to track your job fit trends
* 🤖 **Interview Prep AI** with custom question generators
* 🤝 **Recruiter Tools** and a 2-sided job marketplace

# Final Thoughts – Let’s Build the Future of Job Hunting

This project has been my creative playground, my technical dojo, and my passion in motion. I’d love to hear what you think—whether you're a job seeker, developer, or just curious about building with AI.

1mjyong,How to ask for a larger raise?,"I worked for a company for 3 years, rising up in roles as I went, until I was able to be a sales director. I won't mention the industry, but typically, there's only sales guy per location. My sales slumped after a year in that role, and I was very politely let go. They even said they wish they had another position for me somewhere else because of other skills, but policy dictated this. I didn't burn a bridge. 

A year and a half later, I was ready to leave the job I'd taken elsewhere, and saw a position for assistant sales director at one of my old company's largest properties. It's one of the few needing two people. I reached out and the VP of Sales was like ""We would love you back!"" I got the job. Now, we're the management group specifically, but then the business has an owner. The management group offered me 6K more as an assistant in my offer letter, but the owners lowballed and for the last year I made $1000 less than I did last time. I'm much closer to home so no big deal. The VP did say ""we can review that in time"".

I just submitted my yearly self-review to my boss and the site boss. My boss is also the regional sales director and has been gone a lot overseeing the newest site we're operating. Its floundering. He fired their sales person, and that job posting is listed at 16K more than I make. Meanwhile, I'm holding down the fort successfully at the big site while he's gone, and I've had a ton of sales success before that too. My boss also wants me to start helping him at the other site as well to right the proverbial ship.

So my question is, how do I navigate a substantial raise. 3-4 percent would only bring me to what I made for the company 3 years ago. I feel like if I've impacted the sales of an office with twice as much distribution as the one that's struggling, I should be getting paid a lot closer to what they're gonna pay the new person of that one once they hire. Get me past what I was once offered last summer at least.",reddit_userMN,1,0.6700000166893005,21,1754569574,2025-08-07 12:26:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjyong/how_to_ask_for_a_larger_raise/,8,2025
1mjyme8,Advice on career choices so far (engineering),"Hi all, this might be long winded but I just want to get the entire story out to get some relevant advice.

I've been spiraling about some career choices and have realised I've made a few 'emotional' decisions in the past. I graduated in 2023 and at this point I had been working as structural engineer for 2 years at a very large consultancy that caused me to be so overworked and unhappy. There was minimal guidance and mentorship, coupled with being thrown in the deep end - this caused me to begin hating being a structural engineer and lead to my resignation.

I escaped to a role that paid almost twice as much in government in a completely unrelated discipline. I've been here for a year and a half now and have been doing some tutoring at a neighboring university for structural engineering subjects, just for some variety in life. And my goodness I have built the love back up! I had a professor talk me into a funded phd (4 year program) and I thought i was happy in this direction (it's been about 6 months and I'm still working that government job full time). It's a cross-disciplinary project so it's really keeping me on my toes.

Now, as I have build my way up into different courses, leading into building design, I have realized I really love structures and I let one company kind of ruin it for me. I love teaching it so much too. Although, I am faced with a few tutors who are professionals questioning why the hell I am going down the phd route - it's so looked down on in industry and it's really making me second guess myself. If i liked structures should I not just work as one? did i mess up trying out different things? I just needed to escape that first job so badly.

I actually ran into my old manager and she had the same sentiments, telling me that it's a silly decision for doing it and that at least i have some work experience from them to lean on when i finish- it was so condescending and humiliating.

I don't really know what to do from here - i feel crappy about the phd, leaving structures, not sure what to do. is it truly a waste if i finish the phd and then go back to working? I'll probably be 27-28 when i finish the phd for a time-line reference.

Thanks for any advice.",Zealousideal-Tie1739,1,1.0,0,1754569395,2025-08-07 12:23:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjyme8/advice_on_career_choices_so_far_engineering/,8,2025
1mjyk3c,would it be okay to apply in behalf of someone? (With consent),"hi!!

so context, my boyfriend of 2 years is working in telecom and it’s just a very dangerous and hectic job. the problem is the workplace and people, he’s kind of manipulated and he had to work 12hrs a day for 6 days. so he doesn’t really have much time to apply! and if he stops, he’s also the breadwinner. 

i kinda feel bad for him and he also wants to have another job but he’s just been stuck with this. god i hate slave labor in ME :( 

so i figured i will learn his job and role and make a Linkedin & resume out of that and if i find a job (because i am applying too) i can send that to him and if he liked it, i can help him apply. 

its just that he also have to drive for so long aside from his actual job so it’s just physically and mentally impossible for him to apply.

would this be ethical or okay? ",carabelliza,1,0.6700000166893005,6,1754569217,2025-08-07 12:20:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjyk3c/would_it_be_okay_to_apply_in_behalf_of_someone/,8,2025

1mjyaln,"Regretful, unsure, overthinking.","I guess I’ll start with a background:

I have a bachelors in accounting and currently work in the accounting field. I have held several positions, but nothing in management so far because I kept switching companies (better pay, the company I was working for relocated farther away, etc.).

About two years ago, I decided to do the alternative route and get my masters in teaching (K-5). I substituted between jobs and really enjoyed it; got to learn things about classroom management, how the daily flow goes, etc. I got through nearly half of the program, but I left the program because at the time, I was still unsure of my path, and the hours I needed in observing the classroom exceeded what I could do. I got a job full-time, and while that job was flexible, I couldn’t miss out on all of those hours of pay while observing. I also know that the PRAXIS takes many hours of study, and I simply couldn’t do it at the time.

I was content for a while, but now I’m losing sleep again and can’t think straight. I’m not dissatisfied with my current position (in accounting), but it is not fulfilling either. I can throw on a movie while doing my desk work, but sometimes, that takes a toll on me because I am a person who needs to keep busy and not overthink about life. I keep a cloud over me because I have many regrets professionally, and if I could’ve just went into teaching when I was younger/fresh in college, I wouldn’t be having this issue. So, I’m discouraging myself because I’m older than people who are starting out teaching right now, and if I wanted to pick the MAT program back up, I would have to work out the observation hours. My current job pays well (for my area, at least), but while they are flexible, I cannot take hours to observe classrooms. If they found out, I may even get fired.

Here’s what I have been thinking: make it my goal by 35 to get ahold of my finances, get things paid down, throw money in savings while I’m potentially student teaching. If I am not happy in 5 years with what I am doing, go back to school for teaching (maybe elementary, maybe math, maybe even business). However, I can’t help but feel “down” because I’ve already wasted so many years of my life, and I’m about to waste more. By that time, I will be much older than those coming into the profession. Maybe I am overthinking it, or maybe it’s the fact that I’m turning 30 and am not proud of myself/have nothing to show for my years besides an accounting degree that I really can’t serve a purpose with. 

It’s worth mentioning that it’s extremely hard to get a teaching job in this area, especially in elementary education. I’ve seen many people become discouraged through the process and even went on to find something else in a different field. Job security also scares me because you can be replaced very easily. I’m not really interested in relocating because all of my family lives here and I don’t want to leave them, so this makes it tougher.

I don’t know. I just feel discouraged and unsure professionally right now and needed to vent. Maybe it’s hitting me so hard right now because school just went back into session and I’m seeing all of the teacher posts. I’m sorry this post is such a mess, and it may not even make much sense, but I’m just looking for advice from anyone who is going through/went through a similar situation with their career. What helped you feel more fulfilled? Any tips on potentially transitioning? Literally anything is appreciated, even if it is not what I want to hear but need to hear. If it sounds like I’m very confused, it’s because I am.

Thanks. ",JustWantingAdvicexo,2,1.0,2,1754568438,2025-08-07 12:07:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjyaln/regretful_unsure_overthinking/,8,2025
1mjxsvq,Being forced into executive assistant role + toxic VP targeting my appearance - need resignation advice,"Hello everyone.

I (30F) started working at an organization about 6 months ago in an entry to mid level Communications role.

Some context about me: I’m a creative writer passionate about writing, editing, digital media, and storytelling. I recently got a Masters in a related field and have had my writing published in well-known outlets. However, for 5+ years I felt stuck in back-to-back administrative assistant roles.

I was grateful for the opportunity at my current company to pivot away from being an admin assistant and move towards my ideal career path in Communications. My immediate team, including both my managers, were excited and supportive from Day 1. I was hired with the understanding that I would primarily be doing Communications work and building my creative portfolio, while occasionally doing admin duties on the side if needed.

However, red flags began popping up shortly after starting.

In my first week, I learned there was major beef between organization members, mainly with the new Vice President, my boss’s boss who leads the company. We’ll call them M.

M was hired shortly before I was, leading to organizational changes that many staff have been extremely unhappy with and resentful about. (M is also a huge micromanager who patronizes staff and often brings people to tears.)

To sum things up without going too into detail, the office politics have festered during my 6 months here.

I was optimistic at first, but things only got worse.

Recently, M has been searching for an executive assistant. This has been a grueling process for everyone involved, due to M’s particularities and nitpickiness. For perspective, M even pressured an employee to interview candidates DURING THE SAID EMPLOYEE’S MATERNITY LEAVE.

During this process, M somehow decided I would be their temporary executive assistant. For months, I’ve been managing their calendar, setting up meetings, and even cleaning up their trash on top of the Communications duties I was hired to do. They clearly feel entitled to have me as their personal assistant with no pay increase or acknowledgment.

Fortunately my direct managers have been understanding and apologetic. My manager even told me, “I’m sorry. I know you didn’t sign up for this.”

But the final straw happened today.

M passed feedback to my managers, others in the senior leadership team, and her new assistant (yes, she finally hired someone but continues using me to schedule meetings, etc) that I’m no longer allowed to wear t-shirts because they’re upset my shirts “ride up,” exposing my lower back when I sit at my desk. Other complaints were made around my productivity, responsiveness, and work ethic that even my manager outwardly disagreed with and was skeptical about.

I’m humiliated. My direct manager was so uncomfortable passing this along, she shared it with HR first. Apparently M’s new assistant has been sharing opinions about my clothing and making false claims about my Slack responsiveness, which even my manager acknowledged to be untrue.

This is also a casual, largely remote workplace where people dress casually even at senior levels. I’m careful about dressing appropriately and have never worn jeans due to professionalism concerns. There was no precedent for this new wardrobe regulation — I have no problem dressing formally, but this is so fucked and I feel I am being targeted. (Moreover, my shirts are nice, minimal cotton tops, not tacky tees).

This issue was never raised before, much less through this messed up game of telephone.

I feel disrespected and disgusted with leadership here. I’ve experienced workplace abuse before and am getting flashbacks… I know how this goes.

I’ve decided to submit my resignation letter and speak to my manager tomorrow morning. They’ve been subtly supportive of me pursuing opportunities elsewhere and shown embarrassment at how things have unfolded. I’ve given my all to this job.

I need advice on addressing this with my manager and tips for the resignation process. M has my personal phone number and tends to call people after/during drama, so I’m worried they’ll expect me to explain my reasoning. I’m unsure what I should or shouldn’t say if they reach out.

I’ve never quit a job before and would appreciate advice. Also validation would be good, because despite how messed up this situation is, I still gaslight myself into thinking maybe I’m being stupid quitting without another job lined up.

But I KNOW this will only get worse and affect my mental health.

Any advice is welcome and appreciated. Please be kind. I’m struggling right now.

———————

TLDR: Toxic VP forcing me to be unpaid executive assistant for months despite being hired for Communications. Final straw: complained about my “inappropriate” t-shirts in casual, nearly fully remote workplace because they are not blouses and “ride up” when I sit. Never quit before - need advice on resignation process since VP calls employees during drama.",bootypop_69,1,0.6000000238418579,4,1754566995,2025-08-07 11:43:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjxsvq/being_forced_into_executive_assistant_role_toxic/,8,2025

1mjwnza,What would you do? /Sorry for spamming,"**NOT USA / EU**

I graduated with a BA in Architectural Engineering mid 2018, but haven't worked a day as an architect, and rather, *for the past 7 years of my career,* I worked with an agency that kept shifting focus with time.  


I have experience in Social Media management and some light Digital Marketing, Media monitoring, and News Analytics, creating dashboards with Looker Studio and doing light data analysis *-no coding-* and I  also created websites *-functional and actually good-* using WordPress, and also dabbled in Event management as well.

  
Financially, I'm doing well *-for the country I'm from-*, but now that I'm 31 years old with 7 years of work experience, I'm getting worried. My worries are that if I ever get laid off, I wouldn't be appealing to any other company because rarely they would be looking for someone with my experience -or lack thereof-, I mean, Yes I do digital marketing functions but I am no digital marketer, yes I do dashboards and analyze data and news, but I am no data analyst, yes I make websites, but I am no website developer... You get the point.

My colleagues and friends say that I shouldn't be worried, and that the diverse work I did qualifies me to manage projects/teams/products. While I stand more skeptical and a little afraid, because while I am truly a jack of all trades, I am a master of none, my value to the ""small"" company I work in comes solely from my ability to adapt to changes and pick up new skills ""with enough functionality and quality to deliver projects and keep clients happy"".

  
**I asked some people from my social circle, and the advice I got was as follows:**

* Choose a work area I really like and develop a specialty in it (Marketing/ Creating websites/ Analytics). *That sounds good since I have a good footing in working on those projects, but at 31 years old, I'm afraid that if I start to learn and specialize in technical stuff, it would take me too long. ""I have no programming skills or knowledge""*
* Another recommendation was to **get an MBA** since I dabble in various stuff and have worked on various projects, which would cement and organize my management skills. An MBA would be an actual asset, given that I have true experience and am not a fresh graduate.
* Another recommendation was to get PMP certification, for the same reason above, but given that PMP is cheaper, valuable/credible, and I can get it faster.
* The last advice was more of an observation, actually, which is that my skills are boiling under Communications management, and therefore I should look into getting a master's in communications, and maybe build a career as a communications manager.

1mjw5wc,My Boss Suddenly Hates Me,"I work for a k12 school district as tech support. We had a technician from an elementary building resign. 

They coincidentally resigned right before my 30th birthday. My boss sent a personnel update letting us know about the departure of the other building tech and arranged a lunch for their last day. Well their last day was my 30th birthday, so the Tuesday before I sent an email letting him know I was taking a vacation day for the big 3-0! He approved and wished me a happy 30th. 

Everything seemed well until the Thursday before my birthday. He sends me an email letting me know that there will be a meeting on the upcoming Monday to discuss a position location change. Which killed me completely. He also assured that I was welcome to a union rep. 

My 30th birthday destroyed and then having to brace for the meeting. 

He brings in his new boss and says historical data shows that the other building has more tickets and they are moving a seasoned vet over there. Meaning me. No appraisal of my skills, no discipline, not anything but despair. I pleaded how much I love my current position but he told me to pack up and move effective immediately. He was very angry and red throughout the interview. 

I explained that I couldn’t be moved because it would cause a disruption in the workplace as I have dated someone in the community who has her kids on that side of the district. 

All of which were refuted. I too am a person of color and normally people of color are sent to this building to either be terminated soon or forced to resign. I hear a lot of racism and rumors of discrimination. 

I’m not sure what to do but my boss burned a bridge then took a 3-Day vacation while I’m breaking down probably having a mental episode as I’ve been here for 8 years with no discipline whatsoever. Being forced to a building with a high turnover rate is so nerve wrecking to me, I just don’t know what to do!

1mjvfwa,Framework to evaluate a role,"Hi all, I put together this very simple framework to assess if a job is a good fit for you (either your current one, or a new one).

Here it is:  


|Lever|Importance (H/M/L)|Assessment (job 1)|Assessment (job n)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Passion for the role|High|||
|Stress level|High|||
|Time management (control)|High|||
|Salary|High|||
|Benefits and perks|Medium|||
|Team mood / culture|Medium|||
|Relationship with boss|Medium|||
|Career growth potential|Low|||
|Learning opportunities|Low|||
|Company situation|Low|||

You can rate the assessment whatever way you want: I ussually keep it simple, from +1 (positive) to 0 (neutral) to -1 (negative). Then, if I am comparing jobs, I compare their sums at the end. You can even multiply for its importance level, to factor that in.  
Of course, you can add/remove levers and change their respective importance.

1mjummb,Advice/thoughts on my degree choice,"Hi everyone, I'm 26 and feeling a bit lost in life. When I was 22, I seriously tried getting into art, specifically concept art, and I was also open to UI/UX design. I was passionate about it, but over time, I let people discourage me. I kept hearing that art isn’t a ""real"" career, so I gave it up and decided to pursue computer science and software development instead.

I do enjoy working at a computer, and with all the hype around tech and coding, it seemed like the smart and stable choice. Since then, I’ve been learning to code and studying math to prepare for a CS degree.

But to be honest, I don’t think I like it.  
I’ve gone to interviews, taken math classes, and tried to push through, but it just doesn’t click. And I feel that I don’t want to because it's not what I want to do. What I really enjoy is creating, building worlds, and telling stories through visuals. I know that might sound childish, but it’s the only thing I’ve ever really felt passionate about.

1mjujmr,Here’s how to ACTUALLY use chatgpt to tailor your resume,"Hey everyone, I recently asked this subreddit on how annoying it is to use chatgpt to tailor your resume since it likes to hallucinate a lot, and I got a lot of insights

I’ve been using this prompt I made based on everyone’s feedback, and I can see a significant difference in the amount of time saved, quality, and callbacks I’m getting. 

I want to share this prompt with everyone and hear what you guys have to say about it. 

Here's the prompt:
You are a Resume Alignment Strategist.

Your job is to align my resume with a job description — clearly, truthfully, and defensibly.

I will give you:

My resume (pasted below)

A job description (pasted below)

Using those two inputs, do the following:

Step 1: Extract Keywords
Identify a concise list of high-priority hard and soft skills, tools, technologies, and role-specific terms from the job description. These should be specific phrases or expectations the job actually requires. Group them into:

Soft Skills

Hard Skills & Tools

Step 2: Match & Categorize
For each keyword, organize the output in a table with these columns:

✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ (match status)

Keyword / Requirement

Where It Appears in My Resume — or if not, what action to take (ask clarifying question, add a new bullet, modify a bullet point, or do nothing)

Ask YES/NO clarifying questions where needed (e.g., if something is implied but not proven).
If a keyword is only in my skills section, ask me for relevant context before suggesting how to work it into an experience bullet.

Be specific, structured, and easy to read.
Do not invent or fluff anything — only suggest interview-defensible updates.
Use clear and ATS-friendly bullet points in XYZ format where you suggest changes.

Your job is not to ""enhance"" — it's to truthfully align.

→ Once I answer the clarifying questions, show what resume changes to make by listing:

The original bullet (if any)

The updated bullet

Whether it’s a new addition or a modification
—------------------------------------—------------------------------------—----------------------------------------------

What this prompt does is that it actually allows you to confirm which keywords are being added or modified to your resume with targeted, personalized questions to help you out. 

Without this, chatgpt likes to hallucinate and add keywords to your resume that you don’t actually have any experience with. If you still found the process annoying, I found tools like jobsuit ai that does a pretty good job as well

If you can find a way that’s more optimal than this, please let me know! Hope this can help you guys out with your job search!",Frosty_Vermicelli_25,1,1.0,1,1754555369,2025-08-07 08:29:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjujmr/heres_how_to_actually_use_chatgpt_to_tailor_your/,8,2025
1mjuiuz,"[Free Career Coaching] After 10+ Years Climbing the Corporate Ladder, I'm Now Helping Others Do the Same — Offering Free 1:1 Career Coaching","Hi everyone,



After spending over a decade navigating — and climbing — the corporate ladder across multiple industries and leadership roles, I’ve decided it’s time to give back in a more personal and impactful way.



Throughout my career, I’ve led high-performing teams, coached individuals into careers they never thought possible, helped individual contributors get the recognition they deserve, and sat on countless promotion panels. I know what managers, executives, and decision-makers actually look for — and more importantly, how to position yourself strategically to stand out and move up.



I’m now transitioning into a career coaching — with a particular focus on:



Helping professionals get promoted or pivot into leadership roles



Building influence and visibility inside organizations



Developing skills that truly matter for upward mobility



Navigating politics, performance reviews, and internal growth opportunities



Crafting growth roadmaps that actually work



To kick things off, I’m offering free 1:1 coaching sessions (45 to 90 minutes) to the first few people who reach out. No catch — just a genuine offer to help. If you’re someone who’s:



\- Stuck at a career plateau

\- Eying a promotion but not sure how to position yourself

\- Struggling with confidence or visibility at work

\- Looking for a tailored plan to accelerate your growth



…then I’d love to help.



Just shoot me a DM or comment below, and we’ll set something up. I’ll only be taking on a small handful of these free calls for now (while I have the bandwidth), so spots are limited.



Whether you're early in your career or in management and aiming higher — let’s talk.

1mjt8cc,50k to invest. What business to become self employed,"I have 12 yoe in management up to C level. Mainly in life science industries. I studied business and hold an MBA. I am located in Germany. 

But I am tired of that corporate shit. 

I also launched a Shopify store (not too successful), know the basics of python programming and am currently writing a book (novel). I also did lots of home renovations by myself, like parquet make over, paint jobs, balcony flooring, etc.

I would say I am pretty versatile and can dig myself into a field that catches my interest. 

I am more looking for a local business (no restaurant/cafe) that has a lower entry barrier (no formal education required), but is still capable of upscaling and has a good return. 
The other option is to start an online business. But not as a service provider to compete against fiver/Upwork guys. More a remote consulting opportunity.

1mjsmck,First Job,"Just started my first job as a management trainee at a startup (sustainability). So there is no structured training. Every day I get new tasks and I do get clear instructions on what to do but sometimes what I deliver is different from what they expect. It’s not always wrong but it’s just not the way they usually do things here or they want in their way.  
Since this is my first job I am also wondering if the expectations are usually this way or if it’s different in other places. I’m not sure what to expect and that makes it more confusing.  
I talked to my manager and told them I need more help at least for the next 2 months since I have only been here for 1.5 months. My manager said they could help but there were some conditions (try to bring a figure it out mindset attention to detail take clear instructions).  
I asked if we can have a detailed feedback meeting every week but they said it might not be possible because too busy have to arrange it myself and give them a heads up.

I have made a couple of mistakes and stupid ones and even a few blunders with that meeting minute task. Now I am scared of making mistakes even basic ones like spelling errors when I show my work.  
There is this constant fear and pressure of doing well or what they are expecting out of me I am not able to deliver. My team is not mean but I just do not feel comfortable. When I work I feel scared instead of relaxed and this fear makes it harder for me to do good work. I feel if I do wrong they'll judge me and of course they do but that is just making me even more sad.  
I want to do my best but I feel I need more time and support. For e.g.. I have never done meeting minutes before but they put me in an 8hr meeting and asked me to write detailed notes. I felt lost and I wasn’t sure if I did it right.  
Now I am questioning if this is even a good place for me to learn and grow or if this is just how startups are. How do I figure this out? How can I learn and become better in this job especially since this program is only for 10 to 11 months? I feel really confused and would want some advice from anyone who has been in a job like this or the first job experience.",Substantial_Taste920,1,1.0,1,1754548023,2025-08-07 06:27:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjsmck/first_job/,8,2025
1mjslzf,Software engineer career advice,"Hey

I’m a self-taught software engineer from Eastern Europe and have been working in the field for about 7 years. Lately, I’ve been thinking about my next move and I’m stuck between two options:
	1.	Doing an online Master’s in AI, Data Science, or something similar from a solid university (like Georgia Tech)
	2.	Continuing to teach myself more advanced computer science topics on my own
       3. Open to hearing other paths too

AI/Data Science is still pretty new to me, so I feel like having a structured program with real guidance would help a lot. Plus, having a degree from a well-known school could be a nice boost to my resume.

On the flip side, when it comes to general CS stuff, I already know a good amount and have a clear idea of what I’m missing. So self-study might be a faster and more focused way to fill those gaps without going over things I already understand.

Long-term, I want to be in high demand as an engineer—either at a great company or running something of my own. I enjoy software engineering and I’m sure Ill enjoy AI/Data Science, so I’d love to keep growing in both areas.

1mjsfa5,Career Advice: PhD vs Industry Job (PLC Programmer/Nuclear Power Plant)?,"Hi Reddit,  
I'm from Central Europe and currently finishing my Master's degree in automation, measurement, and cybernetics. For the past 4 years, I've worked part-time as a PLC programmer.

Recently, I received an offer to pursue a PhD focused on R&D for gas detectors (material engineering))—essentially continuing my Master's thesis, which involved programming control systems for testing gas detectors.

I have 6–8 months to decide, and I’m torn between two paths:

**PhD Path (Pros & Cons):**  
**Pros:**

* 4–5 more years in academia
* Salary similar to a junior PLC programmer
* Cheap rent during PhD
* Interesting research (I enjoy teaching and R&D)
* Already worked with the potential PhD supervisors on several projects over the last 3 years—great collaboration and positive experience
* Did my Bachelor's thesis with the same team, and it was very successful

**Cons:**

* After PhD, I’ll likely need to live in a big city for job opportunities
* Long-term, I’d prefer to settle in a smaller town
* Not sure if 4 years of PhD experience equals 4 years of industry experience

**Industry Path (Pros & Cons):**

**Pros:**

* Potentially higher salary after 4 years
* More flexibility in choosing where to live
* Found an interesting job at a nuclear power plant (travel involved, which I’m okay with)

**Cons:**

* Rent is much higher outside academia
* Might miss out on deeper research and teaching opportunities

**My Dilemma:**

* I enjoy research and teaching, but I value living in a smaller city long-term
* Money isn’t the main factor for the first 2 years—both paths offer similar pay
* I’m unsure whether a PhD will give me better career leverage than 4 years of industry experience
* The nuclear power plant job sounds exciting, but I don’t want to rush into it
* I’ve had a great experience working with the PhD supervisors already, which makes the academic path more appealing
* I’m also thinking long-term: after around 8 years, I’d like to start a family and settle down. I wonder how different the outcomes are depending on whether I choose the PhD or go straight into industry. Which path offers better stability, flexibility, and work-life balance when family becomes a priority?

**Has anyone faced a similar choice?**  
Would you recommend going for the PhD or jumping into industry now?  
Is a PhD in this field (automation/cybernetics/gas detection) worth it long-term?  
How did your career path affect your ability to start a family and settle down?

1mjscbl,What should I do?,"I have been at my current job in professional sports for the past 6 years. I have talked to my bosses 3 times in the past 2 months about getting a promotion (literally just a manager title not even talking about a raise) as I have managed our staff for the past 5 years while our Sr. Manager sits back. They missed 4 months of work earlier in the year and I picked up their responsibilities plus mine. 

Well recently I was approached by a friend in the industry about a potential opportunity where I would be the internal top candidate.  It pays $20k more with added responsibilities but maybe a worse work life balance. 

I also recently applied for a managerial job with my old employer and have a first round virtual interview soon.  

I am very close with all my current co-workers and bosses. I view them as a second family and even invited them all to my wedding a few years back. Since we are close should I tell them about these 2 potential and very realistic possibilities? 

Currently I make $73k and both jobs would be $90k +. All I truly want is a 10% raise and the job title/recognition I deserve. If I were to get my standard 4% raise we are talking an extra $4k + some fancy words for a title. I feel like it is extremely reasonable given that I have 10 years of experience in the field, two bachelor's and a master's degree. Do you think I should say something to try and lite a fire or keep quiet until I progress further in the interview process for both?

1mjsakb,I prepare Korean 7th Civil Services. Please advise me.,"* I am Korean. and I live at the one of near-Seoul areas.

I prepare The 7th-grade civil services exam.
There are 2 options for me.

One is Seoul Metropolitan 7th-grade exam(general administration)

Another is Election-Administration 7th.

If I choose The former, I will be located in Seoul permanently.

But If I select The latter, I will be positioned in several of Rural areas of Korea. 

Futhermore, The Election 7th civil servants must move to the othet regions periodically.
 (The period's length is 1-3 years.)

But, Gap of Their Cut-off is so tremendous that I have trouble choosing one of them. 

Seoul's Cut-off is approximately 96 points, which is roughly 10 points higher than Election's.

Consequently, If I study Seoul's, I spend additional 40% of duration of study which needs for preparing Election's.

(Given that The perfect scores are 100 points.)

Moreover, Election management isn't suitable for my aptitude and personality. 

(Even if many of the civil services in Korea have Introverted-temperature, They want Far-Extroverted people. Because They spend many of time by presenting election laws around lots of people. but I am Slightly-Introverted.)

Given that Election's promotion from 9th to 7th needs 2 years, and from 7th to 6th needs 12 years.

And Seoul General administration's promotion from 9th to 7th needs 8 years, and from 7th to 6th needs 7 years.

Concerning that I prepare 7th's (either Seoul or Election), Please advise me.

1mjrzob,MS in CS or DS or MEM???,"
I’m honestly pretty confused about what I want to do with my career right now.

Just to give some background—I did my Bachelor’s in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science. I’ve always liked learning about data and it’s something that really interests me. Right now, I’m working at a startup in a role that’s technically called “Software Engineer,” but it is a mix of tech support+ software development + managing clients/ project management. The problem is, there’s not much growth here, and I’m not learning a lot either. That’s a big reason why I’m thinking about going back to school and finding a better opportunity.

One thing I’ve realized for sure is that I don’t see myself being a hardcore software developer. I don’t think I’m particularly good at coding, and even if I push myself to learn more over the next few years, it’s just not something I enjoy doing.

I’ve been looking into a few master’s programs, and here’s how I’m thinking about them:

MS in CS
Pros: 
* It’s a broad degree, so I’d have the flexibility to explore different areas.
* The coursework usually lets you pick and choose what you want to focus on.

Cons:
* It’s super saturated—everyone seems to be doing it, and a lot of people have more experience than I do.
* Also, since I’m not into hardcore coding, I’m not sure it’s the right fit.

MS in Data Science
Pros:
* I’m genuinely interested in it—especially the stats, analysis, and problem-solving side (as long as it’s not super heavy on coding).
* It feels more aligned with what I enjoy.

Cons:
* I don’t have much industry experience in this field, just a few projects here and there.
* Again, it’s pretty competitive and saturated.

Master’s in Engineering Management (MEM)
Pros:
* Seems like a good mix of tech and management, which kind of matches what I’ve been doing.
* It looks like something that might be a better fit overall.

Cons:
* I just started looking into it, so I don’t know a lot yet.
* Not sure how recognized or in-demand it is compared to the others.

So yeah… that’s where I’m at right now. Still trying to figure out what makes the most sense for me and what direction to take moving forward.

1mjrjag,Nights To Days,"Hey yall,

I am currently working night shift (12 hour swing shifts). Work 2 days off 2. Work 3 days off 2. Work 2 days off 3. Etc etc. I work every other weekend. I actually got sent to nights temporarily (could be 3 more months, could be until the start of the year, could be a full year from now), they haven’t said yet. 

So I’ve worked at this company for 5 years but switching departments to learn more. However, night shift is killing me and I honestly don’t know if I like the schedule as much as I used to when I was on days. I worked my way up into a leader role while making good pay. However, mentally I have not been in it because of nights and just schedule. I don’t see my fiancé or family as much as I would like to either. So I’m thinking about going back to a LOT more physically challenging job (I’ve done in the past) in the same company and take a $2-$3 pay cut. But the schedule is 7-3 M-F off every weekend. I would kind of throw out what I worked for in the last year but I’m only 26 and know that there are always other options in the future. I’m just worried about my future but I know this schedule would make me a lot happier. Just at a cross roads.

I've gotten a couple of raises since starting (yearly raises) and have been pretty content with them.

Bob, who started at the same rate I started at (they showed this off too), requested a huge raise and is now matching me. They got a 8$ raise this year and I got a 2$ raise so that we became equal. They have been complaining about making ends meet and I think management felt bad.

This being said, I feel pretty awful about what a low raise I got now that it's out in the open. I have had the top numbers for two years in a row out of our team of 10, and I feel like that should speak for itself (after all we are in sales). We do not have commission. I am still top of sales to this date. This is not to say Bob is bad, they are good at their job and have shown great numbers also.

Is this worth bringing up? I'm pretty content with the job and I love the rest of the team, no complaints there. I feel like my self esteem took a hit though. Some of the other team members are pretty upset about the small raise (we all got around the same raise, some under 2$, except said coworker) Other complaints are that said coworker is an ass kisser (hence the large raise). 

Should I say something too? Friends say I should stand up for myself, but I don't want to raise hell. I would just like a fair raise

1mjrgpm,Job hunting frustration,"I applied for a position mid June. I have had 4 “interviews” more like conversations. End of last week I had a zoom call with HR where she mentioned she would email me the benefits information and offer letter. We discussed the next steps were for me to sign, for them to do the background check and then contact references. If all came back good we would have an agree on a start date. From my former job, after I resigned I received 2 more months pay, so end of Aug is when there is no more money coming in.
So I followed up to see the timeline on the offer letter (it seemed like both benefits and letter would come at the same time). Instead of HR responding, the person who would be my bosses boss (who was not in the HR meeting) informed me they are still interviewing and they should know shortly. 
I expressed sorry for the confusion but from the conversation I had on Friday, it seemed like an offer letter was coming and there must have been some sort of misunderstanding.
I also own my own tutoring company so this job works perfectly around that and there is room to grow, they have said everything someone could want to hear and the pay is really really good. 
On LinkedIn under 20 people have applied and yes people could apply other ways, it’s been up for 2 months.
Part of me is mad because I haven’t job searched as hard for the last month because this seemed like a sure thing (my mistake) but I did take that time to focus on growing my tutoring business.
I’m not even sure if I want to be a business owner (no paid pto, benefits, health insurance). 
I have enough clients to cover half or more of my bills and more are contacting and am signing up. It is growing at a good pace but it’s not enough yet to survive on it.

I just finished an interview with Rockstar Games for a Systems Designer role. It went well, and they mentioned a technical interview is next. But here’s the issue:

- I’m 26, turning 27 soon
- Comp Sci grad from a Russell Group uni with several large personal projects (game engines, ECS, multiplayer systems, etc.)
- 5+ years of work experience in different industries before uni, including building passenger trains for Alstom and Bombardier 
- Already learning C# in prep for this
- Role involves supporting a system for GTA VI and touching multiple game systems
- This role would require me relocating to the other side of the UK, although their relocation package is alright I suppose
- Non-remote work

1mjq2rv,I was unofficially demoted today.,"This is a long post, but I’d love feedback if you don’t mind reading it. 

I’ve been with my company for almost 7 years. It’s a small (less than 20 employees) IT company that mainly provides remote support for clients. I started at the bottom, as a tier 1 engineer and worked my way up to managing the central service desk team. I’ve been in that position for about 2 years. My goal was to keep moving up the management ladder, and eventually get into a director role, or something along those lines. I’ve had multiple quarterly meetings with both my direct supervisor, and the VP of my company regarding this. I don’t like being stagnant, and I always want to move up when I can. I have made this VERY clear. Here are some problems that I face during my day to day job. 

1. I’m one of the best engineers in the company. There are 2 people more experienced than me on a technical level, that’s it. They’ve been in the field about 20 years longer than me, but I’m very good at working service desk tickets, fixing problems, and interacting with customers. I can do networking and firewalls, servers, virtual machines…the list goes on, I get thrown on projects, customer review meetings, and so on. Not to be cocky, but I am very good at my job…nobody has to tell me what to do, or babysit me. I just get my shit done. But……this makes doing a lot of the manager aspects of my job hard though, because I’m constantly picking up the slack for my team, and having things escalated to me. 

2. I’ve complained about a few of our employees for months and even years for some. I’m pointing out that they’re not doing their jobs, they’re not dependable, and they’re costing us more money than they’re making us. This is never received well. So that person sticks around, thus making my job harder. I do not have permission to fire someone without getting approved from upper management. My company is very afraid to get sued for wrongful termination or to pay unemployment. It’s happened once before. 

So today, my VP calls me into his office and says he wants to talk about a problem employee from yesterday. Great, we chat about that and then my direct supervisor comes in. 

“Okay no big deal” I thought. “He probably wants to talk about the problem employee”. 

We finish that conversation and then my VP goes 

“(Company owner) wants to bring this guy in at a director level to help out around here” 

cool” I say. “Director of what?”….

”Director of operations, he’ll be taking over your duties as service desk manager so you can focus on tickets and grow your technical expertise more…we need someone who is solely focused on managing the team and not doing tickets. This also means he’ll be taking your office, so you’ll need to move your stuff out to the central service room with the guys”

I sat quietly, avoiding an outburst that may make the situation worse. I calmly say 

“So you’re bringing this guy in, and probably paying him more than me, giving him the director title you know I want, and he doesn’t have to deal with any of the service desk tickets? You’re just kicking me out of my office and putting me directly back as a service desk engineer? After I’ve made it very clear I don’t want to do that? If you would have done like I asked and gotten rid of the shit employees, and hired some good ones I WOULD be able to do what you’re hiring him for” 

“We know you want to make more money and we think the best way for you to do that is by growing your technical abilities and we just need someone to work on the management part full time”

“Please don’t think of this as a demotion or anything like that. You’re going to keep the same pay, and we’ll let you keep your title. We aren’t firing you, we’d never want to do that”

“If you did you’d regret that decision before end of day” I think to myself

They then proceed to tell me that they’re going to remove my coworker from his office as well and throw him in the central office with me. This guy is already overworked and pissed off and way underpaid for what he does. I told them “you better tread carefully with that one too” and left it at that. 

I let them finish talking, got up and walked out the front door. I wanted to leave and never come back, but I knew I couldn’t just quit, I have things to pay for and my dog needs food and a roof. But I couldn’t stand being in that office at the time. I got in my car and sat there for a good half hour. Just thinking. I knew they were aware I was gone. I wanted them to think about it, I wanted them to worry. Knowing that made me feel a little better. 

I finally walk back in and my VP asks to talk to me again. This then starts an entire new conversation about my future at the company and where I want to go. 

“We’ve discussed this multiple times, I’ve told you exactly where I want to be and here you are putting me in the exact opposite position” I say. “It’s very frustrating and I feel very disrespected after everything I’ve done for you and this company” 

“I know, you kick ass at your job, you’re extremely beneficial to this company and the last thing I want is to see you go. I hope that never happens” 

He starts talking about how he came up in his career and how it took him 15 years before he was a director and then eventually became an owner of this company. 

“I’m not asking for a director title right now, I just want progression TOWARDS that…and this feels like a step backwards” 

He asks me about my financial goals and my life goals, again…all things we’ve discussed before. I tell him “My goal is to not stress about money. I want to own a home, be able to put more into retirement and investments. I want to be comfortable, and right now I’m not there” 

“what’s that number today?” I tell him my number that would make me feel comfortable and he then says “well let’s work to get you there”

That really pissed me off. I told him “honestly i told you that number to be fair and respectful to you. I’m worth a lot more than that and you know it . I’m one of the best employees you have. Ask any customer if I’m worth the hourly rate you charge for me and I promise nobody will say I’m not…I make every customer we have happy” 

“I don’t disagree with you” he says. 

“Then you need to figure it out” I say. 

The conversation goes on for a while and i ended up just leaving his office. I spent the rest of my day in my office with the door shut finishing a project. I didn’t check any ones else’s tickets, I didn’t do anything manager related at all. I just worried about me. When I was leaving today my direct supervisor stopped me outside and asked me if I was alright 

“I’m actually pretty fucking pissed off” I say. 

That starts an entirely new conversation where he basically says he didn’t know about it until the day before, he doesn’t want me to leave, he thinks it’s the best thing for me yada yada yada. Just more excuses. I cut the conversation short and then I went home. 

I’m not entirely sure what to do. If they give me the number I mentioned today, it would definitely make my life a bit easier, but I feel so disrespected that I just don’t know if I can continue working there. 7 years of loyalty, after hours calls, always giving my best…just to be thrown aside like that. I have started looking for new jobs. My job is very convenient though. I live 3 minutes away, have a lot of freedom, and have gotten some good titles and experience for my resume so I’m conflicted.

1mjpr70,"At 50yo, is it worth finishing a degree?","I studied Commerce when I left school, because I really had no idea you could make decent enough money doing something you enjoy, plus at 18yo I didn't really know outside sport what I enjoyed, but I taught myself to code at 7yo on a Sega computer (BASIC), so my grandmother suggested computers.

In the end about 2/3 the way through and starting to fail papers, a friend had their boss headhunt me for a technical role in Telco, I wound up in early internet support (56k, ADSL etc), I moved on to internetworking and web development in the early 2000s (CISCO gear mostly and fairly static websites for the Telco).

I moved out of that and into Systems Analysis and Project Management. I finally found something I enjoyed in Project work, mainly because working for very large corporations (ie 100k+) I was trusted to run large projects of work, the cost of which is often insane but I thrived under that. I was hands on, able to do to all roles, which helped me to get projects delivered on time and often under budget.

Did that over a 20year period.

I then had to care for my late mother, which lasted near on a decade. 

Anyway, at 50yo having been out of PM work for a decade, along with industry certifications which Ive held a few, is there any point finishing a degree I never completed?",CuriousCyclone,4,1.0,34,1754538313,2025-08-07 03:45:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjpr70/at_50yo_is_it_worth_finishing_a_degree/,8,2025

1mjpq9u,"Offer stage: How to ask for ""after-hours"" (40+) compensation as a salaried employee? [US]","I am currently looking to leave my current job as a software engineer. This is a regular full-time role and my hours have normally been 9AM-5PM. I work from home and my role has been fairly desirable. About 2 years ago, I started getting assigned a pager to be available 24/7. It has only gotten worse and I am looking to leave. It started as rotating among the team once every 8 weeks, but now I am on it for like 4 straight weeks at a time. Apart from the lack of predictability, I am mostly frustrated by the fact that if I get a page, there is not even anyone else who is online to help at the time.

Yesterday, I had a final interview with a large company for a mid-level role (3-5 YoE). This position was expected to be 5 days/week in a traditional office. My interviewer was my potential future manager. During the interview yesterday, I asked about after-hours work or work outside of normal 9-5 business hours. The interviewer said that work after hours is not common, but there are some rotating after-hours responsibilities that rotate. There are some people who engage in after-hours work but they said that they are eventually to eliminate those needs altogether.

Earlier today, I received a phone call that they were interested in proceeding to the offer stage with me. They indicated compensation is based on a base salary, bonus, and one-time signing bonus. After that, they asked for my expected base salary. I gave them a range for the base salary and they asked for my justification for the range provided. I said it was based on other offers that I have received (the offer is comparable and not obscenely high). So, then I asked them if they provide additional compensation for work that is done after 9-5 or specify an ""after hours"" rate of pay if you are required to be available. I mentioned to them that I have other jobs that happen after hours that I was looking to maintain if hired. They responded and said ""*No, we do not provide additional compensation outside of your base salary because this is not an hourly or contract position.*""

They said they would seek approval for the offer and they would call me back with an update.

Two hours later, they called me back and asked if I still wanted to proceed. They mentioned that they recalled how I was concerned with an ""after hours"" rate of compensation and were NOT able to offer that. They did not even offer the opportunity to ask for an ""after hours"" rate from the hiring/compensation committee. Since they said in the interview ""*they are looking to eliminate the current after-hours work entirely,*"" then I took this response as a bait-and-switch tactic. If they were genuinely looking to eliminate after-hours work, I felt paying people after-hours should incentivize them to eliminate it.

So, I told them that I did not want to proceed further. I am not desperate to leave my current job, so I feel that I made the right decision. The only benefit to proceeding to the offer stage would have been just to know the potential compensation offered, but I was not really too happy with how immediately resistive this person was to my request for after-hours compensation.

Can anyone share some advice on how to go about negotiating an ""after hours"" or ""overtime"" hourly rate as a regular 9-5 salaried employee? Is a reasonable employer usually satisfied with specifying an additional hourly rate if you are required to work more than 40 hours per week if you are salaried? Is there a better way to phrase or present your need for it? I am not a caregiver nor do I tend to dependents if that would make my case more justifiable. Even if an ""after-hours"" rate is offered, I am not looking to habitually work after-hours. As a salaried employee in the United States, there are no constraints on time that your employer can require you to work.",anonymous2454,0,0.5,6,1754538232,2025-08-07 03:43:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjpq9u/offer_stage_how_to_ask_for_afterhours_40/,8,2025
1mjpjpb,"I’m in my late 20s, caring for my mom and sister alone, and it feels like life is slipping past me. I need advice (and help)","Hi everyone,
I’m (F27) honestly struggling to keep it together.

For most of my adult life, I’ve been the glue holding my small family together. My mom was never really in my life growing up and I was raised by my aunt. After high school my aunt started her own family and during that time my mom came back around. My mom was in a terrible car accident that changed everything. She didn’t make the best choices in life, and now I’m carrying the weight of it all…not just emotionally, but financially and mentally. The fathers of her children (myself and my little sister) were never in the picture, and that reality hit hard as I got older.

I’ve delayed my dreams for so long always putting them first, always showing up for them and she wasn’t in the most important parts of my life growing up as a child. It’s so unfair! And now? I feel like life is slipping out of my hands. I had plans… big ones. I’ve always wanted to finish college, I started once but ended up dropping out for financial reasons as you may be able to pick up if you’ve read this far. Every year I try to chase after that dream but every year, something pushes my goal further away. Bills, caregiving, stress, emotional burnout.

I’m trying to get back on track now. I’ve submitted my school evaluation and I’m preparing to start. But I need help. Financially, yes but also emotionally, mentally, practically. I’m scared if I’m being honest. I look in the mirror and sometimes I don’t even recognize myself. The sacrifices have been heavy. I don’t regret loving and caring for them, but I regret how long I’ve put myself last and scared to put myself out there to ask for help in this way.

So I’m here for two reasons:
	1.	Advice: How do I build a future this late in life, with so much baggage and feeling behind?
	2.	Support: I’ve started a fundraiser to help me finish college. I’m nervous to even ask, but I know I can’t do this alone anymore. Here’s the link for anyone that can help me: https://angelink.com/fundraiser-public/c02df27d-5f3a-4638-aec4-140936d550e3

If you’ve ever had to rebuild your life late, or made a comeback after feeling stuck, please share how. And if you read this far, thank you. I’m doing my best to keep going.",HorrorPizza973,3,0.8100000023841858,2,1754537661,2025-08-07 03:34:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjpjpb/im_in_my_late_20s_caring_for_my_mom_and_sister/,8,2025

1mjogv9,Help me pick between two jobs,"Hi all, please help me pick between two jobs. I’m distraught and need advice. 

Offer 1 - I applied for a government job and they’re offering me $148k for a management position. The benefits are great (pension), 17 days PTO, 12 days sick leave, 13 holidays. Hybrid schedule with 2 days wfh. Very reliable but government work can be stagnant.

Offer 2 - My current company countered at $145k, with a management position promotion and 20 days PTO combined sick leave, 8 holidays. 401k with a 3-4% match. Private industry so less reliable but work is more existing and is more of a corporate setting. Hybrid schedule with 3 days wfh. very flexible with remote work.

Now on paper offer 1 sounds better. But I’ve been distraught as my current company truly values me, they have an invested plan in me to make me a long term partner, and they are extremely flexible. I can basically work from anywhere, announce anytime that I can’t come in even on my in office days, and nobody blinks an eye. The flexibility has really helped me with my personal life but both jobs required hybrid anyway. I’m just scared of losing that flexibility. Any advice is welcome.

1mjnqd0,Back to school? Find a new job? Need advice on what to do next.,"Long post so feel free to skip if you don’t have time to read. 

Im feeling really stuck about my future, here’s my situation and thoughts and hopefully someone has some advice for what to do next.

For some background I walked in my schools graduation ceremony this past spring, but don’t officially graduate until the end of August. It’s a pedestrian University ranked around 250-400th in the US depending on source. I’m set to graduate with a B.S in Psychology and a minor in Economics. I switched majors many times and have multiple courses in chemistry, biology and physics as well. I have a 3.6 GPA. 
I’m currently completing an internship as a behavior therapist at an ABA clinic. For those who don’t know about ABA it’s intense therapy aiming to help children that are autistic through collecting behavior data and implementing programs run by behavior therapists to improve quality of life and independence. It’s fulfilling work but I’m suffering doing it, and it’s certainly not what I want to do continue to do for a career. 

Now I’m thinking I might want to hold off on my graduation if that’s possible and complete one more semester so o graduate as a double major with a B.S in Psychology and Economics. It would require me moving back to school and subleasing for the semester. The cost between myself and my parents could pretty much cover the tuition. My thinking is that this would allow me to find jobs finance/business that my psychology degree may not have been right for. But I’m not sure how much value the degree adds to what I already hold/would hold.

The other option I could take is trying to find a job anyway with what I have and leverage that experience later on to work my way into those sectors. Regardless I’ve been learning python and c# (game development as a hobby) to hopefully bolster my resume whether I go back to school or not. 

As far as specific careers go I’ve considered trying to become an actuary - where I believe my degree will not matter as much as passing actuarial exams. 

I’m looking for a career with high earnings potential, something I can feel morally okay about doing everyday, and something that challenges me intellectually. I’m hoping to get some advice from anyone with more experience about the value of an Econ degree over my current minor with a psych degree, if I should go for that or try and find a job regardless, if there’s other skills I should be building in the meantime, if there’s advanced degrees I should look into or even any careers in the field of psychology that might get me into a more solid white collar career (thinking behavioral economics)

1mjnhun,"I want to pursue a career in Science Communication, but I have a piss-poor GPA","TL:DR at bottom.

I am interested in working for a university or research facility in a public-facing science communication role. I'm mostly interested in writing articles, but it seems like most jobs would require working with multiple distribution channels. 

My main issue right now is that most of these jobs seem to require some sort of journalism degree or at least certificate. I have a B.S. in Zoology with a whopping 2.9gpa on a 4-point scale. I'll save you the gritty details but basically I was dealing with a lot of undiagnosed issues in college that are now under control, and barely graduated. No surprise, I am having trouble finding any M.S. degrees or even one-off certificates with a GPA requirement under 3.0.

I do see a couple job postings that don't require a degree, but they're mostly for publications that don't do research. Eventually I'd want to end up working at a lab writing articles for the public (think NASA or more realistically a university), if this is still a viable end-goal for me.

Does anybody have decent options I could explore? I have some experience already working as a nature center interpreter and writing a few freelance articles for nature newsletters. I'm in no rush to get to my end goal, I just want to start working on this now in some capacity.

  
TL;DR: My GPA is under 3.0 and I want to work as a Science Communicator, preferably as an employee of an institution that does its own research.

A little background about myself:
I’ve been working in the hospitality sector for the last 10 years and worked my way up from the rock bottom. I’ve worked in several countries and positions, but always had my eyes on a particular place that is ran by industry legends & got all of the awards.

Recently they’ve contacted me, which surprised the hell out of me & offered me a job. Moved from the continent I was living on, without speaking the language and been working here for the last 3 months.

There were rad flags from the first day onwards, but I didn’t really care. Microagressions, micromanagement through the roof, super toxic team, everyone just shit talking about guests & worst of all, racism.

Deep down I know I shoul leave immediately, but if I do I feel like I’ll give up on a life long dream & affraid it will feel like a step back in life.

1mjn6jn,Career Change & Life Decision – Seeking Advice,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 25-year-old currently living in the Cayman Islands, and I’ve recently made the decision to switch careers—from hospitality to **radiography**. It’s a major shift, but one I’m genuinely passionate about and excited to pursue.

I’m considering attending a **college in Canada or the United States** next year to study radiography, depending on whether I receive a scholarship from my government. My long-term goal is to gain hands-on experience, build a solid career in the healthcare field, and hopefully settle in Canada permanently.

My girlfriend, who has been with me since we were 16, is incredibly supportive. She was born in the United States and is also a **Canadian citizen through her father**. She currently lives with me in the Cayman Islands, but she wants us to move to Canada together and build our future there. We’ve started discussing what it would look like for me to relocate, study, and eventually become a permanent resident or citizen of Canada.

I’d really appreciate any guidance or advice from anyone who has:

* Transitioned into a radiography career,
* Studied in Canada as an international student,
* Gone through the Canadian immigration process through a relationship or education,
* Or has any general insight into making a move like this work long-term.

1mjmxmt,Tough Decision Between Two Jobs...,"Job 1 - Very similar role to what I'm doing now. Hybrid schedule with 1-2 days in the office a week. Direct hire. $8000 more yearly than I'm making in my current role. Potentially challenging but stable.

Job 2 - Similar role to what I'm doing now but a government position. 5 days a week in the office but the site is only about 10 miles away. $6000 less than I'm making now yearly but after temp to perm, it ends up being $5000 more than I'm making now. The temp to perm isn't guaranteed but likely. Very stable. Likely could retire on the job and it comes with a pension.

So there's my conundrum. Do I take Job 1, instantly make good money, $8000 more than I'm making now and $3000 more than Job 2 would end up getting if I go full time. Or, do I take a pay cut for 6 months with the hope of ending up with the full time role and making roughly $5000 more than I do now and potentially have a job for life?

It's a good problem to have but it's stressing me out because I have to give an answer. I can afford to take the pay cut for 6 months but it still feels like I'm going backwards doing that. Job 1 will feel like more of the same but it's a pay bump and I'll pretty much instantly know what I'm doing. Job 2 is not only a pay cut but driving in 5 days a week so that's wear and tear on the car, gas and quite frankly, just waking up early to shower and get ready.

It's almost a coin flip and I have no idea what to do. No matter which job I choose and if I don't like it, the other job will likely not be available again and I'm always going to wonder if the other one was better.",draven33l,1,1.0,2,1754530165,2025-08-07 01:29:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjmxmt/tough_decision_between_two_jobs/,8,2025
1mjmqbq,Losing sleep over how to quit my job,"Hi everyone! A couple months ago I started a new job as a Brand Partnerships Coordinator. However, I accepted the job knowing I’d be leaving after 4 months. I already had another big opportunity setup but my start date wouldn’t be until November. However, I really needed to make money in the meantime because I was so disgustingly broke. I applied for a few jobs and I ended up getting a pretty good role with good pay and it’s permanent. Everyone likes me, I like them and it seems like they really needed someone in that role. Despite all that, the role is still not as good as what I’ll be walking into in November. (The stars really aligned for me on that one).

But I’m now starting to feel guilt/remorse because I know I’ll have to hand in my resignation for this current job soon and I know it will probably fck up their operations. I feel bad because I lied in the interview and said I planned on being there long term even though I knew I’d be making an exit fairly soon. But I needed the money, and I’ve learned the hard way that being an “honourable” person in corporate gets you no where quickly. But still, I don’t know how to go about quitting, what to say and how to feel. I’m scared once I tell them I’m leaving, that’ll be my last day…Any advice would help!

i got a job offer for a new position. basically double my salary. 3 days in office minimum is company policy (but i get the sense i will be expected/pressured to come in more). the specific area i would work in got acquired by a private equity company. makes me a bit nervous because of the instability of an acquisition. a bit vague when i asked about how often i will actually have to come in, how things may change during/after the acquisition is official, etc. 

what do i do? im torn. i cant figure out if im nervous because of change or if its my intuition telling me its a bad idea. my current job makes me so anxious but at least im in the comfort of my own home the majority of the time. commute to the new job is like 45-50 mins one way. 

i feel so lost and stuck. part of me wants to leave and take the new position, but for reasons above im nervous ill end up hating it, having to quit a few months in, and be back in the same position of job searching. idk what to do. any advice is appreciated :(  ",Puzzleheaded-Aerie69,1,1.0,2,1754529033,2025-08-07 01:10:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjmitz/what_would_you_do/,8,2025
1mjmgcd,SDR to head of Operations Path,"Hey everyone – looking for some career advice and would love your feedback.

Quick background: I’ve been an SDR for the past 6.5 months. Before that, I worked as a client operations associate for a year and then transitioned into a financial advisor role for 1.5 years. I made the jump into tech/startups because I really enjoy the pace and culture, and I’m aiming long-term to move into a Head of Operations role eventually shooting for a C suite position down the line, but that’s a way future conversation. 

Right now, I’m trying to figure out my best next move. Should I try to pivot directly into a BizOps/Operations role now while I’m still early? Or would it make more sense to go from SDR to AE, build a bit more revenue experience, and then pivot into Ops?

Would really appreciate any thoughts from folks who’ve made similar transitions or have insight into this path. Thanks in advance!

1mjl2q2,What would you do?,"
Hey all,

Hope you’re well. This post isn’t for me because I’m a lawyer in biglaw, but I wouldn’t be without my dad, who’s my hero. He’s 56 and has worked for a major food distributor in MA for 30 years now. His main responsibilities include unloading and loading trucks, managing warehouse stock and updating his inventory management software. He also assisted on truck deliveries quite often during overtime shifts so has delivery experience.

He’s always had issues with his employer due to some favoritism shown from management and bosses towards employees who slack, but he’s thrived there despite those issues, even recently earning his full bonus (as he’s done each year for 30 years). In fact, he was the longest-serving member on his team. However, just this past week he was fired for threatening language towards a coworker, which (knowing my dad and being a lawyer), I strongly suspect was veiled age discrimination. Despite our suspicions, we’re not interested in pursing an age discrimination lawsuit as we’d like to just move on and find further gainful employment.

My dad is now, for the first time in 30 years, seeking employment. We have some time to consider his options because he’ll be on unemployment for a bit, but I’m curious to hear if anyone has any suggestions of what might be suitable for someone in his position. He’s 6’4” and still quite strong, a very hard and reliable worker, and quite handy (does a bunch of side jobs on the weekend like landscaping, painting, etc.). He made $26/hour in his last job and just needs to earn somewhere similar to support his and my mom’s bills. He has no issue with standing or walking for a long period of time. Hes not extremely technology-forward, but can learn basically anything quite quickly. His only issue is that he doesn’t want to work in a refrigerator for an extended period of time.

We’re open to all suggestions and really appreciate the help from all of you. ",Guilty_Marsupial_960,1,1.0,0,1754525105,2025-08-07 00:05:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjl2q2/what_would_you_do/,8,2025
1mjkyc8,Less Pay- More Growth/Flexibility? Help.,"I live in Indiana and make $41,000 before any OT in a field that doesn’t utilize my degree and is taxing. I would love more money but I can afford my life on it (dual-income house- no kids yet). I currently can work about 3 hours of OT a week. I drive 36 miles a day round trip, have 6% 401k matching, and have 3 weeks of PTO. The kicker is that I do not get paid holidays, and I have to use my PTO if I want paid for them. I do not have flexible hours but a strict attendance policy. If I were to need to call-in, I would get an attendance point even if I had the PTO. Same goes with leaving early, coming in late, etc. I also have only 2 weeks of maternity leave, so when it comes time to having a kid they recommend you save all your PTO and burn it on maternity leave. I get yelled at daily and so far am coming up on the negative end of growing internally. I work in healthcare with a business degree, lol. I’ve applied internally and keep getting denied due to lack of education or experience. 

I was offered a job through the state making $39,000- unable to negotiate. It is 84 miles round trip, 3% 401k match, 12-14 paid holidays, 90 hours of PTO, 40 something personal hours, and approx 20 hours of sick hours, they also have a pension that you become fully vested in after 10 years. I also can flex my hours and work earlier/later if needed due to personal conflicts (as long as I’m working between 6a-6p), and don’t have to worry about being fired for having a doctors appt as long as I make up my hours elsewhere or use my personal time. After 6 months, I could apply internally and make more/transfer different places granted I get those. The field I would work in would utilize more of my degree, and don’t think I’d be yelled at daily. 

I’d work less hours but spend more time driving so I’d probably spend more time away from home at the new job. I’d come out less on money but more potential to grow (I think?) and more flexibility when needing time off that can’t always be planned like when it came to having kids I wouldn’t have to worry about losing my job when I had an ill child. Any advice? I have a week to give new job an answer.

1mjkm7s,How do I navigate upward movement as a consultant?,"I posted here April, got the job in May, and now there's raises and an opportunity to move up already. I'm looking for advice on how to navigate it all.

So I started out strong and made a big impact during a critical time. I'm a consultant, and produced a product for them right as I came in, and it paid off big time. The contract for my consulting service is being negotiated now, and the raises are looking like 12% across the board, which is great as far as I'm concerned. I consult with a team of about 16-- 4 supervisors, 8 at my level, and 4 at a jr. level.

2 supervisors are leaving, and I'm thinking my supervisor would help me learn some admin skills to be considered for the move up. That seems like a no-brainer.

Ultimately, however, my idea was to transfer from being a consultant to actually working for the client, but I may have screwed that up.

The company was *so impressed* with the product I produced, that now there are talks of reducing the amount of internal employees, and giving more responsibilities to my consulting team.

There also might be an opportunity to request a specific job title in the contract negotiations, so I'm almost wondering if staying at my level with an ideal title would be the better long-term career move? I am leaning towards wanting the term ""specialist"" added. I have a very niche subject matter expertise but I feel the need to avoid ""SME"" in my title so my job options don't get too narrow.

I want to get some advice on what jobs I could realistically land after, what extra certs might help, and if adding a bachelor’s from WGU would be worth it in the long run.

**Here’s my current plan:**

**Cybersecurity (35-week program august 25 ,2025- April 25 ,2026)**

* Linux
* CompTIA Network+ (Certification)
* Python
* CompTIA Security+ (Certification)
* CCSK v5 with Zero Trust (Certification)
* 1 month of Work-Based Learning

**Cisco Networking (Jan 12-May 5 2026)**

* 16 semester credit hours
* 1 Technical College Certificate: Cisco Networking Specialist
* 3 Networking Academy Badges
* **CCNA certification** (with successful exam completion)
* Courses:
   * CIST 1401 Computer Networking Fundamentals
   * CIST 2451 Intro to Networks
   * CIST 2452 Cisco Routing & Switching
   * CIST 2453 Cisco Scaling Networks

I also have VA **(Veterans Affairs)** Chapter 35 benefits covering tuition by giving me $1,580 monthly stipends, since I'm a child of a veteran so debt isn’t a big concern.

**My questions:**

1. After finishing these courses/certs, what entry-level (or possibly mid-level) jobs could I realistically land?
2. What other certifications would you recommend next (Cloud+, CEH, etc.)?
3. Would getting a **Bachelor’s in Cybersecurity from WGU** make a noticeable difference for my job prospects and pay, or would certs + experience be enough early on? **(I could complete bachelors in 1-2 years while getting payments monthly by the VA)**
4. What would my career progression look like at 23 if I stop at certs vs. if I add the degree?

I did everything ""right"", working the whole way through and got a high (3.9 GPA). Like many, I can't get a job in my field. I still have the job I had without a degree. 

My issue is that my younger sibling has no formal education and isn't working at all and is considering going to school to help get a job/find what they like doing but the current job market/AI situation makes me feel like it may not help at all. 

I'm not sure if I should instead encourage some other path like blue-collar work or getting a job now without any training, or if I should hope it'll be a different situation in 2-4 when they would graduate and encourage college instead. 

In my family, I'm basically responsible for them/their decisions as the older sibling, and have already been the ""fallback"" when things went wrong, like giving them money for a car or helping them deal with/pay for a medical emergency. They do heavily value my opinion with larger decisions.

They get money from the VA after getting discharged from the military, so they can barely scrape by, but not save anything. The school would also be 100% paid for.

They don’t see me as competent  they treat the whole interview like some kind of process to reassure themselves that I’m not a match. They ask me questions in a way that’s meant to provoke or trap me like, “So do you think X is a solution?” And I’m like, your conclusion is wrong, that’s not what I said. Why are you even suggesting it or trying to put words in my mouth?

I feel like I have to give 150%. Even when I answer correctly, they act like I only got it right because I guessed just because I don’t sound confident. Im introverted, and I don't  sound confident,  it's a part of my personality, I cannot pretend and learn how to be more confident and extrovert.

Long story short, I’m fed up with this environment. It’s drained my nerves. I’m starting to hate tech bros, and even if they did accept me somewhere, I wouldn’t be happy working with them for the rest of my life.


Even when they interview me, the way they phrase their questions and how they formulate them I can tell they’re less bright than me, less emotionally intelligent. They can reject me even if I answered all the questions, just because they don’t feel a vibe with a woman in their tech bro company. At the end of the interview, they said I sounded unconfident and stressed and later, I got the rejection.

I thought about switching to medicine. But that takes years. I’d be jobless in the meantime because med school is so demanding. I’d burn through all the savings I’ve worked hard for. I’d probably live like a rat in a cheap room through my 30s. If I went to med school, I’d probably be over 35 by the time I fully finished it. I probably won’t even have financial stability until then. And by the time I do, I’ll be hitting menopause and won’t be able to have a baby.

I'm heartbroken for all the women whose jobs have been made redundant by AI and this brutal job market. So many women are now forced to switch careers and study for years just to rebuild financial stability but by the time they get there, it’s too late to have children. The birth rate is already terrible. Women went to college because they wanted a stable future and to have kids in their 30s. But now it feels like I’ll spend my 30s studying for a new job, and by the time I finish and finally start earning, I’ll already be hitting menopause.

That’s the real issue now, in the age of AI young women are being pushed to sacrifice everything just to survive, and in the process, lose the chance to build the life they dreamed of.

I wanted to have kids. I still do. But finding a husband, having a baby, and building financial stability all at the same time  it’s hell.


For men and women who don’t plan to have a family, it’s easy. But for people who want kids… how the hell are we supposed to do that? I already majored in one field, worked in it for 5 years, and now I can’t even get a job for a year as a reward?

When are people supposed to have kids if they can’t find jobs even after doing everything by the book  college, job, experience? Are we supposed to have kids in our 60s?

1mjhj2u,Forced to start from scratch. Running out of time. Suggestions for certifications/short programs to land a job with growth opportunities,"I went to a community college for graphic design… with the rise of AI and the job market, even having internship experience, I have been unable to find a job. A lot of graphic designers are jumping ship and learning alternate paths. 

I am 22, live with my parents, and have no school debt, however, they both are retired or unable to work from health complications, and do not have much savings. It feels like time is running out, and every path I take crumbles in front of me. I can’t go back to community college for free since I graduated and used up the scholarships. 

I am currently working in the events industry as an assistant florist, but basically act as the second-in-command to my boss. She pays me well at 25/hr, but with the current market, we are not booking much at all, and we are scrambling. Haven’t had a wedding in two months now, and with no benefits and being on a 1099, I need to find something that will provide health insurance, even though I love my job and my boss. 

I was thinking about radiology, and just devoting two years to it, but the wait list for that program is up to 2029. Phlebotomy was another thought, but the pay is poor and there’s no room to grow( however, only takes a few weeks and the classes in my area cost 1,100) . Dental assisting was also a consideration, but it would be a large expense. 

I have been working since I was 15, and I am a very hard worker, willing to do whatever it takes to get a job done. I am more than capable of learning on-the-job and am very proud of my work ethic, however, I just need someone to give me a chance. I haven’t even been able to get a job at Costco or other grocery stores. 

Please give recommendations that are fairly entry-level, with a reasonable starting pay and preferably a safe and stable job market without the fear of it being obsolete within a few years.

1mjh66u,I dont fit in..,"I've been in my current position for about 1.5 years. Its a new role as a release manager, which is very similar to my previous role as a project manager. I came from the game industry, which saw the biggest layoffs of the entire tech sector, so I took a job in internal IT for a local company. 

The job itself is enjoyable (aside from hours commitment), but the people just aren't my kind of people, I suppose. My direct supervisor and I have butted heads a LOT previously, but have since reconciled. Its now feeling that we have reconciled TOO good and she sees me as her gossip buddy now. I've told her twice now that personal matters that dont involve me should be kept private. That request has not been respected. She's informed me of others employees PIPs and firings before anything was made public and told me about a gossiping director at our workplace, among other instances.

Aside from her, I feel like a real black sheep here. At previous jobs, I made friends with people and was generally well liked among my peers. People saw me as someone to get advice from and I spearheaded process improvements at two different studios. At this new job I always eat lunch by myself, I get (seemingly) purposefully left out of important conversations, and my input has never felt less valuable.

I feel like im becoming depressed because of this, but the job market is so bad right now I can't even get an interview anywhere else. 

Im not sure if I'm looking for advice, to vent, or for people with relatable stories... all I know is that im beyond frustrated with how the company politics work here. Average tenure is 11.5 years which is much higher than at game studios (avg. 1.3 years). The workplace feels very cliquey and people are incredibly stubborn towards positive change.

1mjg52i,Feeling Defeated After Yet Another Missed Promotion at AWS,"I’ve been at AWS for 3.5 years now, joined right out of college, and over that time, I’ve worked on a wide range of impactful projects. I’ll admit, when I first started, I had a bit of a learning curve. The data we worked with was new to me, and I know that slowed me down early on. I understand why that might’ve delayed an initial promotion.

But for the last two years, I’ve consistently exceeded expectations. My manager has acknowledged that directly, and I’ve been told repeatedly that leadership, both within my team and in other orgs, has taken notice of my work. Just in the past year, I led two major projects that touched multiple stakeholders, brought in significant revenue, and earned strong praise.

Despite all that, I’ve now been passed up for promotion again. What’s more frustrating is that my manager has dangled the idea of promotion in front of me for so long, it’s lost all meaning. Each cycle, I’m told I’m on track, only to hear last-minute that “the bar has been raised again.” It feels like a moving goalpost that I’ll never be allowed to reach, no matter how much I deliver.

I’ve poured so much into this job, and to feel this unseen and let down by leadership is making me question my value, my future here, and whether it’s time to start looking elsewhere. I have been considering pursuing law for the longest time because it’s something that really intrigues me and honestly have always been very passionate about it; this situation is making me feel like I should just begin to pursue law and see what falls into place for me.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?

The current employer hired me with the promise I could build an appropriately-sized on-site team after I put a plan together and square away their vendor issues.

Turns out they can't afford any developers. Now I'm writing all of the code by myself. I started in dev but haven't been an IC in 10+ years. Even though my pay is less than what I'm used to- they're overpaying me for what I'm doing. 

So I found another job. My boss is going to use my salary to hire an offshore dev firm. I'll stay on as a contractor, run the devs and strategize on direction with the leadership team. Idea being, they'll tap me back in once they can afford me.

New job ends around noon local time. New job is super easy- middle management at a large corporation. Should have plenty of time. It has the potential to be a best-case scenario where I retain the potential upside of a startup without the risk/writing everything myself.

1mjdj4e,Told I Need to “Stroke Egos” & Change My Tone. Thoughts?,"I just had my mid-year performance review. Overall, it was positive feedback.

Part of our review process is collecting anonymous feedback from both internal team members and cross-functional colleagues. In mine, my manager said that my internal team feels I can be “direct” and that I should “stroke people’s egos” more in conversations. When I asked for clarity, they explained that I should “adjust my tone of voice” — meaning sound more upbeat or peppy, ""use my telephone voice""— so people feel better during interactions.

Here’s the thing — I work in Communications. Communication, tone, and perception are huge parts of what I do. I have a strong understanding of how to adapt messaging to different audiences. I’ve also been a people manager of a large team within the same org, many of whom I still have a great relationship with to this day. I’m not just about business talk — I ask people about life outside of work and genuinely care about them as people.

The challenge in my current role is that I often have to deliver news about changes the business is making. In many meetings, I get vocal pushback — and because I’m the one communicating the change, I’m sometimes seen as “the bad guy,” even though my goal is to help the team navigate it successfully. In addition to that, I have to work with other teams within my organization that are newer and because of my background as a people manager and how our organization runs, I can provide a lot of feedback and insight into our processes. Even though it's not within my remit, I do try to be a team player to help those teams navigate on how to develop or streamline our processes. I was brought on to this role because of my background but I have also intentionally try to avoid providing input to the other teams for the very reason to not overstep but in many scenarios we are often delayed in our projects because of this very team. So to help move things along, I will provide input but I guess by me providing input Is not the best solution. 
My manager fully understands these challenges and supports me.


I guess my struggle is this:

I intentionally already try and use positive, collaborative phrasing. 

I understand the politics and play the “song and dance” daily.

I can adjust my wording, but asking me to literally change the natural tone of my voice to be more “peppy” feels inauthentic.


So my questions are:

Have you ever received similar feedback?

How did you handle it?

Is it reasonable to expect someone to change their natural tone just to make others feel better?

How do you balance authenticity with adjusting your communication style to fit your audience?

Should I do away with providing collaborative input or guidance to the other teams regardless if I know the right answer or not?


Would love to hear thoughts from people who’ve been in similar situations — especially in roles that require collaboration with internal teams and gathering feedback.

I was brought in last year to help drive commercial growth. Our CTO/CPO wasn’t delivering and was just laid off. Now the CEO wants me to take over that combined role. I’ve held both positions before and have more experience as CTO and know the role well, but I really enjoy my current focus and I’m not very motivated to move back into a tech-heavy role right now.

There’s no one else internally who can step in, and we have critical product launches ahead, so waiting for a new hire isn’t realistic. Should I accept the role as is, or ask for a raise?

1mjd3pi,I work for an awful family.,"Hi everyone. 

I’m a house manager/housekeeper for a private family. I have worked for them for almost five years. 

They have gotten progressively more awful and toxic to work for. They are, in my opinion, never happy. You cannot please them. I work myself to the bone at their house 4 days a week and am only ever met with criticism or complaining about the two things I didn’t get time to complete, as their expectations are WILDLY unrealistic. If a mistake is made, even small, it’s the end of the world. 

I can’t say too much, but the last five years have been proof over and over again that they’re honestly just terrible people. 

I have stayed this long because of the pay honestly. It’s pretty good, but normal for this position. I think they think because they pay well, they can treat everyone as they please and everyone should basically be inhuman and perform perfectly 100% of the time. 

It’s getting really hard to deal with them. I feel very unappreciated and my mental health deteriorates when dealing with them. The problem is, I’m a single mother to a young son. And while it’s not fun to work there, it has been reliable pay and the schedule I need. 

What would you do if you were me? I’ve been looking for other opportunities, but opportunities in this field, where I am located are scarce. I have the opportunity to possibly work for another family who has been vetted and is great, but they don’t need anyone until January. 

Do I hold out until then and hope that they don’t fire me for some ridiculous reason like they have so many before? Do I find something temporary? Do I try to make this work? Any advice appreciated.

Im investing a lot of money in my MBA, and I'm not sure if it's worth it. Should I stick with it and hope for the best, or is it time to pivot and explore other options? 

I also love soccer, tennis, and basketball, but the sports industry in Uruguay is tiny, so I'm really looking to make a move abroad.

1mjbxfr,Thinking of pivoting from Cybersecurity to UX/UI – is the market really that bad?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve spent a lot of time building out a full study plan and organizing a Notion dashboard to guide my transition into UX/UI design and eventually UX engineering. I’ve done my research, planned out projects, and started gathering all the concepts, skills, and resources I’ll need to make this career shift.

But lately, some of the job market posts I’ve seen here (and a few replies to my roadmap) have me second-guessing everything. One person even said I should just pivot to a different career entirely. I’m not afraid of putting in the work—I actually want to do this—but I’m wondering if it’s even worth pursuing right now.

For context: I’m coming from a cybersecurity background. While I’ve learned a lot there—tech, problem-solving, systems thinking—I realized I want to work on things that are more creative, visual, and directly connected to people. UX/UI feels like that bridge between design and tech that I’ve been looking for.

Is the market as bad as people say? Or should I just take the leap and give this path a real shot?

Thanks in advance for any insight or encouragement.

1mjbqw0,Getting a Surprise Mid-Year Review Next Week But I'm Burned Out and Job Hunting. How DO I handle the Review?,"I've been working at my current job for 6 years, and have been burned out and looking for another one since the beginning of 2025. 

The biggest reason for my desire to leave is due to management—mainly my direct manager. The long and short of the story is: he's gotten more and more controlling over the years, and he has a perception of me that I can never change. At the beginning of last year. he put me on a PIP without warning, which I succeeded at since I'm still around. But for years before and after the PIP, any time I've given him feedback about my career development, he would brush it off and say that the work I do is valuable (even though it's been the same four tasks since I first started). All I get is lip service, and I constantly need to fight for my ideas and opinions to be acknowledged. Needless to say, I just don't care anymore. After years of this, I'm just done trying. Obviously, I still do my work and produce quality stuff, but that's mainly out of fear of getting another ""blemish"" on my record for no reason (during one annual review, I was given a bad score because I wasn't as happy as I normally was, and I was bringing everyone else down. I'm not a manager or assistant or any team lead whatsoever.).

Yesterday, my manager told me that I will be receiving a mid-year review next week. Everyone is receiving one, and this is the first time my company has done this in the time I've been here. I've already had a surprise mid-year check-in with my manager's boss, and it was a whole nothing burger. I haven't been told to prepare anything like we normally would for annual reviews,, which I think is kind of odd. But since I just don't care anymore, and I'm actively looking for another job, I'm not sure how to handle my mid-year review with my manager. With the job market sucking major dog butt, finding something new has been a challenge, and I'm not sure how long it will take to get a new gig. I'm obviously not going to mention that I'm looking for something new, but I'm not exactly sure what to say. 

Given my current state, how do I handle my mid-year review? Should I still prepare something? Should I just grin and bear it knowing that I'm trying to leave and the review essentially won't matter?",WitchyWeebOfMidwest,2,1.0,1,1754503046,2025-08-06 17:57:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mjbqw0/getting_a_surprise_midyear_review_next_week_but/,8,2025
1mjbo66,Career Advice: What Next After 7 Years in IT?,"I'm 30 years old, studied business and information technology and have been working in the IT department of a machine manufacturing company for the past 7 years. Over that time, I've focused primarily on:

* Inhouse IT Consulting
* IT Project Management (projects up to and beyond €10M budget)
* IT Process Management & Enterprise Architecture

Recently, my company offered me a **team lead position**, which is something I’ve always seen as a medium-term goal. However, now that the opportunity is becoming real, I’m feeling an urge to **explore beyond IT**.

I'm increasingly interested in **broadening my horizon,** potentially shifting into areas like:

* **Product Management**
* **Business Development**
* **Finance / Controlling**
* **Business / Strategy Consulting**

What drives me is a **desire to understand a company from all angles**, not just from an IT lens. I’m hungry for steep learning curves, cross-functional exposure, and long-term career growth, ideally in a direction where I keep doors open to senior leadership roles one day.

So my question is:

**What are some realistic and smart next steps for someone with my background who wants to pivot out of IT without starting from scratch?**  
Is it worth taking the team lead role first, or should I make the switch now while I still can?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s done a similar pivot, or from folks in product/strategy/business roles who’ve hired people from IT backgrounds.

I'm trying to figure out what's next. I kind of knew that I wouldn't end up wanting to pursue research ultimately, but now I feel I have too many ideas of what I might like to do and not enough direction. 

I'd love to be a **copywriter**, but AI seems to be taking a lot of those jobs. 

I have an interest in **marketing**, but getting your foot in the door seems rough. I have networked and got a reference for a job that would get my foot in the door– I'm waiting to hear back on this. 

I would consider **product management**, as it wouldn't be totally alien from what I'm used to as a UX researcher in corporate and seems like a good path to go down.

I feel I'd make a good **administrative assistant** because I'm very Type A lol. I'm extremely organized and love planning and scheduling things. I've read that two typical paths forward in this are towards being an Executive Assistant (which sounds interesting but maybe a bit demanding...) or an office manager, which I could see myself doing. I applied to be the assistant to the Dean of one of the colleges at my alma matter, but also waiting to hear back. 

Does anyone have any insight into any of these career paths? I have around six years of restaurant experience, an Ivy League degree, and 3 years of real-world experience, but the job market is extremely daunting– especially given that I'm trying to pivot. I don't want to dive head-first into trainings or courses for something that will be a dead-end and would love to hear from people who actually do these jobs.

1mjaak6,My manager seems to hate me and today was the final straw.,"I work in retail. I’ve been in the same job for a year and a half and I’ve always worked hard. We got a new store manager around 9 months ago and ever since then, she’s made it her business to make me miserable in work.

She’ll frequently watch me on the cameras and blame me for things that I wasn’t even in work to do. Once she blamed me for leaving a pricing gun on the shelf when I was on holiday, therefore it was physically impossible for me to do so.

Today was definitely the final straw in my opinion. She actively avoided me until the final hour of my shift, where she came up to me and had a go at me, telling me that I had only worked one pallet in 3 hours and i was lazy. I’m not the type of person to let somebody gaslight me so I stood up for myself and told her that I had worked 3 and she could check with my other manager. He quickly came to my defence and told her that I had worked 3 and I was close to getting to my fourth one. She gave me the DIRTIEST look on the planet which made me absolutely break down into tears. 

My manager told me to go and cool off upstairs and he’d let everyone know I wasn’t available until I came back down. I eventually came back down to finish my shift and she was working on the tills. I expected at least a half arsed apology but all she did was bark at me to go on the tills so she could go on lunch, then she shoved past me and left the building.

I don’t know if I’m overreacting, but it is truly gut wrenching when you see your manager being lovely and chatty with every other employee then treating you like garbage in the span of ten minutes.

I’m 24F and recently graduated with a degree in Health Sciences, but I feel completely lost. Life didn’t go the way I expected, and now I have no idea what career path to take. What I do know is that I want financial freedom—something stable, high-paying, and sustainable long-term.

I grew up poor and I’m still struggling. I’m in a lot of debt. All I want is to build a better life and make my mom proud. She’s been through so much, and I feel like I’ve failed her. The pressure is so heavy, and eating me alive, and I don’t know how to move forward.

I’ve been debating PA school, but I don’t know if I can do it—mentally, or academically. I’ve also looked into radiologic tech and sonography, but the salaries don’t seem high enough for the life I’m trying to build. I want a career that pays well enough to give me stability and allow me to eventually start a business on the side to grow real wealth.

I don’t have a passion for anything. I genuinely love health and wellness, but I hate direct care and one-on-one caregiving. I used to be a caregiver for both children and adults, and it completely burnt me out.

Ideally, I want a career that: 
- Pays well (six figures eventually) 
- Lets me use my health degree 
- Doesn’t involve providing direct patient care  - Allows for travel or flexibility 
- Feels secure

I know tech is laying people off due to AI, and everyone keeps saying healthcare is more secure because there’s always demand—but I don’t want to be a nurse or a doctor. I really want to find something that aligns with my goals and is realistic for me, but then again there is no dream job. Which is the sad reality, all I want is financial freedom.

Right now, I feel like a failure. I feel stuck, anxious, and overwhelmed. Everyone in my extended family talks down on me and calls me a bum, and it’s killing my confidence. I’m just trying to survive, break generational cycles, and build a life I don’t hate, and make my mom proud.

If you’re a first-gen college grad, you probably understand the kind of pressure I’m under. Please—if you know of any high-paying, realistic careers (ideally travel-friendly and related to health) that could lead to financial freedom, I’d truly appreciate your guidance. I’m exhausted and I feel so lost. I’m desperate for a direction.

I have no prior coding experience, but I’m highly motivated and already have ideas for some web and mobile apps I’d like to build.

Right now, I’m applying to WGU’s Computer Science B.S. program. I plan to transfer credits and do a lot of self-study beforehand, which would let me finish the degree in about 6–8 months. WGU’s structure makes that possible. The problem is, if I graduate that quickly, I may miss out on internships or chances to gain real-world experience before entering the job market.

I’m debating whether I should:

1- Go ahead and finish the CS degree quickly, then focus on building projects afterward, before applying for jobs.

2- Pause school for now and spend 6–8 months learning coding through HarvardX, The Odin Project, and other resources while building strong projects utilizing AI tools like Claude, then go back to school.

3- Take a hybrid approach where I do the degree part-time while focusing heavily on building a portfolio and gaining experience on the side, like applying for internships that sometimes only accept current students. I perfer to finish the degree in 6-8 months since it costs around $4k every 6 months for WGU.

I really don’t want to waste time going down the wrong path. If anyone here has gone through a similar transition, especially from a non-technical background, I’d appreciate any advice.

# 🏀💼 I’m a sports agent — just launched a résumé audit + community idea for people trying to break into the industry

Hey everyone — I’ve been lurking here for a while and figured it’s time to give back a bit.

I work full-time in sports as the **Director of Football & Operations at On Time Agency**, and over the last few years I’ve helped grow our client roster across the NBA, WNBA, NIL, and now NCAA football. I’ve represented players, negotiated multi-million dollar deals, and led strategy on both the basketball and football sides of the agency.

Lately, a lot of people have been DMing or emailing me asking how to break in. So I built something small to test it out:

# Sports Résumé Audit

I’ll review your résumé from the POV of someone hiring, scouting, and advocating for players every day. I’ve worked in ops, scouting, NIL, agency strategy, and more — so I know what actually gets noticed (and what gets ignored).

📝 **Submit your résumé here**: [https://tally.so/r/np2BY1](https://tally.so/r/np2BY1)

💬 First time you use it, check your spam — the reply may land there.

🗓️ **Want a live call?** You can book one with me here for $15:

[https://calendly.com/letsbreakinai/20min](https://calendly.com/letsbreakinai/20min)

# Also gauging interest in a private sports career community

Thinking of launching a **Discord or private subreddit** with:

* Weekly résumé feedback threads
* Monthly Zooms with industry pros (ops, sales, NIL, scouting)
* AMAs with agents, coaches, and ops staff I know
* Verified job board (stuff I personally know is real)
* Group chat + accountability

I’d love to know:

* Would you be interested?
* What would be a fair price for *some* paid calls/workshops (if I bring on bigger-name guests)?
* What else would you want in a space like this?

Happy to answer any questions about breaking into agency/scouting/ops from my own journey — and I hope this helps a few people get unstuck.

If nothing else, drop your questions below and I’ll answer honestly.

Long story short, I’ve worked my ass off for the past 3 years grinding my way up to a managerial position in the construction industry (2 promotions in less than 2 years). I quit my last position a few months ago after being depressed and overworked for so long and have been looking to break into project management instead for non-construction projects. I know my skills are transferable and I have the experience, though I haven’t been getting any bites on LinkedIn or any other job sites. I do however keep getting recruiter messages for positions back in construction and I’m torn between going back temporarily until I find a job elsewhere or just wait it out until I find something I actually want to do. The only thing that’s pulling me to maybe going back to construction is the $ ofc. I’ve hated all my years in construction (despite the fact that it pays the bills) and have been burnt out, depressed and absolutely torn apart by it, but I am feeling a bit anxious and feel like i do need a job soon so I don’t run out of what I have saved. Would it be a good idea to get back to the industry I worked so hard to leave until I find another job or keep looking for a job in the field I want?

1mj7pbl,Should I stay in a stable job that doesn’t fulfill me or pursue something I’m more passionate about (with all the risks that entails)?,"Hi all, I’ve been working in Costa Rica’s public sector for 4 years, holding two part‑time roles at public institutions. I come from Social Sciences and while opportunities are limited, I’ve stuck with it because I enjoy what I do and value the social impact of my work.

**Job #1:** I’ve been in my first position since the beginning. I like what I do, the environment is positive, workload manageable, and leadership supportive. The downside is the low salary—public sector roles hardly ever offer raises or movement unless a position opens up—but I’ve stayed because the job is tolerable and I can manage financially thanks to Job #2.

**Job #2:** I started this role a few months later. It pays slightly better, and recently I secured a permanent position. I value it a lot; I know how difficult public roles are to get and how much stability it represents. But truthfully, I don’t feel good there. The workload is light, but the environment isn’t positive: communication is poor, leadership unclear, I don’t feel appreciated or valued, I haven’t connected with anyone, and I dread going to the office. It’s not toxic, but it’s uncomfortable—and that’s taken a toll on my mood.

It’s been hard to come to terms with the idea that not all workplaces are like my first one. I struggle to see this second job as what it is: a job. Sometimes I tell myself that work doesn’t have to be fulfilling—just functional—but I find that frustrating. (Fellow social sciences folks will understand: this kind of job often becomes quite personal and emotionally meaningful.)

When something unpleasant happens, it hits me harder than it should. I feel the urge to quit—but then fear sets in: giving up a permanent position I just acquired (asking for a unpaid leave isn’t really an option yet), in a context as saturated as Social Sciences in Costa Rica, where finding something stable with better conditions is very difficult.

I feel stuck between accepting this “labor reality” or risking it all to find something that excites me, knowing instability might follow. Even though I have my first job, it’s only part-time, and while I don’t want to leave it, finding another part-time that matches or exceeds the second job’s salary seems unlikely.

I don’t want to settle if I know I’m not okay with the status quo.

**Has anyone been through something similar?**  
**What strategies have helped you not take personal the negative feedback, uncomfortable workplace climates, communication failures, or lack of job satisfaction?**  
**Is it worth trying to change environments even without any guarantees?**  
**How do you know when it’s time to let go of something stable that isn’t fulfilling?**

1mj7e5r,I want to quit after a few days -- Am I the problem?,"About a month ago, I quit my previous job after nearly three years due to an increasingly toxic work environment. While I truly enjoyed the work itself and initially had a great team, the mental health toll became too significant to ignore. With the support of my therapist and loved ones, I made the difficult decision to leave in order to protect my well-being. Interestingly, my entire original team also left for similar reasons.

After taking some time to reflect, I realized it would be hard to land a new job while unemployed, so I accepted the first offer I received — an $18/hour office position. I knew it wouldn’t be a long-term fit, but I figured it would help me stay productive while continuing my job search more intentionally.

That said, I’m struggling. I’m supposed to start full-time hours next week, but even during training, I feel disengaged and unmotivated — which is unlike me. In the past, I’ve started jobs excited and ready to learn, even for entry-level roles. This time, my gut is telling me I don’t want to be here. I even called out today due to intense cramps and mood swings, and honestly, I feel indifferent about whether they keep me or not. I plan to return tomorrow and take things one day at a time, but I’m questioning whether it’s right to stay in a role where I already feel checked out. I know that's not fair to the company either.

In the past, I enjoyed entry-level roles (like being a barista or cashier), but I’ve been rejected from jobs like Starbucks and Chipotle — likely because my background seems too “professional” for them to believe I’d stay long-term. My partner, who manages in retail, confirmed that suspicion.

For context, I started my career as a public-school teacher and loved the impact I had, but after seven years, I learned that being too emotionally invested in work can seriously harm your mental health. I'm now looking for a more balanced career path. I found that balance in my most recent office job where I did HR work — which I really enjoyed. I'm scheduled to take the HR certification exam in February, though I’m not entirely confident I’ll pass on the first try. Still, I know HR is the direction I want to move toward long-term.

Right now, I’m feeling stuck — caught between needing a job and wanting to do meaningful work that doesn’t drain me mentally. I’d appreciate any feedback or thoughts on how to navigate this period, or how to better frame my situation as I continue applying to roles.",Muted-Bus-8032,1,0.6000000238418579,3,1754493324,2025-08-06 15:15:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mj7e5r/i_want_to_quit_after_a_few_days_am_i_the_problem/,8,2025

1mj6sg3,Should I take a part-time role at Cos or go for a full-time one at Prada? Feeling stuck.,"Hey everyone,
I could really use some outside perspective.

I’ve been offered a part-time position at Cos (£13.85/hr). I’m happy with the pay, and I know the work environment is fairly relaxed. The downside is some late shifts, the store closes at 9pm, but we usually leave around 11pm after cleanup.

On the other hand, I’ve been given the opportunity to interview for a full-time role at Prada, which pays slightly more (£14.42/hr) plus commission. It’s obviously luxury retail, so it sounds more impressive on paper, and I imagine there might be more structure or opportunities. But their closing time is 10pm, so realistically we’d be leaving around 10:30–11pm as well.

Here’s my thing, I’m honestly tired of retail and plan to go back and study next year for my master’s to get a stable and long term job I enjoy. I know luxury retail can be hostile/stressful, and full-time hours might burn me out before I even get to apply or prep for school. Cos gives me more flexibility and peace of mind, even though it’s less money and less glamorous. But, Prada might look better on a CV, and the extra pay is tempting, but I don’t want to get trapped in the stress of it.

Has anyone been in a similar situation, choosing between flexibility and prestige/pay in a job you don’t plan to stay in long-term?

Would love any advice. Thank you 🙏

1mj6oj5,MSW (Clinical Track) vs. Master’s in Mental Health Counseling,"Hi everyone,

I’m 34 and making a career change into psychotherapy. I’m deciding between an MSW (Clinical Track) and a Master’s in Clinical Mental Health Counseling (CMHC).

The MSW seems safer and more versatile with better reciprocity and access to schools and agencies, but it involves policy and macro-level coursework I’m not very interested in. The CMHC is therapy-focused from day one, which feels more aligned with what I want to do.

Context: I’m currently living in Spain and will move to Connecticut to study. I’d like to work in different settings, especially schools as a school-based therapist, and eventually return to Europe to run a private practice and do telehealth with U.S. clients.

Questions for those in the field:

    •Did you choose MSW or Counseling, and why?
    •How much do you actually use the non-therapy parts of an MSW?
    •Would choosing Counseling limit me long-term?
    •Any insight on school-based therapy roles for each path in CT?
    •Is there a noticeable preference in the job market for MSWs vs. LPCs?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s navigated this decision or is working in these roles now.",Sapphireflowers9,1,1.0,0,1754491715,2025-08-06 14:48:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mj6oj5/msw_clinical_track_vs_masters_in_mental_health/,8,2025

1mj57va,Can and should I negotiate future pay as an F‑1 in inventory control?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working as an Inventory Control Specialist Intern at a packaging and labeling company in New Jersey, earning $20/hour. I’m on an F‑1 visa, and during my performance review, I brought up my status. My manager was supportive: she said I’ve been so beneficial to the company and mentioned she’ll try to get me a work visa (though she’s not familiar with the H‑1B process yet). I also saw her filling out the E‑Verify form.

She told me she’d love to have me back full-time after I graduate in November, and I told her I’m interested. It was a verbal conversation, so nothing signed yet, and I’m still exploring other opportunities, but once I bring up my F-1 status to recruiters/hiring managers, the conversation ends.

I’m super grateful she’s open to bringing me back, especially knowing I’ll eventually need sponsorship. I think I’ll be paid more as a full-time hire, but I can’t be sure. $20/hour has been manageable, but it’s getting tight with my Philly-to-NJ commute, and I’d definitely be hoping for a raise if I come back full-time.

I’m currently doing a BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) from NUST, q universities in Pakistan. I’m trying to figure out how valuable this degree really is in the international job market or for further studies abroad.

I have a few questions and would really appreciate honest feedback, especially from international students or people working or studying abroad:

Is the BBA degree actually valued globally, or is it seen as outdated or too generic?
I want to combine BBA with IT and data analysis skills. Would that make a difference?
If I aim to go into management or business leadership roles, what practical skills should I build during my degree?
Some people around me say BBA has no scope or real value anymore, especially in terms of job placement. How true is that from an international perspective?
Can a BBA from NUST open doors for international work or study opportunities, especially if I add certifications like ACCA, CFA, or data-related skills?

1mj47gr,Scared for the future,"I, 19F, am an Australian university student. I’m currently studying a Bachelor of Arts. I did one semester in Law fresh out of high school (simply because I got the marks for it), and realised that I cannot justify a 5 year course when I don’t have any interest in becoming a lawyer. I changed to a BA in second semester of my first year because I don’t know what I want to do.

But that’s the issue. I have absolutely no idea, and it’s stressing me out. Everyone around me seems to have a vague, if not solid idea, but I’ve got NOTHING.

I’m thinking of majoring in psychology, and potentially pursuing forensic psychology down the road. However, I’m worried about the pay (especially with the cost of living growing every day), the job stability and availability. So I thought, why not become a criminal psychiatrist, which is what I had my heart set on for about 6 years before I grew up and realised it requires extreme commitment through med school (which is extremely hard for a NSB to get into via the GAMSAT pathway).

I’m also interested in public policy and international relations. Most of my high school subjects centred around this. I think it could be cool to merge my interest in criminology/forensics with something in this area. But again, I’m extremely worried about job prospects. For example, if I pursue a Masters in Public Policy, I am very constrained to a particular area. If I pursue a Masters in International Relations, how likely is it that I’m actually going to find a relevant and sustainable job??

I know it’s early to be thinking about this, and ultimately it is my decision to make, but I feel so lost and worried for the future.

So stressed about this please help:

Hi everyone, 2026 grad from UofT here.

Just found out I’ll have to take an extra course next summer (1st session) to complete degree requirements. Therefore, instead of receiving my ‘eligibility to graduate’ letter + official transcript in May, if I give my summer exam by June 24th, I’ll only receive the letter and apply for my work permit around mid July earliest. 

So my convocation will be in October not June, and I’ll be eligible to work mid July 

But yeah, I’m super stressed about full time start dates as a result. Are employers flexible with start dates if I need a little delay? While many roles start in the fall (I’m interested in consulting), if a firm has a June or July 1st week start date I won’t be eligible unless they allow a late start. And I’m still considered a summer 2026 graduate right?

This has been stressing me so much. Don’t wanna miss out on opportunities as a result of this delay. Am I right to worry/will this be an issue for me?

Ended up in Big Four consulting due to market conditions, but the work feels unoriginal and unfulfilling. I miss building things that matter. Now I’m torn between returning to my old, meaningful work or sticking with consulting to justify the MBA and good career progression (that's what I heard), and I'm worried that I’ve lost my grip in coding and may face stiff competition. Can you suggest what I should do?

**Detailed Journey:**  
My three years of work experience with two companies were nothing less than a blessing. I learned more than I contributed, got decent hikes, work from home, so plenty of time with family & friends, and last but not least were the great colleagues to crib about how the company and work sucks (It didn't, but let's be honest, we employees love this, don't we?)  
But somehow it was not thrilling enough (at least that's what I felt at that time), working from home within those four walls was eating me up, and every single morning, family drama, Ahhh!  
So I looked for an option that could give me some peace of mind, away from work and, of course, the four walls, and it turns out that an MBA was a sweet way to postpone my career for two years while looking all professional on my resume. So I did that. Got overwhelmed, scared and excited throughout the journey, targeted tech roles (product management). Still, since the product market was on a lower end, I got myself a consultant position in a Big 4, because it sounded like a fair choice considering all the hype, but guess what, it isn't.  
As I joined this, I realised that, living in a different city, getting dressed up for the office and making pretty PPTs all day from the predefined templates and solutions (what they call strategy) is not fulfilling enough for me. Now I crave my past work, where even though the job was a little, after the day, there was this satisfaction that I solved and made this. It is original and holds some value.  
I want to go back, but then I will not be leveraging my MBA degree from a Tier-1 institute as strategy work experience, and a Tier-1 MBA does wonders in your career at later stages, as I have heard.  
Also, this fear of not being able to cope with the work because I have lost my grip, and candidates who are more experienced and are ready to work for a lesser salary are lurking in my mind. I decided to seek advice from you guys.

**PS:** I tried making a resume and applying to big companies for analytics/product roles with good pay, but had no luck there. I am too scared to throw away the Big4 tag and start a career again in a startup right away.",Exact-Mirror-8525,2,1.0,2,1754480710,2025-08-06 11:45:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mj2ehe/analytics_to_mba_to_consulting_still_confused/,8,2025

1mj0ew1,Need advice: left my job with irrelevant experience due to hostile environment and slow growth. What to do next?,"Hi everyone,

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and would appreciate some honest guidance.

I recently left my job, where I worked for about 19 months as a Functional NetSuite Consultant. The environment had become quite hostile, and the working hours were odd and mentally exhausting. Despite spending over a year there, I didn’t gain much learning or hands-on experience, mainly because there was minimal work allocated to the India team.

Now I’m at a point where I’m trying to figure out my next step. I’m considering two options:

Focus entirely on CAT 2025 I could take the next 3.5 months to prepare seriously for CAT and not apply to any jobs in the meantime. The challenge is, I’m not very confident about cracking CAT this year with just this limited prep time — I consider myself an average student, and the uncertainty is making me nervous. Look for another job while preparing for CAT I could start applying for jobs in my domain (again, Functional NetSuite Consultant roles) and give CAT this year regardless of the outcome. This way, I’ll avoid a gap on my resume, gain some experience, and then prepare more seriously for CAT next year with more time and stability. The problem is, given my limited experience and skill growth in the previous job, I’m unsure if I’ll land a decent role or salary right now. I’d really appreciate it if someone could help me weigh these options — or share any advice if you’ve been in a similar situation.

1mizxyb,"To all the coaches, consultants, and experts here, I need your help!","Hey everyone, I’m Justin.

I’ve been in the digital marketing space for a while now, mostly behind the scenes helping other businesses grow through SEO, ads, funnels, all that. But recently I decided to finally step out and build my own brand and consultancy, something I’ve been putting off for way too long.

Now that I’m doing it, I’ve become a lot more curious, not just about strategies, but about *people*.

So I wanted to ask you, coaches, advisors, consultants, service providers:

**What’s the hardest part for you right now?**  
Not just in business, but as a person building something.

* Is it getting leads?
* Selling without feeling salesy?
* Feeling like you're doing everything yourself?
* Or even the emotional side, burnout, doubt, pressure to succeed?

Also... what’s driving you?  
Is it freedom? Time with your family? Money? Building something that finally feels *yours*?

I’m genuinely trying to understand the real stories behind the grind, just open ears. I want to learn from this and build a brand that actually helps people in a meaningful way.

So if you’re up for sharing, I’d love to hear where you’re at right now. 🙏

1miy9sb,Torn Between Two Job Opportunities — Need Advice,"Hi everyone! I’ve been sitting on this for about a week now and decided to ask for some advice from people outside my circle to help me get more perspective.

I recently had an interview with a company offering a hybrid setup, which is great for me personally due to some responsibilities at home. However, during the interview, the hiring manager asked if I’d be open to taking a position that’s fully onsite, which comes with more exposure and opportunities for career growth.

They were kind enough to give me time to decide. If I say no to the onsite role, they’ll still consider me for the hybrid position I originally applied for. I need to give my answer very soon.

Meanwhile, I’m still waiting to hear back from another company I applied to, which is actually my top preference but I haven’t received any updates yet.

So now I’m stuck between:

Saying yes to the onsite role and risking being locked in even though I’m still hoping for my top choice

Saying no and sticking with the hybrid setup while hoping the other company responds

Or just continuing to wait even though there’s pressure to respond soon.

Would it be unprofessional if I say yes now, but back out later if another offer comes (from my preferred company)? 


I know this is technically a good problem to have, but it’s been mentally draining. I don’t want to burn bridges or make a bad impression, but I also want to choose what’s best for me long-term.

1miscb8,Is pursuing a free Master's degree worth it?,"Hello, I just recently graduated with my Bachelor's degree in CS from a local college. I had a software dev internship last summer and am currently back with them working as a part-time developer 1. I can work a maximum of 30 hours per week, and they aren't currently hiring full time.

My original plan was to pursue my Master's degree at the same school in which I got my Bachelor's. I would be able to complete it in two semesters. I was offered a Graduate Assistant position in which I would have to work 20 hours per week in order to get free tuition and a stipend. Out of these 20 hours, 12 would be tutoring students, and 8 would be doing research with a professor. This is on top of the classwork, which is about 6 hours of classes a week and an unknown amount of ""homework time"" per week. This would probably be a lot to juggle, and I would need to work an additional 20 hours per week at my part time job to ""break even"" with the amount of money I'd be making without doing the Master's - but the difference is negligible, and I'd be able to work like 8-12. My employer is cool with whatever decision I decide to make.

Ultimately, I am having trouble deciding if I want to go for the master's or not. I don't think I'd get anything out of the classes - they've all been pretty useless from my experience (I've taken some classes already). BUT, it \*is\* practically a free Master's degree - albeit I'd be spending some time working for the school. My biggest fear is regretting not taking advantage of this golden opportunity if I decide not to pursue my Master's.

I've been pretty bored working the ""9-5"" at my current part-time job, so a change in schedule by doing the graduate assistant gig might be a nice change of pace. But I also don't want to overload myself with different tasks. Ultimately, I don't really want to do either, as funny as it sounds. Working sucks, and I'm not motivated to do classwork. There's also the whole debate about whether or not a Master's is even worth it - and regardless of that answer - I still fear I'll regret not taking advantage of this good opportunity to ""get it out of the way.""

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1mirwxh,Toxic boss creating issues during my notice period — should I write to HR to protect myself?,"Hi everyone,
I’m in my final week at my current job and will be starting a new role soon. While I’m relieved to be moving on, I’ve had a really tough experience with my boss and I’m unsure if I should raise it formally to HR before I leave — both as honest feedback and to protect myself.

Some background:
	•	She frequently gossips about other team members to me, and from what two close colleagues shared, I’m sure she does the same about me to others.
	•	She loses her temper easily and raises her voice in the office, even when it’s quiet — it feels like a way to shame or embarrass us publicly.
	•	She often blames the department head for decisions or confusion, but from what we can see, many of the problems are due to her poor management and lack of support.
	•	We had agreed on my handover scope, and she said I could clear my remaining leave. But after I submitted the leave request, she changed the expectations and asked me to deliver two large projects that usually take 4 months to complete — all within 3 weeks.

I’ve done my best and completed as much as I could, but I don’t want to be blamed for not finishing everything — especially when the scope and timeline were so unrealistic. I’m thinking of writing to HR to document this, but I’m not sure if it’s worth doing at this point.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would you raise this to HR before leaving, or just walk away quietly and not look back?

For context, I’m based in Singapore — not sure if local work culture plays a part here, but just adding that in case it’s relevant.",helpsssmeplease,2,0.6700000166893005,18,1754444717,2025-08-06 01:45:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mirwxh/toxic_boss_creating_issues_during_my_notice/,8,2025

1mirgad,Switching Careers,"I’m 23F and make just under 53k base salary, plus quarterly bonuses depending on sales. I have been working as a GM at a food/convenience store for the last 2 years. 
I got a position there as a clerk as a bs job to help me pay bills temporarily. Two seconds later, I had my own store. 

Anywho, two years later, we are here. I recently had a baby and being back at work has made me realize, yet again- this is not for me long term. The constant on call and demands expected from me just don’t fit my life now. It’s not fair to me, it’s not fair to my staff, and I guess it’s not fair to the company that I signed my life away to when I accepted the position. 

I unfortunately wasn’t able to go to school and get a degree after getting my highschool diploma. So here I am, at a loss. Even if I had the time, I don’t necessarily want to go into a ton of student debt to try to obtain a degree. 

My previous work experience is Walmart, as a Team Lead. Promotion after 6 months of employment. 

I’ve been thinking about what I would like to do next and could really use some suggestions. I can’t afford to make under 50k, but really would like to make at least 55k minimum. 

I’ve thought of office management (unsure which setting) and have even thought of sales. I see account management but majority of the time they would like for you to have a degree. 

I’m an extremely quick learner, eager to learn and would really love to find a career rather than a job. I’m over retail and tired of feeling stagnant. I’ve been recognized as one of the top performing managers of my zone but would like to utilize my skills and be challenged elsewhere. HELP!!!

Not really anything I was interested back in UNi, but I must say I have learned a lot more about networking here than I did at school (because I learn in practical manner).

Now that was few years ago and the job is exactly the same, no change, nothing new, unrelatable coworkers (atleast 15 years older than me and nothing in common, in world view or in normal convo), no real 'challange, no career options, no interest.

I have been working as a freelance web designer and developer as well as graphic designer on the side. Its been fun but eats up my time especially as I just got a baby, that time is nexto 0. Also the gathering of clients and the cut throat market of a small one man ""agency"" that caters to mom and pop shops (and equivalent) that have nexto zero budget as I compete against hosting service's own web site packages and them using premade templates ""that get the job done"".

I would be interested in UI and UX design but I keep seeing people saying to steer clear from it. Also graphic design positions are rare and very competitive to get.

What are some skills in the design and IT field that could fit me that I havent even considered? Like a product owner? Or the like that which are a bit more Obscure and not a direct study field? Im giving myself a year to learn or to gain skills to start applying for jobs during my paternity leave so that I can actually get a career to advance in. Im pretty much open for anything design adjacent that I can advance in. I will learn what ever needed.

1miq0y7,Just landed my first Facilities Assistant job in a small office! Any tips on how to stand out when I'll be working mostly alone?,"Hey everyone!

So, I just landed my first job as a Facilities Assistant! It's for a small office, and this is my first time working in facilities at all. So yes, I'm a total newbie but really excited to get started.

It is in a digital bank company but they have this office for those customers who feel a little left out by not having in person contact with account manager and I'll ""take care"" of the whole office building.

Here's the catch, though: it's a small company, so I'll be pretty much on my own in the office most of the time. I won't have any regular coworkers around and the officer's manager is focused not on my field, but in his investment clients and team.

My big question is, how do I make a good impression and stand out if there's nobody there to see my day-to-day work? 

How can I prove I'm doing a great job without a team or manager watching over my shoulder all the time?


And since I'm new to this whole facilities world, I'd love any pro-tips you guys have. I feel this field isn't popular as I don't get to read a lot of things about it.

Seriously, any advice would be awesome. Thanks a bunch!",Puzzle-Headed0,1,1.0,1,1754439494,2025-08-06 00:18:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1miq0y7/just_landed_my_first_facilities_assistant_job_in/,8,2025
1mipugr,"43 years old, Burned Out & Ready to Switch Careers — Need Advice for High-Demand, Better-Paying Pathswitch career","Hi all — I could really use some insight from those who’ve successfully switched careers later in life.

I'm currently working full-time in the public sector (transportation-related job). The pay isn’t enough to live on, so I’m constantly working extra hours and overtime just to survive. On top of that, the workplace environment is often toxic, and the stress and long hours are starting to take a toll on my health and time with family.

I’m 43, and I’m wondering if it’s too late to switch to a better-paying, more stable career — or if others have done it successfully around this age.


---

✅ What I’m Hoping to Find:

I’m looking for a career path that meets most of the following:

Starting pay close to $30/hr (without relying heavily on overtime)

Work–life balance (remote or hybrid would be great, but not essential)

Fast-track training (certificates or 1–2 year programs)

High demand and potential for growth

Bonus if it could eventually become a freelance or business opportunity


My current employer offers tuition reimbursement for degree programs only — no certificate coverage — but I’m willing to pay out of pocket for short programs if they’re worth it.


---

🔍 Fields I’m Considering:

Cybersecurity – seems high-paying but possibly tough competition for entry-level roles

Medical Billing & Coding – growing field, but not sure if it pays well enough starting out

Real Estate – thinking of doing part-time to test the waters

Drone Work – looking into this as a side business opportunity

GIS – I have a geography degree, but not sure if it’s enough without extra skills



---

❓My Questions:

Is it realistic to switch careers at 43 and still land a solid job within 1–2 years?

What careers would you recommend that are in high demand, pay well, and don’t require a 4-year degree?

Have you done a successful career switch in your 40s (or later)?

Anything you wish you had done differently?


Thanks so much for reading — I’m open to all suggestions and would love to hear from anyone who’s been through this. 🙏

1mipteq,Should I tell my boss that I have adhd?,"UK based.
I’ve just started a new job and I’m wondering if I either need to or should tell my boss that I have adhd. I work in retail and am capable of what they’re asking me to do but because of my adhd it means I’m often forgetful and can struggle to multitask. There are many other ways in which it affects my
life but job wise I’ve just started, its only been two weeks but this is what I think they’ve picked up on so far. Sometimes they’ll give me a list of things that need doing and I’ll likely remember the first thing or the last thing they said or maybe something in the middle but I never remember all of it. For privacy purposes I won’t disclose what company it is but it’s considered a fairly luxury retailer. It’s not as simple as writing things down, we’re not supposed to have hand written notes laying around anywhere. In terms of struggling to multitask I think they’re currently perceiving it as getting flustered. I don’t know what to do for the best. On one hand if they don’t know they can’t help but on the other hand I’m aware of the negative misconceptions about adhd so I don’t want them to think that I’m incapable, lazy or a liability in anyway. I’ve been avoiding telling them unless I feel I really need to but it’s playing on my mind more and more. It’s a catch-22 if I tell them that might be a bad thing but If I don’t that could also be bad.

I majored in something completely unrelated so I didn’t really care to know because I thought it didn’t matter to me.

Fast forward, I’m out of college and not really interested in perusing when I went for. So my question is, what can this basic experience working in a data center lead me to?

1mip1vc,Denied promotion right in my face,"Dear all, 

Hope you are doing well. 

Title pretty much says it all, I am a professional working for the government of Canada and we have this program where after 4 years past, showing that you earned the required skills (which I did, I honestly worked my ass off for those 4 years and even exceeded in my performance review a couple times). 

So now would be the time for my promotion, I’ve done everything needed, I was literally supposed to have it in 1 week. 

Today, the bomb dropped, the program is being paused temporarily (whatever that means) and people are no longer getting promoted because of budget constraints.

I’m in a highly transferable to private skills set place. My private counterparts earn more than I will ever think of in Government, but I enjoyed the Government aspect of my job. I’m not doing it for the money per se, but doing a lot of free overtime and although I’m not a materialistic person, I have quite the expectation to, at least, being paid according to my skills and at most, that the government keeps his promise in promoting me according to the program (that is in my letter of offer by the way). 

So I wanted to reach out to you guys because all I need to get the hell outta here is make a phone call to all my friends that have been begging me to leave for the last couple years. 

But I don’t want to make the bad decision and choose out of anger here. Maybe I should stay in my current position and go with the flow for a couple times (not going beyond what is asked anymore) ? I guess everything is cyclic ?

1mip03x,I AM SO LOST. Where do I go from here?,"I am exhausted. I feel like this is hopeless. This post will reflect that. And it will be long. 

My hope is that even one person who can give me useful advice may read this all the way through and respond. If that's not you, please go away. I assure you that the voices inside my head already say every negative thing you think you want to say to me. 

A \[not so little\] bit of background: I (42F) am married (42F) with one child (12F). I live in the deep south. I have a 15 year career history in the mental health field and coaching collegiate softball. I have a Master's degree in Counseling Psychology, but I am not licensed and never have been. My career path took me in a different direction. I have *many* hours in a Sports and Performance Psychology *Psy.D* program, but the school who offered the online program was a part of the huge scam several years ago, so I don't know if I could even finish that degree if I wanted to.

I have coached college softball at the community college, NCAA DII & NCAA DIII levels. I was assistant coach for all except the last where I was a head coach for three years. At that time, I was solely coaching and had not worked in mental health in a few years. In 2019, I suddenly lost that job - just in time for co-vid shut down. 

I have struggled with mental health since I was 18. By struggled, I mean that I have almost constantly been on an antidepressant and attended counseling. That worked for me, and I was an active and productive member of society for years. After I lost that job - and with the help of the co-vid isolation like most of the planet - I went into a deep, deep depression. For years, I struggled. Then, in May 2021, I tried to take my own life. It was the culmination of unhealed trauma, relationship struggles, no self-love, accumulated failures and perceived worthlessness. My wife found me, revived me, and sent me to much needed treatment. (Thankfully!) I was inpatient for about 10 days after physically recovering, and then I voluntarily spent 60 days at a trauma treatment center. I had no idea how much I needed that, and I am VERY aware of how privileged and lucky(?) I am to have been able to do that. 

I share all of that to say this - I have not worked full time since then. We were okay financially for a while, but we aren't anymore. I have held a few positions such as online tutor and local coordinator for foreign exchange students. None of them pay enough. I had finally found a position working for the Census. I liked the position, and it allowed me to see people but not constantly, and I had a very flexible schedule. I was very successful in that position, and my supervisor was arranging for me to be able to take on more work. Then, Trump was elected. When he took office, I was one of the many who were out of a job. I was simply not recertified (as this is considered 'hiring') for my temporary position, so I didn't get an offer for a severance package. I am currently pursuing rehire for that job just to try to make ends meet. 

If you are still here, bless your soul and thank you. This is where I am and how I got here. I am smart, educated, skilled and have a very diverse set of skills that could be helpful in many positions. But I don't know what to do. Or what I want to do. Or what I can do. The idea of sitting in an office anywhere is paralyzing. I am terrified that I can't do it any longer. I'm scared to take a full-time position. Despite a lot of amazing treatment for my past trauma and continued treatment, sometimes I feel like moving from the bed to the couch is successful. Other days, I can clean the entire house and complete 2 whole projects. Some days I can't put forth the energy to choose a show on television, and other days I can learn how to restore music boxes and snow globes and actually DO it. No, I'm **not** bipolar, but I do have wonderful moments of hypomania that allow me to be productive. I'm **not** catatonic usually, just overwhelmed and lost. So, you see, I have no idea how to move forward. 

I have to help provide for my family. I'm so grateful for my wife's job and to her for how hard she works. I maintain the home, but we can't afford for me to be a SAHM anymore. What do I do? Who do I talk to? What jobs may want me? Does anyone find themselves in the middle of over and under qualified for every (desirable) position out there? Please help.

TLDR - Depressed, middle-aged, formerly successful woman seeks guidance on how to move forward as an unlicensed Master's level mental health worker or guidance for career change in post-SA life.

I'm currently getting paid $90k AUD + super. Senior agronomists might get paid $110,000-$130,000 after 8+ years if they're willing to live in remote locations. At present I'm not quite experienced enough to take on some of those roles, but the handful of opportunities that exist at a similar level would mean the same pay or a pay hit.

Am I bitter for expecting more? It seems like the soft-cap for industry pay is awfully low given the high skill requirement, and hardly worth the amount of extra effort required. 

Should I cut my losses and be an electrician instead? 

Love ya. ",SeaweedFabulous,1,1.0,0,1754432932,2025-08-05 22:28:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mingrh/25_years_into_career_limited_opportunities_or/,8,2025
1minc8m,Considering 2x salary jump to client-facing role - worth it?,"Currently an engineer at a stable company with very good benefits. Working mostly remote, but its changing to 50% in office soon. Standard raises but promotions are tough due to politics/timing.

Got an offer for post-sales architect at a FAANG-adjacent big data company:

**Pros:**

* Over 2x my current TC (80% base, 20% commission - they've been meeting/exceeding targets)
* RSUs at a private company with solid potential
* They specifically wanted my type of engineering experience
* Better growth/networking opportunities

**Cons:**

* Way less coding, more client consulting
* Don't love client interaction
* Hybrid with client visits and office time
* Moving away from technical IC work

I've always wanted to break into big tech and this seems like my shot. But I'm torn about leaving hands-on engineering for client work I'm not specially excited about, but this could change once I experience it.

Anyone made a similar jump from technical IC to client-facing? Is the money and career growth worth doing work you're not passionate about? Or am I overthinking this?",more_moneys,1,1.0,2,1754432621,2025-08-05 22:23:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1minc8m/considering_2x_salary_jump_to_clientfacing_role/,8,2025
1min6zq,Am I in my right to request a raise?,"
Hi everyone, 

I’ve been working for my current company for about 6 months now- the owner is someone I worked with on a project 2 years ago so they’ve known me for a while, it’s pretty friendly. I work on the sales team but because of my marketing experience they frequently ask me for input and ideas which i usually give. My last idea was a huge hit, it completely changed the way we sell and became a huge value add for our clients. Most of our recent sales are due to my idea, which I solely built and fleshed out. 

Because I’m the only person who fully understands what I’ve created, I’ve been responsible for creating the SOP and fulfilling this offer, on top of the sales work I already do. I have one person helping me but she’s not involved in the way that I am. We just started fulfilling last week and the demand is high. I’m overwhelmed and they’ve told me they will get me a VA and want to make it easier on me. 

I want to request additional pay for all of the hours I’m putting in to this that I was never contracted to do, but I know this is a smaller company and we were slow in sales until this new offer I created. What really makes me hesitant is the last couple of months my sales were lower than usual, so I wonder if I request a raise or commission if that’s going to be used against me. 

I just feel a bit taken advantage of in all honesty. A few months ago when I created this offer I did bring up adding a commission if I need to fulfill the orders but it was cast aside because they didn’t know if it would take off at all.

Now I don’t know how to best start the conversation. Can anyone advise? Much appreciated. ",restauranteurpeki,1,1.0,2,1754432261,2025-08-05 22:17:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1min6zq/am_i_in_my_right_to_request_a_raise/,8,2025

1milyn4,I guess a degree in cultural anthropology really is useless and now I’m stuck career wise and I don’t know what to do,"22f I just graduated with a BA in cultural anthropology in May and I can’t get a single interview for anything other than scammy sounding jobs that seem like MLMs. I applied for internships too and I couldn’t get any. What really kills me is that I feel like I did a lot academically and still can’t get anything. I diversified my degree to have focus in public health and online culture and AI, maintained a 4.0 all throughout college, have experience coding with R to perform statistical analysis and using GIS and have done extracurricular research since I was in the honors college, one of them was even funded by a small grant. I also participated in doing research on food insecurity for the school board for one of my classes. I also held a job as a server all throughout college. And I am bilingual. No legitimate job wants to hire me. I can’t even get jobs that a degree is not needed for like an entry level paralegal. I don’t know if I’m just applying in the wrong places or something or my degree and so called experience is just genuinely worthless. Because that’s how it feels. 

If you’re asking why I majored in anthropology was because I initially wanted to stay in academia when I entered college. I still want to go to grad school but I want to hold off until the mess with this administration is over and because I would need enough funds to pay for it and obviously my current position doesn’t really allow me to make enough money quickly. (Not taking out loans, i graduated college debt free and I would like to stay debt free). Please don’t tell me oh you’re young don’t worry, even though I’m young I’ve been stuck living with my parents working a job I hate in a city I hate for 5 years in the name of finishing my degree, plus you never know what could happen. I want to move on with the next step of my life while I’m young, not another decade from now. 

What do I do? What should I get a cert or something? More experience??? Try networking even though begging people I hardly know for a job seems like a sure fire way not to get one?? 

Sorry if I sound really negative but I’m just so exhausted of trying so hard and getting nothing for it.

1milfwl,"Applied to government job, now they contacted my boss… but I haven’t quit yet. What do I do?","I currently work as the only employee for a solo attorney. He’s my boss, HR, and supervisor all in one. I’ve been here for almost a year as his assistant/paralegal.

Since pretty early on, I’ve been applying to other jobs because of issues with the work and environment. 

Recently, I applied to a government contractor position and received a conditional offer. The job isn’t guaranteed yet, it depends on which company wins the contract, but I had to fill out background check paperwork about a week ago.

Now the Department of Defense has mailed forms to my current workplace asking my boss to verify that I work there and basically confirm I’m in good standing. This means I’m going to have to tell him something, but I haven’t put in my notice and I don’t even know when or if I’ll be leaving.

It’s awkward because I don’t want to create tension when there’s a chance the job doesn’t even go through. At the same time, he’s extremely reliant on me, and I feel guilty for not being able to give proper notice or a timeline. I want to be upfront, but I also don’t want to put myself in a bad spot if I end up staying here longer than expected.

How would you approach this? What’s the most professional way to handle it?


TL;DR:
Got a conditional offer for a government contractor job. The DoD sent paperwork to my current boss, but I haven’t told him I’m job hunting and there’s no guarantee I’ll get the job. How do I bring this up without damaging the working relationship?

I do just fine networking with the trades/subcontractors, but when it comes with women empowerment and long ass speeches and people taking photos just for Linkedin-- it's not for me. 

I'm pretty quiet and prefer to work in the backend where I do my job absolutely well, but I just don't like to talk to people much outside my coworkers and vendors. My role doesn't require much client-facing and I don't bring in clients or anything like that.

But my boss is impressed by HR's activity on Linkedin and how outspoken she is and that's great for her, but it's just not me. I also don't find it fair that I'm the only woman in the company and none of the other 18 guys have to attend these panel talks. 

Am I just complaining? Or I have every right to not want to join this woman's club. I've been to a handful and always end up leaving early because women talk down on men and get on their high horse or I get bored or have to work.

1mijo54,Phased retirement boss is checked out,"Looking for advice here.

I'm 5 months into a new role with a company I've worked 5+ years for. This role has had many challenges, not limited to, but including an ambiguous reporting structure, conflicting feedback and uncommunicated expectations. Basically, I report to 3 people, 2 of which are terrible managers who have made it clear that they do not like me.

To date, I have met or exceeded all of the goals the group agreed on at the start of my role. I'm not perfect and there have been small errors or miscommunications, but nothing outside the norm. But my relationship with the 2 external managers has become very strained because of the issues above (unclear and uncommunicated expectations, conflicting feedback, refusal to let me implement processes to help the organization, etc.)

2 months into the role, I expressed my concerns to my primary boss, and she did nothing. Things got slightly better for a while, and now, they're bad again. I've tried to stay positive and have passed along documentation to my boss, but in our last 1:1, she was so checked out and her comments made it clear that she doesn't see anything wrong with the way I'm being treated and has no interest in addressing the issue. She's in a phased retirement and only works 2 days a week remotely so it's very clear to me that she's just done and isn't going to help me here.

Meanwhile, I am nearing 8 months pregnant, busting my butt to show my worth and efforts to the two other managers making my life hell. The other day, they hinted that they would fire me if I did not improve. Today, my primary boss told me that the other 2 think I'm argumentative and combative toward them. I disagree, but at this point, emotions are going to be involved when you're casually threatening my job security and healthcare access. 

Other than hoping I survive to my maternity leave, my only other option at this point is to take my concerns to the grandboss. I did bring my concerns to him at 2 months in and he seemed fairly supportive, but he also is a busy guy so I've tried to handle this the right way first.

Should I go ahead and bring this up to him? Or wait until after baby? Any other options?

1mijdi2,"2 months into new role with no pay, limited access, and being told to fix things I can’t even reach. At a loss...","Hey everyone, looking for advice or at least some sanity check here.

I started a new remote role as Director of Communications at a legitimate nonprofit about two months ago. The org does important work, has a real presence, and I was genuinely excited to join. But since day one, it’s been a chaotic mess — and this is the first time in my career I’ve ever experienced this level of unprofessionalism in a workplace.

Here’s what’s happening:

* I’ve still have not received a single paycheck. It’s been over 8 weeks. I've followed up regularly since the 5 week mark, and leadership just keeps saying, “I’ll get to it tomorrow.” One such individual told me ""we tried to pay you but the payment bounced"" and hasn't attempted to do anything about it. I confirmed with my bank that there was no transaction attempt recorded, and that the account number I shared with the employer was correct. 
* I’m locked out of about 50% of the tools and platforms I need to do my job, such as shared drives, brand assets, social accounts, project management software. I’ve flagged this repeatedly. The only individuals who can grant access is the same one saying, “Tomorrow.”
* To make it worse, leadership is asking me to fix communications issues or strategy problems that literally require the access I don't have. I’ll explain why I can’t take action yet, and… they’ll just ignore that part and ask again the next day.
* There’s no one else internally who can help move things forward. So I’m stuck in this bizarre loop: no pay, no access, no solutions — but still being asked to “lead” comms.

I’ve been documenting everything, trying to be patient and professional, but I’m honestly starting to feel taken advantage of. I want to believe this is just disorganization or leadership overload… but I’m starting to wonder if it’s plain negligence at this point?

Has anyone dealt with something like this? Would you walk away? Escalate? Report it? I don't want to cause unnecessary drama — but also can't keep donating my time and energy like this indefinitely.

I'm praised in secret by company big guys while I'm actually slacking off. What do I do?
Advice
I work at a large software company with a pretty big hierarchy

Me and a few other developers

Our team lead

Then the engineering director, product director, and other department heads

Recently, the product director sent out a shoutout for how well I did on my tasks and for the success of some features I worked on - sending it to most of the top people in the company.

My team lead told me about it (and of course told me to keep it private).

I did perform well, but I honestly don’t know how to feel. A director taking the time to shout out one developer to all the other directors feels surreal, almost like it isn’t real life. I even saw the email chain and the replies from the other directors agreeing - but it still felt random. Imagine the top ten people in the company praising you in a secret email thread without you even knowing about it - ain’t that weird? Like I would have told my lead to shit his pants if I didn't see the email thread wouldn't have believed it. And he showed me.

At the same time, I feel like an impostor. The things I’m being praised for were tasks I personally thought were pretty easy.

There was even a feature in the past that either me or my teammate could have worked on, and I basically said, “nope, that’s way above my pay grade,” and let him take it. It’s not that he is more skilled - I’ve just been alazy at work (quiet quitting after a four of years without a raise), so I tend to skip challenging tasks, just fill in the time with easy shit and watch Netflix.

So it feels like my praise isn’t from talent but from luck: I got the easy wins, and my teammate got the really hard assignment that sadly failed and ate up development time. That makes me look like a star by comparison.

Even my lead praised me, saying something like, “I shouldn’t say this, but relative comparisons are easy to see, and you’re levels ahead of him.” Meanwhile, in my head, I was like: “No, dude. I’ve just been on this project for a while and know the codebase and team dynamics inside out. My teammate joined a few months ago, on a project that’s kind of a mess, and then got handed a nightmare assignment that I wouldn’t have touched either.”

So yeah… on paper I look amazing, but in my head, it feels like luck and circumstance.

So the situation is just surreal to me, like if anything I would have expected them to catch on my quiet quitting, but the he praised me and then showed the directors praising me and I was like wtf, what did I smoke?

How do I deal with this? And is there any way to get anything out of it while at it? Each year there's no money for the raise (no team member got any so it's fair), so idk if there's anything to this situation. And yes I've been trying to look for something but Im in a such a niche tech stack that I've had no luck (although it's also my fault that I've should have prepared more for the very few interviews I've got due to this bad job market).",Emotional_Cut2206,0,0.5,1,1754421699,2025-08-05 19:21:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1miima3/im_slacking_at_work_yet_im_being_praised_what_do/,8,2025
1mii92p,New “Promotion”,"TLDR: Should I start looking for a new job because it feels like this role wasn’t really necessary in the first place and I don’t want to end up screwed when they randomly decide to lay me off? Or do I hang in there a bit longer and hope they just botched the rollout and dumped it on a manager who hasn’t had direct reports in forever?

Hey all,

First time poster, long time lurker. This might be a bit rambley but I’ll try to keep it tight.

So I just got a “promotion” at the company I’ve been with for almost 5 years. In my last role, I was finishing up my bachelor’s degree (just graduated in May). For the past year and a half I’ve been trying to find a position that actually lines up with the degree. I applied to a bunch of roles within the company, both at my current site and others.

Last October I interviewed for a Supervisor role, and it went really well. The Director said I made a great impression. I didn’t get the job, but I was told they were working on creating a new position in another department just for me, and I just needed to be patient while they got everything sorted out. It took a month to post, then another month before I interviewed, and it was super obvious during the interview that they had no real idea what they wanted out of this role. Around the same time, I was asked to help cover some of the workload for someone going out on medical leave, on top of my regular duties.

I was still interested in the role, but then another month passed before I heard anything again, just to be told they needed another month to figure things out. Eventually I had a conversation with my manager where I was told leadership got cold feet, but the person I was covering for during their medical leave really liked working with me and requested I be added to their team. So I was told again that they’d be creating a new role for that, and to hang tight while they handled the backend stuff. This was sometime in late February or maybe early May.

I kept following up with the Director, and I was told the delay was because their boss needed to approve everything. So I just kept waiting and occasionally doing one-off tasks for that team. Then in mid-July, out of nowhere, my manager calls me and asks me to come in early for a meeting with him and the Director. They tell me the promotion is finally going through, and I’m getting bumped from a grade 7 to a grade 12. This is all happening during a big layoff, so they had no actual start date for me because HR was overwhelmed. I was only told who my new manager would be.

I messaged my new manager just to introduce myself and let him know I was looking forward to chatting more about the role. About a week later we had a 15-minute meeting which was just a meet and greet. He said there was still some HR stuff to work out but the plan was to have me start either July 28 or August 4, depending on how fast that gets sorted. I still hadn’t gotten anything official like an offer letter or anything with my compensation.

The 28th came and went, but on July 30 I got a message from the new manager saying everything went through with HR and I just had to log into the payroll system and accept the offer. But there was still nothing about salary in there, just the usual HR legal stuff to agree to. I accepted it anyway and asked if I’d be getting a separate document with pay info. He said he’d check with HR. I also asked what hours he expected me to work and never got a response.

Later that night, I woke up and checked the payroll system again and finally saw what my new salary was. It’s basically what I made before, just as salary instead of hourly. Since I usually worked 2-3 hours of OT per week, this means I’m actually making about $200 less per paycheck before taxes. So much for a promotion.

Monday morning I just showed up at the time listed on his calendar. He was about 20 minutes late, so I waited in the cafeteria because I didn’t even know where my new desk was. When he showed up, he said they hadn’t figured out where I’m sitting yet, so he put me in a small conference room for the day. No training, no walkthrough of what I should be doing. I just sat there all day.

At the end of the day, I checked in with him and he said we’d talk more tomorrow with someone from the team to see what I could help with. The next day, same story. No tasks, no real direction. I finally bugged him around 11:30 and now I’ve got a meeting scheduled, so maybe I’ll get actual work soon. Still no update about a desk, even though there are a ton of open ones. I also plan on asking again about the pay situation, because at this point it feels like I’m being shorted and this doesn’t really feel like a promotion at all.

So now I’m wondering if I should start looking for a new job. It honestly feels like they created this role without really needing it, and I don’t want to get laid off because they realize that too late. Or should I hang on a bit longer and hope they just rolled this out really badly and it eventually turns into something real.",Alone-Tomatillo6548,1,1.0,0,1754420869,2025-08-05 19:07:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mii92p/new_promotion/,8,2025

1mihszj,"23, Torn Between Two Wildly Different Opportunities — Need Some Honest Advice","Hey all, I could really use some perspective on a big decision I need to make. I’m 23 and trying to figure out what the right move is for the next few months. I’ve got two very different opportunities lined up from September through December, and I’m totally torn between them.

Option one is an internship at a production company in Los Angeles. It’s in-person two days a week. The pay is pretty minimal, but the connections are solid and it’s in the industry I want to work in long term. It feels like a smart career step, especially at my age when breaking in is tough.

Option two is very different. A close friend of mine is offering to pay me around $12,000 to hitchhike across the country with him for three months. He has sponsorship deals with brands like New Balance and is producing content as part of the trip. He wants me to come along as his cameraman and help out with filming, logistics, and everything in between. It would be a fully paid, wild, creative road trip, and I’d also have the chance to work on my own projects along the way.

Both options take place over the same time period. On one hand, the internship is more stable and could help me in the long run. On the other hand, this trip feels like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I know I won’t get too many chances to travel the country, get paid for it, and create while doing it.

Part of what’s making this tough is the feeling that if I take the trip and step away for four months, I’ll come back and things won’t be the same. A lot of my friends are starting their lives in real ways — new jobs, new cities, new relationships. I worry that when I return, everyone else will have moved on and I’ll be starting from scratch. I also feel a bit guilty about leaving my family. I’m really close with them and they’ve been a huge support system.

I know this is ultimately my choice, but if anyone has gone through something similar or has advice, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.",dcondon123,2,1.0,2,1754419891,2025-08-05 18:51:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mihszj/23_torn_between_two_wildly_different/,8,2025
1mihjd6,No degree what options do I have?,"I’ve worked a minimum wage job for ten years and it’s the only job I’ve had. It’s in retail customer service and I haven’t moved up or really gained anything from it. 

The industry has taken a downturn and I want to actually try and have a career. I don’t have many skills and my social skills aren’t great. What options are available to me? I know that trades is an option but I’ve never been very good with my hands. I’m not fit enough for the army. 

How do I get over the worries and concerns of going into another job I don’t have a great level of confidence and when I look on Indeed I see lots of jobs but I’m not sure I could do any of them. I worry about going from my current working environment which is slow and not very involved to a faster paced job that requires actual effort which my current job doesn’t. I worry that I won’t be able to keep up and will get sacked. 

I know I won’t be able to get much if anything without qualifications and going to uni is not viable as I wouldn’t be able to afford it and I’m not sure I would get in or be smart enough for it. 

Is Indeed and other sites like it the best way to search? I noticed a new gym has opened up near me and I never saw any openings for it (not that I could work there of course) and it got me wondering if there are other places to go. I did start a LinkedIn but to be honest don’t really know what I’m doing on there.

1mih27k,Should I call most of the companies to inform them that I would like to work with them or should I just meet with them in person?,"I went to college outside of my US state for undergrad and I returned to my parent’s house in my city, after finishing. It’s been a few years since I graduated from college and I have been jobless ever since. I received a quantitative degree and I had wanted to go into tech (specifically data analytics). However, I have been unsuccessful; the tech industry is currently having massive layoffs and many, many people also want to go into tech. As a result, I have shifted towards other fields such as the warehouse/food manufacturing and restaurant industry. However, like tech or any other industry/field, I don't have any work experience in these fields. I literally don’t have any friends, family or even neighbors that can help me get a job.  As a result, I recently went to a city funded career services program and I got lined up with a career coach. He helped me craft a resume.

Since then, I have applied for many positions online but I've mostly received rejections.I also visited or contacted employment/staffing/temp agencies and it has been unsuccessful. 

For example, I visited an employment agency and I emailed the person who I met with. A week after that, I emailed the same recruiter to follow up and I received an odd automatic email. I called the office only to find out that the recruiter has left the company.

I emailed the head of a recruiting staffing agency to ask if they had more jobs than what was listed. He asked for my resume which I emailed back to him. He replied that there were no appropriate jobs for me.

I called another temp agency and one of the main recruiters picked up the phone. I asked if they had more jobs than what was listed. The recruiter asked me to email my resume and a recruiter would get back to me if there was a suitable job. It’s been three weeks and I have not heard back from anything. It also doesn’t help that the ratings and the reviews of many of the staffing/temp agencies are not that good.

I've called a few other employment/staffing/temp agencies and they told me that the jobs that they have listed are the only jobs they have listed and those jobs were not appropriate for me.

I am willing to do what I can to attempt expedite my ability to get a job because I am sick of just applying to jobs online and being unemployed. Recently, I've came across a bunch of warehouses/food manufacturing companies that don’t have jobs listed on their linkedin page or a careers/jobs section on their website. In two of these places, they ask prospective candidates to email them. 

Should I call most of the companies to inform them that I would like to work with them or should I just meet with them in person?

When this person returned to work, I continued to work at the same organization. Since then I work pretty much as an assistant to the person I was covering, but without a new title. My workload has slowed down a bit, so then they pushed me towards managing the IT side of things (mind you I have 0 experience) I'm just a middle person between the IT people we hired and the organization. Anyways, the job comes with good benefits, lots of holidays off including March Break, and I have the best co-workers ever. The thing is, I feel like I'm not doing a job that I enjoy and I feel anxious every day to come into work.. I don't feel as motivated as I did when I started this job, and there isn't any positions within the organization I am interested in, or if I am its an evening & weekend job. 

Also, I had just lost my brother and my boss was super good to me during this time giving me more than 5 days of bereavement leave.... 

  
I think I just feel a lot of guilt about leaving a job, and also worry that I won't find an organization as caring and supportive as this one.

* A Python 2D RPG engine with data pipelines for rapid content creation,,
* An OpenGL renderer with procedural terrain,,
* A compiler for the ""MiniTriangle"" language in Haskell,,
* …and more.,

I’ve recently received interest from two companies:

* A world-renowned AAA studio (they're releasing a massive game next year) for a Systems Engineer role,,
* And a smaller gambling/game studio for a Game Client Developer position.,

Both are responding quickly (sometimes within 10 minutes), and both seem to be fast-tracking me.  
I've never interviewed for a CS role before, and I'm looking for advice on how to handle the situation well.

My Current Strategy:

* Book any further interviews with the AAA studio ASAP to move that process forward quickly.,
* Try to delay scheduling the smaller studio’s interviews slightly, to give the AAA pipeline more time to reach a decision.,

My Question: If the smaller studio ends up offering me a position before I hear back from the AAA studio, what’s the best way to handle that? Should I ask for time to decide? How do I professionally ""stall"" without losing the offer?

1mieltm,I’m a bit stuck right now and not sure what direction to go. What’s helped you?,"Hello!

I need some advice, or even just some personal stories of other people to help motivate me and keep me going. I have no idea what path to take and have a few concerns. I'm 37/F. I moved to another state last year and took any job I could find. Currently, it's for a pretty terrible call center that I just can no longer work for. 

I need to figure out my next step with a career going forward. Most of my work has been remote and customer service focused. Most of that was done through social media and community moderation. I've also worked as an independent social media manager for a few small companies. My thought here was to go for marketing, but I didn't enjoy it at all. Instead, I was going to go for Communications. However, looking through Reddit and doing some research... it seems like there's no future for me here given my age and the amount of people that already can't find work here. 

Given that I'm almost 40, I know I need to be selective about the path I choose and start on it as soon as possible. However, I have no clue where to even begin. Everything I look into has everyone screaming, ""There aren't any jobs! It's a waste of time!"" - and that scares me. I don't have any time to waste. Whatever I go forward with has to be it. 

I'd love some advice or suggestions. I'm pretty open to anything. I need a new job asap and also need to work toward a better future. Meaning new job for the time being, but working toward something better at the same time.

I'd also love to connect with people in a similar boat. Or if you've been in this situation, I'd love to hear your personal story and where you ended up.

1midz82,Deciding between two jobs early in my career,"Hey everyone,

I’m deciding between two job offers and could use some input.

For context, I was working as a data migration consultant on SAP projects but was recently laid off. I’m now looking to get back into the field and trying to figure out which path makes the most sense in the long run.

One offer is a consulting role in SAP Ariba with a well-known SAP partner. It comes with structured training, a clear career path, client-facing work, and full benefits including healthcare and a 401(k). It seems like a solid way to build deep expertise in SAP Ariba and stay on the consulting track, especially in procurement and supply chain.

The other is a rotational engineering role at a manufacturing company. It’s a two-year program where I’d rotate across operations and engineering teams. I’d be using SAP, but more as an internal end user to support processes like procurement, production, and maintenance. The salary is a bit higher, and the benefits are strong, including 401(k) contributions, profit sharing, and relocation support. It feels very stable, but SAP wouldn’t be the main focus.

I’m torn between continuing in the SAP space through consulting or shifting into a broader engineering role that uses SAP but isn’t centered around it.

Would really appreciate any thoughts from people who have worked in either type of role. Thanks in advance.",Lucilfer99_99,1,1.0,0,1754411559,2025-08-05 16:32:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1midz82/deciding_between_two_jobs_early_in_my_career/,8,2025

1midnph,What would be the best major/career field for me?

1miceto,Traditional counselors are so 2010,"
Just spent 40 mins with a counselor who told me to ""explore my feelings"" and then Googled career options after B.Com in front of me 😭

Meanwhile, my GenAI career mentor just showed me a mind-blowing visual map of skills, real-time job openings, salary trends, AND threw in a confidence boost saying, “You’ve got potential in Product Management ”

Old counselor: “Have you tried journaling?”
AI mentor: “Here’s a personalized roadmap, 3 free courses, and a meme to keep you going.”

Honestly, one felt like my school principal. The other felt like a nerdy best friend with a GPU.

Can we all agree traditional counselors peaked in 2010? It’s 2025—if your mentor doesn’t use data, visuals, and a little sass... are they even trying?

1miby57,Finance Grad – From Low-Paid Accounting to Research Analyst (£42k) – Smart Move or Not?,"Hi all,

Looking for some honest feedback from people in the industry.

I’ve just been offered a Research Analyst role in London, with a salary of around £42k. The role involves tracking financial markets, central bank updates, and global economic events — not too technical, but it requires strong language skills and attention to detail.

Now, the context:
	•	I have a Master’s in Global Finance
	•	Like many grads, I’ve been struggling for a while — it’s been nearly two years of job hunting, setbacks, and uncertainty, especially in this tough economy
	•	I eventually took a low-paid accounting job (close to minimum wage), mainly just to stay within the finance space — but it had no real growth prospects
	•	Now I’ve finally got this offer — my first real opportunity in research, though I have no prior experience in this area

My main questions:
	•	Is £42k a reasonable starting point for someone new to research?
	•	Could this be a strong long-term stepping stone into areas like market analysis, macro strategy, or investment research?
	•	What would you suggest I start learning now to grow into more senior or technical roles?

It feels like a turning point after a long grind, but I want to be sure I’m making a smart move — not just reacting to a better salary. Any insights would be massively appreciated. Thanks in advance!

1mibrd6,Quitting your corporate/post grad job,"TLDR: Has anyone quit their “big girl/boy job” that they got after undergrad/college because you realized its not what you want anymore and went to work somewhere like retail or serving or just any other job that isn’t what you went to school for/a corporate job while you figure out your next move? 

For context, I am a 25 year old thats been out of college since December 2022, I’ve been working as a paralegal since then bc i wanted to dip my toes in the legal field before committing to law school, but very early on I realized i realized it’s definitely not for me and I’ve just been on a what do i wanna do next journey since then. A lot of big life changes and just personal matters have happened to me since then as well but for the most part I’ve just been staying here until i find another job or what else i want to do. 

This year especially I  have been doing a lot of self reflecting and realized that not only do i hate my job and this career (its not toxic its just not fulfilling and i just don’t like what i do, and i have adhd so if you have it yk how debilitating it can be working in something you genuinely dont like). The job market is trash and im still figuring out what I want to do moving forward and if i wanna do a career change to what etc, so previously my plan was staying here until i secure another job because obviously i need this job to pay my bills, health insurance etc. 

It was going okay, but recently I’ve had such a big urge/impulse, im talking its an itch in my brain i cant scratch and like a voice in my head keeps pressuring me to do it, to quit my job and work something else while i figure it out. The logical part of me is fighting it because i get paid “okay” but enough to cover my car payment, i definitely need the health insurance, its a stable job with a stable check etc so i know i really shouldn’t, but its just been hard coming in everyday. I do have adhd but im medicated rn, and previously the meds helped me focus even when i hated my tasks or found them boring, and I’ve already had an increase in dosage but even they don’t help anymore. Im just really unsatisfied and unfulfilled. 

And i know a job is a job at the end of the day and it shouldn’t fulfill me, i do have hobbies and passion projects I’ve began to do again, but it feels like this job is still sucking my soul away and like i can’t concentrate on finding my passion or my next move because of the noise it creates. It doesn’t help that I work in a cubicle with no windows and it looks like a closet so i just literally feel like im in a prison. I find myself getting distracted so much at work and i also don’t want be an unproductive worker so i don’t get fired but idk what to do. Part of why i also dont want to quit is because, and this is no shame at all to people working those jobs, but im a first gen college graduate so I kind of put this pressure on myself and it feels like if i do quit to get something else even if it’s temporary while i figure it out, im failing. Like i did all that hard work and my parents sacrificed so much for me to go to school and it was all for nothing. Idk irrational thoughts maybe but its whats making me spiral.

Has anyone ever done that, like quit their corporate job and take of a random job that has nothing to do with their career/degree, just as like a temporary thing while you figure things out?",Beautiful_Home_2863,1,1.0,7,1754406460,2025-08-05 15:07:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mibrd6/quitting_your_corporatepost_grad_job/,8,2025
1mib8nw,[ Update ] Old boss is poaching me to his current company. What should I do?,"I made a post here 2 days back.

TL;DR of the original post- I joined company A a year ago with 40 team members. After layoffs and resignations (including my boss and manager leaving for company B), I was promoted to manager with a promised 50% raise but haven’t received my new contract or pay. Ben from company B offered me a job twice, which I declined due to weekend work. Company A has better work-life balance but contract delays; company B offers higher pay and old teammates but more work and Saturdays.

Today, I received a call from HR at company A saying my contract is ready, but with one condition: I’ll get only a **30% raise** in my monthly salary, and the remaining **20%** will be accumulated and paid as a **retention bonus** every six months (for 1 year). If I leave before completing six months, I’d have to return the bonus. They’re also pressuring me to make a decision very quickly—ideally the same day. I managed to get an extra day to decide, but I’m unsure what to tell them since I want more time to wait for Ben’s response.

I spoke to Ben (my old boss) and told him that I’d need a 20% increase over my current compensation. He said he would discuss it with management and get back to me. I was hoping for an immediate yes, but he didn’t give one—though I suppose that’s understandable.  
  
I’m really hoping Ben comes back with good news, because if he doesn’t, I don’t want to stay with company A.

Advice on how to proceed with company A?

1miavgs,Is it realistic to ask for nearly double salary if switching roles mid-year?,"Hi Guys

Wanted to ask for your opinion on something that’s been on my mind.

A little background about me: 27 years old, graudated 4 years ago and right after graduarion started my carrer in the banking sector.
About 7 months ago I joined a major bank in poland as a junior account manager. At the time, I was in talks with two places the one I eventually joined, and another company that seemed promising but moved slower. Even though they were offering a bit more, I went with the first because they acted faster and I didn’t want to keep them hanging.

Funny twist:
That same hiring manager from back then reached out to me again recently. Now they’re hiring for a more senior version of the same role, in the same office just a different team. We had a great vibe back then and kept a friendly tone even after I declined. Compared to my current boss (who’s… let’s just say not exactly supportive or easy to work with), this guy seems like someone I’d genuinely enjoy working with.

Here’s the thing:
Right now I’m on ~€1,900 gross/month (a little below local market average) They’re open to talking about ~€3,800 gross/month for the new role. I know it sounds like a huge jump, but: It’s a senior-level position now. I’d be giving up my annual bonus due to the mid-year change. And frankly, the environment wouldnt be that differenct but maybe a little healthier

Do you think that asking for this kind of comp is unrealistic, or could it be fair under the circumstances?

I am considering where I want to go with my career after I go back to work and after the past year of thinking it over I have really been interested in Hr.

1mi9gzp,Sell my business for another career? Stay or go? Advice needed,"I had the opportunity to start my own business as an short term insurance broker, back in the year 2020 when covid hit and I was 24 years old. My first commission received was R2,800 (South African Rand), fast forwards 5 years later, I turned 29 this year, and my monthly commission is now between 36-38k. So thats a solid annual increase of 5-6k per year, which in my opinion is pretty solid since other jobs barely give you 10%. I am on the very edge of selling my business (Clientele) and being on the lookout for something else, I truly hate working with clients sometimes, and it has a huge impact on my mental health. On the other hand, I dont wish to sell it because the pay is somewhat okayish and the new business I get yearly equates to Gross 5-6k increase in my monthly commission, but the fact that I worked my entire ass off is probably the most deciding factor. People keep pointing out to me that I am so blessed and in the top percentile of earners my age, but I call bullshit. Dont live a high life, but love spending a bit of money on the things I adore. My idea is to sell my clientele and get a normal job as to oppose to working for myself. I do recon I could find something in the same pay range, and it will be less stressful than my current situation, but in the long term I would probably be worse off financially since due to my current annual increases.

Recently, I was told by my departments manager that the higher-ups understand we are working very hard and she encouraged me to stick around bc we will all be “rewarded”, I assumed it would be a raise or a bonus of some sorts. So they ended up raising the starting rate to $13 an hour. Everyone who was making $11 an hour will now make $13 an hour. The people who were making more than $11 an hour all got around $1 an hour raise. And me I got nothing, I’m the only one who didn’t get one, presumably because I got a dollar raise two months ago.

1mi8sdb,Taking a new job or not,"I've been working at the same company for a little over 4 years - we are a CX/UX design consulting firm where I am a ux consultant. 

Recently I've been offered a new job with ~15% higher pay from an ex client and I'm not sure what to do. The new firm is definitely better from a resume perspective but i could use some advice:

Pros:
1. New job pays better from a base salary perspective. My current firm is basically a startup and pays a little below market rate. I've discussed the offer with my boss (who is excellent by the way) and she is coming up with a plan for me to make up the salary difference by getting into consulting sales and making commission. But from a base salary perspective the new job would be about a 15-20% jump.

2. The new firm would look better on a resume. Not a FAANG or anything like that but it's a well established, government backed local consulting firm with much more in revenue

3. The ex client who is offering the role would be my director and he's an excellent operator. I only worked with him about 3 months but there is a lot I could learn from him.

Cons:
1. Culture - the company has terrible Glassdoor reviews. And although I know who would be my manager and team (I worked with them before, they are good guys) this concerns me. On top of this my current boss and company is excellent in this regard.

2. Role - I would be doing more general consulting and less design work. I'd say at my current job it's around 40% UX design and 60% consulting (depending on the engagement) but in the new role I suspect it would be more like 20% vs 80%.

1mi8r9t,Stuck between technical and management,"Hi,

I would like some advice on my situation and how I should approach it.

I’m a 30M, I have MSc in AI & Machine Learning.

I’ve been a tech lead at a university in Australia for almost a year now, the department I’m a part of is going through a restructure. 

The culture here is bad, backstabbing, sabotage, management overloading people with work outside of their responsibilities to make themselves look better, unrealistic expectations etc etc.

I’ve interviewed for the group manager that sits above me, hoping that I can at least protect my area (Cloud & GenAI) from that culture, but if I am successfully I’ve been looking outside, I’ve had an interview for a Head of AI role at a smaller private company as well.

I’ve reflected on my experience so far and I’m not sure on what route I should go.

While I have a strong technical background, going from grad to software engineer, lead data engineer, lead systems engineer and now to technical lead, I think that the safer and more lucrative approach to the next 5 years is trying to get into the c-suite.

To that end, I find myself in this weird middle ground where I’m still technical, I do code reviews and system designs and I’m not “management” even if I look after budgets and vendor engagement, mentoring and assisting teams, being a liaison for future work, bringing various departments together to solve problems etc etc.

On paper, it looks like doing the right things to set myself up, but I feel like I’m stuck in this situation.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you for your time.",EndlessZorga,1,1.0,0,1754399354,2025-08-05 13:09:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mi8r9t/stuck_between_technical_and_management/,8,2025
1mi8i73,"WTF do I do now? Having a hard time finding my way after being a startup entrepreneur, consultant and project manager/strategy lead in finance.","Hi everyone,

I am having a hard time figuring out what the best career path for me would be now. If you could help me out, that'd be great!

I started my career as a marketing freelancer. Then, I worked as a strategy consultant for 7 years, which led me into finance after receiving an invitation to work full-time with a client. Worked there for 3 years, achieved great results but got seriously burned out. 

Took a sabbatical year and when I came back to the market, I ended up landing a job (through networking, without applying) at a marketing consultancy firm that had some investments in startups. Worked there for almost 2 years while also becoming a late co-founder of one of the startups. 

The firm did not have money to invest in the startups and I had the possibility of staying with one startup (early stage, no funding either). I chose to quit because I'd have to raise money for the startup by myself and lead it all the way to an exit while making little to no money from it at all, just paying bills.

My CV: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K7KIrTNmC-LnMJRTLAplBqNvUpJrO1Zx/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K7KIrTNmC-LnMJRTLAplBqNvUpJrO1Zx/view?usp=sharing)  
  
I have tons of experience, am very insightful and results-oriented (see from my CV). But I suck at applying and interviewing for jobs because I never really did it. I started as a freelancer (entrepreneur) and kept being self-employed for most of my career. I have never had a job through the traditional path of job searching > applying > being screened by HR > interviewing > getting hired. 

Now that I am trying to go through that path, I can't land interviews. Not sure if it's because I have such a diverse/general background or something else. I've been tailoring my CV based on job descriptions and all but no interview yet.

In the meantime, I get tons of invitations from past colleagues and partners to join them in a new venture. But the issue is that those colleagues and partners aren't really rich or have enough funding to pay a good salary right now. 

Adding to that, I am bit tired of being an entrepreneur myself and would like to be actually employed right now as I am looking to have kids and be present with them as they grow up. 

Any ideas of what job titles, industries, etc I should aim for? 

All kinds of genuine advice are welcome! 

Thanks a lot!",BridgeLeapX,0,0.5,0,1754398718,2025-08-05 12:58:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mi8i73/wtf_do_i_do_now_having_a_hard_time_finding_my_way/,8,2025

1mi4cwu,Really torn between accounts and sales need some advice.,"Hi everyone,

I recently applied for an Accounts Administrator role at a car dealership. I’m 18 and really eager to get my foot in the door in an office environment. One of the things that attracted me to this role was the opportunity for growth — the company mentioned that if I performed well, they’d be happy to help me work towards becoming a fully qualified accountant.

I had my interview a few days ago, and it went really well — the interviewer seemed to like me a lot. However, he mentioned that I come across as quite confident and suggested that I might be better suited for a car sales role within the company. Now, I’ve been invited to a meeting with the Sales Director to learn more about the position and see if I’d be a good fit.

To be honest, I’m leaning more towards the accounts side of things. I’ve heard mixed (mostly negative) things about working in sales, and I’m not sure if it’s something I’d enjoy long-term.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation, or worked in both sales and accounting?

1mi3ffy,Interested in moving into planning/analytics from a generalist background — seeking advice,"Hi everyone, M29 from a southern European country, looking for advice from people working in supply chain, production planning, or controlling.

I hold a BSc in Industrial Engineering and have spent three years at a small SME in the food sector. There, I did a bit of everything: procurement and vendor management, basic production scheduling, cost analysis, and some admin tasks.

I was initially hired as an apprentice (current gross salary around €28 k). In two months I’ll be relocating within the region and seeking a new job nearby.

In interviews, many companies (especially in mechanical manufacturing) tell me they expect candidates with hands-on experience in mechanical parts production. They see my food‑industry background as a potential barrier, due to unfamiliarity with specific production cycles. I understand there are technical differences, but I studied many relevant topics in my degree and I’ve quickly adapted in real-world roles before.

Just yesterday, a multinational in the new city offered me to shadow their purchasing manager at a plant, who plans to retire in two years. It’s a path I know (procurement), but it’s not what I want long term. I’m wondering if I should accept it given the location change, or hold out for roles in production planning or demand forecasting — roles I’m intrigued by but haven’t yet explored deeply (and free online training seems scarce or expensive).

I worry that once I’m in a procurement role it may be hard to pivot later. Procurement would be my “plan B”: acceptable if nothing else comes up, but it’s not what excites me most.

**Questions:**  
• Anyone transitioned from food/generalist roles to planning or controlling in manufacturing?  
• Does it make sense to accept a “comfortable” procurement job just to get in the door, or is it better to aim directly at planning/analytics roles early on?  
• Any recommendations on entry‑level courses or skills to strengthen to become more competitive as a planner or controller?

Thanks in advance!

1mi1unl,Feeling Lost About My Career – Need Advice From Working Professionals,"Hey everyone,

I really need some honest advice — I’ve been feeling completely directionless and anxious about my future. Here’s my story so far:

2020: I joined BTech in Computer Science, mainly due to parental pressure. I’ve always had a genuine interest in technology, but I wasn’t able to stay focused on academics.

2021: During my BTech, I started a small PR agency and was earning well through Instagram and Facebook promotions. But because of that, I neglected my studies.

2022: I got a year back and things spiraled down. Eventually, I left BTech altogether. It felt like I had completely messed up my chances.

2023: I enrolled in a 5-year integrated BA LLB course to start fresh. Right now I’m in the 2nd year, but I’m constantly questioning this decision. It’ll take me 3 more years to complete, and honestly, I’m not sure if I see a stable or satisfying career in the legal field — especially when I compare myself to my BTech batchmates who are already graduating and earning.

Meanwhile, I’ve continued learning tech on my own — I still know Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, and some related frameworks. I enjoy coding and backend development, but I don’t have a degree to back it up now.


Here’s where I’m stuck:

Should I just commit to law, finish the next 3 years, and try to build a career there?

Or should I pivot back to tech, double down on my skills, and try for dev jobs or internships — even without a CS degree?

Is it possible to break into tech based on skills alone?

1mi1gfu,Looking for an advice - Bored at work,"Lately I’ve been feeling super bored and just completely unmotivated at work, so thought I’d throw this out and see if anyone else has been through the same thing.

Honestly, none of my ideas or suggestions ever get any priority, and it really feels like what I do isn’t appreciated by some people here. Kinda sucks, not gonna lie.

What makes it worse is that in my meetings, everyone shows up except for the two people who actually matter for decisions—my manager and the Lead TA (who reports to some distinguished engineer). Since I work remotely, it just makes me feel even more ignored and disconnected.

And yeah, zero empowerment at my level. I don’t get to take real ownership of anything, can’t make any decisions, basically just following along without any say.

The TA’s feedback is honestly the worst too, which doesn’t help. On top of that, managers here have no say in hiring. We don’t know who’s joining the team until they just show up on Day 1—we’re expected to make it work, no questions asked. Even with offer rollouts, we’re totally out of the loop.

Just feels super demotivating having no control or say over who joins the team I work with every day.

Anyone else stuck in a setup like this? How do you even stay motivated? Or is it basically a sign to start looking elsewhere?

Just to begin I (20M) have recently started an apprenticeship as a mechanic. As I go along, I am realizing I am finding working on cars is more of a hobby to me. I have loved cars all my life, but seem to enjoy working on them on the side more. I also, importantly, just hate the work environment. I come home angry everyday, and I don't want to do that anymore. I am thinking of switching trades or going a completely different route in total. If I went to a new trade, I was thinking HVAC. Pay is potentially better (?) and I may enjoy it more. Another part of me wants to learn digital marketing. As I am still young, I just want some insight from several people. If I went HVAC, I can get an apprenticeship and learn on job. Digital marketing on the other hand would require school. 

Basically what I am getting at is:
Any HVAC technicians to share your story about your experience in the field?

Anyone in digital marketing to give advice on where to start?

I obviously don't want to dive into something brand new until i have some people giving me their experiences. Thanks.",zdf55,1,1.0,0,1754369038,2025-08-05 04:43:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mhzydl/thinking_of_starting_fresh/,8,2025

1mhy6e8,Company reorganization put me in awkward situation,"Hi everyone,

Thanks for listening to me!
In the last 6 years working at the same company. I had changed 4 managers and changed teams 4 times within the same department all because of company reorganization. I’m at a breaking point this time because I don’t get along with my new manager. He dismissed my ask for help when I need strategic and business guidance and micro managing me when I am completely able to do my job. 

It all started with my team lead leaving 5 years ago and my department had a new manager who basically told our VP that he did not know how to manage me because my job it’s kind of cross functional which is a big advantage for anyone who would be in this role. So I got transferred to a different team but after a year the new manager started to get familiar with the work and wanted me back to the team because he thought I was important. But this time he cut my job responsibilities by half and moved a valuable part of my job to another team who later off shored the job. (The new hire was so bad at his job and got let go after 1/ half year) Because he wanted me to work solely for him. But this had seriously derailed my career development. And for 2 years I worked for him, I got out of touch with the business and feel I was doing an entry level job with no exposure to the business and any strategic level content. He once told me to work on a very high level project but said no you can’t be in the meetings with the vendors because we can’t pay for extra seat. This sounds ridiculous because I can’t get any training or get any learning but was expected to deliver?!

For the whole time I was on a work visa and the company was sponsoring my green card so I couldn’t leave. 

Now I’m changed again to a new team and reporting to my current manager who is really capable and smart but difficult to work with.

I’m at a point where I feel so not valued by the management because of all the changes. I was a good employee who got a lot of praises for my work before and had a unique job that really helped the team in finding solutions for difficult cases. 

But all these changes had completely eaten out my passion for the work and made me feel humiliated. 

I’m quiet at work and a bit introverted. I’m trying to be kind and respectful to everyone I work with. I’m not 100% perfect as everyone is but I don’t think I deserve to be treated like this.

I’m thinking of leaving the company for sure because my passion and love for my job is not enough for me to heal from the trauma I got from the mistreatment. I want to kindly ask your advice, and hopefully find anything I could learn and improve from this unfortunate situation. I don’t want to remember this experience as being a victim but would like to really understand what happened to me.

Really appreciate your time and comments! ",ApprehensiveGift922,1,1.0,3,1754363499,2025-08-05 03:11:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mhy6e8/company_reorganization_put_me_in_awkward_situation/,8,2025
1mhy5w8,"25M, feeling a little lost in life, looking to change career paths","I’ll start with this—chasing money and a flashy lifestyle got me nowhere. It pushed me into real estate, which gave me some résumé experience but also made me neglect school and left me feeling negative. I used to think life was all about being “special.” Now I’m not afraid of living a normal life. I’ve never had the comfort of a salary, benefits, or structure, and I realize that’s something I actually want.

I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a B.S. in Business Administration from a top 25 business school. During my last year, I got into commercial real estate. By year five, I had a strong client pipeline and owned nearly $800K in real estate—fully paid off.

Here’s what I’ve learned about myself:
	•	I love helping people—it’s genuinely one of my gifts.
	•	I’m good with numbers, data, and emotions.
	•	I’m not bad at real estate, but thriving in that industry would mean going against my instincts.

Lately, I’ve been stuck—depressed on the couch, still sending out deals, but not moving forward. That has to change. I have too much to be grateful for, and I know I can bring real value somewhere.

I’d appreciate any thoughts, advice, or even résumé help. Sometimes an outside perspective is exactly what’s needed.

I don't really have any complaints about the firm in itself, the pay isn't great but it's higher than the amount I'm being proposed to by $3,000 and the hours are very good for my field. The downside is the location as I had to move to a pretty rural small town for the job and I literally don't know anyone here and have yet to make any connections with anyone my age. I'd like to atleast have some social life or activities to do and it's difficult in a location like this. 

On the otherhand, the job I'm being offered is at a much bigger firm, so I'll be working much more hours and making less than I do right now (Which is only 58k). Yet, I feel like it's the right choice to make as I'll be able to move back to a city that I'm way more accustomed to and be closer to friends and family. I just don't see myself staying in a small town like this for my whole 20s, so I kind of ask myself if I don't take this offer now, when would I be willing to move?

1mhwunh,Feels like I have switched from one toxic workplace to another. How do I cope?,"
My previous office was horrible. Horrible work culture, office politics, low pay, overwhelming work, refused to add staff after people resign making workload huge. The worst of it was micro management. I hated it, they had a mouse tracking app which took screenshots of our screen per minute (in an on site setting). That wasn't enough for them. There were CCTV to monitor us because we were allowed to bring phone inside the workspace, it had to be kept in the locker.

I finally switch after a year. This new job is fully Remote. This wasn't my ideal position but the exit from my last job was messy and I was desperate. 

This new place seems worse 😭. 8.5 hours per day, 6 days a week. There's no mouse tracking but there's time tracking. Our end our must be 8 hours 30 min break. And we have a hourly report system. The hourly reporting system itself was fine, we're in a remote setting hourly reporting seems understandable. What ticked me off was the reporting has to be listed, filled out in excel and we have to make a minute long video of what we did the past hour and what we are gonna do the next hour. The video has to be made EVERY HOUR. even when I have a time consuming work which would take 2 hours I have to pause and make a minute video in-between. The video must me 1 min. 

Even if I could take this for short term, there's still the work delivery process. I am a designer, the design delivery takes 4 steps, 
1) moodboard collection and sending them the moodboard process 
2) creating content and sending for review 
3) when I'm designing I need to send half done design (I don't understand this it's probably to check if I'm working)
4) final design 

I just joined 2 days ago, I did a whole design style analysis of their previous designs yesterday. I need my time and space for a focused researching and analysis but it needs to be set aside every hour for reporting. The report it's just updat the sheets, it's update sheets, make a video explain your work, write a whole reporting add the video and sent it in slack, takes about 5 mins.

I feel like I'm being micromanaged😭. This might be some truma from my last job but It feels so heavy. I don't know if I can do this even for a month. I hate it when people try to micromanage when I designing, it takes the whole creative process down the drain.

The manager of company B was very reassuring that the company will get out of the freeze soon and that I was the top candidate. He even urged me to take the full time offer just in case. So I did. I’ve been at company A 3 weeks now and while I love what I’m doing, the commute is horrible. It is 1.5-2 hr train commute there and back. That’s about 3.5-4 hours of my day commuting 4x a week. The salary is nice but I have zero life after work.

Company A is 40 min train commute, only 3x a week. However, this role is full-time contractor. I am a designer so this is common but I’ve never done contract work before. This role was presented as full time at first but after the hiring freeze, the role was made contractor. This is also my dream company but I’m a little nervous about it being a contract position. 

Should I stay at my current new role or jump ships at the contract position? Both are similar responsibilities.

1mhvefi,Offer rescinded…help,"Hi everyone,

I had something humiliating happen and could use advice. I’ve been unemployed for several months and finally got an offer for a life changing dream job at a large company. The process took months of grueling interviews and I was ecstatic about the role it was a level up but it required a full relocation out of state in weeks, to a place where I had no social support. 

As the deadline to sign approached after them giving me more time, I had a first in my life full-blown anxiety attack. I completely froze. The offer expired- they rescinded it and gave it to another candidate after the deadline passed, and I don’t blame them but I’m devastated and embarrassed. I sent a message to let them know my hesitation was only logistical relocation stress, but they’ve gone totally silent. I understand their perspective. 

I sent a message to let them know my hesitation was only logistical relocation stress, but they’ve gone totally silent. I understand their perspective and how that looked. I take full responsibility. It was a mental health crisis and I didn’t know how to communicate what happened. 

Has anyone ever come back from something like this? Anyone repaired a relationship with a hiring team after a massive misstep like this? I am worried I burned a few massive bridge in small industry. I’m living in deep regret and could use guidance from anyone who’s been through a similar situation. Please be kind I am living with sincere regret. 

Thanks in advance.

1mhva9a,Career help,"Recently I've been struggling with finding a career path which I want to follow. I'm 20 years old already, and I've started to feel a lot of pressure when it comes to this matter. I feel like when I'm in school, I take random classes which may not be necessary or useful to me. Originally, I wanted to become a 2d animator, but careers in the art field are going to disappear in the future due to AI. I would want to do something creative, or something that has to do with designing things. I've been thinking about possibly getting into architecture, industrial design, or something similar. My main issue is that these careers are often criticized as being overly difficult, competitive, and overly saturated. I'm willing to put in the effort into succeeding, but I worry that these efforts may not be worth the stress. I understand that life doesn't often go the way you plan, so I would also be open to career suggestions. I'm not sure if someone has had this similar issue, but I would appreciate any advice you could give me.

1mhuy8e,How should I reconnect with my industry's top client?,"Hey guys. I recently got back in touch with an important man who runs one of the nation’s top political consultancy firm—-this type of work might involve phone bank, door-to-door
 or a signature gathering project. I worked with him in 2014 on a door to door campaign for a local candidate seeking office. He almost instantly gave me the manager role which I was hardly prepared for at the time, but I’m glad I did it! I did learned a lot! 

     A couple of years later, I tried the signature gathering aspect of the biz, & I did commit fraud so I got blacklisted—- in my home state! This happened in 2016.
   Nonetheless, I still work in the industry … Some of the coordinators/managers might give me a chance and continue to work with me…and some won’t. It all just depends! 
  On the most recent campaign, I worked with an unscrupulous coordinator who ended up not paying me the back end. Heard he has a reputation for being both a creep & a thief! I’m not trying to avoid responsibility or excuse some of my bad actions, but most of my colleagues are incredibly abusive and toxic… it’s literally politics so it attracts a certain “type” lol 
  Obviously , the non-payment has put me in a difficult situation, YET I genuinely wanted to reach out to this client anyway  and I’m actually surprised that he responded to my email 3 days later:)
    **I feel totally hated  by everyone & like a total failure in all aspects of my life. Guys, I don’t wanna mess this up and I’m in a very, very vulnerable mental state so please be firm yet as gentle with me. I still struggle with my demons but I want to be better**. So He told me to reach out to him later on in the week and I am sooooo thrilled but so nervous. He totally remembers me… I’m so grateful because he is very important in the industry so that early connect from back then is vital… I even thought to myself, “wow, he’s making time to respond and even told me to call him at a certain time”. I have no one to talk to, some bad habits, some bad luck and a lot of extreme loneliness, so that definitely made my whole day!!! 
  He totally has access to the “blacklist” because I saw my name on it and he told the coordinators to not work with people on that blacklist! Please note that, we’re talking about a list that was created & shared by ANOTHER client—-so some coordinators or managers ( who are way below the clients) will still work with me either because they’re desperate and want to earn more—overriddes— or are simply using me to commit wage theft, by putting me to work and not paying me and expecting me not to speak out because I’m blacklisted …or some will deal with me because they’re wanting to trust me & would like to allow me to continue to earn a living!
  
Again, this guy i emailed is a client and 
 a big deal. But I’m guessing he didn’t recognize that my name is on the list… Apparently it has about 300+ names. I don’t know how to start off the phone conversation or even mention this mishap or just sort of wait on him to mention it down the line? Also I’m owed money due to the sub coordinator/manager who didn’t pay me. So it is a bit complicated but most of all, I would like to reconnect & move on, but I am so anxious guys. Any tips or advice!

1mhtf4m,"Boss asking me to travel since our field agent’s last day was today, is this allowed??","Is this normal? What should I do? (any advice is appreciated!) 

I’m an analyst at a real estate company. A field researcher from my team usually drives/flies to places for data collection purposes. His last day was today (Monday), and my boss asked me to do field work this Friday, which involves driving an hour to and from the location. I don’t really mind since it’s not far.

BUT my boss mentioned that I could at some point be driving to another city (example city that he said I might drive to is a 4 hour drive). He didn’t mention I could be flying to places, but I’m worried they will want me to.

For context:
I was an intern and promoted to full-time about a month ago and have been with the company for 3 months total. Travel was NOT in my job description. In fact, my job description explicitly stated the position is in the office.

I guess I don’t super mind if it’s in the city I’m in, but also I don’t want to be driving my car hundreds of miles either, even if they reimburse for miles/gas. It still wears out my car, which is old and already has high mileage. They did say I can rent a car, but implied that they don’t really expect me to. And I definitely don’t want to be flying anywhere whatsoever. I hate flying, not to mention I have pets to care for and can’t leave overnight.

So how do I approach this? I’m worried they only asked me to come on full-time bc they knew their field researcher was leaving and would need someone to do the grunt field work. I don’t want to travel at all. I don’t care about overtime pay either. I just want to serve my 8 hour in-office sentence each day and then go home. I’m also annoyed my boss just basically assumed I’d be okay with doing field work now. Like that’s not my job??? My title is Analyst. The other guy’s title was specifically Field Researcher.

I'm looking for advice on finding a fully remote job that guarantees a basic income of at least $1000 USD or EUR per month. I recently started my career as an Odoo implementer at an Odoo Silver Partner company, where I’ve gained hands-on experience in implementing and customizing Odoo ERP solutions, particularly in HR and payroll modules. I also have basic experience with WordPress and Shopify, mainly in setting up websites and managing e-commerce platforms.
I’m open to exploring opportunities in other fields and am eager to learn new skills if needed to secure a stable remote role. My goal is to find a position that offers consistent income and allows me to work from anywhere. I’d love to hear your suggestions on:
- Industries or roles that are in demand for remote work with this income level or more.
- Platforms or job boards best suited for finding legitimate remote jobs.
- Tips for transitioning my Odoo, WordPress, and Shopify skills to other areas, or ways to leverage them in the remote job market.
- Any specific certifications or skills I should pick up to boost my chances.

This is where I messed up:

\- Wasn't pro-active enough, procrastinated a bit at the start and never really got back on track

\- I don't think I was honest enough with how the project has been going probably because I didn't know what I was actually meant to be doing or what ""good"" looked like

\- Didn't ask for help early enough in the project (2 months left on a 4 month long project) so I feel weird about asking for help this late into it. Should have involved more peers and colleagues throughout the project

\- Stressed myself out leading to even worse productivity and just being all over the place, leading to no sleep and just being very low mentally speaking

I want to at least give this my best with what time I have left, granted if I was my own manager I would probably fire me but curious if anyone has ever messed up this bad and what got you through it or for any more senior people out there what would you want from a more juniour employee to do in this situation?",SnooSprouts9028,1,1.0,0,1754348020,2025-08-04 22:53:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mhshq8/what_to_do_when_youve_messed_up/,8,2025
1mhs2zu,"What am I? 10+ years of experience, total generalist, a bit of an identity crisis","Throwing this out there because I’m feeling stuck and hoping some outside perspective can help.

[Resume Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVDeh2dVQdYn9XUPjZkO65a5pvSImAzu/view)

I’ve got 10+ years of professional experience across a mix of industries and roles: started as an engineer in semiconductors, then moved into manufacturing/quality as both an engineer and an account manager. From there, I became a software developer, and then a co-founder, where I basically wore every hat imaginable. At this point, I’d call myself a full-blown generalist.

I don’t say this out of arrogance (I hate talking about myself), but I really do believe I could figure out almost any job in tech that doesn’t require an advanced degree. I’m customer-facing, systems-oriented, a strong communicator, coachable, and I genuinely *love* learning new things. I’ve done sales (not trying to go back into it, but still a useful skill), operations, strategy, customer success, a bit of product, people management,  and technical work (I can write scripts, build automations, etc).  
  
I’m getting interviews, but nothing is landing. 

Here’s a list of titles I’ve applied to so far:

* AI & Automation Manager
* AI Deployment Strategist
* AI Innovation Lead
* AI Transformation Director
* Billing Operations Manager
* Business Operations
* Business Operations Manager
* Chief of Staff
* Deployment Strategist
* Director of Operations
* General Manager
* GTM Operations Manager
* GTM Strategy Manager
* Head of Core Operations
* Head of Ops
* Member of Operations Staff
* Office of the CEO / Founder Associate
* Operations Partner
* Program Manager
* Sales Engineer
* Sales Operations Specialist
* Solutions Engineer
* Special Projects / Research Ops
* Strategic Operations Lead
* Strategic Project Lead
* Strategy & Operations

My process for applying isn’t passive. I send cold outbound to 2–4 people at each company after I apply, using Apollo and a 4-email sequence to boost my odds. That part actually works way better than just applying cold!

But still, I’m wondering: **is there a job out there that’s perfect for my skill set that I just don’t know exists?** Something I’m totally missing? I’m open to all suggestions. I’d prefer to stay in tech (I love product, and I want to eventually start a software company), but I’m open to creative ideas.

Most of my traction has come from startups. Companies under 200 people, often under 50. Big tech won’t touch me, which I’ve heard is a thing when your resume doesn’t fit their clean molds.

So yeah, if you’ve seen a title, a role, or a path that sounds like it could work for someone like me, please drop it below.

Or really any advice at this point.

1mhr7iv,From Industrial Designer to CNC Machinist / Tool and Die trade?,"Hello,

I am an industrial designer with a 20 years of experience in the wood industry and looking forward to change to metal field, precisely as CNC Machinist or Tool and Die, since I have almost two decades designing in SolidWorks (CAD/CAM). I have 10 years of experience using fabricating parts with a large CNC and 3D printing.

I am trying to get into the field, and there are some schools that offers the training, so far an hour and half from Lexington KY (Elizabethtown or Louisville), and trying to decide what will be the best path.

I am reviewing the programs, and half of those courses (4-year program) are already on my belt because of my education and experience (drawing, reading blueprints, CAD/CAM, mathematics). So I will need for sure a deep training in CAM focus on metals, the programming, quality control due to the tolerances differs from wood to metal, and all the hands-on of this amazing trade.

Because of the cost of the program, about $8,000 - $10,000, and the span of the program (4 years), I am considering getting a CNC gantry milling (Langmuir system) instead, since that is a big key part in which I need more training.

\-Other option could be getting a CNC operator job to get hands-on, and see if they will take me.  
\-As today August 2025, there are not apprenticeship open in this field.

1mhqehb,"Should I quit a good job with nice colleagues, but that doesn't fulfill me enough?","2 months ago, I was approached on LinkedIn by a recruiter for a senior software engineer role. I usually politely turn down those, because I am overall satisfied where I am, but this one I wanted to know more.

My boss was starting to annoy me at that time and he also brought in the team someone he has worked with in the past, bypassing our normal interview process. This new person has experience, but also a bit of an attitude. The boss also put this new person above every one else in the team. Not officially, but whenever team discussions arose, the boss would consider this new person's opinion as the default correct opinion. He has the right to - he's the boss -, but I also have enjoyed my job less since then. I'm not on the big projects anymore.

My boss was fired a few weeks ago, for unrelated reasons, which is a plus, but the overall situation remains: I'm not on the big project and I don't feel like I'm learning as much as I used to.  
I've kept going through the interview process with the company that approached me, went through the 5 rounds of interview, have a feeling I could learn a ton over there. I visited their office, they sent me an offer last week, I told them I would take the time to think about it. They are very insistent that I join them, they see good potential in me, I could potentially lead a team over there, which is something I would like to do.

You know, when they say that good is the enemy of great...I feel like it's exactly that. I don't hate my current job, but I have a vague feeling I need a change of scenery.  
I love my colleagues, I love the office, which is a walking distance away from home (the other office is, also), I love the working conditions, I wake up on Monday morning and I don't mind having to go to work, the work-life balance is great...but still, I would like to try something new. I think in tech also, you can never allow yourself to be too comfortable. As I was working on my resume, I also noticed that after almost two years, it wasn't so easy to come up with realizations. I've been working, I've been busy, but I had a hard time coming up with more than 3-4 bullet points. Our projects have been continually scrapped due to changing priorities.

I have the fear of the unknown. The other company looks great too, but still, I'm afraid I'm leaving something pretty good for something that won't match it. If I hated my current job, it would be a no-brainer. But I don't.

Also, I was thinking on starting all over again and get a second degree in Physics to freshen up and get to see it is what I want before committing to graduate school. 

I would appreciate some advice, please. Should I stay in engineering? Apply for a masters? Start all over again with a second degree? 

I'm working as a programming teacher and I'll start an internship in development for a social Security company. Also, i got the opportunity to volunteer for a Astronomy Organization as a web dev which I'm so happy about it.

1mhpjs1,What career advice would you give to an undergraduate student currently studying Biotechnology with certain interests?,"Hey, I am 21(f) and currently studying Biotechnology as my undergrad. I am so confused about the career paths for this course. I absolutely don't enjoy lab work, and do not have any interest in pursuing a career related to the lab, and I also discovered that those jobs don't pay as much. I pursued biotech cause of my interest in pharmaceuticals, innovative and financial aspects of the course. I do have a lot of interest in tech, finance, and business, and took some subjects in high school and did well, so it's something I am willing to explore as my main priority is financial stability and comfort.

I have a few questions, and I am seeking advice from professionals who particularly studied a science-related field ( biotech, etc) but did not follow the conventional roles ( like lab technician, etc)  or transitioned from biotech to finance, tech, etc.

1. What was your path to transitioning from lab work or biosciences to tech, finance, or business (business development/product manager, etc) aspect of biotechnology?
2. What academic qualifications do I need to transition and work in other fields, whether tech (bioinformatics, AI in drug discovery ), Venture analytics, Business development, etc
3. What was your experience like working in these fields, in terms of pay and other factors
4. Are my ambitions realistic in terms of the current industry, and how do I excel
5. Are there any other lucrative non-lab-related fields I should consider?

Lastly, I am inexperienced and trying to learn. I will be open to any form of advice anyone wants to give.

1mhooa3,I want advice from successful business owners - i want to learn,"Hi Reddit, 

Just a few bits about my life quickly...

I'm going to study business and management at university - please don't flame me for this. I know what people think about this in every corner of the internet, so just chill for a minute. Basically, I want to learn about business, but I can't just create one; it's harder than that. I don't have any amazing, flashy skills right now, so I want to use my time to learn and maybe meet people in university who are like-minded. Also, if I wasn't studying, it would be like an apprenticeship or getting a job straight up, but I want a bit of time to figure stuff out before that. 

Aside from that, I just wanted to ask, are there any successful business owners who could share some of their wisdom, please - I want to soak it up like a sponge - get all the feedback i can to take into future considerations.... take it away :)

1mhny5o,How would you leverage my experience to a 6 figure role?,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for advice on how to leverage my current experience into a six-figure role. I've been with a propane company since graduating college four years ago, managing regional logistics and deliveries. I currently make $75K a year. Daily, I manage 30 drivers across multiple states and coordinate the delivery of over 12,000,000 gallons annually.

I'm in line for a promotion to Operations Manager, with a starting salary of $85-90K. I'm interested in taking it, but I would leave for a better opportunity elsewhere. I like the propane field and would like to stay in it. I’m open to logistics or anything else. I’ve heard there is good money in traditional gas and oil, but those jobs are often in Texas, which isn't an option due to my wife’s family obligations.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What did you do? I’m interested in any company recommendations or roles to look out for.

If you have any advice for a 26-year-old, please comment below!

1mhnuwt,Should I learn coding instead of doing CFA level 3? [Canada],"My life goals have changed in the past years and am now rethinking how I should spend my free time. My goal is now to maximize my income in the next 15 years to try and retire early.  
Here's a bit about me: 

* Based in Canada. Willing to relocate, but not to a different country.
* I’ve passed Level 2 of the CFA and have a degree in Economics from a ""target"" school. 
* Currently working as a venture capital analyst. Been here \~2 years, making \~$80K.
* Before that, I was at the same org doing database (Salesforce) work for 2 years.
* No formal coding background, but I sometimes help my girlfriend (she’s in software engineering) with logic problems on LeetCode, and weirdly, I’m actually decent at that side of it.
* I’m pretty logical, but I lack strong networking/social skills. I do think I can grind and learn on my own.

I think my options are

1. Finish the CFA.
2. Learn to code and try to pivot into tech + Maybe try to get some certifications

I know how hard it is to find entry level jobs in tech right now in Canada. The question is therefore, would my ""unique"" financial background be enough to open doors that are closed to others despite not having a formal degree? Would the pay be significantly higher in tech?",GreatMorty,1,1.0,0,1754337247,2025-08-04 19:54:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mhnuwt/should_i_learn_coding_instead_of_doing_cfa_level/,8,2025

1mhmh92,BEWARE OF WONSULTING!,"Hello, I wanted to warn others about my recent experience with Wonsulting. I just got off a call with one of their reps and the entire thing felt sketchy and salesy, not like a legitimate career service. From the start it felt like a high pressure sales pitch. They kept hyping up their premium packages without giving clear details on what you actually get. Everything was vague, full of buzzwords like ""10x your chances,"" ""insider strategies,"" and ""customized support,"" but when I pressed for specifics the answers got dodgy fast.

The biggest red flag was when I asked some basic questions like where is your company based and where are you personally located. The rep literally refused to answer. When I asked where she was based, she just stayed silent. Then she awkwardly said ""I'll email you the details later"" and moved on. Same thing happened when I asked about where Wonsulting is actually headquartered. It felt like they were actively avoiding giving straight answers. Combine that with the pushy upsell tactics, lack of transparency, and scripted sounding pitch, and the whole thing gave me scam vibes.

If you're job hunting, especially if you've been recently laid off, please be careful. There are better, more reputable resources out there that don't use emotional sales tactics or dodge basic questions.

1mhldv9,How do you explain a toxic job without sounding bitter or burning bridges?,"About four years ago, I accepted a director-level position at a family-owned company. The VP (who was also the owner’s nephew) brought me in because the organization was clearly struggling—with clients, regulators, and insurers. They had a lot of potential, but seemed to be stuck. I liked the challenged and He liked my approach and believed I could help right the ship.

What I walked into, however, was a dysfunctional leadership structure. Officially, there were chains of command, but in practice, the owner/president made impulsive, unilateral decisions without input from key personnel. It caused a lot of internal confusion and sometimes even put operations at risk. He was more interested in appearances and networking than actually addressing the root problems. Think: lots of golf, outings, lunches, little accountability.

I was often pressured to do things that were… questionable. Things like fabricating documentation, misleading clients and regulators, or hiring/retaining unqualified friends of the family. I politely but firmly pushed back, explained the potential consequences, and tried to steer things in a more ethical direction. That didn’t go over well. I started getting iced out of meetings, and eventually I was told “it wasn’t working out.” I was let go after six months. I believe the VP didn’t really like this decision, but he was overruled. 

When I re-entered the job market, this role came up in every interview. I defaulted to saying “it wasn’t the right cultural fit,” but I could tell that answer didn’t land well. The four-month gap afterward didn’t help either. Eventually I found something and it all worked out. I’ve been employed ever since.

Now I’m back on the market, this time just looking at more gainful opportunities, after all, this is the only way people our age get a raise. But I know this is going to come up again. I want to be honest without sounding like I’m trashing a former employer, but I also don’t want to dodge the truth.

I’m an engineer with over 8 years of experience, and my manager insists on reviewing every internal email I send, even simple messages like requesting a document or asking someone for access to a site. Most of these go through at least five rounds of revisions, even if they’re going to a peer.

Most recently, I was told to stop using “hey” when addressing colleagues because it’s not professional. I acknowledged it and asked, politely, why “hey” was discouraged. I just wanted to understand the communication expectations. My manager seemed irritated that I even asked.

I want to be clear: I’m not pushing back on feedback. But this level of involvement in basic internal communication feels excessive, especially in an senior+ role. Is this common in some workplaces, or is it overkill?

1mhj8am,Passed Up for the Promotion Twice,"I’ve been with my current company for almost four years. After my third year, I applied for a promotion within my department but was passed over. I was told it was because I wasn’t knowledgeable enough.

There are only three people in my department. Most of the time, I’m there consistently, but during the summer months, I assist another department full time for about 3 to 4 months. I manage this while still maintaining compliance with my proficiency testing and completing nearly all of my regular tasks.

After being passed over the first time, I volunteered to complete a training program designed for incoming development associates. I took on this program in addition to my normal workload and regularly checked in with my manager, who gave me positive feedback and congratulated me when I completed it.

Now, the position opened again because the person who was promoted left for another facility after only a year and a half. My manager even called me directly when the job was reposted and encouraged me to apply.

However, the interview process was, by many accounts, inappropriate. I was asked how I’d handle complex managerial situations—like insubordination—at a unionized facility, despite not currently being in a leadership role. I responded honestly: I said I would speak to the team member again but acknowledged I had no authority to enforce anything.

That answer apparently wasn’t acceptable. I was told I didn’t understand how to handle situations like that because I don’t have children or haven’t led anyone before—essentially implying that I lacked the life experience due to my age.

Once again, I didn’t get the position. This time, I was told they didn’t believe I could handle customer interactions or manage team dynamics. Ironically, they hired someone from a different facility who had completed the same training program I did.

I feel hurt, disappointed, and stuck. I’ve worked hard, stepped up when asked, and done everything within my power to grow—but it feels like that’s still not enough.

During the interview, someone told me that “leadership isn’t something that can be taught, you either are a leader or you’re not.” Honestly, after all this, I’m starting to believe them.

I don’t know what to do next. Is it time to stay and keep trying, or should I take this as a sign that it’s time to move on?",Different-Nail-1970,1,0.9900000095367432,3,1754327210,2025-08-04 17:06:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mhj8am/passed_up_for_the_promotion_twice/,8,2025

1mhgrdn,"Took a Step Down to Move Forward, Family Doesn’t Understand.","
Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a bit of my journey and get some outside perspective because I’m feeling a bit caught between logic and emotion right now.

I was previously working as a store manager at a boutique for an international brand. At first, I was genuinely excited about the role, it felt like a great opportunity at the time. However, I slowly started to realize that the company had a pretty terrible reputation within the industry. This became painfully obvious when I began applying for new roles. Every interview I went to, I was met with negative or sarcastic comments about the company. A few recruiters and hiring managers even flat-out told me they wouldn’t normally consider someone from there. That was my wake-up call.

Eventually, I resigned and spent months applying for jobs. It was discouraging to face so many rejections, especially knowing that my past experience, something I once thought was an asset was working against me.

Fast forward to today: I just accepted a job as a sales associate at a much more respected brand. It’s technically a step down from my previous manager title, but it’s part-time, pays more than my last job, and gives me a chance to rebuild my experience with a better company name on my CV.

The issue? My family is upset.
They’re frustrated that I “stepped down” and that the store closes at 9 PM, with shifts sometimes going as late as 11 PM. While I completely understand their concerns (especially about the late hours), I feel like this is the most logical move right now: secure some income, gain new experience, and give myself a chance to reposition in the industry.

Has anyone else had to take a step down to move forward? How do you stay confident in your choices when those around you don’t get it?

Thanks for reading, I’d really appreciate any thoughts or similar stories.",Ok-Taro-4648,4,1.0,2,1754321745,2025-08-04 15:35:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mhgrdn/took_a_step_down_to_move_forward_family_doesnt/,8,2025
1mhgq8h,Apathy towards any job / career (may be)?,"I've published a post previously, titled:

**Deep tech entrepreneurship vs pursuing career in high finance (IB/PE/VC/HF)?**

Like a quick summary on how to get wealthy, slowly and with (much) more probability

Since then, not much certainty was gained

To be honest, like in the recent past It was quite interesting to get a job like in a big firm, at highly skilled positions, but really not anymore. , Any job and career just looks, meh and nah now

I have an associate in computer science and currently pursing bachelors in physics

There are 2 options that do look interesting though:

1. Private markets - Private equity (PE) and Venture capital (VC). Just investing in companies that are not publicly traded. You can also work for hedge funds that are making private investments
2. Bioengineering / Molecular biology with a focus on longevity. You may not know, but longevity (anti-aging) field is really regenerative medicine. Because aging itself is about - destruction of tissues and genome function into more chaotic state over time.

I don't know where I want to work at. Not interested in anything really. Just want to earn money and the more, the merrier

The 1st option is (mostly) about earning money. It is high finance, but without the stress of public markets (like if you are not performing on short term benchmarks in trading public assets, then it's easy to get fired)

The 2nd option is more mission driven. But I have a fear of ending up an old and poor professor (academia workers aren't earning much, let's be honest). Entrepreneurship is the only salvation I can think of right now

How would you overcome the apathy towards a career/job choice?

What would you choose from these 2 options?",EffectiveRisk2008,0,0.5,0,1754321679,2025-08-04 15:34:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mhgq8h/apathy_towards_any_job_career_may_be/,8,2025

(micromanaged by boss as well as my fellow colleagues) I work a very physically demanding job & am working a minimum of 50hrs but closer to 60hrs / week and being asked to put in more, or scrutinized for taking days off not related to dr visits (IE they want me here 6/7 days a week). Lifting 50+ pounds multiple times through out the day, bending over constantly, working outside in extreme weather, no time to sit down throughout shifts constantly on my feet. With that being said Im not worried about necessarily LOSING my job, but I do believe they plan on trying to demote me soon, if not before my leave. If this happens I would lose a slew of my benefits (stocks that haven't yet vested, 12 weeks leave at 100% pay, all my PTO that i've never taken totaling in 6.5 weeks) What would be the right course of action here? I have already got a list of my necessary accommodations so if my hours get brought into conversation again I have documentation to provide. But realistically they can do as they please to me as long as they list it as performance based reviews and don't allocate it to my pregnancy. I would really like to use the full scope of my CURRENT benefits for this leave before anything happens, if I were to get pushed down my PTO would cut to 40/hrs I would get a pay cut and get my 12 weeks at 60% pay. What would you all recommend to do in this situation? HR here is going to protect my supervisor not me so that's not really an option or helpful here. My current plan is to wait until my next drs appointment explain the workload i'm being given and how it's effecting myself and my pregnancy and see if they will write me off work early and utilize my 6.5 weeks of PTO on top of my 12 weeks of paid leave.

For the past year and a half, I've been trying to become a sole trader doing drop shipping. I had a business selling Refrigeration equipment but it just didn't work. I've been constantly trying to make it work and find something to sell.

I've even considered to look towards day trading aswell, I've got a family of 2 daughters and a new home, I guess I just want to to escape the matrix or life and provide for my family and ultimately be more financially better off instead of living each month worrying about money. I make between 38-40k a year so not too bad but can be better.

Here's where I need help. I have a friend in Cyber Security and he's on alot more than myself. He's advised me there's jobs coming up which if I can build a basic knowledge of cyber security and learn for 2 or 3 months, there's a chance I could get the job. 

It's already more than what I'm on, it's offering 45k starting and I know it's completely different to what I currently do for a job but it's something less physical on my body and genuinely sounds better to work for. I'm fed up up driving miles every day along the south of England up to the midlands.

My honest thought process/plan would be to train myself for 3 months, hopefully get the job and teach myself day trading for a side hustle, maybe even do it full time years down the line. 

I just want people's opinions as I don't want to give up my dream of ""leaving the matrix"", I honestly don't think dropshipping is the way for me. I've tried so hard and it just isn't working.

1mhdq4p,"Career Advice Needed – BPO Employee with Aeronautical Engineering Degree, Feeling Stuck","Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some genuine advice and hoping someone out there has been in a similar situation or can offer guidance.

I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Aeronautical Engineering, but I haven’t taken the licensure/board exam yet. Instead of pursuing a career in engineering, I ended up working in the BPO industry, where I’ve been for almost 5 years now.

Recently, I’ve been feeling emotionally drained and unmotivated in this line of work. It’s becoming clear to me that BPO is no longer something I want to do, but I’m unsure of what path to take next. I feel stuck.

I guess my questions are:
	•	Is it still possible to shift into the engineering field even without taking the board exam?
	•	If I don’t go back to aeronautics, what other career paths could be a good match for someone with my background?
	•	Would it be practical to take up certifications or short courses (e.g., CAD, data analysis, cloud, etc.) to pivot to a more technical or engineering-related role?

I’m open to learning and working hard for a new path—I just want it to feel more meaningful and aligned with what I studied and who I am.

1mhcitm,PIP Question,"I'm a marketing professional who was recently told I'm going to put on a PIP and just really at a loss of how I should handle things. 

Some background: I was hired for my current role about a year ago, and suffice to say, I don't think I've been impressing anybody. Admittedly, I was hired during a particularly chaotic time in my personal life I don't want to go into the details of, and I don't know that the company got my best version. In my defense, I was pretty upfront about some of the struggles, and every time I made a mistake, copped to it, and worked to try and improve the way I did things, and learn from my teammates. In fact, the PIP came as part of a semi-annual self-review, and in completing my self-review, I realized I'd actually accomplished much more than I realized, and brought real value to the team. 

When I was brought onto the team, my now current manager and I were professional peers. She said during our first meeting that she was surprised that I wasn't underneath her, and the first time I made a rather public mistake was on a document she had been supposed to proofread and told me was great to go out...I suspected at the time she may have sabotaged me a bit, but at the same time, am the type to always blame myself, and the error in question was something I should've caught so didn't say anything. She was very reticent to actually work together on any projects and gate kept parts of the job I could've been helpful with. Fast-forward to this spring and I've been placed underneath her. All of as sudden we're collaborating on things and I think working together well, but she micromanages the hell of out of me in ways that feel like she's putting me in my place (she's very old school and a brand/grammar stickler which aren't my strong suits, whereas I know ALOT more about analytics and digital strategy than she does). In June I came to her saying I was feeling stetched thin and need to take a step back from my workload and she agreed and I thought things were getting better, so was suprised that I was put on this PIP. 

  
To me, a PIP is a death knell. And in my head, I thought, I need to start looking for another job, and ultimately, this woman outmaneuvered me. However, in the PIP meeting, my original manager (who's technically still my manager, and my manager) made a point to say how he's in my corner and wants to help me improve and over the past week has been reaching out for my opinion on things in ways he hasn't before. Dually, the head of the department reached out to me and said she knows about my poor review and has been impressed with my work recently, and to use her as a resource moving forward. Am I reading too much into those words of kindness or are they just playing by the book? I'm actively looking for other work (I've been very unhappy here) but just wondering how bad this PIP actually is/if I should possibly say something about the ways my manager has micromanaged and possibly been sabatoging my reputation in the department. Or should I just lay low, work through the PIP, and still try and find another job? As you could see from this post, I'm feeling very scattered, very confused, and ultimately very low.

1mh9pck,"Feeling Stuck After Hotel Management: Lost, Demotivated, and Looking for a Way Out ?","I’m a 21-year-old who recently completed a Bachelor's in Hotel Management (which, honestly, feels like the worst decision of my life). I got placed in a café chain as a Management Trainee, but the role is not what I expected. It’s been 10 days since I joined, and I’m already feeling like quitting.

I’m working 9-hour shifts where I’m not learning any relevant skills — most of the time I’m just serving and clearing tables (basically doing waiter work). The salary is also quite low, around ₹25–30K per month.

The problem is, I don’t have any technical skills to switch fields, and I can’t go back home either. I’m thinking of attempting CFA Level 1 in February, but I don’t know how I’m going to survive the next 6–8 months here. I’m feeling very demotivated and stuck.

What should I do?

1mh97b5,Considering leaving current career as a consultant to get an administrative public office job. Opinions?,"A bit of context: I worked in Academia/scientific fields for around 6 years, including my PhD program. This is where I've invested more time and resources.

Following the PhD, I enrolled in a UX Research job as a consultant. For context, I live in Portugal and our economy and market is very limited; a huge percentage of jobs in this field (that relates to my PhD heavily) is consultancy. The pay is decent, but not that decent; the raises are slow or nonexistent (as per my colleagues history).

Now, I may have the opportunity to go back to the institution where I did my PhD and most of my training. They often open positions for administrative roles.  
  
A couple of pluses in these roles:  
\- because they are public sector, I can opt to work 40h/week or 35h/week (with a payment adjustment)  
\- on top of that, I can ask for a specific regime of working hours as I have a small kid (and another in the way): I can ask to reduce my working hours by 1h, and include 30min of lunch break; this means that for a regular 8h (+1h lunch) workday, it would actually become a 7h (-30min) workday. Naturally, this gives a lot of flexibility  
\- while this one is not a guarantee, I could also likely secure 2\~3 remote work days due to having kids.  
\- the salary increase would be around 5\~10%, depending on the specific position  
\- this extra time could give me an opportunity to do some scientific research, especially because I would be often close to the main lab. This is something I enjoy doing in part time, but currently I can't make enough time for it.  
  
 Cons:  
\- currently work from home 90% of the time (I go to the office once every other week). However, this is highly volatile, it depends on the client and projects. I've been in a situation where I was at home for like 3 months, and situations, more recently, in which I even had to travel to a distant city and stay overnight  
\- salary increases should be somewhat faster in my current job  
\- I would have to change careers again, and join a less specialized one; however, I am also not enjoying my current career that much.  
  
  
Overall, the main reason I'm considering this move is:  
1) I don't really enjoy my current work, nor the clients; I often feel like I should be working in a field more ""impactful"" and more interesting, like education  
2) having a predictable schedule and year is very important to me because of family and anxiety; while I am usually at home most of the time, I think I would rather be less at home, but with a 99% certainty where I would be in the next months; wondering if I will have to travel and leave my wife and kid (kids, eventually) is very uncomfortable to me. 

Anyone made a similar move? I'm very inclined to really make this move; but I really like my team and manager; if I didn't like them, I wouldn't even ask this question.

1mh95nt,"Struggling with remote work in a new policy role, feeling isolated and unsure. Help please!","Hey all, I could really use some advice or solidarity right now.

I recently transitioned into a regional role in the policy space, it’s a big step up from my previous company and role, where I was doing research and analysis on policy and geopolitics. That role was in a fairly toxic environment, and while our work was meaningful, it often got ignored by management. The one thing I did like, though, was that everything was in-person. I built good local connections and could be quite extroverted, I liked the feeling of being “in the room.”

Now in this new job, the pay is significantly better (almost double), and the impact is arguably bigger, it’s not just research anymore, but also includes policy advocacy and even some lobbying. The issue is… most of the team is based in other countries (HK, India, etc.), so almost everything is done over Zoom. (I still go into the country HQ though, and the office is quite nice as I’m under the country leaders’ office.) I don’t have many chances to network in real life or build that same camaraderie I used to rely on. My only in-person colleague is kind of cold and formal, so I just feel super isolated. And while I know the work matters, the lack of human connection makes me feel a bit useless, like I’m just typing things into the void.

Maybe I’m still new and it’ll get better, or maybe this is just how regional policy roles work. Either way, I’m feeling a bit low and desperate. Has anyone gone through something similar? How do you cope with remote work when you’re someone who thrives on in-person energy and connection? Any advice or mindset shifts that helped you adjust? Is it because I’ve just started and I’ll have more in person connects soon? 

Thanks in advance. Even just hearing I’m not alone would mean a lot right now.",Actual_Activity3390,2,1.0,0,1754301071,2025-08-04 09:51:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mh95nt/struggling_with_remote_work_in_a_new_policy_role/,8,2025

1mh60z2,A book that was a game changer for me 😭,"""The Career Breakthrough"" written by Col. Arvind Jaldi what a book i mean whatever I have felt till my career journey it was true. And when I went through a chapter of Career Breakthrough it taught me something which I am sharing

Guide: Attract Rejections, and it gave me a fresh perspective. We often measure success by acceptance-but this chapter reminded me that rejection plays an equally important role.

Rejection means effort. It shows we stepped out, tried, and made ourselves visible. As someone still navigating the early phases of my career, this idea encouraged me to stop fearing rejection-and start learning from it instead.

I've realized that every ""no"" carries its own value. It teaches, redirects, and quietly builds resilience. Growth, after all, doesn't begin where things are easy -but where we choose to keep trying.

Other than my boss, no one has given me any recognition or thanks for what I do well — but they waste no time in letting me know if I make a mistake or disrespecting me if I don't always have an answer for them. I deal with weaponized incompetence from male supervisors, in which they even refuse to write their own emails or print their own documents and ask me to do it. The other female secretaries are constantly out to get one another to the point that it effects their workload and mine. Long story short, I feel like a mother more than a colleague. I'm constantly running around doing basic tasks for others because they refuse to try, while looking over my shoulder due to workplace drama.

Background: I have worked for the same company full time for 16+ years now. My current role title is SCADA Technician that I have been at for almost 3-1/2 years now. In the 16+ years I have never asked for a raise and taken 2 lateral moves that turned out to add more responsibilities than outlined. I like the type of work I am doing now but the expectations and responsibilities are weighing heavily on me and am trying to determine how to approach management to reevaluate my title, responsibilities, and compensation.

Updates: Between May 2, 2022 and July 31, 2025, I have carried 24/7/365 on-call support with minimal backup, logged extensive after-hours sessions, driven over 200 high-severity SCADA change matrix actions, and regularly worked well beyond the 42.5-hour standard work week. 

After-Hours Support Commitment

• Sessions: 126 critical interventions

• Hours Logged: 278 h 49 m 52 s

• Coverage: Nights, weekends, holidays, scheduled PTO

• On-Call Expectation: 24/7/365 escalation to me, even after partial rotation implemented six months ago

• Compensation: No additional pay or comp time provided for these sessions

  
Work Week Overage Analysis (Salary Employee)

Standard Weekly Hours	42.5 hours (40 + 5 × 0.5 h lunch)	

Actual Average Weekly Hours	53.0 hours	

Average Weekly Overage	+10.5 hours	(No Compensation)

Period	May 2, 2022 – July 31, 2025	

Consistently logging over 50 hours per week for 169 weeks reflects duties and urgency beyond a technician role.

My active duties—architectural design, advanced diagnostics, MOC leadership, cross-team coordination

I don’t think my role fits as a SCADA Technician anymore and I feel this workload with 0 additional compensation is unrealistic.

1mh1soz,Pharmacy.... the thing we all hate to hear,"*I know* this question has been asked many times, but seriously, can I still consider it a career option? Like, a lot of nurses get disrespected by patients, discriminated against, doctors overshadowing them, but yet people find joy in it and is recommended to many! Why not pharmacy if they get treated the same way (according to Reddit).

Where I'm from, pharmacy is a 2-year program (meaning you spend 4 years of undergrad + 2 years of pharmacy school to get the PharmD). Some programs even have a BSc + PharmD and you can actually get that in just 4 years because you're only required 2 years of undergrad studies. In total, you're spending around 6 years on average unless you do the accelerated route. So is this realistically speaking a LOT of time? I mean don't some engineers take at least 5 years to graduate from their bachelors?

Also about the salary part, I heard that PharmD's usually get paid around 100k to 120k (on average depending on location), but is this not like considered a livable wage? I get that it's stagnant and not going to make you rich enough to own mansions, but it's not like you make minimum wage. Again, correct me if I am being naive about anything, but isn't it better to dislike your job at least making a decent salary compared to disliking your job making minimum wage?

Also for the last part, is it really super hard to go into Medical Liaisons or other forms of higher paying jobs from a PharmD? Like I get that it's not super common, but at least doable?

Firstly the description of the position has very little bearing on day to day work. There are things in the description that are present but then there other parts of the description that have been missing from the internship entirely, things I would consider critical to the experience. The other thing is that there are constant distractions and fires that need to be put out and the whole thing just seems undermanned. The company has had a track record of not being able to deliver on promises yet continuing to make new promises in the same vein as the old. All of this has caused a lot of stress, and lower productivity.

Issues that deal with customer orders are getting brushed off by higher ups and not dealt with in a timely manner, or not dealt with at all.

Please help me decide, and yeah I know I’m supposed to figure it out on my own blabla… but I’m only 19 and a little help won’t hurt:) Just say the first thing that crosses your mind.

Ps: Please don’t mind the syntax.

- I don’t want a 9-5 job.
- Desks job -> Even worse I think, like being in the same position for 8 or even a few hours feels like a nightmare.
- I like being in contact with people, talk to them, learn new stuffs, ask TONS of questions, debating (even though I’m probably one of the most clueless person of my generation), and analyse any situation like it’s my own.
- I wanna travel a lot, mostly to discover everything that’s outside of Europe. Like knowing there are so many cultures and other ways of living/thinking out there that idk about, kinda…, SCARES ME.
- I want lots of opportunities, and money (this one is important and yeah ik it’s what everyone wants …).
- Feel like school might not be for me but it’s also NOT not for me… Plus given most people I met in my many student jobs, told me they regretted not pursuing school and not having a degree. And cause I’m basically poor, black and a woman (which yeah kinda feels like a curse in this world tbh).
- I hate feeling limited. That’s probably why I wanna have a degree even if I don’t end up using it, at least I’ll have it.
- Don’t like regrets, I mean yeah sometimes mistakes are good but some are just unnecessary, like if I can prevent or just do the right thing now, why not? (I don’t know if what im saying makes sense but yeah it’s my opinion).
- Didn’t have any favorite subject in high school, except math… I wasn’t even a genius or naturally good at it, I just liked it enough to practice enough, to pass just enough (yeah I lost me too…).
-Oh and yeah, in case you haven’t noticed… I’m a big over thinker :)

1mh14me,What should i do next??,"I really need advice on what to be done next

So my background have done 10th in 2016 with 65%, have done 12th in 2018 with 50% got a paper back cleared it in repeater exam same year, then Joined BCA from a worst college imaginable Joined in 2018. Should have completed it in 2021(dec) But had a paper back  cleared that in 2023 Cgpa:- 6.8

The same time when I completed college in 2022 I started learning front end technology joined this course with Relevel it was for 8 months had to learn things myself after that.

I got this internship which lasted 1 month was removed from there it was really far so was late like all the time but I did build some good projects there (end on 2022) was paid 15k there (aug 2022) (front end developer)

I joined another internship in the beginning of 2023 it was a good company it lasted for 4 months they also offered full time but when I joined I had told them I have cleared the degree but had a paper back they gave me when they offered me full time and asked my degree certificates I got ashamed and said I don’t want to continue they paid 18k in internship and promised 22k in job (nov 2022 - April 2023) (front end developer)

Then I didn’t join any company in 2023 in June I started working on a project which I always wanted to work on that is solving porn addiction in people I have kind of addicted to this as well so worked on this build a react native app released in august 1st same year But sadly it’s not working at all I earn like 15k per month and have 10k downloads all time Cleared that back paper from BCA

1mgzt3l,help a hs senior confused what career to pursue?,"first of all thank you for any help/advice you're willing to provide, i genuinely appreciate it so much! the past year, i've been extremely confused & stressed over what career i want to pursue, and now i'm entering my last year of high school so that confusion is just multiplying lmao. i'm open to anything worth considering, i genuinely have no preference! 

some things i want in a career: decent middle class salary so i can retire comfortably, not a trade, something that hopefully wont get completely offshored or ""taken over"" by ai in the future 

 + wlb/no crazy long hours, i don't want to be stuck spending everyday working long and spending my free time stressing about my job. 

bonus if it's (inattentive) adhd friendly & fulfilling/something where i can help people 

i'm fine with stress, fine with boring tasks or fast paced tasks, i'm not that great at complicated math but i can get by with any subject as long as i study, i'm fine with a career that starts out shitty but then gets better wlb later on as well, decent at talking to people 

the idea of corporate life already seems draining and soul sucking, i'd prefer hands on work but i'm not entirely opposed to an office job either

1mgxwzh,I don't want to work retail for the rest of my life,"hi there; I am freshly 25, have worked at target for almost one year now, and I really do not know what to do with my life. I liked school a lot, despite not being successful in math or science. I graduated from a 2 year college with an associates degree, but I still do not know what I want to do with my life when it comes to careers. 

I like history, I love animals and nature. I struggle with mental health issues and learning disorders. I live in a small city where it seems that the only job opportunities are for nurses, mechanics, or retail but I do not have the money to move to a place with more opportunities.  

Going back to college was something I wanted to try, but after talking to an advisor, the college closest to me doesn't have classes or majors that I liked, and I have a hard time doing online courses.

1mgwx44,Micromanaging dept manager is doing more harm than good - IMO,"I’ve tried to address my complaint with the department manager about accidentally breaking a fairly expensive product in the store but he just dismissed it. Do I need to write him a letter outlining my issues with his micromanagement or escalate?

I’m occasionally assigned to this department in a large health food store and while I can let the dept manager’s micromanaging just roll off my back. But yesterday I was “corrected” for trying to improve my efficiency by using a shopping cart to stock shelves with new products. What I’m supposed to do is leave the new products in the shipping totes and slide them across the floor. One of several issues is that’s liable to aggravate my lower back problems. Also, I have a wider field of view when using the shopping cart than bent over the totes to see where else to stop. 

Okay, that last thing is not a big deal but when I had to carry a case of 30-oz liquid across the store, try to rotate freshness dates of ≈ 30 of these bottles, one dropped, broke, and the store lost $30 on top of paying me for the time it took to clean it up. It just feels like it was totally unnecessary.

Other departments get industrial carts for a work surface while stocking. The department manager has some kind of hang up about “touching the products no more than necessary” so to him the products shouldn’t be transferred from the totes to a cart. But we don’t wear gloves, either, and that was never brought up.

For context: I’ve been working in several departments for ≈ 2 months and I think things are going well so far. The store management is supportive & the team and morale are good.

1mgwhh2,Managers who stepped down,"Hey everyone,

I could really use some advice on how to handle a recurring interview question.

I worked in retail management for two years. One year as an Assistant Manager and one year as a Store Manager. I was made redundant when the company closed about half of their stores, and the rest are expected to shut down within the next year. It wasn’t a performance issue, just really unfortunate timing with the business.

Now I’m applying for part-time sales associate roles, and I keep getting asked why I left management and why I’m not going for another management role. The truth is:

1.	I don’t want to go back into management right now. I’m looking for something with less stress and more flexibility.
2.	The pay for this sales associate role is actually better than what I earned as a manager (£14 per hour starting, with increases every three months, compared to £12.98 as a manager).
3.	I still enjoy retail and helping customers. I just want a more balanced role without the pressure of running an entire store.

I’m just not sure how to explain this clearly in interviews without sounding like I’m overqualified or taking a step backwards. I don’t want to give the impression that I’m not serious about the job just because I’ve held higher positions before.

Thanks in advance for any tips!

I want to pursue.","So I'm currently entering my junior year right now, taking all honors and colleges classes every period. I'm in band, marching band, book club, tri-m, student council, nhs, choir, and I participate in the school musical as a main every year. my GPA is a 3.9 right now (I'm still fucking pissed about getting 0.1 below an A in biology during freshman year). but if I get all A's this year, it will be significantly higher (4 weighted classes). I'm not extremely good at turning in assignments but I've pretty much aced every single test thrown at me.

Hobbies I like to do is play video games and listen to music (legit nothing else tbh). I do have a job right now, and I do like it, but I dont see myself working this job for life. Everyone in my life tells me that I will be very successful if I don't fuck up. (they mistake me for some giga genius or sum)

My dad is expecting me to go to college, and he's getting ready to get another job to help pay for the costs. (other parent is out of the picture)

I did talk with my therapist about not knowing what to do in the future, and she said it's okay to go into college not knowing what to do, that plenty of people do it, or even switch majors mid year.

1mgut6j,Not sure whether I should get a white collar or blue collar job,"I (20M) am very lost in life, I struggle with severe treatment resistant depression and anxiety along with adhd.

After Highschool I got into a good university and was studying for a finance degree. Unfortunately my mental health got a lot worse in college and I got to the point where I had to drop out. While in school I pretty much just took general education courses so I didn’t really get to even give finance a fair shot. 

Now I’m at the point where I’m really not sure what to do. After I dropped out I worked construction for a bit and enjoyed it. I’ve also been interested in the trades for most of my life but was always pushed towards college bc I’m fairly smart and the people around me thought it was a waste if I don’t go to college. I like the idea of my work actually being meaningful which the trades are great for.

Honestly the thought of having to work any job for the rest of my life sounds like torture. It’s a major factor in my mental health and I feel like no matter what choice I make it will be the wrong one. My main goal is to find a job that pays well so that I can retire as early as possible, while also being bearable enough that I don’t put a bullet in my head before I’d get to retire.

So I’m trying to decide between these 2 main options:

1. I can go back to school and keep studying finance. Planning is one of my greatest strengths and I find investing kinda interesting. Mainly I know finance is a great industry where I can make a lot of money and retire early. There is also a decent chance I’d be able to work from home which is nice bc of my anxiety. My biggest issue with finance is that it’s often a pretty soul crushing and meaningless job from what I’ve heard. I’d essentially just be getting rich people even richer, whereas a trade actually contributes to society. (I know all jobs contribute to society but it’s a lot more direct of an impact when compared to finance) I also don’t really want to go back to school. I had a scholarship that paid for my tuition completely, but I had to withdraw 2 semesters in a row because of my mental health so now if I did go back to school I’d have to pay the last year or so of tuition on my own.

2. My second option is that I can go to a trade school an become an aviation mechanic. With this I’d have a job that is important and still pays well without needing to go to college. I feel like the hands on nature of the job will make it a lot easier for me to do while dealing with depression. I can also get my trade school tuition paid for so I’d be able to get into it cheaper and faster than it would take me to get my bachelors in finance. There are downsides though. I do think the job would be interesting enough but I’m almost entirely doing it for the money. I don’t really have any interest in aviation but to be honest I don’t have any interest in like anything so finance only has a slight advantage there. I worry about the physical toll it will take on me too, I don’t mind working night shift or getting my hands dirty, but doing that for the next 30 years would probably take a major toll on my life. My biggest issue is the lack of mobility I would have. It’s pretty much a useless qualification outside of aviation so if I decide I don’t want to stick with it I’ll be starting from nothing again. There also isn’t that much career growth from what I’ve seen. Sure it’s possible to move into management if I really wanted to but from what I’ve heard I would likely make less if I were to do that. My last problem is just the stigma society has for blue collar work. I know it’s not true, but my whole life I’ve been propped up and told that I’m probably gonna be rich and successful. I was even voted most likely to succeed in high school. I’ve just always imagined myself as like a businessman or a lawyer, I think it will affect me if I end up a mechanic. Even if they aren’t I’ll feel like people will be looking down on me for being blue collar. 

There is also the option of me pursuing a trade in construction like welding or becoming an electrician. I do like the idea of being a construction manager but apparently that job is really rough so I’m not sure if I’d be a good fit. I mainly chose aviation technology bc the pay is actually really good and I feel like I would do alright in that job.

I’m just really feeling stuck. I don’t want to do either and really just want to end it all but I can’t bc of my family. What do I do?

TLDR: Not sure what to do with my life. Kinda have it narrowed down to becoming a financial planner or an aviation mechanic. On one hand I’m slightly more interested in finance and my quality of life will likely be better, but being a mechanic is easier for me to start doing and I would enjoy the impact that job would give me on society.

1mgsq8z,Which job offer would you take?,"Hey Reddit, I'm at a major crossroads and could use some outside perspective. I've been wrestling with this for a while, and the clock is ticking.

A little background: Last year was a whirlwind. I was working for a tech startup that helped schools with Apple products—a job I loved and was pretty good at. In fact, I was a top performer. Then, out of the blue, while on Spring Break, I got the call that the company was closing its doors. I spent the next year in a job I absolutely hated, only to be laid off again this spring. Toss in some burnout and depression, and you've got the picture. After five years of being a remote MSP (managing other people's tech), I'm craving a change: in-person work and a chance to build my own systems.

This brings me to now. I have two great job offers on the table, and I need to pick one.

**Job A: The Exciting, High-Risk Venture**

* **Role:** Senior Tech Director for a company launching a Top Golf-style venue.
* **The Vibe:** This company has grown 1000% in five years, and it feels like a rocket ship. It’s a chance to build something from the ground up, change fields, and make a real impact.
* **The Details:**
   * **Compensation:** $150k.
   * **Location:** Fully in-person (30-minute commute).
   * **Time Off:** 3 weeks of vacation the first year, then unlimited PTO after that.
   * **Ownership:** Single owner.
* **The Catch:** Is this explosive growth sustainable? It feels a little risky, but also incredibly exciting.

**Job B: The Safe, Familiar Bet**

* **Role:** The exact same job I was doing before, and I'd be reuniting with my old team from the startup.
* **The Vibe:** Familiar faces, familiar work. It’s what I know and what I'm good at.
* **The Details:**
   * **Compensation:** 10% more salary than Job A, plus a 10% bonus.
   * **Location:** Remote, but requires almost 35% travel.
   * **Time Off:** 6 weeks of vacation.
   * **Ownership:** Owned by a private equity firm. They just closed a branch, so while my job is probably safe, there's always that thought in the back of my head.
* **The Catch:** Remote work with significant travel doesn't sound like a great balance. The job growth potential also seems limited.

**The Family Angle**

This is where it gets complicated. My wife and I have a 9-year-old and a 10-year-old.

* Job A means a daily 30-minute commute (an hour a day away from the family), but I'd be home every night. It gets me excited to build something new, but the PTO is a significant drop.
* Job B means more money, double the PTO, and I could walk my daughter to school most days. However, I'd be on the road for a third of the year, missing out on that time entirely.

I'm ready to be in-person and excited by the potential of Job A, but Job B offers more money, more vacation, and more flexibility *when I'm home*.

1mgsif0,What career path when your skills and experience don't matter?,"I've been Unemployed from a layoffs from a Healthcare software company for about 2 years. I was actually running the Marketing team as a Director had 3 people under me.

The job market has been brutal. 

My focus has been on Digital Marketing and SEO. My specialty is Keyword Research and understanding search intent, which sounds easy but a lot of people are not skilled at. I've done lots of other things which includes Email Campaigns, CRM Integrations, and Tradeshow Marketing.

I'd like to get back to my Digital Marketing career but don't see that happening. I've applied to thousands of marketing jobs. Nada. 

The current job I have listed on my LinkedIn is a recruiting firm and career coaching service that I tried to launch with friends. I thought this was a great time to launch it, definitely wasn't. 

I did the marketing and they were going to do the recruiting and career services since that was their experience. They got offers to go to the major healthcare system, I told them to take them. 

It's terrible time to be in the talent or jobs space but I keep it there as relevant pro experience on the resume. It looks like I still have a FT professional job. 

I've done odd jobs and worked retail over the past 2 years, barely making much. I work part-time at YMCA as a trainer. I was hoping to get an Admin job there but they don't open up too often. 

Been trying to keep my marketing skills up still. 

I've focused on learning video and YouTube.

I also do a lot of AI experiments with OpenAI credits. This makes it much less expensive and it seems knowing how to use AI tools deeply like this is super important. Hasn't gotten me a job though. 

At least my own writing is faster with AI helping. 

I did Sales for packaging and processing machines. Selling capital equipment can be a challenge but I was good at that. 

I have Diesel Tech cert from a workforce development program. I am mechanically inclined and do most of the work on my own car. 

I have a Life & Health Insurance licensed that a financial service firm paid for me to get. It was part of the hiring process and then they ghosted me. 

I can't seem to get an insurance job as everyone Property & Casualty seems more ideal. 

I applied to Fire depts, but it's competitive. I haven't even made it onto a waitlist yet. 

Switched and applied to a few Police and Law Enforcement, since the seem desperate for bodies. 

Really unsure what direction to take currently with my career or what to highlight to potential employers. 

Should I go do a trade job? Keep applying to Fire depts? Use the insurance license? 

Any advice or thoughts from this community would be helpful. 

TL'dr - Laid-off marketer with a mix of skills trying to figure out his next career move. I have a Life & Health Insurance licensed, Certified Personal Trainer (CPT), and Mechanically Inclined.

1mgrqyy,Don't know how to handle problem colleague who has autism,"So have recently been promoted to management on a project I have been working on for the past 5 years in a technical role. Have to assign people work, manage hours and resources, make sure customer deadlines are met etc. 

Now the majority of the team I know and have worked with on the project but there is one particular employee (let's call him X) who I can't get on with. He has autism and was not hired by myself or the previous manager, we just sort of inherited him as was hired very recently. I should also add that we are both the same age and are relatively young, but I was put in this position because I started my career young and have over 10 years experience.. 

Now this employee I have had run ins with in the past because he decided he was going to make technical decisions on my behalf when I was a technical lead (e.g. he made a suggestion on a technical problem, I said it wasnt feasible and then he told senior management we are going with his suggestion right Infront of me in which I had to correct him, which turned into a screaming match from him, I just had to sit there completely silent trying not to do/say anything that could get me in trouble while he went off on a massive rant about how he has done this sort of stuff in the past, has led teams etc, all of which is lies as higher ups then checked his references who confirmed it.)

First day in my new role he says he wants the technical role I have just vacated (which has already been filled) so have to break that news which then goes into another rant about how he is more experienced (has been with the company a year as opposed to my replacement who has been with us for 4) and is underpaid, to which we find out he is one of the highest paid people on the team.  

So fast forward, I move from a technical to to management of the overall project and things just get worse. Every team meeting I have he starts an argument about how I doesn't think my decision is the right one, has used phrases like ""that's retarded"" when I'm discussing plans of action with the team, has been telling higher ups my methods are to chaotic, any work done is not to a good standard and he always says he is done when he hasn't done any of the work asked if him. To try and improve this I have been having 2x 1 hour meetings with him and a few others every week to go through his work and explain what he needs to do but every week he just copies and pastes the notes we give him into the presentations and reports and says that's it done. Did assign him a buddy with an experienced colleague but even he is struggling to get anything useful out of him. And now I am burning through twice as many hours on his tasks, in addition to my own hours managing him.

Recently people have been complaining that they have noticed him pulling out a book in the middle of the day and just reading books for hours on end. Now I am trying to be sympathetic, as I know that can be a method to calm people with autism down but when there is work to be done and everyones flat out it's causing tension within the team and I'm afraid to bring it up because he is known to report people for not making accomodations for his neuro diversity. 

It has become a particular kick in the face now that we are ramping up and need more people on the project, that when I went to a resourcing meeting to ask for more people on Thursday I was told that some people currently on the project don't have any work and they should be utilised more. When I questioned who exactly, was told X had come to his line manager and told them he had no work, when they said they would find him a different project, he refused and said he wanted to stay on mine. So I had to explain that he has the biggest backlog out of the entire team and just is simply not doing it. And to top all this off, X came to me directly after the meeting complaining there is no room for promotion in our company.

So the predicament I am in, I want him off the project but I still need resource to get the work done which is kind of a contradiction and not sure how to go to senior management asking for more resource but at the same time rejecting a resource. I am trying to be as considerate as I can but it comes to a point where it is unfair to other team members that they are picking up his slack and we aren't getting additional resource because he is apparently ""not utilised"". Honestly don't really know how to handle the situation.

1mgrkgy,What to do next?,"Hi, I have spent the last three years as a tech BDR/SDR. The last two companies I have worked at I have been the top performer and recently earned a promotion to a mid market account executive position. 

This has been my goal for the entire time I’ve been in tech however I know that this is not the opportunity for me. For one it focused me on a product that is not my companies primary product and to be honest underperforms in the market due to a limited feature set. Additionally the quota for each member of this new AE team my company is building is $800K which is what the entire company closed of this product last year. Lastly and likely most importantly, I’m being asked to move to the Bay Area for a base salary that is $30k under the market value. For a number of reasons this opportunity does not make sense for me. 

Here’s where my issue lays though. With such a limited time as an AE, I am struggling to get interviews to be an AE. I’d really prefer not to move back into a BDR role because I feel ready for a new challenge after three years of the same thing. I’d love to stay in tech because I like the work life balance I have had in the industry so far but how can I move into the role that I’d like to?

1mgr80u,I’m in a dilemma and I need some advice rn,"Hey everyone. So rn I’m at a very defining moment of my life to choose between two career paths, an operations associate at a music record store, and then a data engineering role on the other side. You might be wondering how did I land the store operations role, well I’m super passionate about music and initially had plans to pursue a PhD from Berkeley in Music History if I could. It’s nothing but a deep passion that I have for music, often writing about album, connecting my life with different songs, and curating mixes based on different scenarios. On the other is the data engineering, which aligns with what I’m qualified and studied for, a corporate role where I’ll be assisting the data scientists and analysts for their business needs. I also have a plan for CA later on, so that I could break into finance, this desire for CA is only because I’m curious about the financial world and would love to research and eventually be a detective with the accounting books. These are the two roles that I have in my hand, a genuine question for anyone here who has worked in retail and store operations, how beneficial would it be for a fresher like me to make their way into finance.

A week ago we had a talk with supervisor, he said he can’t do raise rn, but when I mentioned that now is our deadline, he said he has forgotten and now is going to talk with CEO. Week has passed no update. 

Earlier this year I was told that CEO is requesting to do more work from my side and even make sales (which isn’t my job even). In fact I did more job and responsibilities were increased.

1mgqjs8,"Quitting for a better job, but I might leave my team drowning - how much notice do I give?","Hey everyone, I’m looking for advice on how much notice to give at my current job. Here’s the situation:

I’ve been with my company for 4 years. I started in a labor role but worked my way up into a hybrid position doing estimating, project engineering, systems development, and even some superintendent work lately. I’ve been wearing 5+ hats and quietly holding a lot together while we’ve been understaffed.

Compensation never really caught up to the value I’ve been providing — especially once I started building internal systems, forecasting tools, and doing higher-level operations and BI work. I did recently get a raise, but it was still well below market.

I wasn’t actively job hunting, but a friend mentioned a role at another construction company that’s a much better fit for my skillset. More focused responsibilities, pay that reflects the value I bring, and a company truck — which would ease some real financial stress at home. I got the offer and plan to accept.

I have a good relationship with my current boss and genuinely want to keep it that way. If this opportunity hadn’t fallen in my lap, I wouldn’t be looking to leave.

The complicated part is:
- My current company is already short-staffed and stretched thin.
- The new company is owned by a friend of my current boss.
- I told the new company I’d give up to 6 weeks’ notice, but honestly… I’d really prefer to give 2 and move on cleanly.
- I don’t want to burn bridges, but I also don’t want to delay the next chapter or stay in a chaotic role longer than necessary.

What’s the fair move here? Two weeks? Something in between?

Appreciate any insight.

1mgpwys,Career decision,"Has anyone ever considered going back to their old role? 

I’ve worked for a corporate company for a long amount of years, and I stepped out of a management role at the start of the year. I used to work as a GM and as you can imagine, it involves a lot of general day to day stresses of working in hospitality. Pay was $40k per year. 

I went into a senior role in a franchise but in the same brand, Involves looking after the people aspects of a business, L&D, ER/HR franchise wide - it is remote/hybrid work that has a good lifestyle benefits including a car. Pay is $45k, but with the car benefits - more like $47/$48k

There’s a “but”. This organisation is on flames - in a negative way. Senior team absence, constant firefighting and even though there’s a lot more personal time, the negative impact it has, has a double weight and it makes it hard to enjoy time outside of work - because you’re constantly thinking about tomorrow. 

Halfway through, I contacted the old company, to see whether my role is still available to explore, a whole month went by spent in talks and the result was they offered me to come back on the exact same terms I left. In the end, I declined at the last minute and decided to stick it out because i now held the position I always wanted.

I’ve never doubted my career, in fact, it was a position I always wanted. But recently, it’s left me debating whether any senior role in this brand is something I want to pursue. 2 months later, I feel like I’m in the same boat, not as bad because I feel like I’m giving it another go - but with staff shortages and no direction we’re remaining in our current “on fire” structure for months to come. 

The brand is complicated (and can’t name it for some reasons), I need permission from my manager to apply for any role within this brand, in franchise or company. I’ve already tried this once in the situation I’ve mentioned, and if I was to do it again - I’d have to be absolutely sure it’s the right move for me because it will definitely burn bridges, considering this would be the second time this is happening. 

I saw they posted my old job again, exactly in the same time as I’m having this issue again. Is it a sign? Should I do it? Or should I continue to stick it out, hoping things get better as it will in the long term give me better experience and qualities for roles ahead?

1mgp921,Do you stay for family or move for work?,"I grew up in a small-ish town where most people either stay or eventually move back. It offers a sense of security, familiarity, and being close to family - which can be both a blessing and a challenge. For our kids, it would mean growing up with their cousins, who are all around the same age and go to school together.

I work from home, so we have the flexibility to live anywhere. I went to school with people who now live in big cities, making great money - many of them came from more financial privilege than I did. I’m doing really well now, and in some ways, I want that kind of life for my kids. But it’s hard doing it all without a community or any help.

Right now, we’re managing everything on our own. Back home, my mom provides free daycare and watches all the kids during the week. Since we moved a few months ago, my kids ask for their grandma and cousins constantly. I feel a twinge of guilt at their sports games when they don’t have that same cheering section of familiar faces. Back home, the family is very enmeshed - sometimes overwhelmingly so—but I do feel bad when I think about what my kids are missing.

So what’s the answer? Do we stay in a big city (with warm weather, which is a plus), even though it’s physically harder without support, and a 12-hour car ride makes holidays difficult - especially since we want to bring our dogs? Or do we move back home, enjoy time with grandparents, and give our daughter the comfort of growing up surrounded by familiar faces and deep family roots?

1mgo5vo,"Should I take the ""opportunity"" to go from manager back to lower level receptionist/concierge for same pay?","Backstory: 27 years old, three years out of undergrad (health problems gave me a late start). BA in theater from a nothing special school, intended to pursue an artistic career initially but decided I needed stability for my mental health, so haven't pursued anything related to it. I turned my part time college retail job at a clothing store into a full time job, was promoted to supervisor but it got toxic so after a year and half working there (and applying to many different customer service, customer success, sales ""desk jobs"" with no luck due to lack of experience/qualifications) I was hired as a full time concierge/receptionist at a senior living facility.

I absolutely adore the community, the residents, my coworkers, the commute is easy, I had weekends off. The residents love me and I got frequent commendations and nominated for a corporate award. The cons were that it could get hectic at the desk, pay was $20/hour which is not enough for my HCOL area and considering the administrative work I had to do (dental/medical receptionists in the area make $23-27). I also felt a little ""less than"" because I always dreamed of being a high achiever but my mental health got in the way (much better now), but that's mostly in my own head.

Anyway, after less than a year, was promoted to an open low level managers/""coordinator"" position which felt like a good career trajectory. I have a better title, am not trapped at the desk and having o ask for coverage to go the bathroom, I get to work on different community projects, have my own office and business card. I feel like I am making something of my life, can come in a little later and more flexible with my hours. I don't think there's any higher I can go in the community at this point without becoming the manager of the whole building which I think would be too stressful and not have enough experience for.

The cons of the new position: worse schedule (I have to work every Saturday), working closer with some managers that are tough on me and stress me out and give me anxiety. I am also essentially on call 24/7 for issues with the front desk. We have 24/7 concierge service, so even when I'm not working, I have to take phone calls about issues and questions that the evening, weekend, and overnight staff have. I also have to cover them when they call out sick or taking a day off that we don't have coverage for. So I semi-frequently have to cancel plans, take my work phone everywhere, last month I had to cover an overnight shift with four hours notice and was awake for 30 hours straight and had the worst anxiety/depression/anger attack of my life, I have never felt so bad as I did and contemplated harming myself. I generally have anxiety in the evenings when I get home unless I know certain reliable concierges are working, other than that I'm worried that something will go wrong. I got the equivalent of a $3/hr raise when promoted, but I'm salaried and don't get overtime, just alternate days off when I come in during my days off. So still not enough, for a while I had a second part time job to supplement.

My managers know I don't like the above cons, so since the person who replaced me in my original concierge position is leaving and they haven't found a replacement, they proposed creating a ""new position for me"". They said it would be ""lead concierge"" or even ""concierge coordinator"". So I would be back at the desk like I started, M-F, set hours, eligible for overtime again, but with a few extra responsibilities for making the schedule in our software and training the concierges. I would get my current salary but split up hourly. I would not be expected/compelled to cover open shifts unless I wanted to and I would not be expected to work when I wasn't clocked in. I would lose manager status though which feels like a demotion, although they said it has nothing to do with my performance although I think I was better/more well received in my prior position. They would hire someone else to deal with the other tasks (there's a lot that goes into my job besides what I described) I have in my coordinator position, who would take my office :(

I have some time to decide, they're not forcing me to accept. But I can't help but feel hurt and disrespected even though they think they're helping. What do I put on my resume if I move to a different company eventually? Also, I would miss the silly status symbols like a private office, a personal email, going to managers meetings, having some authority over others and making judgement calls, being privy to certain information that lower level staff don't get. I like being able to walk around the building without being chained to the desk, to have a breather sometimes (there's still downtime at the desk, but I can get interrupted anytime). And I feel like now that Ive been a manager, it would be difficult to deal with the loss of status, being shut out. 

But at the same time, I would enjoy a having a better work-life balance, picking up overtime when I wanted (so I could make more some weeks), not having the stress of coming in at the last minute. I just mainly worry about what other people (staff and residents thinking I couldn't hack it) would think of me and the professional ramifications. I think the residents would enjoy having me back at the desk, they tell me frequently they miss me because I have to be in the back office more. And I miss them too!! The best part of the job is building the personal relationships.

I keep going back in forth and feeling firmly decided one way, then changing my mind. Either way there are pros and cons... As of this minute, I'm inclined to accept their offer and lose my manager status. I feel comfortable in my dealings with my supervisor and boss that I could ask them to frame the transition to me being at the desk as initially temporary so i can save face. I'll push to have the word coordinator in the title. I'm burnt out in my current role and feel less than already, so maybe going back to what I know I'm good at would be better. I'm just sad either way.

I started out initially as a student manager for my university IT services which I did for 2 years until I got an internship. I then work an internship as a Jr. IT Admin and the company put me on a lateral movement teaching me all assets of the company (financially analyst, business analyst, QA). After 2 years at that job, they offered me a job upon graduation.   
I declined and decided to move out of state after graduating college with a degree in Management Information Systems. 

  
I then found a job in 2017 with a very large Forbes 100 company as a Client Services Technical Representative. This included supporting a product, handling trouble tickets, and on-call. This product was a VERY technical product. I have been with this company for 8 years and received 3 promotions so far, the latest being in 2024 where they added a $25k pay bump directly due to the customer satisfaction and how much work I was putting in. 

In my last career checkpoint meeting, my manager said they wanted me on track to become a Customer Service Manager where I would lead a team of about 10 people who are all in client relations (project manager, customer service reps, etc.). 

  
Unfortunately this past month I was asked to do a paid move 1000+ miles from my home which I declined thus accepting an agreement to part ways with the company at the end of the year (I get a great exit package). My immediate department was shocked and scrambled to see what they could do to keep me. They then offered me a $40k pay bump, but I still had to move so I declined again. 

I will not be with this company starting January 2026 and am looking for some insight on what others might think should be my next choice? 

I am very technically apt and have a great strength of explaining highly technical items to non-technical users. I absolutely LOVE customer service. I like to directly work with the client and solve their problems they have. I am not shy of working hard either as I am used to working 11 hour days as it is right now with my current company. I am known as the ""work horse"" as my team and frequently bear a large load with no problems. 

I am generally looking for a pay range of $60k-$100k. Last year I made $91k including my yearly bonus ($10k). I am not a job hopper and prefer to stay with a company. This current company was my first job after college and I've been with them for 8 years so all this change oncoming is a bit overwhelming.

Even though I receive appreciation at work, the truth is I don't feel confident in the core technology I work with (Java), and I’m not enjoying what I do. I genuinely want to grow, learn something meaningful, and feel satisfied with the direction of my life and career. But I'm struggling to figure out what the next step should be or how to bring about that change.

I know this might sound a bit naive, but I’m reaching out in the hope that someone here can guide me. If you’ve been in a similar place or have advice on how to move forward, I’d really appreciate your thoughts.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

1mgm5rw,My manager feel threatened,"Feeling like an outsider at work, overwhelmed, excluded, and starting to question everything

I’ve been at this new company for a couple of months. It’s a small team of five people and I’m the newest hire. I came in with a decent amount of experience, and my manager personally recruited me. That’s actually why I accepted the role — he gave me a solid pitch and I took the leap.

From day one, I noticed his management style is respectful, but there’s a kind of paternalistic vibe to it. He treats the team more like kids he’s taking care of than actual professionals, even though he does assign real responsibilities.

With me, it’s been different. I wouldn’t say he feels inferior, but when I’m around, he seems uncomfortable. He avoids talking to me directly, engages more with the others, and seems to intentionally build rapport with them while leaving me on the sidelines. We even went out for lunch as a team recently — he sat next to me and didn’t say a word the entire time. It was awkward. The strange part? He’s the one who hired me.

On top of that, I’m getting a massive workload thrown at me with very little guidance or training. I’m honestly not sure if it’s a stress test or just disorganization, but I can’t help but feel it’s not entirely accidental. Meanwhile, in our one-on-ones, he’s already started to postpone the career development goals he promised during the hiring process.

To make matters worse, I feel like one of my teammates sees me as a threat and is subtly working to exclude me. He used to be the “top guy” in the team, and now he’s not exactly welcoming.

I’ve been doing my best to stay genuine and professional. I’m not into office politics, I’m just trying to contribute. But the vibe is getting heavier every week. I’m starting to think this environment might not be worth it, unless something changes soon.",usual_hyper_johnson,1,0.6700000166893005,8,1754235058,2025-08-03 15:30:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mgm5rw/my_manager_feel_threatened/,8,2025
1mgm4r9,I got what I wanted... now I don't know what to do,"TL;DR: I was hired as an assembler after being an apprentice in quality. I'm grateful, but I'm at a loss as to where to focus. I have the chance to grow in the company, but I'm afraid I'm limiting myself - both in terms of salary and opportunities. I'd like some advice on which paths to take and what I might be missing out on.

___

Hi everyone, I was recently hired as a production assembler at a large car manufacturer, after working as an apprentice in the Process Quality Assurance area. I studied Technical Administration at Senai and worked during the course in the mornings, sponsored by the company.

The experience was incredible, I learned a lot and I'm grateful - I know a lot of people would like to be in my position. But now that I'm a permanent employee, I'm unsure of my next steps.

During my time as an apprentice, I did a lot of data collection and analysis using Excel and Power BI, as well as PowerPoint presentations. I also accompanied the inspectors on the machining and assembly lines, which sparked my interest in the quality area.

But my fear is that I'll end up limiting myself. To continue with data or management within the company, the path would be to become a leader - something that could take 10 years or more. The salary isn't bad (R$12,000 to R$15,000), but I'm not sure it's what I'm looking for in the long term either.

I want to grow, learn more about business and, in the future, perhaps become an entrepreneur. But I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to prioritize: salary, type of role, company, benefits, free time... I want something bigger than that, but I don't know if I should use my current company as a springboard or think about alternative routes.

I'd love to hear advice from someone who's been through something similar, to better understand what your fears were and what you ended up doing throughout your life/career.

Maybe these are all just fears disguised as a desire to grow or something?

Any advice is welcome. Thanks a lot!",pchc_x,1,1.0,2,1754234991,2025-08-03 15:29:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mgm4r9/i_got_what_i_wanted_now_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,8,2025

1mglpsw,41 yo professional w/over 15 yrs experience can’t seem to get ahead,"Hi everyone! I need some advice. First some background/ lil about me. Sorry this is long.

 I am a 41yo, disabled, LGBTQIA2S+, cis-woman, biracial (white-presenting) with lived experience of generational poverty, trauma, and violence. I have dedicated my entire life to breaking cycles and combating stigma both personally and professionally. 
I’m also a first-gen college student got my BA in Organizational Psychology and am halfway through a MSW w/macro focus (meaning I take a social worker lens to address systems and organizational problems). I am a certified life and financial coach and have several other graduate level certifications. I have nearly 20 yrs of professional experience. I’m an ENFP and my top 5 Clifton strengths are Input, Learner, Futuristic, Communication and Belief.

Most of my career has been in the nonprofit sector working in community engagement, training, and development. 

I have been diligently trying everything I can think of to get to a Director level role where I am making around $100-$120k. I just cannot seem to get past Manager level positions! I say yes to nearly every opportunity/challenge that comes my way. I work my butt off and I consistently get the highest level employee evals. 
What am I doing wrong here? Why can’t I seem to get ahead? What more could I possibly do? 

I started a new job in State government about a year ago and recently discovered that I’m being paid $15-20k less than every one else on my team! Yet my role interfaces with every new employee that comes through our door (I manage and direct our mandatory onboarding program and have anywhere from 65 to 150 employees in that program at any given time). I also manage our agencies community-based outreach programs, talent acquisition and recruitment, and all our youth based programming. One would think that a position that holds so much internal and public influence would be paid accordingly but I took a $5per hour paycut when I accepted this job. During my recruitment I was guaranteed opportunities for growth but I recently discovered that my position doesn’t actually have any room for growth. I’ll be stuck in the same pay grade forever, unless our director were to decide to reevaluate all our teams positions (I asked and she has no intention of doing this).
I’m the breadwinner in my home so when I’ve had opportunities to look for work I’m always in a position where I need to find something quickly, so I accepted this role even though I knew it didn’t pay enough, thinking there was room for growth. 
What do I do now? I’m so sick of working my butt off for employers who pay the bare minimum for work that far exceeds the level I was hired at! Any suggestions would be welcome!

Fast forward to today. I'm 2 months in job A and job C proactively reached out to me. I entertained the position and now I have an offer to join for essentially the same money (3% more)

ill give a pro and con for both jobs.

1mgkwps,"Am I expecting too much, or am I being undervalued? Frustrated after performance review at Big 4 (entry-level)","I started working at a Big 4 firm in December last year, joining as an Analyst at the lowest possible grade due to not having a Master’s degree – even though I already had solid (several years) full-time work experience, a Bachelor’s, and a year of study abroad. I accepted this knowing the system is rigid, but I was determined to prove myself and grow (quickly).

Since then, I’ve worked intensely – often 12–14 hour days – and accumulated more than 180 overtime hours. Not because I’m inefficient, but because there was **no onboarding beyond the first week (just 4–5 hours)**. I even created an onboarding deck for future hires, because I didn’t want others to go through what I did and provide some written guidance.

From day one, I took on responsibility: I was involved in complex client projects (some with C-level visibility), helped standardize materials, acted as a mentor for interns (as part of my defined KPIs), and consistently supported the team - even beyond my role. I collected feedback from 12 colleagues, including senior staff I supported, all of which was entered into our system.

Fast forward to my **performance and goal review meeting**:  
My goal was to pitch for a grade + salary adjustment (going in for the salary 10%, walk away 6-7%). I had two supervisors in the room (my previous manager who switched departments a month ago + my new manager). I’ve barely worked with either of them, and yet they led the evaluation. They did **not reference the KPIs set at the beginning of the fiscal year with my previous manager**, **ignored the written feedback from my actual stakeholders**, and gave me feedback that I “appear unable to complete tasks within standard hours.” This felt like a personal judgment rather than a performance-based observation, especially considering they never opened our **project tracking board** or checked what’s actually on my plate and at the same time, they recognized that I am constantly going the notorious ""extra mile"" and that I embody an extremely high operational commitment with great reliability. 

Our team uses **daily stand-up meetings, a Kanban board** and a weekly team-meeting to keep all work transparent (the micromanagement is no joke here) – everyone sees what everyone is working on. Despite this, none of that seems to have factored into their assessment although I have been constantly working on an above-average number of projects.

Unfortunately, we didn't came to discuss the grade and salary adjustments porperly, as there was not enough time, however, it seemed like they just didn't care. Due to both supervisors being on leave for the next four weeks, we scheduled another meeting to discuss this further. 

As a proven high-performer, I left the meeting incredibly frustrated. It felt like excuses were being created to justify **not recommending me for a grade and salary adjustment** during this year's only compensation cycle. There’s no mid-year review—**if I don’t get an adjustment now, I’ll stay on entry-level pay for another full year**, despite working well above that level.

Meanwhile, a colleague who joined two weeks after me, with no prior experience, earns the same as I do - despite me carrying significantly more responsibility and experience. Objectively, I just want that my skills due to previous professional experience and value that I obviously add to the team (which seniors also share) reflects in my pay and my gap - I’ve always stayed professional, committed, and focused, but I now feel punished for working hard and being proactive.

Also, maybe it's also important to mention, we haven't had mentee calls, which we usually had biweekly, for 3.5 months - I am especially frustrated about this as room for improvement has been taken away from me. During this period, I asked for feedback proactively from these two supervisors several times, most of the time I did not even receive an answer, and if I did, I challenged myself and delivered accordingly. (Another senior also feedbacked (written and entered into our internal system) that he really likes that I constantly challenge myself, that I am constantly asking for feedback to improve myself) With that being sad, my supervisors' arguments do not really feel justified, and even if, this could have simply been resolved if I was given the chance to - as I WANT to constantly improve myself and perform better.

**What should I do?**  
I’m honestly considering to quit and applying elsewhere. But part of me wonders: Am I being too impatient, or is this a clear signal that I’m being undervalued?

Would love any honest advice or perspective from others who’ve been in similar situations.

I’m not sure if anyone here can help me find some answers, but I’m currently at a crossroads in my life.

I’m 27 years old, and after a failed attempt at a career in international law, I’ve decided to change direction. Right now, I’m in a difficult spot, and pursuing a legal advisor role in international law seems nearly impossible for several reasons.

Academically, I’ve always done well, I had good grades, but I’m starting to grow disillusioned with academic life altogether.

During my bachelor’s degree, I worked in other fields too, so I’m not afraid of hard work. In fact, I enjoy it. I’ve also learned that I need to give 100% of my focus to one thing at a time.

So I’ve been thinking about what to do with my life, and it’s come down to two possible paths:
Either I pursue a new career in psychiatry, or I go for a more hands-on profession like becoming an electrician.

I’d really appreciate some perspective on my situation, whether I’m thinking about this the wrong way, or if there’s any insight someone might offer.

1mginvy,Does it sound like I am eventually going to get edged out of my job? Is this a yellow flag?,"

Hi everyone. I’m an attorney(woman)  in my late twenties and I have been practicing for less than two years. A few months ago I started a new job as an appellate attorney at the DA office. I’m obviously still a new attorney and new to appellate work specifically so I have a lot to learn, but it feels like a great fit as writing and research has always been my strong suit/what I enjoy most. Everyone was super welcoming at first, I haven’t missed a day of work, I work hard at the tasks that I am given, and I take guidance and direction well, and I’m polite to people. 

Most recently I’ve noticed a few things that I believe are, at least, a yellow flag to keep tabs on. A lot of the my briefs will sit on my supervisors desk for weeks and weeks before receiving feedback (I’ll give gentle reminders of my deadlines) and I have to keep filing more extensions, yet everyone else seemingly get theirs turned around to them much faster. I don’t have a lot of different tasks on my plate and I have, on several ocassions, asked for more work (especially because my boss seems to have a lot of work on her plate), and my boss kinda says okay thanks and doesn’t do so. I have gotten no negative feedback so far. I DO understand that I’m new and she probably doesn’t want to slap a big murder assignment on my plate because I  am not there yet, but something still feels off. 

This is where I REALLY started to raise an eyebrow. I overheard a conversation last week with my boss and another higher up saying that the appellate unit could really use another attorney but that the office isn’t hiring right now. And then they started whispering. And I keep hearing about this guy (let’s just call him Bob) that they really want to hire but just aren’t in a position to do so right now (likely because they hired me). But I can tell they really want this guy in here.

Do you think I’m being deprived of developmental opportunities and feedback on my work so that In let’s say one year from now they can edge me out to get this guy Bob in? I’m really looking for insight from people who have been in these environments a lot longer than I have. Thanks!

1mghh5r,Is it worth pursuing a second Master’s in Global Communication or Migration Studies if I already have one in English?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 27-year-old with a Master’s degree in English Language and Culture. I’ve mostly worked in teaching, but I’m seriously considering a career change. I’m particularly interested in fields like **Migration Studies** or **Global Communication**, which align more with my personal interests and long-term goals.

I’ve been thinking about applying for a second Master’s in one of these areas abroad (possibly with a scholarship), but I keep wondering: **Is it really worth it to pursue a second Master’s?**

Some questions on my mind:

* Will a second Master’s help me pivot into a new career path more effectively?
* How difficult/ easy is it to find jobs in these fields? or which one of these fields would be better future career wise?
* Will it be seen as redundant by employers or academic institutions?
* Are there better or more direct routes into these fields (like professional certifications, internships, or entry-level jobs)?
* Has anyone here made a similar shift from the humanities into social sciences or communication fields?

1mggp26,Nursing or OT??,"Hello to all!

I am currently on my last year of high school. And right now, the pressure of picking a course is getting to me. Before discovering OT, my thought process was to become a RN and soon get my masters to become a NP. But recently a lot of people have been asking me, if I am sure about my decision. Even nurses themselves asked me if I am sure about my decision. So this makes me question myself and that leads to confusing and anxiousness.

All I know is I would love to work in a medical field aspect, being with patients. I love kids and I love psychology and I know in both i can tackle it. What scares me entering nursing, is the hours, the amount of study and the work after, since i know it's a tiring job but what job isnt? The pros of OT as what I heard, is that it's less tiring and it has a good pay. But I know both will be fulfilling.

I don't know if i should go for OT or Nursing, but my heart has always been drawn to nursing, the idea of taking someones blood and all that. But I also would love to help others with their daily life as what OTs do and I know it will be a less stressful route. I only got the jist of OT cause they all said its a less tiring and stressful environment. I acutally don't know a lot about OTs so please do educate me on that!

For reference, I will be studying these courses in the Philippines, specifically in Cebu. Tuition aside, which course do you think is more worth my time and effort? And which will be more worth it in the long run? Job opportunities, salaries and work environment?

PS. The plan is to gain experience in PH, and work abroad

1mggo1l,Thinking about offering freelance consulting on RFPs/RFQs and procurement tenders – does it make sense?,"Hi everyone,  
I’ve been working as a **buyer** in procurement for about 5 years (private sector), mainly handling tenders, writing RFPs/RFQs, evaluating offers, and managing supplier relationships. I’ve also run tenders over €1M, so I have a good level of hands-on experience.

Lately I’ve been thinking about offering **freelance procurement consulting** on platforms like Fiverr or Upwork:  
helping companies structure or review RFPs, supporting vendors in responding to RFQs, improving documentation, and optimizing tender processes.  
It’s definitely a niche, but maybe there’s value in it.

My main concern: **does this kind of service actually sell on freelance platforms, or is it just too specific?**  
There are lots of low-cost freelancers (especially from Asia) offering similar services, and I obviously can’t compete on price. But I do believe I can offer more practical, EU-based expertise from someone actually working in the field.

I also recently applied for a training role as a procurement course instructor, to explore the teaching side of this as well.

Has anyone here worked as a **freelance buyer or procurement consultant**?

1mggmvs,Should I stay in my current company or move on?,"Hi everyone,  
I’d like some career advice, and please don’t take this as me trashing my coworkers — I really appreciate them and the workplace.

I’m a 21M backend developer/programmer. I’ve been working since I was 17 (started as an intern, then freelance, now full-time). I’ve worked at 3 companies so far, and currently I’m in a place with:

* **Good environment** → no drama, no politics, just teamwork toward goals.
* **Decent pay & bonuses** → salary is good and every 3 months we get a bonus (equal for everyone).
* **Job security** → workload is heavy enough that layoffs don’t seem likely in the next 3–6 months.

So on paper, it’s a solid job.

However, my concern is about **growth and learning**:

* We mostly stick to traditional methods (basic backend dev, single database, deploy to a server). No scaling strategies, no testing culture, no proper code reviews.
* Newer or more advanced technologies (like Apache Kafka, Spark, Kubernetes, CI/CD, automated testing, etc.) aren’t used at all.
* My senior (10 years in the company, now a frontend lead) doesn’t seem to go deep technically. When I ask about topics like rerendering, SSR, SSG, server components, etc., he doesn’t really know them. He’s good at leading people, but not pushing technical depth.
* My tech lead tends to play it safe. Instead of exploring better-performing or modern tools (Vite, Go, columnar DBs, test cases, etc.), he just uses whatever is safe and familiar.

Basically, the culture is: *just code, finish, and move on*. No optimization, no testing, no scaling, no real room to sharpen advanced skills.

I don’t have any education besides the personal training but I’m out of shape now and who wants a chubby introverted personal trainer anyways? 

So yeah, not sure what to do. 

I have a casual job at a hospital that could turn into a career if I prove myself.

1mgfkch,Should I stay or should I go?,"So my company recently did a round of layoff (restructuring as they say it). It’s quite surprising to many, as the company seemingly is in healthy growth and financially strong. I survived, mainly because my team wasn’t part of this layoff round. The company has however openly stated that the restructuring will come in multiple rounds, and that every single team will be reviewed. Looking at who got laid off, they seem to be mostly targeting mid-junior people, which kinda worries me since I’m one of the very few people in my team that’s not senior. The positive side is that my team is somewhat important to the business, so there’s a chance that the restructuring won’t affect us. But if anyone’s gonna be chopped, I feel like I’m very likely to be one of them.

So pretty much right after the first layoff was announced, I started actively looking for jobs. To be clear, I really enjoyed working in this company and with this team, but I feel like this is no longer up to me, and it would be nice having some offers to fall back on if I do get laid off.

Fast forward to now, I’ve received an offer from a decent company: same position, similar company as my current one in terms of size and reputation, slightly higher pay but I’ll need to relocate to a different city. This kinda caught me by surprise as their hiring process was much quicker than I anticipated, and I still have no further information on when the next layoff round will happen (or if I’m even affected). I’m in a dilemma about what to do now. My gut feeling is that I should take the offer but the following thoughts keep popping up:

- Am I overreacting on something that may not even happen? There’s a chance I might not be laid off, and I’ll be walking away from a job I love. If they did plan to lay me off, I’ll also be losing out on severance.

- The grass is not always greener on the other side, layoffs can still happen in the new company. I will be even more screwed if this happens given I relocated to take the job.

- On the other hand, the new company is a really good opportunity in itself. Given the current market there’s no guarantee that I’ll find something else as good, so I’m also hesitant to let this offer pass.

What would you do if you were me? Would there be any benefits to bring this up with my manager? Do I even hold any cards to negotiate with them?

Thanks for reading all this, my head has been spinning the whole weekend.",Waste-Buyer3008,2,1.0,12,1754215437,2025-08-03 10:03:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mgfkch/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,8,2025

1mgdyw7,"Just got hired but already thinking of quitting, am I being unreasonable?","Hi Reddit, I need some advice.

I’m 23 (F) and recently got hired as a part-time remote assistant for an international company. I was really happy at first because I’ve been working as a freelance designer for years, and this felt like a step forward. a “real” job.

When I got the offer, I was told it would be part-time, with a mix of light design tasks and virtual support. The pay was $120/month, and honestly, I accepted it because I assumed the workload and hours were minimal. I even joined a video call with the team to thank them. I was excited and hopeful.

But then during onboarding, they told me I’d be working 6–8 hours a day, not 4. Aside from design work, I’d also be doing data entry, assisting 1–2 people directly, and eventually making reports. Basically, it’s starting to sound more like a full-time job, but with part-time pay.

To make things harder, I’m still a student. I attend classes during the day and work at night to match their timezone. My body clock is messed up, I’m barely getting rest, and I’m already worried about how I’ll survive this semester, let alone graduate next year.

Here’s my dilemma: I can technically do the job, and I don’t want to seem ungrateful since I was just hired. But I feel like the pay isn’t fair for the hours they expect. If it was truly just 4 hours/day, I’d accept the $120/month no problem. But with the current workload and time demands, I feel like I’m sacrificing too much, especially my studies.

Would it be terrible if I resigned even though I just got hired? Is it unprofessional? I don’t want to burn bridges, but I also don’t want to risk my education and health for something that’s not sustainable.

Any advice would really help. Thank you in advance.",Standard-Strategy899,1,1.0,8,1754209071,2025-08-03 08:17:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mgdyw7/just_got_hired_but_already_thinking_of_quitting/,8,2025

And I'm pretty clueless, I don't have more than a couple years to dedicate to school for the time being. And I only have til 25 to make use of a grant I was fortunate enough to have. 

I've kind of always thought nursing was the most appealing thing growing up, it was always my backup thing. 2 year degree, high demand, good pay, flexible hours. But I have a hard time with stuff like gore. The idea of working 3x 12 hour shifts seemed really appealing to me, nice work life balance. I know PRN is a thing too, but I don't know how that works. 

I was thinking radiologic tech school sounded cool after it was mentioned to me. From what I understood it was similar but less need than nursing. I was told by some nursing friends that it wasn't the same as nursing, I would be less likely to be involved in gore, poop, etc. But then I hear other people talking about how people had bones sticking out, gore, leakage, etc. Sorry for being TMI. 

Sonography seemed interesting but I know even less about that. 

I just want to help people.

I really am into lifting, I love biomechanics and rehab. I've rehabbed dozens of different injuries over the years from various sports and it's always been fascinating to me.  Occupational therapy seemed interesting to me but it's a lot of schooling. I looked into being an assistant but it seems like a lot of people genuinely regret becoming an ota and the pay isn't as good as stuff like nursing.

Hope all is okay. I 24M started my career in a tech company. It was a night shift job. It was a very very toxic environment but I still joined. Didn’t have any other option. I left that job within a month and a half. Then I got into an Australian Bank. Stayed there for 1.8 years. There was no growth or any learning so I left. I was burnt out too, so that made the decision stronger. During my notice period, Goldman Sachs India came with an offer to join their Investment banking operations division. I didn't want to continue in banking but everyone told me to take it cause of the brand name of GS and told me to stick to banking. I also didn't have any other job so I took this. I have a hating towards finance and don’t like it at all. 

As soon as I’ve joined, the environment here also is very very toxic and people get fired very fast. I’m facing difficulty learning the work and facing bullying at work too. 

My actual passion is Retail and Supply chain. I applied a lot for companies like Target, Walmart, Lowe's etc. but couldn't get through. I get fomo that I can't enjoy my life and work in these companies. I hate my job and I feel everyone loves their jobs. I hate finance and I find it difficult to understand stuff. Plus we work a minimum of 10 hours everyday. My biggest fear is that I won't be able to switch fields after completing 2 plus years in banking. I hate myself for not rejecting this. 

Should I leave and then job hunt, or should I job hunt while working. Do I mention my job on the resume?

I'm not sure what exact niche I want to specialize in for my career yet but my top picks after doing some research are embedded systems engineering, semi-conductor design/VLSI, or something with AI that is more hardware based instead of software based (if that makes sense). After not knowing what career I wanted to pursue for the longest time, EE has been the one that checks all my boxes. The pay sounds great from what I've heard, I've always been into electronics and can definitely see myself surrounding myself in it for the rest of my career, I think it's an industry that will be growing for the foreseeable future, and it's not as oversaturated as some of the other engineering branches due to its difficulty in comparison.

Now to get into the essence of what I'm seeking answers to, I want to know what I can/should be doing on my free time to maximize the amount of progress/experience I can get under my belt to give myself the biggest head start.

To give an idea of what my end game is, I want to build a strong skillset in the niche I go with (let's say embedded systems for example) and simultaneously build my network. I would be grinding and learning as much as I can during those years until I reach a level where I'm at least in the top 10% of the best people in my field. By then I'd like to have made worth-while connections with people with similar goals as mine. By the time I am 100% confident in my skills/network that I've built up until now, I would like to start looking into forming my own small company to get some experience in the business side of things while taking advantage of the tax optimizations that come along with it.

I partied hard and got a few different girlfriends and one I’m with now. After experiencing life outside of school I really don’t think I wanna go back. I got really burnt out from all the calculus, physics etc. I still did incredibly well in them but I don’t think I could do that for another 4 years.

Looking for some advice on how to handle a tricky situation with my current employer.

* I am a senior person at this business. I report to the owner of the business.
* The business has paid bonuses every April for the last few years. However, this year we had no contracts in April and my boss was concerned about the business cashflow. My bonus is supposed to be $45k.
* My boss told me he could pay the bonus as we have a large cash reserve, but said it would be helpful to the business if we could wait until we signed the next contract to ensure we had guaranteed cashflow. His words were ""sign the next contract""
* I said no problem.
* We signed a contract at the end of June. I asked for my bonus then. He was vague and evasive about it. I reminded him that I did the company a favour and he said the contract signing would trigger the bonus. He got defensive and made the following comment:
* ""If you've left your family in a difficult financial situation and need the money, I can make something happen.""
* That really rubbed me the wrong way. I don't need the money out of desperation - I just want the bonus I was promised. It's also a pattern with this guy - if you pin him down even for something of his own doing, he uses abusive and manipulative language to get out of it without fail. 
* After that I applied for a job that I had already been eyeing, and ended up getting an offer. They've offered 50% more than I currently make, and it's a great role to step into at this stage of my career.
* I plan to accept it. But now I'm thinking about how to handle my notice.
* I should also mention, that when we signed this contract, I was deemed mission critical to it, and I had to cancel my summer vacation as well to help out... another way I've been quite flexible.  
* My contract says I need to give a 1-month notice.
* My boss is heavily counting on me over the next month - I am mission critical on this contract.
* I want to ask him if he will pay the bonus upfront. If he will, I'll stick around for a month. If he says he'll pay at the end of the month, or won't pay at all, I'm considering giving only a couple of days notice.
* Finding someone to replace me on this contract will likely cost triple what that bonus will cost. Nobody internally can do it. They might not find someone fast enough to finish this contract in time either.
* I recognize that leaving on such short notice will probably burn a bridge. I've never burned any bridges to my knowledge. But to me, I've been extremely accommodating the last few months. If he is unwilling to pay the bonus for last years work after I've been so accommodating, then the relationship has already soured. 

Has anyone dealt with something similar? I'd appreciate any input on how to navigate this professionally.

2. What is the long-term career growth like in this field?


3. Is this a good field to continue in, or would it be better to switch to the software side (like development, or other growing tech areas)?

1mg72bz,Re-connecting with big name client,"Hey guys. I recently got back in touch with an important man who runs one of the nation’s top political consultancy firm—-this type of work might involve phone bank, door-to-door
 or a signature gathering project. I worked with him in 2014 on a door to door campaign for a local candidate seeking office. He almost instantly gave me the manager role which I was hardly prepared for at the time, but I’m glad I did it! I did learned a lot! 
A couple of years later, I tried the signature gathering aspect of the biz, & I did commit fraud so I got blacklisted—- in my home state! This happened in 2016.

   Nonetheless, I still work in the industry … Some of the coordinators/managers might give me a chance and continue to work with me…and some won’t. It all just depends! 
  On the most recent campaign, I worked with an unscrupulous coordinator who ended up not paying me the back end. Heard he has a reputation for being both a creep & a thief! I’m not trying to avoid responsibility or excuse some of my bad actions, but most of my colleagues are incredibly abusive and toxic… it’s literally politics so it attracts a certain “type” lol 

  Obviously , the non-payment has put me in a difficult situation, YET I genuinely wanted to reach out to this client anyway  and I’m actually surprised that he responded to my email 3 days later:)

    **I feel totally hated  by everyone & like a total failure in all aspects of my life. Guys, I don’t wanna mess this up and I’m in a very, very vulnerable mental state so please be firm yet as gentle with me. I still struggle with my demons but I want to be better**. So He told me to reach out to him later on in the week and I am sooooo thrilled but so nervous. He totally remembers me… I’m so grateful because he is very important in the industry so that early connect from back then is vital… I even thought to myself, “wow, he’s making time to respond and even told me to call him at a certain time”. I have no one to talk to, some bad habits, some bad luck and a lot of extreme loneliness, so that definitely made my whole day!!! 
  He totally has access to the “blacklist” because I saw my name on it and he told the coordinators to not work with people on that blacklist! Please note that, we’re talking about a list that was created & shared by ANOTHER client—-so some coordinators or managers ( who are way below the clients) will still work with me either because they’re desperate and want to earn more—overriddes— or are simply using me to commit wage theft, by putting me to work and not paying me and expecting me not to speak out because I’m blacklisted …or some will deal with me because they’re wanting to trust me & would like to allow me to continue to earn a living!
  
Again, this guy i emailed is a client and 
 a big deal. But I’m guessing he didn’t recognize that my name is on the list… Apparently it has about 300+ names. I don’t know how to start off the phone conversation or even mention this mishap or just sort of wait on him to mention it down the line? Also I’m owed money due to the sub coordinator/manager who didn’t pay me. So it is a bit complicated but most of all, I would like to reconnect & move on, but I am so anxious guys. Any tips or advice!

1mg6lb1,How do you deal with a spoiled kids boss in your team?,"I have been working in this company for 2 years. I have been one of the early employees and have been working part-time. The kids boss and his friend joined our team this summer for an internship and things were nice at the beginning, they were nice and chatty and wiling to ask questions, until they started bossing everyone around including the team manager.

We had a new member recently and during a meeting, the kids boss forgot he was sharing his screen and he started trashing the new hire in private, saying how useless he is and what's the point of hiring him. Everyone acted as they didn't see anything.

Sometimes he would be laying down on a sofa during remote team meetings. Last week, a collegue of mine was working on a project and she asked him for some information, a few hours after launching the project, to which he replied 'What have you been doing all this time then?'

We were asked to recommend new hires to the team. Later on, we found only the kids boss and his friend were conducting the interviews and doing the hiring process (safe to assume they would only hire their other friends). 

I need the job to continue funding my education otherwise I would have just quit or looked for another job. How do you suggest I deal with that?

1mg3w3e,"Got an offer at a new company, but current company gave me a raise out of the blue... should I stay?","So I currently work in revenue ops as a director in a global company (still start up). Its 100% remote and I get to travel to one of our offices several times a year in different countries (not required). Boss is vp and is super chill and leaves me alone to run the business. He also looks out for me and has given me raises and promotions without me asking.

Company has decent prospects (I doubt our valuation is where it is at since I joined in the billions, but recent uptick in the financial markets and the industry due to positive regulation has starting to provide tailwinds. also a couple of our competitors are going public).

Pay is good (220k tc , 45k of which is annual bonus and i am 3.5 gears into a 4 year vest). I manage a team of 5 (all in different parts of the world). Despite this I still feel overworked, and not very excited about the job or the company. Things are always hectic, reactionary and lack of direction or strategy is wearing me thin. Also managing a team across multiple time zones has been hard as well. 

So I have been feeling just meh about my role and the company. Combination of being bored, not particularly interested in the industry anymore and just burnout) so I started hunting around for othe roles (specifically in ai) and landed a revops role at a much smaller start up that's local to me. 

The new company is a 1/4 of the size, and the people I've met have been amazing when I met with them, with long tenure and super passionate about the company. Technology is interesting and unique in its space. I would be taking on a head of revops role (although still technically a director) for $245k (20k of which is based on ote paid quarterly with opportunity to overachieve). Also got a 10k sign on bonus and equity.  Benefits are basically the same. But i do have to come into office 2 says a week (which i don't entiterely mind).I would manage a team of 5 but across multiple functions.

So heres the conundrum. Without even asking my company gave me a retention raise up to 240k (of which 40k is still annual bonus) out of the blue. 

Am i crazy for still considering leaving? I just lost passion here but i have a pretty sweet situation. I also feel like im not growing anymore.

Thanks for your advice!

1mg26gz,I stood up for myself and resigned. Now i feel regretful.,"Previously i worked in the govt hospital from 2017 to 2021. When i entered the workforce as a houseman, unfortunately the govt has started the contract system of 5-7 years max before being absorbed as permanent doctor depending on the vacancies due to a surplus of doctor. The previous batches were all hired as permanent doctors straight. 

I had already completed my housemanship for 2 years(which was compulsory for you to work as a certified doctor) and continued to work as medical officer in psychiatry dept. The environment itself was abit toxic but still bearable. The trigger point was when i delivered my baby and i only got 3 mo maternity leave with no option to continue for another 3 mo unpaid leave where as my permanent colleague was able to take up to 7mo total. My HOD approved it but the hospital HR denied because i was a contract dr. I felt very disappointed because i felt like i needed that break and when i came back to work i was emotionally not at my best. 

The thing about the contract system was that it took away a lot of the privileges; no time based promotion, no unpaid leave, no clear pathway for specialization since you may not get absorbed as permanent, risk of being terminated which added more pressure all while working the same shit as the other permanent doctors.
It was very messy at the time though it has improved a bit in recent years. 

Anyway i felt like i couldn’t perform as i did before and felt very demotivated. Hence, i resigned after 1 month and entered the private clinic after 2 months of break.

But the thing about being in private was the stagnation. Here, the only way to specialization was mainly through being in the govt hospital where you take masters program. My colleagues who stayed and later became permanent had started their program to become a specialist. 
Now i felt regretful. Even after 3 years working in the clinic i still could not move on esp since i was let go recently due to restructuring. I felt like even if i didnt have much interest in psychiatry, i could have asked to transfer to other dept though it may take up to 1 year to get approved. But during that time i felt like i couldnt think clearly and i felt like i was standing up for myself due to all the unfair treatment.

Right now im thinking of trying to enrol in a masters program through a private hosp which is still accredited but cost a hell lot around 50k$ for 4 yrs which will require me to take a loan. And that is even if i’m accepted since it has very limited spots yearly. Even then im not sure if it’s worth it anymore. 

I cant help feeling very conflicted and uncertain for my future. I feel very lost. I find it hard to move on from my mistake of resigning. 
Please offer some advices on how i can move on. 
Thanks

Forget voting. Forget having kids. Forget everything. Nothing else matters but the End of Modern Life. It needs to collapse and end.

1mg1imo,Can someone let me know if I’m reasonable for feeling this way?,"I don’t have anyone to talk to about it.

I started working at a bank in 2022 after graduating. It was rotational program working on different teams within banking/wealth management. I eventually landed on one of the teams after three months. Did that job for 2 years

Now in hindsight I made so many mistakes. For one, my boss was the worst thing to walk this earth as I come to find out. Never checked in and would blame stuff on us because she never looked at her email. It got ridiculous so I started posting for jobs internally. 

The 2 I posted for was outside of my department. I did not get passed the first round each time and had to let my manager each time which wrecked me. One of them I was up against Harvard grad, it brought down my confidence that summer and made a move within the same department for 10k more as I was doing anything to get away from her at that point and our relationship really started to strain. The job required that I train for 2 months before shifting over. Which meant I had to continue to help out my older manager. Turns out that lasted 6 months, I come to find out the new manager used to work for her so they worked out a deal to get everything done for the year before I moved over.

So I did it, I bit the bullet and decided to grind it out if that meant staying at the company. That ended up straining my relationship with my new manager and his relationship my old boss. So now I’m on this new team and have been for the last 9 months. My new manager is on the other side of the country so it’s all zoom, my coworkers are not very social and there’s only 3 of them at my location. 

I took a week of last week for vacation, I asked my manager if he had any extra work due to the slow period in the year he said yes and that was before I left for the week. I get back and gave all the extra work to the team, but me. 

Now there’s a few things I would like answered. Did looking for jobs outside of my department make me look bad so early in my career?, is my boss/company trying to ice me out? And should I have jumped ship a while ago?

I’m not very good at the ethics of corp America as it is very new to me and l admit im not the smartest but im hungry.

1mg1evw,Transition to Different Role Within Company or Switch Company With a New Industry,"I am currently fortunate that I enjoy the work that I do. I have been at my current career for 1.5 years. I recently asked my leadership if the steps I am currently taking will get me promoted in the future and what's the timeline. All I was told is just more time, but they are thinking 3-5 years. I asked them is there anything specifically that's just barring me, and they said just need more time. I asked can we create a plan with actionable steps to get there, and they just said keep doing what I am doing and a promotion will come. I am completely dissatisfied with that answer. It seems like the time will pass, and they will say, ""Oh, you did not do these things, so we can justify the promotion yet.""

I decide to start exploring options. The first is reaching out to a different manager working in a different part of the company. The meeting goes fantastic, and she is truly honest about the situation. She said we can establish a plan and utilize specific language based on promotion documents to write up my end of year accomplishments. She said the only issue is that since my experience is not a direct lateral movement, I would be resetting somewhat. She says this to temper my expectations a bit, she said she wants to be as transparent as possible. She tells me think it over, and we can start working with my current leadership if I decide a transition would suit me best. I wish I started working for her in the first place.

  
The second option is to switch companies. I turned down a job offer from a different place before accepting my current role. It was nothing wrong with the company. They were wonderful. It was just for personal reasons that I decided to not move states to work with them. I was always left with the ""what if"" feeling. I decide to give one of the managers a call. He is excited to chat with me. He was a bit bummed things did not work out, and he asks has anything change that would lead into the same result of me not accepting. I told him that I am no longer attached to living in this state, and I am looking to make a change depending what the opportunity is. He tells me he would love to make a role for me, but he would have to clear it with other senior managers and get back to me

  
Now I am in a weird spot. It seems like I have two positive paths, and I am not sure which one should I actively pursue. I would love any thoughts/advice or questions to ask to help decide.

1mg0rsh,Need out asap,"Hi all. This is going be a pretty long post. I’m in a bit of sucky situation and would love any advice on what to do. To give some background, I was promoted into a director role back in January and was moved to a different customer. I’m 5 years out of college and still learning. Previously I worked with a really great team and sr director who did an amazing job at succession planning and leading a team. The sr director on my new customer account (which I don’t report to) is awful. I was warned before I was promoted that this specific leader was terrible however I overlooked it because I would be reporting to someone else. It is my understanding that a sr director should essentially be driving the plan/vision of this account with me & my other director executing the plan and ensuring efficiency. However that has not been the case at all. She looks to me and my other counter part to drive everything in this market however when things don’t go the way she wants or the customer responds negatively she will pretty much blame me or my coworker that we didn’t present something correctly or their was a “lack of understanding”. Most recently there have been a few challenges in my market and really need some guidance from this account leader on how to handle specific situations and her feedback to me was “well I look to you on what to do as your a director and being paid as one”. Never in my professional career have I ever went to someone for guidance and be told to just figure it out. This sr d also has made this job unbearable due to her prioritizes being all off. She pings me on teams all day long and then will report to my direct supervisor that I am unresponsive. She sent me 15 emails in one day one time and reported that to him as well. Also to note - as a sr d shes supposed to manage the relationship between us and the customers executive team and she now has invited me and my other director to her 1 on 1’s with them because she can’t even answer their questions. I’m at the point where I’m crying daily and can’t even breathe during the day because the amount of work she continues to pile on me. I’m also having nightmares. Most recently she’s been cc’ing my direct supervisor on all emails. I’ve spoken to him about what’s going on and he’s aligned however I don’t think anything is going to be done about this. I’m struggling really badly and I’ve asked for feedback on specific things on how I can do things better and I get nothing back in return.

I’ve (31m)been working at a steel mill for the past 9 years and while I make decent money (100k~),I’m honestly so burnt out with the 12 hour rotating shifts and just slaving  my twenties away to a place that couldn’t care less about me.

I feel like I’m not really good at anything so it’s hard to imagine what I could do.
There are so many things that sound interesting to pursue but I’m not sure what I’d be good at to actually deep dive into it. 
Anyone else experience this? How did you overcome this ? 

If y’all have any advice or any websites/books that helped yall with this issue I’d greatly appreciate it.

1mfzppx,Is Hairdresser A Viable Career in 2025?,"A friend of mine is considering cosmetology/hairdressing as a career switch.  She is 31 with no post-secondary degree. She is currently working a non-commission retail position at about $14/hr. She has no appreciable assets and about $15k in combined student and credit card debit that she is struggling to stay on top of. 

The career change would involve about a year's investment and $15-20k in education. She is looking to me for advice and support in this choice. I am highly concerned about the improvement in earning potential not being sufficient to be worth the effort, especially considering the short-term income hit she will take from school and the additional debt incurred. I am also concerned because I've known other people in this line of work and have seen them come and go. It seems like the type of thing people only do until they find something better.

She is located in rural VA but considering relocating to the midwest (Chicago/Milwaukee area). She has previously shown interest in outdoor/nature careers but her dream of getting into the park service seems dead with her lack of education and recent politics of funding. 

What I'm looking for is real-world feedback and reliable statistics to move the needle one way or the other for both of us. This would include any personal experiences around realistic salary expectations, job longevity, and career satisfaction.

1mfzp7y,Laid off from QA software Job seeking advice,"Hello!

I was working as a QA Engineer for the last 6ish years doing all sorts of testing automated, manual, performance testing. I have a degree in Applied Math and a Minor in Computer Science. 

I have been applying to jobs since I got laid off officially about two weeks ago - and have yet to hear back from positions that I’ve applied for.

I was wondering with my degree & skillset what other careers could I look to break into? 

If I have to potentially go back to school, ( maybe for another two year degree? ) I’d potentially be willing to do that even, even though I already have a bachelors and minor.

I am open to all ideas, from people who have a similar skillset / degree OR REALLY anyone that has been in a similar position.

1mfzn7r,Old boss is poaching me to his current company. What should I do? Please help,"Its been 1 year since I joined my company A. And my boss (lets name him Ben) was the one who took my interview and accepted me into it. Ben is a nice guy. 

When I first joined, we had a team of 40 people ( this includes 38 members + 1 manager + Ben)

Over time people left and layoffs happened. Ben was also let go- he then went ahead and joined a competitive company B. 

Hence remained 15 members + 1 manager at company A.

Recently the manager also resigned and joined company B. Due to which i have been made the new manager of company A and they had agreed upon a 50% raise in my pay. 

Around June 25th Ben had offered me a role at his company - which i declined as Saturdays' are working and the company is smaller and not as established in the market as my current company. 

I took up my new role on july 1st. (Im on a contract basis). But I haven't yet gotten my renewed contract which highlights my new title and new pay- due to which i again got my older salary at the end of july. 

I have been asking them daily for my renewed contract- but they keep telling that ""your contract is getting approvals from a number of people- hence it is taking time"".
I cant help but feel a little betrayed.

Today I got a call again from Ben. Asking me to reconsider and that ""all my requirements will be taken care of"" (which probably refers to increase in pay) as they could really use a person with my skill set. 

What do i do? 

Pros of my current company A- Saturdays are off, work load is less-er, more comfortable, i like my new boss (Ritu). 

Cons - They are taking suspiciously long to renew my contract and give my fair pay. 

Pros of company B- Higher Pay, probably will get reunited with my older team. 

Cons - Saturdays working, probably more work load, do not provide company email ID. ",Little-Relief3242,237,0.9100000262260437,190,1754164470,2025-08-02 19:54:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mfzn7r/old_boss_is_poaching_me_to_his_current_company/,8,2025
1mfyyk3,How should I negotiate this offer?,"
I have been working in executive level marketing leadership for a few years now and I’ve built a very good reputation and strong network. 

Recently, I was offered an executive level advisory position part-time for a venture backed start up. The CEO of this startup has an impressive background and the VC firm seems legit. They have shown some traction to date. However, they are still low in revenue, and they offered me about 1/4 what I would normally charge for consulting—but with 0.5% equity vested over 2 years. 

I’ve never had equity as part of my offer and I’m wondering what is fair and what may be up for negotiation. I know 0.5% is a lot for some companies, but is it considered a solid offer for a company at this early stage? Should I counter for more to make up for the low pay? Or should I keep the equity but try to counter for more $$—knowing that that may be a harder sell for them at this time. Is there something else I should put on the table like a trigger clause, performance based bonus, etc.? Is it reasonable for me to ask to see financial projections since equity is such a huge part of the compensation?

There are other reasons to do this beyond the financial as well: excellent networking, a resume bump, and a chance to build something
from the ground up being chief among them. 

This is new to me and I want to be reasonable without selling myself short. ",cMercuryRising,1,1.0,7,1754162700,2025-08-02 19:25:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mfyyk3/how_should_i_negotiate_this_offer/,8,2025

My supervisor was no exception she always distance herself and do not acknowledged my existence or contributions. Over time i stopped caring anymore n tried shutting out the noise with my earphone and going to work has becoming draining. Even the reception isnt helpful.  Following up with her on bills that she needs to send to the dept for approval is annoying as she says she just doing a favor by doing so but it is something she is doing all along it is her job as letters come to her. But she throwing her weight around, yet alone the managers some specfic ones in my dept loves to nitpick and make u do unnecessary checking whenever u need her guidance.

Bills from certain retail mgr always comes at the last hour with all sort of excuses without fail every month making a mad rush for me on the last day to take them in and still have the cheek to chase for pmt as the bills are always due when it reaches me...GODDAMN it if you feel the paperwork n bills are not your priority and always hand in at the last hr,  why should i put it my priority to process yours just because they are due when you sit on it.

1mfwrdj,"How can you reinvent yourself and build a different career path from scratch, if you have a Master's degree in Mathematics and doing a PhD currently in it?","The main problem I have is that I specialize in theoretical mathematics, it's not applied mathematics like statistics or something with computers. This basically locks me into academia and teaching.

All the other jobs which are hiring mathematicians are basically just for applied mathematicians. Like you need programming languages, or be a licensed actuary, or have some degree in Data Science, etc. I don't have anything like that at all.

Because I don't want to restrict myself to academia and teaching only, and want to be open for other job paths, I would like to ask you for suggestions what I should do. If you were in my situation, what would you do?

Repeating university and finishing a second degree is actually impossible for me right now, as I am working part time as a teacher at my university. I could enroll at another university, but I wouldn't be able to attend the classes. So if I were to obtain a second degree, it would have to be online strictly.

Then, you have courses. I could look around, shop around, maybe I would be able to get a discount as a PhD student somewhere (or use those LinkedIn courses - heck, I don't even have a LinkedIn), but I have a feeling that courses are overrated. I think employers want to see a candidate who actually has a degree in let's say Data Science, and not some Data Science course finished on Coursera.

Then, there are programming languages. Though here, I simply don't know how to show it off in my CV.

I also don't know, whether I am overthinking it all too much, and whether another path (which I don't see) would be easier to establish? Because right now, I still think from a 1st year student perspective who is just about to enter the Rat Race, but maybe I don't have to?

I am completely clueless, all I want is to expand my job possibilities, while using my Mathematics degree as a basis for all of that.

I need all of your creative input here. I admit, that I asked different AI models to help me, but they give so vague advice that it's just not helping me really.

1mfvxpy,Is it normal for a recruiter to shut down questions about long-term career growth?,"I was recently in process for a senior-level sales role with a European tech company expanding into the UK. I flew out to meet the team in person, had good conversations with senior leadership, and left genuinely excited about the opportunity.

After returning, I asked the external recruiter a simple and professional question:
“If I deliver results, is there a pathway to grow into a leadership role in the UK over time?”

He refused to pass the question on. Instead, he told me I was “getting ahead of myself,” said “ambition needs to be tempered,” and warned that I could be seen as a bad fit. He even suggested I’d talk myself out of the role and end up in a generic £40K job.

To be clear, I wasn’t asking for a promotion or a title. I was just trying to understand whether the company had a long-term vision for the market and if there was a chance to grow into that, if I delivered results. After that interaction I am debating stepping back from the process.

Is this kind of response from a recruiter normal? Was I out of line for asking a long-term question before accepting a role, or should I dodge a bullet?

1mftwoq,"Need advice with the corporate ""golden handcuffs"" and stagnant career growth","I'm in my early 30s and I've worked for a big tech company for about seven years now. I work in video production I've almost doubled my salary from when I first started and make anywhere between $160k - $180k a year with benefits. I was a contractor for the first 1.5 years, converted to a FTE, and been promoted once. I've received one raise, two spot bonuses and one hefty retention bonus

This all may sound great but the biggest issue I'm having with my 7 years at the company is the lack of career growth. I've seen my co workers get bigger promotions, higher level increases and I've been layered twice now, where co workers jump up in the corporate ladder and I report to them instead of my manager who is two levels up.

Speaking with said manager about this, he mentioned this is not indicative of my performance at all, except it's what makes the most sense for my org structure.

I worry that the work that I do is too niche for my team and I don't have a proper path for visibility and growth because at the end of the day, I'm responsible for the video production of my team and I'm the only one with the technical expertise to run our studio. I feel like I'm valuable because I keep the ""lights on"" yet don't get much visibility outside of that.

It's worth mentioning I've been very vocal about this and my managers and they're aware. I was put on a 6-month road map to receive a promotion earlier this year and once again, I did not get it.

I've looked elsewhere for jobs and have recruiters reach out every year for possible prospects but the two main issues I have is:

1. They pay less than my current company
2. They're not remote work

I can't help but to feel trapped by the corporate shackles. I'm wondering if this is more of a situation where I need a paradigm shift how I view my job and accept the healthy paycheck and leave my job at just that. A paycheck to collect. Though, my ambitious and life protects are more than that and I miss the days where I was hungry to ""make it"" though some may argue I already have with my job.

Would love some insights with people who are dealing the same or dealt with this in the past.

1mfttsr,"Trying to break into tech from a dark place ... burnt out, broke, and barely holding on..","Hi everyone,

I don’t usually post stuff like this, but I’m at a point where I just need to let it out. I’ve been trying to build a career in AI/data science since i had my master in 2021. I live in a small town in a third world country where opportunities are almost nonexistent. Most local jobs (non-tech) here pay less than $70/month, and remote work is incredibly hard to land...

I did manage to get a job as a Python/AI/DS instructor for a while , it was a great experience, but things went downhill fast due to issues with my manager and the toxic environment and she replaced me without letting me know while  I was preparing workshops for the next cohort ( just because I refused to teach extra free hours as I used to do). Since then, it's been one rejection after another, or worse… silence.

I’m also a part-time caregiver for my father with Parkinson disease. I can’t just move to another city or start fresh somewhere else. +I live in a very toxic household  misogyny, emotional pressure, constant judgment. I get questioned every day about what I’m doing with my life, while I’m literally doing everything I can just to stay afloat. No financial support, no emotional support. It’s exhausting.

And even though I spend hours every day studying, learning new tech, applying for jobs, joining Kaggle competitions just to keep going (and maybe win something to survive), I feel like I’m going nowhere. Like I’m screaming into the void.

I know a job won’t magically fix everything, but some financial stability and a sense of purpose would really help. I just want to work on something meaningful ,focus on one objective, be part of a team, contribute, and grow. I want to stop feeling like I'm wasting my years. I’ve got the passion, the drive, the skills (I think?)  ..but no access.

Ik that everyone is  struggling but i do struggle a lot with self-doubt, burnout, depression, and constant identity crisis. I’ve had suicidal thoughts when I hit the bottom.. I feel lost in this rapidly growing field . Like I need to know everything all the time, and that’s impossible. I just want to focus, build something, and feel useful again. 

  
And to anyone who might say, “Just give up on tech and start a business or find a need in your region” I get where that comes from, but I can’t. I’m holding on with grit,  with bloody hands and stubborn hope

I made a promise to myself that I would make something out of this not for ego,  or maybe it is but also because it’s the only thing that truly feels like ME. This field isn’t just a career path to me. It’s survival. It’s identity. It’s a way of proving to myself and to everyone who ever misunderstood me, mistreated me, or made me feel small  that I CAN.

And yeah, it’s draining. So, so draining. and I hate that I'm failing. all I want is one real chance  ,is that too much?

If you’ve been through something similar, or if you have any advice, resources, opportunities, or even just some kind words, I’d really appreciate it.

1mftbx6,University Applications - What should I do?,"Hi! I’m a year 12 student who’s going to put in her QTAC (University) applications soon. Today, I did the UCAT, in which I scored an evidently uncompetitive score, so I’m wondering what I should do instead of uni.

I’ve always wanted to be a vet and I was thinking about applying to veterinary science but I’m unsure on whether or not it would be worth it. In terms of what I’m passionate about, I would totally become a vet. However, the pay doesn’t seem proportionate to the amount of work you have to put in to become one and I’m not sure if I’d want that life for myself.

I guess my main question is: If anyone is a vet (or just general advice pls), would you encourage me to pursue this as a career? Or should I just stick with a science undergrad and take the GAMSAT to do med.

1mfslhq,Career change advice. What do I even do?,"I’m at a loss for what to do. I’m a teacher and like so many, I want out. I literally have nightmares about my job. I have a masters in teaching and also a masters in social work but I don’t want to go back to social work as I found the burnout just as prevalent and the pay just as bad. I do a have two years experience co-owning a small business and basically handling everything from leads and follow ups to digital marketing.

But everything I’m somewhat interested in is super competitive with either other transitioning teachers or people who actually got degrees in that field. I don’t know how to stand out or even where I should start upskilling without spending money I don’t have (I’m pay check to pay check.)

Instructional design - would require money I don’t have to spend on certificates, oversaturated 

Ux design - same thing. Oversaturated and people with actual degrees.

Customer success - while I don’t need a certificate or anything, I lack the experience. The Ed tech sector is more friendly to teachers but I’m against a ton of applicants.


I know everyone wants a remote job. But I have a chronic illness that would be much improved if I wasn’t on my feet all day. Despite that, I’m even willing to relocate for in person.

1mfsggw,Stuck Between Business Analyst Path or Electrician What Should I Do?,"I’m 21 and finishing up my Bachelor’s in Business Administration this December. I’m at a bit of a crossroads and could really use some perspective from people who’ve been through either path.

Here’s where I’m at:
	I’ve been leaning toward becoming a Business Analyst. I like the idea of working in tech or finance, and I know there’s good money and room to grow in those fields. But I’m not super strong with Excel, SQL, or analytics tools yet. I’m willing to learn, but I’m not sure how long it’ll take to break in without experience.
	On the other hand, I’ve thought about just forgetting the degree and going into a skilled trade like becoming an electrician. I don’t mind physical work, and I know electricians can make really good money long-term with solid job security. The downside is it would take a few years as an apprentice before I’d really start earning a solid wage.

My goals:
	I want to be making more than $40–50K as soon as possible, but I’m also thinking long-term — I’d like to hit 6 figures eventually.
	I don’t want to be stuck doing something I hate just for the money.
	I’m willing to grind and level up either way, I just don’t want to waste time going the wrong direction.

What I’m leaning toward:

I’m about 60/40 toward the Business Analyst route. I feel like I could grow more, work remotely, and earn more over time — if I put in the effort to learn the right skills. But I also hate the idea of being unemployed after graduation and just sitting around spinning my wheels.

Any advice?
	Has anyone made the switch to either path and been glad (or regretted it)?
	How hard is it to break into business analyst roles with no direct experience but a degree?
	Is it crazy to throw away a 4-year degree and go trades instead?

Appreciate any honest input!

1mfrstk,"18 years experience in industry X, how to adapt your resume to apply for minimum wage/general jobs?","
Long story short, my husband has 18 years of experience in the game industry as a 3D artist, but is finding it super hard to find jobs. He will keep searching but our money is running out and he'll soon have to apply for employment insurance , and start looking for any job that can help us pay our bills.

But how to adapt his resume in this case?

He had a few work experiences in hazmat cleaning, and sidewalk construction and a little bit of sales and building PC computers, but those were almost 20 years ago.

I'm afraid it will be challenging for him to even find minimum wage jobs because if applying through online systems ATS won't look at his application and hiring managers will say he is overqualified.

1mfprxx,I need general advice and possible interview help,"So I am in a very unique situation and I have been trying to think of the best potential paths and opportunities to be taking and looking for. I currently work for my dad (he is a self employed construction type worker, really an excavator, who I help with both office work and the actual construction part). I am 22 years old and a female, and I have been working for him throughout college. Due to some health issues with my parents, I have been very slow in searching for a job and very picky with what I apply to. I have been trying to help them more than I have been fully 100% invested in finding a job, not the best but also I’m not against taking over my dad’s company.  I would just have a lot of learning to do and a fear of bugs/bees to get over lol. I graduated in December 2024 with a bachelors degree in business administration and my major was information systems. 

Things have started to get better with my parents so I have been taking the job search more seriously and I have landed my first interview. This seems to almost be through networking, but also it was networking through my family so I don’t know how to count that. I got connected with a company that is maybe 5 minutes from my house, and they have the word information systems in their company name, so my cousin thought I would be the perfect fit. 

This is where I start to get confused because there are blurred lines. The owner sounded like he wanted me to do what he called “field work” and was essentially going out to places that they install audiovisual/security equipment in places like like churches, offices, schools, hospitals or a step back which was structured cabling. I had never honestly been knowledgeable in these topics, I set up all the tvs and systems in my house but it’s always been learn as I go and self taught.  I don’t know much about installing anything beyond what would be in a home, let alone trying to transfer it to a commercial or just professional level. The phone call with the owner went really well, I think more so because my cousin was able to talk on my behalf than this guy truly going through my resume and skills. He spoke on how talented I was, and I don’t think I gave him anything to give him that impression after 10 minutes on the phone but who knows. 

I got a call from the HR manager a bit after that, and he was basically confused on the vision of the owner, because I have no experience in what they would need for me to be able to do the field work, many people go to trade school for it or otherwise have knowledge before hand. But he said they would likely have space in their office for me writing estimates and learning enough about the field to be able to transition into a sales role. 

It was something they did still have to talk with all the managers about, see where they have space and that kind of stuff. I just got a call though where he told me I have an interview if I’m still interested. I told him yes, because honestly I’m on vacation and haven’t been thinking about it full time, but now I have been. 

The job is in the office part of the company, not the “in the field” part, so I wouldn’t be any kind of technician. I would be writing estimates, and I don’t know if I am qualified for writing estimates and stuff, I currently write invoices and estimates for my dad but since it’s on such a small scale versus an actual company, and I do it on quick books where I just throw the information in and it’s an invoice/estimate, I don’t know how it would translate into a bigger setting. With my dad it’s so casual and that’s the other reason I want actual experience, I don’t know the proper formats or documentation for an actual company or business setting. I feel like I learned basics in college and then never did anything more with that. Also, I don’t know how interest or good at sales I would be. I have thought of myself as an extroverted introvert. I can talk to people, I don’t prefer to though. I can give a presentation and speak in public, but I will always be nervous before hand and will have to know every detail of what I’m about to talk about in case of questions. I have a million reasons of why I might not be qualified or fit for the job, and then at the end of the day I don’t think I want to be in sales. 

I think it’s important to note that I worked at a big American eagle for 4 days and the whole time they were in my ear yelling at me and everyone to “sell more, we need 4 more $100 purchases this hour to hit the goal” and just the thought of trying to sell someone something like panicked me. I quit after 4 shifts and cried on the phone to them. 

I don’t like to be the kind of person to quit for the reason of not being able to handle it or just not liking it. I do a lot of thinking and research of “is this a right fit for me”.  I just don’t know if I’m being too picky, or if I’m honestly qualified for anything these days. There are people with experience and more qualifications not being hired so I want to jump at, but at the same time I currently have a job that I could make into a career if I worked at it and I don’t want to move away from that to something I wouldn’t like. 

TLDR:
I got an interview at a company and I’m not sure how to go into it, or what my thoughts should be. I might not be qualified in the level that they thought I would be, and I don’t know how to go into the interview. I don’t want to take a job that I won’t like, and I don’t want to pass up a good opportunity. It has the potential to turn into a sales job, but I never imagined myself in sales nor thought I could do it. 
My main question is what kind of people succeed at sales jobs? And should I just be thankful for the interview if I decide I don’t want that job and then move on looking for what I want? (I don’t know if my level of pickiness is a bad thing in this job market).

1mfo0jz,Should I take the job without knowing the pay?,"I know this is long, but I truly appreciate the perspective because this whole situation feels messy!! 

TL;DR:
After my company's acquisition, we were told there will be a comp restrucring and I may get an increase in pay. Meanwhile, I was offered a new role within the company—initially framed as a promotion, but turns out it’s a lateral move with unclear pay until January. Meanwhile, my manager already lined up my replacement and wants me fully transitioned in a month. I love my current role and team, and I’m hesitant to move without knowing if I’d be better or worse off (if I stay I will also still get a raise but again not sure how much). Meeting with my manager Monday—looking for advice on whether my concerns are valid and how to approach the convo.


My company recently acquired a smaller company, and as a result they’re rolling out new roles and restructuring job titles and compensation across the board starting Jan 1 '25. In my current role, I’ve consistently overachieved and was told I’d be getting a raise and a title change to reflect more of a “senior” status. I also genuinely love what I do and have the best team I’ve had in over 10 years.

A few weeks ago, my director encouraged me to shadow a new role that came out of the acquisition. He pitched it like it was a great opportunity—possibly even a promotion. I did a few shadow sessions, met with the senior director, and then she just… offered me the job. There wasn’t even a real interview. She just asked me a few questions, then after a couple days called me up and made the offer.

At first, I was excited. But then I was told it’s actually considered a lateral move, and while my current pay is “comparable” to others in that role, no one knows for sure what the compensation will be until the new structure is rolled out in January. So basically, I’d be accepting the job without knowing what I’d be paid.

I met with my manager earlier today and found out he’s already lined up a replacement for me. He wants me fully transitioned within a month—even though I won’t know my actual pay until January.

The whole thing feels kind of off. Like… I don’t know how this new role compares to what I’d get if I just stayed put and waited for the raise and title change I’ve already been told I’m in line for. It also feels weird that there was no formal interview and that things are moving so fast.

The new role could be a great experience, and I know I’d be able to do it well—but it might be more stressful and less enjoyable than what I’m doing now. I’m not against change, but I don’t want to jump into something blindly and end up worse off.

I’ve got a meeting with my manager on Monday and I want to bring up my concerns, but I’m not sure how to say it without sounding like all I care about is money. At the same time, money is a factor, and I think it’s fair to want to know what I’m stepping into before I give up a job and team I love.

So… are my concerns valid? Has anyone dealt with something like this before? I’d really appreciate any advice on how to handle this or how to frame the conversation on Monday.

Often I get feedback that they love working with me and that I’m the best of my department, but only as long as I agree with them or help them, however as soon as I have to say no, demand smth of someone or take a stance, suddenly people are too busy to talk to me, or have a bunch of advice of how I should actually talk to people, or straight up ignore me, or get offended by it and ask if I have something against them.

1mfmx9j,Haven’t been paid by internship. Losing hope,"Hi everyone, I really need advice because I’m scared I’ve been scammed.

I (21F) come from a low-income family and I financially support not only my disabled older sister but also my parents. Two months ago, I started as a product management intern for a CEO who promised me a better work culture and better pay compared to my previous job. I trusted him so much that I quit my old job for this opportunity.

I know it was probably stupid to quit my old job as a bartender, but I was working 60+ hours a week while also being a full-time computer science student. I barely slept, sometimes only 40 minutes a day while maintaining full scholarships because I simply can’t afford tuition otherwise. On top of that, I’ve been using my savings to pay for my sister’s hospital bills.

I still have some savings left to support my family for now, but I should have received my pay by now. If I don’t, not only am I losing money, but I’ve also wasted two months that I could have spent finding another job or internship that actually pays.

We signed a contract stating that I would be paid. Since then, I’ve been working with him almost every day. Every week he says the same thing: that the payment is coming soon, that “Wise is holding it,” and that I’ll get it next week. But every time next week comes, he repeats the same story.

At this point, I’m losing hope. I’ve spoken to him multiple times, but nothing changes. I’m scared that I’ve been scammed and that maybe the other “employees” are in on it too.

I don’t know what to do. I really need this money to pay my bills and support my family. Is there any legal action I can take to make sure I get paid? Has anyone been in a situation like this before?

Any advice would mean the world to me.

1mfmu64,How can I transition into stable and high-paying career?,"I have been a bona fide student as a child. I knew I needed to work hard to excel. It wasn't until I joined university and learnt that I needed skills to land a job in the market. I had my major in science, and I signed up for societies and worked as a writer. During my second year of university, I landed a team leader (writing job), but due to a micromanagement environment, I had to leave. Then, during the third year, I joined the technical courses and joined another 2 organisations (1 full-time and the other part-time) and did not pay attention to the university's main courses. I juggled a job, was warned by my professor/supervisor to leave this job and focus on my main subjects. I also faced judgments from professors, and considering the demand for research, I signed up for the professor’s classes as the professor gave me research work with the promise that my name would be published with the article. I was quite dumb and I worked under him for a year, but then I realised there were 20+ students like me working under him and none of their names were published in the article. So, I decided to leave his research group and just barely pass the university courses, as my interest was quite lost. I was mocked in class, and so I barely attend the university class lectures. But I was sure that the market is too high and I was going to be underpaid after I complete university education (I joined university as I was offered a scholarship), just passed my subjects. I faced burnout, so I left these 2 organisations as well as I worked there at an entry level. Since it was my choice to start from scratch (writing). I also joined freelancing platforms, but it was too saturated for me, so I joined another marketing platform. Then I joined online tutoring in my last university year and worked as a writer, and I found that the tutor pay was not enough, while my interest was more towards writing. In the end, I had to leave it and somehow just passed the main subject technical courses and completed research work and got a university degree. The government jobs are hard for me to crack due to the long recruiting process. I worked under a freelance marketer, but the person did not clear my pending payment for the previous six months, and I was supposed to be paid for the last month, and the deadline has passed. I had been requesting him for the past week. I think he will not pay me. Now I am still working under another organisation full-time (8-10 hours), and I have been working part-time for 3-4 hours for that freelance marketer as a writer. Now I want to transition to my field where my career can be stable. I feel like I should have listened to my supervisor and not neglected his advice. I am quite ashamed of transitioning and not sure where I should go. My goal is a high-paying and stable career, but then there is AI/ML, and I do not like hard grinding mathematics. I am thinking of transitioning to data analytics and cybersecurity, but I am not sure if I will be able to do it, as I love writing and generating insights. Then, after graduation, it has been three years since I lost again. I feel like I should not transition, or maybe I am just not sure how long I can work there, as I feel like a total failure.",Old_Long_2905,1,1.0,0,1754128838,2025-08-02 10:00:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mfmu64/how_can_i_transition_into_stable_and_highpaying/,8,2025

Cool. Been doing that for 5 years mate. Still lost.

The frustrating thing is it's SO CLOSE to being useful. It can help you research careers, write cover letters, prep for interviews. But when it comes to the actual hard bit - figuring out what you want when you don't know what you want - it's useless.

What I'm building tries to fix this by actually remembering who you are across conversations and helping you spot patterns in what energises you vs what drains you. But honestly still not sure if AI can actually solve this problem.

1mfmfhk,Company counter offered to match new offer.  Should I stay?,"29M and I worked for my current company for 2.5 years currently making $95k.

They claimed the companies overhead was too high and in that timeframe they laid off around 20% of staff.  

I went out and got an offer from another company 115k with company truck and gas that I was planning on taking.  This week I sat my manager down and officially gave my 2 weeks.  He was stunned and started making some calls, next thing I know I’m in our directors office counter offering me with a new base of $124k with 3 weeks of PTO.  They also said there’s a new position that is opening that I will be promoted too as well in the next 6-12 months.  

Not sure how I feel about any of this!  Kinda jaded that they didn’t tell me what this was coming down the pipe the first time when they said no to the raise.

1mfm1y6,How do you deal with a team lead who lets your coworker cheat because he has a romantic interest in her?,"Super sensitive topic, But recently I started a new Job and been having positive experiences so far until my team lead hired a new female co worker and started letting her cheats on small things like break time because he has romantic interest in her. 

This won’t bother me if: 
- We work on a very small team with a lot of work load. ( 4 people ) 
- My team lead pressured me to work harder and said He will put me on a trial for salary increases ( nothing guarantee ) 
-  The company is pretty new so the way they measure work quality or worker productivity is not precise. 
- When I just casually recommended a supportive suggestion he got a bit defensive in his tone ( now I am confused because he said he could promote me if I stick with the company in long term and would like to get more feedback??) -> My suggestion has nothing to do with the new co worker but I guess unconsciously he also knows she lashes out on the job and got protective on her? 

The new co worker things: 

- She kept commenting about my body which I don’t appreciate, not a casual chat, but when we were in the elevator or just sit down she casually brought up my back is not very straight which is rude, and she been brought those up twice and I stopped engaging with her. 

- She asked for my help, But got argumentative when I tried to show her my way of doing my work so I stopped 

- We have policy that no break time when the shift started and she been taking break at the beginning of the shift or took longer break than what we are allowed multiple times. It started to get pretty obvious. 



I know the best answer for this is just to play dumb and do your job until you get a better opportunity and move on but this still wages heavily for me because I never face this situation before. In my previous work experiences, this is something prohibited and will be taken care by HR, however, I moved to a different country and based on what I understand about the culture aspect I know better to be quite. 

But can you give me very “stupid” or “unhinged” solutions to cheer me up 😂😂😂 Something that is straight out of comedy movies.

1mfk87p,Is It Weird to Reach Out to an Old Manager for Advice About a Sensitive Situation?,"I’ve posted previously. I supposed here is a slight update. Now I’m stuck as to where to go from here.. I’m in a pretty uncomfortable situation at work, and I’m not sure if it’s appropriate to reach out to an old manager for advice. 
my boss recently told me that a coworker is allegedly looking for blackmail on me. Yeah, it’s as weird and stressful as it sounds. I had a conversation with the coworker to try to clear things up, but honestly, it just made me feel more uneasy.. I did ask  for a department transfer prior to speaking with the coworker  because I just don’t feel comfortable staying in this situation.. I feel like I have to constantly look over my shoulder. 
Although I don’t want to transfer again or quit.. but idk I am NOT comfortable. Idk where to go from here. Which  is why I’m thinking about reaching out to an old manager / member of upper management. He’s in a different state now, but he gave me his number a couple of years ago and I’ve been thinking about asking for his advice.
To give some context, I never worked directly under him. I actually quit from a different manager, but about 6 weeks later, he welcomed me back to the company. He was there advocating for me with the manager I had quit from. He gave me his number before I had quit, and then again when he welcomed me back. We’ve never really kept in touch, but he’s someone I feel could give me a good third-party perspective. My current boss is the one who called me and offered me my current position.

I don’t want to overstep or make things weird. It’s been a while since we’ve talked, and I’m not sure if it’s appropriate to contact him out of the blue for something like this. But I really need a third-party perspective, and I feel like he could help me figure this out.
Has anyone here ever reached out to an old boss or coworker for advice on something like this? Is it okay, or does it come off as strange?

We have a client pilot that got delayed once already (because engineering needed more time—not in my control). Then I was forced to send a disclaimer to the client, even though I **explicitly warned** that it made no sense in this situation.

The disclaimer is something we normally use *before* starting the work—to get the client to acknowledge that their data doesn’t meet our quality baseline, so we can’t guarantee accuracy. I agree with the idea *in principle*, but this pilot was already late, and the client was already waiting on us. Sending it now just looked like we were trying to dodge responsibility.

But of course, the CEO insisted. To make it worse, he told me to run it by the VAR (a vendor who introduced us but is NOT close to the project at all and has ZERO idea what’s going on) just so he could “approve” the disclaimer. For what? It makes no sense. So I made a judgment call: I skipped telling the partner, sent the disclaimer to the client myself (Wednesday), and delivered the report by Friday as promised.

In my introspect, it was better to take the hit *once* and still deliver, instead of delaying again or dragging in irrelevant people and creating a bigger mess. The client was understandably annoyed at the disclaimer, but after I apologized and sent the report, they said thank you and seemed cooperative.

Then my CEO swoops in to do “damage control,” calls the client *and* the VAR, and then tells me the client doesn’t want to work with **me** anymore. Not the company—just *me*.

But instead of owning his role, the CEO tells me I’m “inexperienced,” and moving forward, *I’ll write all the emails but he’ll send them himself*. What the fuck?

He’s trying to frame this as a “communication problem” when it was his idea to send that damn disclaimer in the first place. I’m exhausted and pissed off. I genuinely tried to minimize risk and deliver on time, but now I’m the scapegoat.

1mfjur0,"Is my company subtly trying to push me out, or am I overthinking things?","I’ve been working at a big financial company for a little over a year now. The onboarding was chaotic — took me 3 months to get access to basic tools and was left alone most of the time. My boss was distant, I felt isolated, and had to create my own work just to stay useful. Over time, things improved, but not without conflict — coworkers gossiping about me, my boss treating me like a noob, and me being blamed for things I didn’t do.

Recently, the VP (my boss’s boss) had a 1-0-1 with me and told me my performance has improved, that I’m reliable and have senior potential. During the conversation, he also made a weird comment: “I want you to leave with the right tools"" when we were discussing the posibility of a certification or a postgraduate program, then awkwardly laughed when I joked about being ""let go"".

A day after that, I had a 1-0-1 with my manager, but he downplayed the positive feedback the VP shared about me; he said others got the same he then talked about two possible opportunities: 1? new role in the department but in another area (which he emphasized the chief officer of our area offered to him before). Then he vaguely offered me a “tool ownership” position, which sounds cool — but I’m afraid it’s a way to sideline me rather than help me grow.

I have to say that my boss always try to omit any of my achievements, he would go above and beyond prasing my coworkers but would skip me when it's my turn.

Coworkers are now fishing to find out what the VP told me. I feel like I’m in the middle of office politics I didn’t ask for.

	•	The other is a more software engineering mgmt role that aligns with my technical background, final round remaining (culture fit round) , and I’m unsure about long-term prospects there. It’s a small but growing company and growth prospects might be good here too. 

The first role pays more and would offer some work-life balance, but I’m concerned I might get stuck doing only support work and not grow technically. On the flip side, the engineering role might push me to grow more. The commute is far for the second job but one of the interviewed said I could ask for Remote too. (But can remote be trusted in these times ? They call people at some point) 

For context: I’ve worked in tech for a while, took a short career break recently, and now I’m trying to re-enter with a long-term view in mind.

If you were in my shoes, how would you evaluate stability vs growth potential? Has anyone taken a similar support-to-security path?

Thanks in advance!

1mfei74,How can I survive a toxic boss?,"Hey reddit! I could really use some advice or would appreciate if you could share your experience with surviving a toxic boss.

I’ve been working with my current company for around 2 years and was ready to quit a few months in but I held on because I needed the experience and money. The company and everyone else is ok but my direct manager is super toxic. 

He is a micromanager, makes inappropriate remarks, raises his voice at me, excludes me, is super passive aggressive, texts me at all hours or the night, gossips pretty much anything you can think of. He has even received multiple complaints from other people regarding his behavior. 

His manager is stepping into a new role so although my manager is the next one up for that position I was told that I could be a runner up to take that promotion from him because he is such a bad manager.

Unfortunately, I don’t think it would be worth sticking it out. I dread going to work, and it has started to affect my mental health and sleep. I am looking for a new role and will make a move asap, but I cannot afford to quit without having something lined up. 

Do you have any tips for surviving this situation, or if you experienced something like this in the past can you please share your story so I know there is light at the end of the tunnel?

1mfeg0y,Crossroads,"Hello Everyone,

I am 26 years old, a first generation grad with my BBA in Finance. I’m a Financial Advisor and have been very fortunate in my career. I earn just under 6 figures and have a very laid back job. I have my 65, CRPC, and currently doing the education for my CFP. I should test Q1 2026. 

I have been told there’s a strong possibility to be moved out of state to be a Junior Planner and can actually use my CFP. I currently live in Houston, family is in San Antonio. I was informed by other colleagues I’d probably make around $75,000 if I get the position but I’ll be getting some actual work as a planner. 

I have sacrificed friends, family, and girlfriends to try to be as successful as I can. I haven’t seen my family and friends like I’d like since I was in high school and I feel it is catching up to me. 

One option is I get my CFP in March I can leave my company and find another opportunity elsewhere. 

The other is move out of state, get the experience, pass my CFP and then evaluate my options after the fact. 

I appreciate any input you guys can give me as I feel since I’ve been told about the opportunity my life has been up in the air.

1mfe9u3,Got a job offer but they asked me to relocate and I had a pre-planned vacation,"Hello everyone, 

I recently got a job offer from a biostats consulting company. The listing was originally for a city but they want me to relocate to another city to start and only disclosed that in the last round (3rd) of the interview. I tried to negotiate with them on that but was kinda unsuccessful (they said verbally that they will allow me to be back after a year). 

Today they sent me the full compensation package to review and the salary (60k) is lower than my desired range and the market average. However, I have a pre-planned vacation upcoming. The job will start in Sept and I will be away for 2 weeks in early Nov. I wonder if in this case I should just bite the bullet, not negotiate the salary, and just disclose the upcoming vacation? Or would a negotiation still recommended esp considering it's a consulting company?

I want to be cautious how I move forward with the current job market so please let me know what you think!

1mfdld4,I need career advice to escape my flop era.,"Hello. I'd like some advice on where to take my career next. Here are some details about me.

 I currently work in an Insurance company as an assistant of sorts. I've been working since January. I currently make MS Access database documentation, which involves a lot of reading VBA and SQL code. I make little VBA projects to make my life easier at work. I really enjoy making VBA automation, and creating business diagrams and documentation, but my current job doesn't pay much. Around 50k. 

I'm a little lost, and my family is becoming increasingly worried about my future. My dad keeps calling my Job a 'shitty job' and my mom was appalled when I told her I got paid hourly.

My parents want me to pursue an MBA and start studying for the GMAT, but for some reason I cannot seem to get myself to consistently study the GMAT. I can code in SQL and VBA for hours, but I just struggle with sitting down and reading thr GMAT Quant book. It just seems to me like pursuing an MBA is just avoiding the real problems I think I have (I struggle with interviews, socialization, communication, and I tend to get very bored with repetitive work - hence the automation). The whole push for an MBA seems more like my family and I panicking about my future than a choice made with a particular goal in mind.

My actual career goals - I believe - have always lied at the intersection of business and technology. Roles like Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Data Governance in general peak my interest. I also find myself very interested in thr idea of making processes more efficient via automation and operations mgmt, though the courses in college I took on Ops made me tired. However, given how tech fields are, my future is uncertain. I'm thinking of specializing in another field and bringing some technical prowess to it, but I'm nit sure what field I ought to choose.

Thanks for listening to my ramblings.

1mfcovk,"Dilema whether to do a PhD or Not, becuz of age","Title basically.
(I know posts related to this have been answered but it's different, so pls go through my post)

My background: Rising senior pursuing bachelors in computer engineering.
Family financial background: middle class.

Why PhD: i literally love research, going deeper into a topic gaining knowledge about it, is really cool and awesome to me. I love collaborating with fellow researchers to make an impact on humanity in any way possible. But I Seriously love research (I have quite some experience in research that's why saying it and I know that I love research)

But I DO NOT like teaching students, or being a Professor in academia per se. I want to Puruse research in corporate companies you get it like in top research companies in some amazing research labs.

But let me clarify something. 
First of all I know, people have these opinions for this:-

1)You can get a PhD at any age.
2)Try to get it in your 20s (if possible)

I also believe in the 2nd opinion.


I have one thing decided for sure, that if I want to do a PhD, it's definitely gonna be right now. I.e. right after my undergrad and guess where most people go for a PhD after their undergrad the USA.
Because it's the only country where it's quite common.


Now my concerns which have the same priority: (or decreasing order of priority)


1) This might sound stupid but I'm almost turning 22. And I feel like as this time will pass like 4-5 years down the line in a PhD or something else like a job or something, I will be in my late 20s i.e. 27-29. By that time I want to have earned a shit ton of money like really hell lot of money. Because I feel that I want to kind of chill in my mid to late 20s, as I will be getting older and I don't want to start earning good money only when I'm in my early 30s or late 20s like 28-29, I want to have that wayyyyy before in mid or max by late 20s.(by Chill I mean I do not have to worry even a single bit about money, and dating). 
 

And we all know where can this come from by doing business obviously.

This is my first dilemma: Business vs Research 

My love is research but I have been really loving the thought of earning a shit ton of money by watching all these founders some have a PhD, some even dropped out of their Undergrad.


(Though I love research but recently when thinking deeply about my life, made me realise I will also love a lot of money, coming from a middle class background is not something I want to be in for a long time.)


2) The second thing to be honest is dating. I want to date hot women sorry if this comes across as weird or a bad motivation but iguess it's a natural thought considering the human nature. And money is a great factor when you want to push your dating pool.

Though dating is a major chunk of it, but still I also want to chill by going on grand vacations, living a life of a billionaire or a trillionaire.



3) I love business as well, so lets start a business then. Here's the next dilemma.

If I go with even a Master's or a PhD, in the USA which is the country that is the best for me, there are issues regarding starting a company on a F1 visa. I want to work on my startup right from the start not afterwards when I'm getting in my mid 20s.

I know one can start a company after their Masters or PhD per se but if someone does that they cannot do a job side by side and since starting a startup is always risky, but worth the risk.

 I'm Willing to take that risk to make it big, but if I go for a master's in the USA, first we all know it's basically a cash cow business for unis, hardly and scholarships available+
Research and teaching assistantships are also not that huge in number and you ain't gonna land it from the very Start of your masters program. So taking a loan of thousands of $ US dollars, and then having a debt after graduation will obviously stop me from starting my own business.


4) No I do not want to do grad school in my home country. I want to study abroad, my first priority is the USA, then the European continent. (And yeah settle there so that I can start a business and have an overall good quality of life) 



5) Last thing is well it's not technically an issue but I know for sure I DO NOT want to go into academia or into teaching. Rather i want to do research at top companies with really amazing research labs and research on something meaningful.












At last I would like to say, I love research but I also love shit ton of money. 

Please help me choose what's the best option for me!

Is there a path I should or can follow??

Please share your thoughts as well. Would love to hear from you all. Doesn't matter if you are a PhD student, a professor or someone else who as done a PhD, etc you all are welcome to share your opinions, suggestions, and thoughts! 


Thank you!!!

1mfb67a,Looking to transition from law and finance to behavioral sciences,"Hello all,

I have an academic background in law and started my career in tax consulting but quickly burned out. I then moved into a finance operations role that mainly involves managing payments and banking tasks. It was supposed to be temporary but I’ve stayed for several years because I could not afford to be out of a job while figuring out my next step. The work is repetitive and I no longer feel challenged.

Recently, I became interested in behavioral sciences and more analytical work. I’ve 
almost finished an online data analytics course covering SQL, Python, visualization tools, and basic statistics.

I’d like to transition into a datafocused role as a first step and eventually consider a masters in something like computational psychology. The problem is I’m unsure what positions to target as my first transition.

Does anyone have advice on how to move forward and what types of transitional roles to look for?",MajesticDetective582,2,1.0,1,1754089778,2025-08-01 23:09:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mfb67a/looking_to_transition_from_law_and_finance_to/,8,2025
1mfb4em,Applied to a job a company referred me to even though it wasn’t a good fit. Was that a mistake?,"I applied for a Director level job at a startup that was a bit of a reach for me. Part of why it was a reach was because there’s no way one person could do the job as described; I have enough experience in the field to know that, and while I wouldn’t dare say anything like that in a screening, I was prepared for there to be an issue with how it was scoped if I progressed. Still, I applied because the company is applying a very rarely used technology to a new field, and I have experience directly in this rare technology in the exact business domain the role was addressing (think, there’s only a few deployments of this in the country, and I was involved in X business area with one of them). 

I got a phone screen but didn’t pass, partly because it felt like the recruiter’s questions weren’t relevant to the role or she didn’t understand the context of what we were talking about. The questions didn’t really make sense for the role. I thanked her for her time, but she then suggested I apply for a different position they had open, which was arguably not as good of a fit for me (further demonstrating she didn’t understand the roles). I stupidly applied for that second position just because I was invited to, even though it wasn’t a good fit, and I never heard back. 

I kept an eye on the company and the original position. The posting stayed up for months. Later, I noticed they took the posting down and seemed to change their approach to better match what I thought would be more effective— they were now hiring more than one person with a different structure that was definitely going to be more successful. Yay! I then applied to one of the positions that was more junior, which was a better match for my career level but an equally great match expertise-wise as the original position I applied for. I applied and sent a short note to the recruiter saying I was excited to see the new approach and had applied to the junior position considering my experience in this business area and this technology. 

Anyway, I haven’t heard back. I would be fantastic for this, especially under the new structure. There are very few people who have worked on this. I feel like the recruiter is a barrier to connection because she doesn’t know what she’s talking about. And honestly that might be because the senior leadership don’t know what they don’t know either as far as my business area (startup building initial teams area by area). Anyway, did I make a mistake by applying to that non-fit position? Now I feel like I just seem chaotic and desperate, and I’m sad I didn’t get the chance to meet the team on the program/tech side.

My big obstacles: 1) I'm in a legal battle with my last employer so I hate bringing them up. I was great at that job, too. I can't use them as a reference. 2) My best references are outdated, several have retired/moved abroad/unreachable, or passed away. 3) I've been out of work for a year due to an injury. I've tried to spin this and not mention my injury because I can now return to work, but it makes people question my ability. 4) Many years ago I was diagnosed autistic and I've been through all sorts of therapies.

(I'm a 40+ year old woman of color with a disability.) 5) Both my computer and math skills are mid at best (particularly for a xennial) so tech jobs are out of reach.

1mf97p8,Should I tell my Boss I feel like my opinions are not valued?,"I’ve been working in this role in my company for a little over a year now. Not too soon after I started working here, the manager overseeing my department was removed suddenly, leaving my coworker and I to rebuild our section of the department together- as that manager hadn’t let us do much more than the grunt work, and weren’t clued into all the other moving parts that went on. 
There had been talk about bringing someone in to take over managing us more than once, but it never panned out. But, that was fine, as we had managed to get our department moving pretty smoothly without one. 

A week ago, the Director told me that my coworker is being promoted to the Manager position. I’m not unhappy about this, as they have way more experience than me, and I think they’ll do a good job. Today, I found out they are moving forward with hiring another person to our team-something that had talked about previously with no clear timeline presented. We do need the help, but this next month or so is very busy for us, and I don’t know that we’ll have time to train someone thoroughly. 

In both of these instances, I was never asked for my opinion or thoughts. I don’t have any sort of supervisory or managerial title, but I still feel-as both of these decisions impact me-that I would have appreciated being consulted.

Is it worth telling my Director or I guess my new Manager my feelings on this? I know it won’t change anything, but this isn’t the first time I’ve felt that my feelings on matters that effect me have been overlooked. 

tldr: My Big Boss didn’t consult me about my new Boss or when to hire a new coworker. Is it okay to tell one or both of them that I would have liked to have been included in these decisions?

Last week I was terminated due to tardiness. I have been filling out applications like crazy and being honest when I get to the question that says
 “have you ever been terminated or asked to resign?” 
“If so, please explain”

I have been answering  
“Yes, due to attendance issues. I take full responsibility and have since adjusted my schedule and priorities to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”

I am starting to realize maybe I should have lied and said no instead. 

I’m afraid I will be automatically turned down even though being honest

Any advice on what you would do?

1mf74vy,Feeling Stuck at Work and in Life – Empty Even When Everything’s Supposed to Be Fine,"Hey Reddit,

I’ve been working as a sysadmin at a small company for about three years. I started as an intern, became the first technical hire, and quickly became the CEO’s go-to person. It started with a mentor-apprentice vibe, and for a while, I felt like the backbone of the operation.

Lately, though, things have changed. The company hired several inexperienced people and entered a quiet phase. Some of my responsibilities have shifted to a new hire—someone energetic, outgoing, and chatty. I’m the opposite: introverted, quiet, background-focused. Now I feel like I'm slipping into irrelevance.

Whenever work slows down, I start thinking, “They don’t need me anymore.” I worry that someone will soon notice and say, “This person hasn’t been doing anything,” and then let me go.

It’s not just work, either. When I’m home, I don’t have the energy to read, play games, or watch movies. Even simple pleasures feel pointless. I went through a tough breakup a couple of years ago, and the shadow of that still lingers. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and started medication, but I still feel... stuck.

The loneliness is brutal. When I take a planned day off, a voice in my head asks: “If I’m gone and nothing happens, what does that mean?” I swing between thinking, “Maybe I should quit,” and, “But I feel like I belong here.”

Deep down, I know people probably like me—my boss still trusts me, colleagues say they appreciate what I do—but I feel hollow. I feel like I'm living in someone else’s tune, and I can’t find my own rhythm.

Has anyone else felt this way? Just... stuck in a place that looks fine from the outside but feels empty inside? How did you cope, and did anything actually help?

I am in the position where I can pretty much graduate in two years if all I do is major in that and take about two summer classes (a research class/internship class). I am applying to the business school but I am not sure I will get in, and they do not have a set 'finance degree' only a finance concentration anyway. I am very interested in env sci of course, but also finance + insurance. I am trying to decide what are some of my best routes to go. 

1. Graduate in two years with just the env sci major -> get a full time job. 

2. I have been debating double major or minoring. (I have been looking into env justice (I can get a minor/major with undergrad, but law school is so expensive or biology) If you have a degree in env sci/other and double majored could you let me know if it is really worth it. (I would stay 3/4 depending) 

3. Should I graduate in two years and apply to another school for finance and try and work while do school.

I am very worried about the job market and pay for environmental science. I am obviously not in it for the money as I truly believe in my line of work, but I do understand I need money to live and survive. I am not wanting a huge three story house or anything extreme like that, but I would like to have a house and two kids comfortable, and hopefully retire at 65.

When I was 22 I found a deep interest in bakery work, I had a good paying job but eventually my mental health declined, found myself in a few different bad situations and honestly it’s been very up and down since. 
I have always had a hard time maintaining a job, if I feel I’m being treated wrong or unfairly I’ve typically abandoned ship. Looking back, I obviously regret it. I mentioned 22 because that’s when I actually stuck with a profession and was good at what I was doing. I stood on my own very well. 
These days now I don’t have a stable or reliant employment history and it’s really biting me in the ass. I know this is my own doing, but I don’t know how to make a change! 
Sometimes I will go on these tangents applying to things but I get no response. I lie on my resume which has helped in the past but these days I’m absolutely terrified that someone is going to check my references! I’ve never been called out for lying on a resume before. 
I am so frustrated because I’m seeing everyone around me maintain stability and I don’t know how to find it. I don’t even know where to start.

1mf4hum,Balancing MBA Coursework with Existing Job: Seeking Advice,"**Hi all—looking for advice on navigating conversations with my employer as I prepare to balance my current job with a part-time MBA (starting next week).**

I just spoke with my manager and director, and while no hard decisions have been made, they’ve voiced concerns about how my class schedule will conflict with our in-office culture days (Tues/Wed). I'm hoping to outline a viable strategy this weekend.

**Quick background:**

* I'm a Sr. Financial Analyst at a Boston-based company (2 years, strong performance reviews).
* Office culture emphasizes being **on-site Tues/Wed**, though not tied to key meetings.
* I studied for the GMAT privately, and this summer applied to one T25 MBA program in DC—was accepted and informed my employer on July 16.
* I initially believed I could build a class schedule around work; however, I’ve learned the MBA’s **Tues/Thurs** structure is relatively fixed (with the occasional weekend event)

In response, I proposed flying back-and-forth on Wednesdays , but leadership still seems uncomfortable with that idea. After speaking with my academic advisor, potential options include:

1. Staying with the Tues/Thurs schedule,
2. Taking a reduced course load (impact on cohort progress is unclear),
3. Switching to a Mon/Thurs schedule—though this may split me across two cohorts/study groups. Advisor recommended against this.

Manager/Director have stressed to me HR doesn't want to set a precedent but want more granular detail behind my request (long term what I'm asking for, what my flight schedule looks like). Would love input on how to best approach these conversations—or if anyone has navigated something similar. Thank you very much.

The final round was with a stakeholder I hadn’t met yet. The interview lasted less than 10 minutes. She hadn’t looked at my resume, said she trusted the team to decide, and wrapped up quickly. After putting so much time and energy into the process, I left that meeting feeling overlooked and honestly kind of disrespected.

I found out today that I didn’t get the job.

Now I’m wondering—is it worth sending a thank-you email with some honest feedback? Nothing aggressive, just a professional note to say I appreciated the opportunity, but also that the last interaction was disappointing and didn’t feel like my time was valued.

Has anyone done this before? Will it actually make a difference or just burn a bridge? I’m not sure what’s best in this kind of situation, but I don’t feel great leaving it where it ended.

1mf3r6f,Completely Lied to About Promotion,"I really need some advice. 

I have been with my current company for a year as a Property Manager for a new build. I loved the company and my job and it was the first time in my career I wasn’t absolutely miserable. I really worked my ass off to move to the next steps and was offered an Assistant Regional Manager position in another state. 

My whole family lives in my state, so I was really hesitant to move and had a lot of questions that I based my decision on. First and foremost was my schedule, as they were also wanting me to be acting PM for a dual property role. I was explicitly told by the VP when she offered me the position that “if it was her” my schedule would be as follows:

Mon: work from home
Tues: work from PM property
Wed: site visits to other properties in portfolio 
Thurs: work from PM property
Fri: site visits to other properties in portfolio 

Or work where I am needed, which was clear and understood. I was also told I had an Assistant Property Manager and a Leasing Agent, that were self sufficient at the properties I managed. 

My husband and I packed up and moved from all our family and friends, my husband quit his job, and we just found out I am pregnant a few weeks ago. 

They however did not mention that the leasing agent only works 2 hours on the weekdays. With this in mind and the schedule I was given before starting, my Regional Manager and I opened a job listing for a part-time leasing agent for the other hours in case I cannot be here. 

I have been following this schedule for a few weeks now until yesterday the VP noticed I was at home during a conference call where we were discussing another employee’s large error. I left my property early to keep the call confidential as I do not have a private office at my property. 

This led to a conversation between her and my Regional Manager essentially saying that the conversation we had about my schedule never happened and that she was clear that the expectation would be for me to work from the properties I managed 4 days a week. He was also told that we cannot hire a leasing agent. 

I am now fuming and have been sobbing all morning because I feel taken advantage of and feel like I just uprooted my entire life with a baby on the way to essentially be their glorified leasing agent. 

My previous property was new, I had a leasing agent, I had 100% occupancy, and I had the flexibility to actually do my job and not all of the other jobs which is why I quit my previous management company. 

The whole point of this promotion was to be moving up in my career, not taking on the smaller tasks like leasing while also having to do PM work and essentially do my Regional’s job for my portfolio since he lives on the other side of the state.

1mf3quh,Which professional route should I take?,"Hello everyone,

I need some personal / professional advice. I’m currently a German dual bachelor student in business administration and computer science. The dual Programme I‘m pursuing integrates college with internships in a company. I‘m currently working since 3 years in a big international production company. Here I already had 7 internships, from which I really enjoyed one in corporate controlling (Opex), Digital M&A and data analysis in the production. In November, I‘ll attend an internship with the Head of M&A in a subsidiary and write my bachelor thesis. These financial fields really interests me and I’d like to pursue them in my career.

Now the difficult decision: Last year, I attended a semester abroad in the US (California). Here I got to know my (now) girlfriend. We visited each other after the semester multiple times and we want a future together. I know that you can’t be certain what the future holds, but I‘m confident that our relationship has a future. She will graduate in 2028 and therefore she won’t be able to move to Germany before. In addition, the thought of living in the US interests me.

Here is my dilemma: I have to work atleast 1 1/2 years in an IT focused role after my bachelors. This is determined in my contract and therefore I’ll most likely start in a business analyst role. My goal is to pivot into a more financial role (e. g. Controlling, in which field I already had an internship)

First option: To achieve this I thought I could study „Financial Analysis“ at a Californian State school and apply for junior positions after I graduated. The costs would be covered by savings from my full time offer. This option would insure the field switch pretty early in my career.

Second option: I’ll work 2 1/2 years in the Business analyst role and move to the US where I apply to similar roles. After a few years (probably 3-5 years) I’d like to enroll into an evening MBA program and pivot after into corporate controlling / equivalent. This option would be safer because of higher savings, but I wouldn’t have the fun full time masters.

To conclude, here my question: What should I do?

1mf3ign,PR Comms to Machine Learning.,"Happy Friday! 

I need some advice on how to transition from public relations and communications into the world of machine learning or at the very least getting to a Data Analyst. 

My background is mostly agency-side. I’ve worked at places like GCI Health and Golin, handling communications campaigns for companies like Bristol Myers Squibb and Nintendo of America. Most of my work involved media relations, stakeholder management, executive visibility, and a lot of writing and coordination across teams. I’ve always been good at understanding complex topics and turning them into clear, engaging stories.

But outside of work, I’ve had a long-standing interest in AI, especially large language models and generative tools. I was playing around with Stable Diffusion back when it was still fairly niche, and I even experimented with training LoRA models to tweak and personalize image outputs. I’ve also been exploring prompt engineering and AI tools to speed up creative workflows, especially in video and content production.

Right now, I know I need a serious career change. PR agency life has been exhausting, and I want to move into something more technical, ideally where I can mix my communication skills with a deeper understanding of AI and machine learning.

Here’s where I need help. I’m a US citizen currently living in Warsaw, Poland, and I’m open to going back to university, joining a bootcamp, or diving deep into something like Coursera or edX. I just don’t know what the most efficient path is. I want something that will actually prepare me for a new role without wasting time or money.

Some specific things I’m wondering:

Is it realistic to pivot into ML or AI from a non-technical background, or should I focus on adjacent roles like technical writing, developer relations, or AI product communications?

It started in 2022 and the business has been growing by over 60% year over year. We did seven-figures in revenue last year, and we're forecasting another 60-100% growth this year. But the financial stress and the cash flow managing it is just so stressful. It's ruining my life. It's been almost impossible to find a financial partner to help give us the cushion we need to operate with peace of mind.

1mf0vbk,What can you do when your career feels like it’s going nowhere?,"Hello community,  
I’ve spent \~8-10 years working in high-performance environments: Big 4 firms, dealing with VPs and C-suite executives, pricing structures, contracts, SOWs, automation with Python, and now AI, etc. Literally, I’ve worked in huge companies and small ones, with salary raises, benefits, and I even have over $1M USD in a diversified investment portfolio (global ETFs, government bonds, certificates of deposit, etc.). I don’t consider myself “rich,” but I’m in a stable position.

However… I feel stuck.

After 1.5 to 2 years in each job, I learn the structure and how they operate, and then I get bored. What used to motivate me (better salary, new technical challenges, climbing the ladder) no longer has the same effect.

Lately, the only thing that really excites me is automating processes, analyzing business structures, and understanding strategies — like in my current official role in enterprise information security. But when I started a small business with my brother (in film production), other entrepreneurs have shared their business cards with us. Most have little to no structure. It makes me want to step in like a private equity or venture capital player — help them scale, restructure, and grow alongside them in exchange for acquisition or partnership to keep growing corporately.

So… I’ve been thinking about:  
• Starting a venture studio or a sort of micro-PE fund to acquire small, poorly structured businesses — something I can manage in my available time, while our own business also needs to grow.  
• Offering myself as a strategic partner in businesses with potential, in exchange for equity.  
• Continuing freelance work while building an internal product/SaaS.",Comfortable-Pen-715,4,1.0,1,1754065187,2025-08-01 16:19:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mf0vbk/what_can_you_do_when_your_career_feels_like_its/,8,2025
1mf0l68,Career Learning Platform,"Hi all. I am actually not sure if this the best place to share/ask something like this so happy to move it elsewhere if anyone would prefer me too.

I’m a web developer and have a huge passion for learning and knowledge sharing. I myself have been experience some career stagnation and issues within the small business I work for and also the worry about AI and how that will impact my day-to-day and the enjoyment I get from it.  
  
It got me thinking, and I'm currently trying to build a passion project of mine into something that's geared toward helping people more. A new learning platform designed to help people grow and progress in their careers not with theory, but with real-world guidance based on real experiences.

To make it as helpful and grounded as possible, I’m looking for people willing to share their career stories...the highs, the lows, and the pivotal moments.

Your story won’t be shared publicly or attributed directly. Instead, insights and snippets from these stories may be used to help the system guides users through their own challenges — like:

* “How do I bounce back after being passed over for promotion?”
* “What’s the right way to switch industries or roles?”
* “How can I deal with a toxic manager or tough client?”
* “What helped you actually grow in your career — not just tick boxes?”

The goal is as people work through courses aimed at helping them to get there career started (younger individuals just out of school) or anyone having trouble, career change etc and they can use the content of the course, the examples and questions that are part of the course and real world stories from individuals tailored to their level and situation.

Here are some helpful prompts to get you thinking:

* What’s one big challenge you’ve faced in your career? → What happened, how did you deal with it, and what did you learn?
* Was there a major turning point in your path? → What triggered the change, and what helped you through it?
* Have you navigated tricky situations — management politics, HR decisions, burnout, redundancies, or client pressure?
* What helped you progress — new skills, mentors, training, mistakes?

Whether you’re early in your journey or leading teams, your story could help shape practical learning for someone facing a similar challenge.

1mezmga,"Most DO NOT need a career coach, from someone who runs a career coaching company","You shouldn’t hire a coach unless you’ve first tried doing the job search yourself.

You don't want to end up paying for someone's help IF you could've gotten there yourself. IMO, it's the same principle with hiring any coach.

Even if you don't end up in a role within 3 months, then at least you'll have a baseline of performance \[eg you send out 100 applications, got 5 interviews and 1 final round interview\]. Therefore you have a 5% interview rate and 20% final round rate and a 0% offer rate.

If you ever do hire a coach, then you want that person to help beat your baseline OR have services to help increase your applications such that you have.

Most ""scams"" come from people saying ""I aM A CoAcH/StRatEgiST/ReCruiTeR ThEReFoRe eVeRyThiNg aBouT uR REsUmE I SaY iS TrUe"". Maybe for the 5 companies you have recruited for, but not the broader market.

The best resume is the one that gets you the most interviews at the companies you want.

This is my opinion & I have a resume business (thus I am biased), but we use these principles in our work.

1mezam3,"Quit my job, mow the lawn, get a haircut.","I’m really tired of my job and I’ve been seriously thinking about quitting today. I’ve been applying and interviewing for other positions for a few weeks now. My girlfriend is right—she keeps reminding me that I should have another job lined up before leaving because we can’t live on just her income. She’s right, of course, but I’ve been doing Roadie deliveries and making decent money—around $130 a day before gas.

I have a second-round interview this Tuesday that I feel pretty confident about. If that works out, great. But if it doesn’t, I’d be in a tough spot. Still, I’m confident I can land another job quickly since I have experience and work in a STEM field.

I actually enjoy doing Roadie—it’s flexible and gives me quick cash—but I know it’s not stable long-term. Right now, though, it feels more freeing than my 9-to-5. Financially, I’m not in the best place: •	$7K in credit card debt •	$20K car loan •	$12K private student loans •	$27K federal student loans •	$3K tax bill

When I write it out, it doesn’t feel impossible, and reading similar stories on Reddit makes me feel less alone. My current job pays $81K (around $60K after taxes), but we still struggle to do anything fun like vacations or nights out. Most of my paycheck goes to rent, food, gas, utilities, and occasionally helping my mom and sister. I try to pay down debt, but something always comes up.

For example, my next paycheck is going toward paying off two credit cards and $850 toward taxes. The check after that is already earmarked for rent. That means I’m always waiting another month just to see a small bit of breathing room. Roadie helps because I get paid the same day and can stash some cash in savings—but I need time to do it.

The real problem isn’t just the money—it’s my job. Mentally, I can’t take it anymore. The work itself is fine, but the company is a mess. In three years, I’ve had 4–5 different managers, zero raises, no bonuses, and no growth opportunities. Now they’re adding a “return to office” requirement by the end of Q4. I’m spending nine hours a day just grinding for bills, and it’s draining the life out of me.

The new job I’m interviewing for pays $102K plus a 10% annual bonus. It’s not a huge jump, but it would add about $600 more per check and give me something to actually look forward to.

Rent is one of the biggest factors keeping me stuck. I know the advice most people give is “just move somewhere cheaper,” but it’s not that straightforward. Moving isn’t free—there’s first and last month’s rent, deposits, moving trucks, and time off work. Even if I found a cheaper place, I’d be paying hundreds or even a couple thousand upfront just to relocate, and I don’t have that kind of extra cash right now.

On top of that, I don’t live in a huge city where you can easily find much cheaper rent nearby. If I went significantly cheaper, I’d likely have to move to the outskirts or a smaller town, which would mean longer drives for everything, worse delivery routes for Roadie, and possibly isolating myself from any local job opportunities.

So, while I know my rent is high, moving isn’t a quick or easy solution. Right now, I’m just trying to get a higher-paying job first before I even think about relocating.

When I do quit my last check will go towards rent, after that HR will send me a bonus for all unused vacation hours, I calculated around $3500. This and roadie she will be financially fine for a few months 3 to be exact. 3 months to find a new job, relax, do roadie and take care of myself but my GF I sort of High management, we need to go out, not every day but at least 2-3 times a week, and guess what? That costs money too, drinks, food actual entertainment, it’s like everyone wants to keep me poor, I’m starting to resent my gf and just start telling her no. She’s a good woman but she doesn’t make it easy.

Honestly, I just want to quit, get a haircut, mow the lawn, and do Roadie while I line up a better job with a bonus and some growth potential.

Had the interview the next day, she liked me and passed my resume to the creative director. I interviewed with her the day after. She came from a big corporate background and said this was more of a startup vibe, and she was building the team from scratch. I said I was open to that (professionally, of course lol).

1mey9m6,Should I consider working for this Chinese company in the West?,"TL;DR: Great leadership position opened up in a Chinese owned global company. The firm and the relevant service line is heavily scrutinised by authorities. The hiring manager is a westerner and the position is also olin the western world. Senior leadership sits in China. I had a strange feeling during the CFO interview, as if he would not want to acknowledge the complexity of the service line I am applying to, and sees it as a black or white topic. I am afraid that this is not just a cultural / communicational difference but bad management, and I could be thrown under the bus, if something goes wrong. Apart from the CFO, the rest of the senior leadership / potential Chinese stakeholders were great. Can I do anything to minimise the risk of failure, or I should just walk away?

***

Hi everyone,

I am using a clean account to avoid doxxing myself. Also, English is not my native language, so apologies if I don’t express myself clearly. 

I live in a western country and I work in finance. I have 10+ years of international experience, both in-house and with advisory firms. Currently, I work for a western based employer, big name, in mid-level position. I don’t manage people. I feel kind of stuck in my career - I am a solid performer but not a rock star. Due to this and to heavy internal politics, my career advancement is heavily limited. I earn a decent wage but nothing remarkable. My professional development has also slowed down lately. I am still learning but, instead of expanding my knowledge exponentially, the process became much slower. Parallel to that, I also get more and more disengaged as other peers of mine are favoured for long-term career advancement. I am middle-aged, with a spouse but no kids (yet). 

I saw an open position recently for an international leadership position at a Chinese owned global firm (individual contributor role). The position is in the western part of the world, the hiring manager is non-Chinese, and very competent. The hiring manager interview went well - the position is very demanding but also motivational. The company is under heavy regulatory scrutiny, which would also affect the service line I would be leading (if hired). 

I had two rounds of interviews with the Chinese financial leadership - the finance director and the global accounting leader, both sitting in Asia. I had a very positive impression of them. Knowledgeable and practical people, highly focused but also realistic. I was quite enthusiastic about the role, following these interviews. 

Then it came my interview with the Chinese CFO, who is sitting in mainland china - I was extremely nervous and barely slept the night before. I did very poorly, likely blew my chances that I had before. Anyway, what’s done is done.. some small hope still remains. 

What really surprised me was the CFO’s answer to my questions. I asked him about their planned investments to prepare / react on the upcoming regulatory changes. He said he did not understand the question. Then I explained with examples - he swept the topic off the table by ‘we have already implemented those (meaning the measures as I brought as examples), we are ahead of the changes’. Then I asked him about potential clashes between financial drive and compliance priorities, how he expects me to approach the topic and escalate. He told me that my area of business is straightforward (it is NOT!), there is not much wiggle room when it comes to compliance (it IS!) - the business needs to be compliant. I also had some more questions but I did not see much openness and I felt that I was kept on a ‘need to know’ basis - and I did not need to know anything, apart from my business line operating in a straightforward legislative field (it is NOT!). 

I walked away from the interview with a bitter taste - partly because of my poor performance, partly because of this misalignment and non-acknowledgement of serious risks that the business line faces (they are aware and everyone knows, even the press, that they are preparing heavily). 

I still have some interviews pending with the HR team to finish off the 5+ round of process. The CFO experience is pretty fresh, I only had the cfo interview a few hours ago, but I am hesitating whether to simply walk away (even before I see whether they even get an offer). 

The position would be a major step up for me, basically a career breakthrough. Considering this and my age, similar opportunities would likely not come along in the near future (if at all). But I also have a very bad feeling after the CFO round, even though I would not report to him directly. 

I am wondering, is this just an example of Chinese leadership style that I should not worry about? Or is this behaviour indeed a red flag? Does it still worth asking for a final call with the future hiring manager and do an additional screening on the Chinese CFO’s expectations / sense of reality / leadership style - and to check whether my future hiring manager would shield me from the unrealistic expectations, or the CFO indeed sees my service line as black or white, and I will be blamed for all future mistakes (which will ultimately happen, no doubt about that)? In that case, I would just let go of this opportunity, even if i would eventually receive an offer.

1mexibs,Mid-level remote job for American company vs. High-level job for local company in lower-paying country,"Hello folks, 

Currently going through a fundamental dilema. This is the situation:

I am an software engineer living in Spain. The job market is not great here and salaries are quite low compared to other European countries. I used to work remotely for an american company. My role was at the senior level and my salary was great for where I live (\~150k yearly). I was an Individual Contributor and I liked what I did: working on AI stuff (although not always), but I was comfortable enough and well paid. Life was good, but I always had concerns about what I could do if I ever lose the job (it might be hard to find something like that again). 

Recently, a former manager offered me to join their company in Spain. The position is for Director, which allowed him to make me an offer for the same salary I was making. 

My rationale was as follows: if I stay remote, and I lose my job some day, it might be hard to find another remote company that pays similarly, especially since the remote job market is way more reduced. On the other hand, if I acquire experience as a director, I may have access to well-paid jobs regardless of whether they are remote, or also local (in Spain). Put simply, I might maximize my probability to land a well-paid job and not having to do significant changes to my life. 

My problem: I've been 3 months into the role and I don't think I like it. I enjoyed my life better before, when I was doing actual stuff, instead of coordinating stuff and meeting people all day. I ended in good terms with my previous employer, so I might have an opportunity to go back. 

My question for the community: would you have done differently in my position? What would you do if you noticed that you don't really like the management track and feel the pull to step back?

I’ve lost my drive and passion and it’s bled into my personal life (jk I don’t have a personal life; it’s always work or thinking about work). 

I feel so stuck and don’t know what to do. The salary is the only thing keeping me there but I just don’t know if the money is worth it anymore. I’ve never felt this mentally, physically, and emotionally drained from work before and because of this industry I just don’t see it stopping or slowing anytime soon. The work keeps piling up so there’s never down time. 

I wish I could just quit and start fresh somewhere but I’ve dedicated so much of my academic and professional career to get where I am. And I have a wedding to pay for which this job obviously is helping with. So I’ve started what I guess could be “quiet quitting”… I’m a high performer and over achiever but this past month or so I have not been bringing my usual high energy to the office and have been doing the bare minimum. Folks are starting to notice. Work is still being done but I don’t have the capacity to give it the amount of care I normally would. 

Sorry just needed to vent but if anyone has any advice would love to hear it. ",mojogaymer,4,1.0,8,1754057150,2025-08-01 14:05:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mexen8/feeling_so_stuck_in_my_dream_job_and_dont_know/,8,2025

I thought I’d enjoy the professional services role but I’ve really not enjoyed it whatsoever and I’m not particularly good at it either. It’s not just that I’m not good at it, the whole thing gives me anxiety and my personal circumstances have changed so much in the last 9 months that studying for a qualification for the next three years is really daunting and not where I thought my life would end up. My old job has been replaced and I can’t actively see any scope for this role to be given back to me in the firm, at least not immediately. 

Do I talk to my boss about this? I absolutely love the company I work for and I’m so happy here, and the company has been so supportive of me. I’d be devastated to leave, but I’m really unhappy in my role. I can’t help but feel I’ve left it too late to ask for a change but my boss did say to me around either 12 or 6 months ago (I can’t remember which appraisal period it was at exactly) that she hopes I could talk to her if ever it turned out that I wasn’t enjoying it.

1meuocm,Prioritize peace and stability or career growth? Opinions please!,"Burner Account because my main is followed. Looking for a little guidance / opinion here. Infosec professional, little over a decade of experience across IT as sys admin and security engineering, mostly on security operations, IR, Detection Response, Vuln Management, AppSec, I have a swath of experience across all niches. President of my local infosec chapter and adjunct faculty at local community colleges. Have the normal certifications for my various niches and a master’s that I use for teaching.

I have been at my current gig for 3 years, fin services, staff level IC role. Org went through a layoff in Jan, then another during the summer. The first affected my team, the second did not. I was promoted from a senior position to a staff position this year. I’ve been headhunted by an org where I know the VP for about 2 years professionally. After taking a couple calls, they made me a blind offer for a Manager of SecOps role without knowing my salary. In all, it was a 50-60k pay cut. I respectfully declined and did not provide a counter but was appreciative of them thinking of me of the position as management/leadership is where I want to go. They came back after a couple of weeks, bumped the offer by 30k and modified the bonus structure to 15% from 10% of annual income, paid quarterly versus annually. This would be a director title.

I am stable in my current role and my promotion makes me feel as though my organization likes me, I have political capital here. However, I don’t see any other promotions on the horizon, nor any leadership opportunities. With the layoffs came several reorgs where directors adjacent to my director were let go.

A new gig would come with some growth opportunity for Senior Director and potentially a VP role down the line, or I could use this role to catapult myself to a VP role in the future at another org. So, I suppose my question is – do I value peace and stability with my current role or take the risk and jump into leadership for a small pay cut, but a likely huge boost to my career trajectory. I did ask for another bump, they said this is the highest they’ll go for the role, so no more room to ask them to match my current salary.",Throwaway_cuzyakno,2,1.0,0,1754049922,2025-08-01 12:05:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1meuocm/prioritize_peace_and_stability_or_career_growth/,8,2025

1meuih9,Full-time or Part-time Studies – From the Perspective of a Working Student,"Hi!

Since I recently finished my bachelor’s degree and am planning to start my master’s, I’ve started thinking about what type of studies to choose – full-time or part-time.

At the beginning of my second year of undergrad, I started working. My hours varied, but generally ranged from 80 to 130 hours per month. The upside was that I worked remotely. I eventually got promoted/moved to a different team – back office. The requirement there is 140 hours per month, and during the spring semester (due to internships), I was working 160 hours. I was able to count this towards my internship since the job was related to my field of study (ᵔᴥᵔ).

I won’t lie – before that, it was quite exhausting. Most of my days looked like this: work from 8 AM to 12 PM, university from 1 PM to 4 PM, then back to work in the evening. Plus Saturdays too. That went on for nearly a year and a half. Fortunately, I had (and still have) great supervisors who were understanding when I couldn’t meet my hours or needed more time off during exam sessions.

Now, October is approaching – time for the new academic year – and I’m torn on what to choose. Should I go for full-time studies (continuing my bachelor’s field), or switch to part-time studies and find a job more aligned with my field on a full employment contract?

For part-time studies, I’ve been considering Finance and Accounting.

**Pros of my current job:**

* Fully remote – I only go to the office once a month for administrative stuff
* Pays more than minimum wage (ᵔᴥᵔ)
* I know the processes well – it’s comfortable and familiar

**Cons:**

* Not really related to what I want to do after graduation
* Increasingly stressful

So here I am, at a crossroads. I’m unsure what to aim for – professional development in a potentially new job, or a calmer two years of a master’s in a familiar environment.

And I'm not gonna lie - lately I've been really stressed by my current job to the point I've avoided it for few days - I change my schedule to just rest. And now I've been working 8-4 mostly",Royal_Tumbleweed2555,1,1.0,0,1754049461,2025-08-01 11:57:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1meuih9/fulltime_or_parttime_studies_from_the_perspective/,8,2025
1meucvd,"Title demotion - I shouldn’t care, but I do?","Hi,

Let me pre-face this by saying that, historically I’m not a person that’s really cared all that much about title, so much as I have what I’m being paid. 

Last month my department at work was informed there was a major restructure happening. No job losses, just a modernisation of the structure. 

My current job title is prefixed by Principal. I was promoted to this level in 2020 after working through the band below, Senior. As part of this restructure, some job titles are changing. They’re keeping the Principal title, but only if you meet certain criteria (e.g 5 or more direct reports). I only have a team of 3 that report to me, so I’ve been told my title is being changed to Senior II. Salary and responsibility remain unchanged. 

I feel like I shouldn’t be bothered about this as my salary hasn’t changed, or my job in totality, but I just can’t shake the feeling that I finished working through the Senior band 5 years ago and wasn’t far off my next progression. Now my next progression will be back to the title I’ve held for the last 5 years.

1mesgms,"Boss wants to move me from full time to freelance, not giving me contract to view before I sigh - is this ok?","
Hi all,
I’m working full-time at a startup as a designer, currently employed on a salary basis. I’ve been there for about 3 months, and we have on-site thing - need to go 5 days a week to the office.

Recently, the boss casually asked if I’d like to “work from home” — and from that, the conversation quickly shifted into turning me into a freelancer.
At first I agreed to consider it not knowing the legal details of what it's like to be a freelancer. But after digging in, I found the following:
- they want me to sign a standard freelance contract, but they refused when I asked them to read it in advance.
- I would be paid per project, not monthly, with no guaranteed workload
- the rate offered is lower than my current total cost-to-company
- they refused to include the rate and terms in the contract - told me ""we discussed everything already""

When I asked to take time to review the situation, boss got annoyed and brought up my previous sick day, car accident, and a pre-approved vacation, saying I ""lack commitment""

I was told, quote: ""maybe you're not a good fit for the company.""

It feels like I’m being cornered into accepting a freelance status under pressure, without protection, stability, or transparency.

Is it legal for startups to do this? Can they pressure me into being a freelancer after already hiring me full-time? And should I expect to be fired?

Thanks in advance ",Kate_Yud_721,88,0.8700000047683716,191,1754042576,2025-08-01 10:02:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mesgms/boss_wants_to_move_me_from_full_time_to_freelance/,8,2025
1mervbl,Should I just quit my new job?,"Hi, I recently joined a new law firm as an associate. It’s been just 2 weeks since I started, after leaving my old job where I worked for a year. But honestly, these last 2 weeks have been some of the hardest I’ve ever had.

There’s a senior I’ve been assigned to work with, and she constantly puts me down and belittles me in front of the team, more often than not for the things that don’t even seem like mistakes. I’ve been working 12-hour days, including weekends, functioning on 4 hours of sleep, trying to give it my all, but no matter what I do, I end up feeling humiliated, anxious, and exhausted.

What’s worse is that people say this is her being ‘nice.’ It’s a small team - just four of us - and since I’m the junior most, I have to bear the brunt of most of her behaviour. I was genuinely excited to join this firm. It’s one of the top firms in the country, and I knew the hours would be brutal. I was ready for that. What I wasn’t ready for was the constant fear and the complete breakdown of my self-esteem.

I’m now stuck wondering whether I should just leave quietly and not even put this on my resume, or try to stick it out for a few more months, even though I don’t see it getting any better. The person before me quit in three months, which says a lot.

1merb0b,Feeling Stuck as a Capable Generalist – What Should My Next Move Be?,"I’m almost 3 years into my career, and lately I’ve been feeling really stuck.

I started out at a boutique consulting firm, and the first year was great as I had a strong manager who mentored me, I was learning a lot, and it felt like I was on the right track. But things started to unravel. My manager left, and over the next year, half the leadership team followed. Many peers at my level also moved on, and the firm hasn’t hired anyone new to fill the gaps.

When I brought up the topic of a raise and promotion (after two years and consistently excellent reviews), it was turned down. That hurt especially since I’ve been taking on more responsibility in an increasingly understaffed team.

I’ve been job hunting for the past 3 months (about 40 applications so far) mostly for remote/global roles. I’ve read that cold emailing can be effective, so I’ve been trying that too. Out of all that effort, I’ve only landed one interview, which ended with the company “pausing the process.” Otherwise, it’s been rejection or radio silence.

Although I have a background in engineering, I am more of a generalist. I can write, design programs, have a great eye for visual design, and manage projects but I’m not sure how to turn that into long-term stability or a clear career path.

It feels like the world rewards specialists or those on well-defined career ladders. Should I try to pivot into something more specialized? Or is there a way to build momentum as a generalist without feeling like I’m drifting?

1mer2v9,How do I figure out what I truly love and can learn and work with for the rest of my life?,"Right now, I’m a young guy who’s been exploring different fields for around three years. I didn’t spend a long time in each because I was doing this alongside my studies. I’ve tried programming, graphic design, motion graphics, digital drawing (I can draw decently), UI/UX, video editing, and many other things. And honestly, I liked all of them — but in a very superficial way.

It feels like I’m someone walking through a garden, picking a flower from each beautiful spot I pass by. Eventually, I end up with a big bouquet — but the scents are all mixed together, and I can’t tell which flower is the best for me. In the end, I’m holding so many flowers, but I haven’t really benefited from any of them.

I never really went deep into any of those fields. What I do have is either:

* knowledge of where and how to learn that thing,
* or just the very basics — just enough to be familiar with it.

Now I’m at a point where I really need to figure out what I want to do with my life. What’s the one thing I could learn and work with long-term?

I’m not talking about what I *currently* love — but something I *can* grow to love and accept as a path for me.

But the truth is… I don’t know. I feel like I love all of these things — but maybe not enough to stick with any of them for life, or even as a solid starting point.

Everything takes time. I won’t master anything in a day or a month or even five — I know that well. And that’s why I want to be sure something fits me before I invest that much time learning it.

Am I learning something because I genuinely love it and can enjoy doing it?  
Or just because it looks shiny and trendy and everyone’s talking about it?

And just to make things clearer: my college degree doesn’t define my career path. It’s just a certificate. So I’ll have to learn something on my own —

Senior management have also acknowledged I’m capable of handling work above my pay grade and repeatedly mentioned I will be up for promotion soon.

A month ago, we had a new guy transfer in from a different team with 0 relevant experience. If I’m being honest, his work and behaviour is rather atrocious. He’s rude, vulgar, constantly deflecting work, mostly MIA and extremely loud, to the point we have gotten complaints from other departments about him. He’s also under HR investigation for unprofessional behaviour in his previous team - threatening violence and inappropriate language.

During the recent 2 years that he was at college he just stayed in his room all day skipping classes and eating in there. He wasted quite a bit of money as well. The reason most of this depression started was due to terrible experiences with his frat and his so called “friends”. He only recently overcame said depression and he wants to focus back up again but since he didn’t finish/attend any classes for 2 years, he would have to redo those classes first before he does anything but after he redoes everything, there would be no chance he gets accepted to a med school due to the time gap and the fact that the classes would show up as retakes. So now he’s stuck in a dilemma where he has to quickly finish 2 years worth of classes (all medicine and biology related) and start a new major which would be another 4 years. I really want to help him but i don’t know what to tell him. If anyone has any advice they could give it would be much appreciated!",Proper-Deer-2708,1,1.0,3,1754029350,2025-08-01 06:22:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mep0la/need_advice_for_a_friend_about_his_career_at_21/,8,2025
1meonsp,Need advice about career path : Psychology or mba,"Soo I'm an undergraduate in psychology, passed out this year. Since 2nd year I've been doubting if psychology is THE career path for me cos it requires further intensive study and licensure. Ofcourse, i chose this field in udergraduate because i was passionate about it, i still am i guess, its all blurred right now.

 I want a job that will pay me decent money, as im an oldest child and in india, i feel the weight of my inability to help my mom ( she's the only one working). eventhough they dont pressure me into providing, i feel really bad that she's the only one working. I'm scared that if i choose psychology for further studies, i won't be able to elevate my family

Now comes the MBA route. When i think of the money aspect, i feel like MBA will give me what i want, will help me elevate my family.. basically im not just trying to live by, i want abundance in my life ahead, in terms of money as well as everything else (ofc, like everyone does). Pursuing psychology, thinking about money feels like a crime idky. But the people around me tell me i have the skills to become a psychologist and it suits me more... And that corporate will suck my soul dry..  I dont have any idea what work im supposed to do in corporate.. It feels like the safer route

what do i do folks? Continue with psy? sometimes i wonder if i really have it in me to be a psychologist cos im not mentally strong at the moment... idk im sorry for rambling on and on but ... Yeah i need advice..

I’m not sure my team has the connections with the teams I’m interested in joining or a clear understanding of my skill set to pitch me, nor do I think they want to lose me as I’m a solid contributor. The other roles at my level have been vacated due to promotions and are not being backfilled…I see that being the case here. They would be losing the work I’m doing and would have to absorb it.

I live in a working city, and as I’m getting older, I’ve realized that I’m becoming something I never wanted, a product of my environment. I have a good job as an apprentice, and I go to a prestigious university.

As stupid as it sounds, I recently went on vacation to Florida and realized how good life can be. My dad is a business owner and his clients there are filthy rich, big homes on the water, huge boats, bad ass Cuban girls, v12s and helicopters, and as his son, I get a quick taste of this lifestyle. Ever since that trip I haven’t been able to sleep. It’s just hurting me knowing some people can live that life, and others choose not to.

On a more real note, I’m crying typing this out, because I feel lost. I want to be great, influential, and live my life to the max . I work harder than anyone I’ve ever met besides my dad.

I’m not asking for a handout, I’m asking for help, any guidance, any advice for me, any ideas to start, anything to start researching, any people to reach out to, I would be grateful for all of it.

I have 2 years of live futures market experience trading real funds, my largest account was 25k, which I ended up losing it all. After that, I took a break for a couple months because I had lost myself, I started doing lots drugs, drinking, and gambling. And now, ever since that trip, I realized I’m not meant to be a product of my environment, and I want to be more as an individual.

If anyone wants to work with me, or help me out with any opportunity I do not need money, I want experience and guidance. My phone number is 941-724-5078.

1mem2pm,Is it a smart move? Jonas software owned company.,"Hi all,

I have job offer for a System analyst role at a financial software company under Jonas Software which I came to know is owned by Constellation. It is a really small company with less than 100 employees.
The platform is low-code and the software company is exclusive for streamlining workflows in operations in particular.

About the role:
	•	1 day/week in office located in Ontario, Canada
	•	Configure workflows, test systems, client interaction (mostly U.S.)
	•	No deep coding needed; SQL/Java is an asset
	•	Reports to IT Manager, small team. 

My background:
	•	4+ years in Canadian banking (AML, fraud, reporting). Working in a big five as a contractor.
	•	Currently learning SQL, aiming to move into tech/analytics
	

Looking for advice:
	•	Is this a good stepping stone into IT/analytics or too niche?
	•	Anyone familiar with Jonas/Constellation — how’s growth, culture, stability?

Would love your thoughts. Thanks!

1melszp,Is requiring a drastic haircut change a bigger red flag than I think?,"I started a new job about a month ago in an office type role. 

Some important pieces of context: my dad referred me to the company and works as a front line worker PT (semi retirement job - not at all what his career was in). I was excited for the role but a little cautious because basically every other office employee is part of the same family. Like siblings, nieces, an aunt --all related.  The other piece of context is that I have the left side of my head shaved. I normally shave it with no guard on the trimmer and let it grow out to a half an inch at most and then repeat. So sometimes I have waist length hair on the right side and basically none on the left. I do not have facial piercings and my few tattoos can be covered if required. This haircut is the most extreme part of my ""look"" 

I interviewed with my immediate supervisor in person and then the CEO (small company) over zoom. Both had good lighting. A few days prior to my first day I trimmed down the shaved part of my hair because it had grown out too much. For my first day I wore a neat side braid, which obviously clearly showed the side shave. I almost never switch the part and it was on display in my interview but a bit grown out. 

We had a zoom meeting on day 1 with the CEO and afterwards he told my supervisor that my side shave was a ""dealbreaker"" and I'd need to get rid of it. I stared in shock for a moment before saying that he knew before he hired me, and she agreed but said he must've not noticed then. So I'd need to cut my hair so as not to have the side shave, grow it out (???), or hide it. I've been hiding it but I hate how it looks. I hate it enough that I have considered cutting off 5 years of  growth from a very very short pixie to waist length. But the idea that this man is forcing my hand makes me incredibly frustrated and angry. And I can't grow it out without looking insane. I also am very wary of expressing my concerns to my boss (who is HR) because of the family aspect. 

I don't want to quit over this, but I have seriously considered continuing to apply elsewhere. I don't want to burn a bridge but this haircut thing really feels ridiculous. And my first thought was that he couldn't know if it was shaved/gone for a medical reason. It's not, I just have a ton of hair and growing it out this long on my whole head would be too much to deal with and would hurt. 

I've been stewing over it for a month. It's not a career path I'm stoked about but I'm trying to move away from what I used to do for many reasons. Normally I go with my gut instinct but the job market is crappy and I can't afford not to work. I think I'm just looking for thoughts and guidance from someone who isn't my endlessly supportive husband or my father who has stake in me maintaining a solid relationship with this company. Normally he'd be the first to say quit and walk away and my go-to for advice on this but the bias means Im just out here spinning on my own. Do I stay, do I find another opportunity asap? I feel lost and that's not a feeling I'm at all used to.

1melk90,Not sure what kind of firm would hire me. Resume feels incohesive. Could i get some feedback?,"[Link to my resume!](https://imgur.com/a/X4VWOLU)

Okay so I'm very proud of my education and all my experiences. Maybe not perfect - if I could go back I'd probably do it differently - but I went through a lot a worked a lot during college. (A couple other jobs have been left out).

Now I'm post grad and took some time to myself but want to get back in the real job market (I don't want anymore part times because that feels like I'm moving sideways). I've been sort of picky with the jobs I'm applying to recently (while still applying to a sort of wide range of job titles), finding companies I like or align with my morals and haven't seen much success. Aside from trying to understand myself and what I want to do with my career I've been thinking more about my resume and what kind of firm or company would hire me.

My experiences feel very unrelated. Of course in my mind they are in many ways, but yes, I constantly feel like I don't know what to do or how to market myself with a business background and this other more holistic experience. Even if they were part times I was very intentional with the jobs I worked and companies I worked for and thought this would be something commendable but maybe not exactly.

Maybe I need to keep refining the resume? or go back to school? I didn't do a very good job networking in college and I didn't go full finance/accounting route but there's no going back. Just out here looking for insight, all is welcome and appreciated.

other experience missing is another retail job at a small batch wine store, and server job at a michelin restaurant

Context: I’m in HR and he is the director of the facility. Since he has came to this building he has fired or ran off so many staff. We have a 100% turnover rate. I have not stopped hiring new employees since he started. He has effectively made my job 10x harder than it needs to be. He is mean, lies, tries to turn staff against one another, talks down to staff, doesn’t show appreciation. Gives extra tasks throughout the day when we already have a big workload and then says no overtime. I walk on egg shells when I am around him and have to be extra careful with my documentation due to his lies. 

The last few weeks I’ve work 50 hour weeks, came in early, stayed over late and provided our nightshift with dinner, hired over 20 people this month. All while trying to juggle the ever growing list of added tasks by him.

I’ve noticed over the past few weeks he seems to be micromanaging me and documenting certain things in emails that are raising a red flag to me. It feels like he is trying to push me out. I found out he’s reported that I seem to be disengaged and not attending meetings. 

He tries to keep us in meetings all day long and not give us enough time to work on our actual tasks. So yes, I skip the unimportant ones that don’t pertain to me. 

I am the only HR for close to 200 people. The workload is way too much for 1 person. He seems to be trying to build a case against me to fire me. Does anyone have any advice?

1mejumz,Financial advisor w/ disclosures,"I am 25 years old and have been with the same financial/investment firm for the first three years of my work experience. I’ve experienced some success, but the industry by nature is very difficult to make a career out of. Out of college I accepted an offer into this advisory training program from one of the biggest wire house firms. One month later, I was arrested for petty theft when I drunkenly scooped up a pair of aviators off the floor of a store. I was in while on senior week, strutted out of the store and was later met by the store, owner and officers who arrested me I did not plead guilty to shoplifting/petty theft And was instead convicted of a more minor charge however, this still appears on my broker check. Fast-forward about two years and I was involved in a bar fight where I was charged with aggravated assault (my attorney told me this was complete bs charge) which was later brought down to “disturbing the peace”. Far cry from agg assault. Nonetheless charged and it’s on my broker check. I feel as though this is probably a death sentence for me, trying to make it in the industry as a career. Ironically, I have been interviewing for another big firm who are aware of these charges/disclosures on my broker check and despite them have demonstrated real interest in me. Many many meetings/phone calls and i think an offer is imminent. My issue is i feel like i may be cooked anyway. I have observed plenty of very successful financial advisor in the wealth management firm that I work at in New York City and can honestly say I stack up with them in terms of demeanor,  knowledge, etc. i went to a highly competitive university. I have a fairly affluent network. I (think) im decent looking. I can talk shop with the best of em and am highly proficient at personal finance/investing/planning etc. basically i think i’d be a major weapon in the industry but these two unfortunate events i believe will barr me from achieving true success. Time is running out on the program im in currently if i dont bring in more business. The success rate in this program is approximately 20-30% so it’s difficult to begin with, much like the industry as a whole. Ive thought about pivoting completely to more or less put those things behind me for good as they wont really follow me as much as being a registered broker/advisor where theyre very publicy visible but then again i have little to no experience in any other fields. I was a finance major graduated 3 years ago. I recognize im very lucky to have maintained my current job to begin with - the firm could have just shown me the door especially after incident #2.  Am i cooked? Advice from anyone and particularly people who may have industry experience id be grateful.
