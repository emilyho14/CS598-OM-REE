166rc5y,"I was a college drop out, how do I turn my life around and go to nursing school?","During high school and college I had no idea what I wanted to do in life. I got bad grades in high school due to lack of motivation, and I dropped out of college because I had no direction. I completed my first semester easily but after that I stopped showing up to classes and got kicked out. Since then I managed to get promoted 5 times in 3 years at my retail job, and I was running my own store at 21. After running my own store for 3 years I wanted to be in healthcare so I took a job as a CNA in training, but I never received my CNA because I was offered a director position(purchasing) within a month of being there. I still want to help people and become a nurse, but financially I cannot afford the pay rate of a CNA, and I won’t be able to afford to go back to school if I can even manage to convince the school to let me back in. I am an extremely hard working person, but I grew up too late.

166qhqw,How to succeed and be perceived well in a corporate environment?,"I just started at my second super corporate role, and I have realized I can be a little clueless about how I’m perceived in a corporate environment. 
For background info, I have ADHD. I like to take notes on my work laptop in meetings, but twice it’s come up that people can think I’m disengaged due to being on my laptop if I’m not actively participating in meetings, when in actuality I was just tired because it’s 8 am and praying they wouldn’t call on me because my coffee still wasn’t helping me feel more awake, so I put my full focus into paying attention and taking excellent notes. Some think you’re more engaged when you take notes in a notebook, but it’s useless to me since I can find the notes much more easily when they’re in my laptop since I can search for the keywords. Taking notes in a notebook doesn’t help me learn the material, since it’s harder to find. One person was caught very much off guard when I showed I had taken very thorough notes. 
We also have a call center- like setup which is distracting to my ADHD when I hear everyone else’s conversations and calls. I would go to conference rooms at my previous job, but that made me not as visible to management even though I was way more productive. I’ve gone in my car or an adjacent empty room to go through my call lists without distractions and my results were better than everyone else’s, but I don’t want to be perceived badly because I’m doing what helps me the best. At my previous corporate job, I did what worked for my productivity but was laid off, while some others who played the corporate game better were retained and promoted. 
What sorts of things should I be mindful about that would otherwise hurt my image? I want to succeed and climb the ladder here so should I do what looks good for the image even if it hurts my productivity? Should I disclose to my manager that I have ADHD in hopes that I can get some accommodation and understanding behind what works best for me?",Regular-Fix-7268,1,1.0,3,1693524052,2023-08-31 23:20:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166qhqw/how_to_succeed_and_be_perceived_well_in_a/,8,2023
166qg1e,starting my dream new job advice,"hello, i am 19 years old and have studied at my college for 3 years in the same subject, i was at the top of my classes and got distinction grades (best i could have gotten) on my level 2 and 3 qualifications and passed all the required units on my level 1 qualification, i got along well with all of the staff and volunteered for the college to do open days and taster sessions for people thinking of attending the college.

I was told by a member of staff at the college that there were possibilities of gaining employment in the college, several months later and after i finished the exams for my level 3 course, a job advertisement was put online for a job in the department that i had studied in that would involve me working alongside my former teachers, I applied for the job and attended the interview.

I went to the interview in a nice 3 piece suit, had a hair cut the day before, a shave the as well, gave a good first impression, shook the interviewers hands with a good handshake, i answered the questions in the interview quite well according to them and provided examples of how i would handle situations in a college environment, at the end of the interview i asked about the dress code, they said that they liked the fact that i came in a nice suit and paid attention to detail, they said they could tell by looking to see that i had polished my shoes, i also asked when i would know if i had been successful in my application for the job, they told me to expect a phone call the following day.

me and the interviewers talked some more, one of them said that he wouldn't keep me waiting and that id got the job, i told them i was very happy, shook their hands, when the interview was over i was escorted out of the building, i bumped into my new manager after leaving the building and had a brief chat with him.

I've submitted all the relevant paperwork, been added to the WhatsApp group for my department, ive also learned that there is another new employee joining the team with me, im just waiting on a start date now, i have met and am familiar with all the members of staff in my department from when i was a student in the college, apart from the other new employee, im happy to say that i have landed my dream job in the education sector, with a great college and room for career progression.

I was wandering if anyone could give me any good advice for my first day or few months at my new job.",15travisw12,3,1.0,2,1693523935,2023-08-31 23:18:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166qg1e/starting_my_dream_new_job_advice/,8,2023
166puih,I got my “dream job” and I absolutely hate it,"This is probably going to be long so tldr at the bottom. 

I grew up in a small town and didn’t have a ton of opportunities. If you weren’t going to work I’m retail you basically had to work at the refinery. I didn’t want either of those things and knew I needed to get out. 

Moved and went university a thousand kilometres away to get away from it and did a degree in engineering. I actually really liked my program, I did well in it and graduated with high honours. 

Eventually got a job in that doing software testing. I liked it but didn’t think it was what I would end up doing for the next ten years. I did testing and design for a while and eventually ended up in a very niche area of software automation. 

I worked at that for a while and eventually had the opportunity to work in the space industry (my dream) specifically in this field. I jumped at the opportunity and went in head first. 

I’ve been at this job now for a couple of years and my soul is absolutely crushed. I hate my job, I don’t respect the company I work for, I don’t even think I like engineering anymore and I honestly think it’s led me into a state of depression. 

I have worked really hard for the past 15 years of my life to get exactly where I am to find that I hate it. I want to quit but I have no idea how to rebuild my life from here. How do I find a career that will actually fulfill me. I thought this would, but I was dead wrong.  I have a mortgage and car payments, I can’t just quit but I feel like if I don’t my whole life is just going to crumble around me. 

Any advice or words of wisdom would be appreciated. 

TLDR: Worked for 15 years to get to my dream job and absolutely hate it. Feel trapped by bills and payments and don’t know how to rebuild or find something j would actually enjoy.",Drummler777,57,0.9599999785423279,12,1693522480,2023-08-31 22:54:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166puih/i_got_my_dream_job_and_i_absolutely_hate_it/,8,2023
166pqz2,Sell my soul to Texas?,"My former boss reached out to me a couple days ago and we're catching up, and he lets me know that he took a CEO position with a machine parts manufacturing company and he asks me if I want to come onboard as his COO. He tells me more about the company, and it all sounds great. Plants all over the southwest and in Mexico. I've been targeting COO positions and this is being handed to me on a silver platter. So I ask what the salary range looks like and he says $500k plus bonus, plus executive fringe. My eyes pop out. That's a $180k jump over where I'm at now. I'm already envisioning early retirement and buying my midlife crisis car. 

Ah but there's a catch. I would have to relocate from Chicago to Houston. And I hate to pull politics into this but that state is waaaaay too red for me. I talked about it with my wife and she hates the idea of uprooting our kids and putting them in Texas schools.  Letting Greg Abbott decide what my daughter's reproductive rights are is bullshit. Fuck that guy. 

But it's $500k! And I could easily get that up by at least another 5-10%.

But...it's Texas.

Oh, and there would be about 20% travel down to some pretty sketchy areas in Mexico, so that would suck.

On the other hand I can probably get a castle down there for the same value as my house up here.

Ugh, but it's Texas.  And not like cool Austin TX, but Houston TX. How do I put a value on that?  Is another $180k worth it?

I know that money isn't everything, but this is potentially life changing.  I can talk to my wife about these things, but I feel weird talking about this amount of money with friends and family, so...I turn to Reddit.

166o90q,Remote worker from a third world country wanted to ask about pay negotiations: yes or no?,"Hey guys. I’m a fresh graduate doing an internship and the contract will end soon and it doesn’t seem like I’ll have a full-time opportunity as my company isn’t very fresh grad friendly. I got approached on a job portal about this remote job which is based in NYC and they pay like half the state’s minimum wage ($7). I understand they look for people from a third-world country to cut the cost, so that's where my dilemma comes from.

From what I found out online, the base pay for the position is $26.50/hour without prior experience.

I do think I should negotiate the salary to get the most out of it, but I don’t know how to approach it. Especially that I don’t have a relevant experience in this role, but I do have the skills needed. Also, I sadly don’t have a comparable offer to counter it. I’m in the process of other job applications (locals) but nothing comes close to that obviously.

Tbf even without raising it, I’ll still make a more than decent living here in my country because of the currency disparity. So I can’t help but feel like I’m being greedy. But I just wanted to get the most out of it. I also feel like I’m being exploited. But ig they are just doing what multinational corporations doing all along and money is money.

I also have some fear that it will make them move to other candidates who are more willing to be paid less and/or do not negotiate the pay.

Oh also for me even a raise of 3 bucks will already make a significant difference. But my goal is the state’s minimum wage

I’m torn because I got a 50:50 verdict from everyone I have asked (8 people in total). One of my American friends said I should take it as it is.

166nkao,Coworkers at internship made me aware that head of department was talking poorly about me and also tried to get me in trouble. Unclear on where to go from here. Advice needed.,"Hi all. Hopefully, this is the right subreddit to ask this question, but if not, feel free to point me in a different direction. A little bit of background first: I'm a student at a university and I recently started an internship at a hospital in mid-June. The program coordinator (I'll call her B) placed me in a department that works with children and teenagers so I could learn more about child development and patient advocacy. Even though this was supposed to be the case, it hasn't played out that way. Earlier this week, I got an email from B saying that the head of my department (I'll call her A) was reaching out to inquire why I wasn't completing my required hours in the clinic every week. Without going into specifics, my program is broken into two areas. I'm supposed to spend a set amount of hours in the clinic every week, which should be four hours, and then another amount of hours done around the hospital. After I hit the required amount, the program is over. The issue with A emailing B and telling her I wasn't working like I was supposed to is that I have been. Every time I've been in the clinic, it is rare that they keep me for the full four hours. I complete all of the tasks they have for me and then I get sent home. I cleared that up with B and explained that I do complete my hours and have stated that I need four in clinic per week. This upset A and she went around complaining and saying nasty things about me because I stood up for myself and pointed out that her department was flawed. 

A few days after being emailed, I went to work and was made aware by three separate people that she not only set out to get me in trouble but turned around and was saying unnecessary things about me that weren't relevant or needed. What made the whole situation even worse was that I was not expecting any of it. I thought there was just a miscommunication with my schedule and then come to find out, it was bigger than needing my hours adjusted. All three people who told me what was happening were grinning and laughing. They said it wasn't my fault and apologized for A's behavior. One even said that that specific hospital is very gossipy. I don't know if I should go to B with what was said to me and ask if I can pull out of the department. Or should I go to my university and ask to leave the program altogether? This came completely out of left field and I'm not sure if I should go back. I should also note that I have never had any issues with anyone in the clinic. A has never expressed any distaste towards my work ethic. I'm a little shy but I think that should be expected. What should I do going forward?

166mwth,How to tell my parents I want to change my career from nursing to accounting?,"Hi everyone, so some background information is that I'm in my early 20s and have been working as a nurse for about 1.5 years. I only decided to do nursing as a career because of the financial stability, I don't have an interest in health care or for taking care of patients. My parents are typical asian tiger parents, they're very strict and conservative and have always told me to focus on school so I can get into a good university, graduate and then get a well paying job.  
I have a bachelor of science in nursing and graduated in 2021. After working as a nurse for 1.5 years, I've been absolutely miserable and I can't go on in life pursuing this career anymore. I've been crying everyday in the morning before work for months. There is nothing I enjoy about this career and I want out so bad. I'm constantly so stressed about work that I can't relax to watch a movie/play video games, go out with friends, can't even focus on cooking, cleaning, or anything outside of work. I can't even enjoy going to the gym because how stressed I am. I'm at my burnout point and have had thoughts of driving off the road and getting into an accident on the way to work, so that I don't have to go. My career is affecting my relationships with my family and friends, I've been isolating myself because I've been so depressed and constantly am an a\*\* hole to the people close to me in life.  
I'm thinking of doing a business degree in accounting which is going to be \~2 years since it will be a post bacc degree because I already have a bachelor's degree. I will do an internship as well so it will be 3 years total. I'm scared to tell my parents because they wanted me to be successful in life and have a good career, which nursing provides for me. But I don't want to do nursing for the rest of my life, I'm only doing it for my parents. I'm scared they won't be supportive with my career change so I'm looking for advice on how to approach it with my parents.  
BTW I do still live with my parents and help them pay some of their bills. I know some of you might say ""you need to move out"", but my parents are asian immigrant parents and they do rely on me for things like translating, putting a bbq grill together, coming with them to dr. appointments, how to pay their phone bills online, and etc so I cannot just leave them since they barely speak english and can't survive without me.",Hellokitty8357,14,0.8899999856948853,17,1693515653,2023-08-31 21:00:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166mwth/how_to_tell_my_parents_i_want_to_change_my_career/,8,2023

I graduated in the spring of 2023, and as school is coming back in, I found out that the post-secondary requirements for this are much more extensive than I realized. In my country, this will take me roughly 9-14 years of post-secondary. I was under the impression that 8-10 years would be the worse case scenario. I know, in my many years of research and preparation I definitely should have realized this sooner, but apparently when 8 years was mentioned, that was excluding the time taken to receive a Bachelor's degree. My two back-up career paths were either a physician or lawyer, which, also take many years an immense amount of money to be qualified for. Thinking about this now, I realize that I have been incredibly foolish in, metaphorically, putting all of my eggs into one basket, but now I have no idea what to do, as I no-longer have access to a career counselor, as I am graduated. I took biology, psychology, the highest levels of English and Social Studies that I possibly could have, as well as -2 level math, but I did not take grade 11 or 12 physics, or grade 12 chemistry, as I thought these were pointless.

For this reason I am thinking of going into less physically demanding fields, such as an architect, electrician, engineer, or maybe a machinist. I have always enjoyed research surrounding living things much more than machines, but these jobs all either take many years of education or have low salaries that I could not survive on, or both.

166lrmn,"If I have been institutionalized, can I work as a mental health technician or similar in a psych ward?","From 2018-2020 I had a bad run with alcohol, hard stimulants and opioids on and off, and during this period was institutionalized about 10 times due to manic/schizoaffective type symptoms and suicidal ideation/attempt. There were also times during this period where I'd lay off of everything and try to just take my prescribed medication, as I was diagnosed bipolar. I'd eventually find it hard to function on any of these medicines and they made me very anhedonic even after some time to adjust. So I'd quit and thus it would trigger another episode, even without using street drugs, thus solidifying the diagnosis. But after laying off any hard substances, and not abusing any substance period, I've realized it's entirely to blame on me screwing my brain chemistry by getting high and taking medication I didn't truly need. Since being off all psych meds, stimulants, opioids, alcohol, or pills I do still have depression from time to time, but have had nothing close to any of these episodes I was, for nearly 3 years now. That's also over 2 years of complete sobriety from anything besides cannabis and the occasional trip, which I wouldn't mind cutting out entirely for a job opportunity.  
  
When I was in these wards, helping other people through their issues is what made me coming out of there feeling healed myself. Many times, I would have stayed in there if I could because understanding and caring for people who rarely are felt so good, and it made me feel accepted as well. I work low paid and miserable kitchen jobs at the moment, and if I have to work a 9-5 the rest of my life I think this would be my ideal option.

Background: mid-late 20's , living in USA in a high cost of living city. 4 year degree. been with current company about 5 years. Salary is about $85,000. Average pre-tax income per year is about $150,000, no cap on commissions. Consistently a top performer and a key asset to my now previous business unit. Was recognized as a top performer and earned a company paid luxury vacation.

I know thousands of jobs will be cut. Business is business. I had been with this same business unit the entirety of my career here.  
  
Ultimately, my duties were to find ways to build pipeline for others to close the deal. I figured out a way to develop and create an extremely easy to read and understand report that shows the only relevant information needed to quickly identify and execute opportunity proposals. Before I came up with this process, we would be very happy to hit 100% of our target number. Following the execution of my reporting- we absolutely killed our targets. Here our mine/my teams performance. We are a team of 5. They all hold individual quota's. Mine was the combined total of the 4.  
  
Once the reporting was being used to its potential, we hit:  
  
Over 400% of our target for the 1st half.  
  
Obviously, the business unit increased our target goal the following half. They raised it by over 2x our H1 number. We still hit almost 200% of target.  
  
Following half, another increase of almost 75% to our target goal/quota was added. We still hit 150%  
  
Following half- Acquisition was announced. Quota stayed relatively the same. Caused alot of worry with customers and really impacted business. our BU/team still hit 110%, crushing other BU's within the company.  
  
Recent half - Additional increase in quota by 20-25%. Finished the half with 95% attainment.  
  
During this period, I was given 1 small raise, which is now completely zeroed out due to inflation/cost of living & Housing.  
  
There is a clear correlation to my impact and success on the business that cant be denied. People from other BU's and Managers would reach out to me and ask to create such a report for their team. It was very clear I delivered a magical process.  
  
Over this most recent half, I was directed to ""lead"" 3 new employees. I was still doing my normal duties while leading a small team, and was not offered any additional compensation. I just went with it and continued to execute and produce results.  
  
Unbeknownst to me, me leading 3 employees was essentially training me for a new role in a different newly created BU. I was told 2 days before an official announcement happened, and things started to make more sense. I do feel very blindsided though as this was in the works for a while and I'm an excellent employee that delivers and executes what is and isn't asked. For better or worse, this is a career changing move for myself and I feel like I should have had more input/heads up/respect in how this process turned out. NDA's were signed by others involved in this new BU creation so I very well could have (should have) been given the opportunity to sign one and understand what is about to happen to me. I was told by others that I was personally requested by my boss to be transferred to this new BU, and my boss will now be a director in the new BU that I was sent to.  
  
Here are my issues:  
  
I am not leading or managing anyone in the new role. I was told, not in writing, that in 3-6 months the goal is to put me in a managerial type of role. At this point everything is just words. I'm starting at the bottom of the totem pole, official role/position wise.  
  
My current salary + commission structure will absolutely be an interesting topic. current employees that hold my new official job title will not and do not make the amount that I am accustomed to. I was TOLD I will not have a decrease in pay. Nothing has been in writing or officially sent from the company and I am a month into the new role with out any idea how I will officially be comped.  
  
There is a commissions cap at 130%. As stated previously, I have hit above this number multiple times.  
  
I spent the last 3-4 years with absolute bare minimum oversight. I would talk to my boss maybe once a month and update him on my work. Other than that, he let me be. My results spoke for myself so he didnt need to worry about me at all since he was in charge of multiple dozens employees, atleast. CURRENTLY in my new role: I have NSA level overwatch on my activities daily. I do not like this at all, whatsoever. This isn't a ""because I'm new to the role"" , this is standard protocol for this BU. This will bother me alot, I know.  
  
Due to long sales cycles, my true business impact is not felt until the following half. If I discover an opportunity in H1, it will more than likely close in H2. So, while I was taking on more work by leading a small team, I was still delivering on finding opps for the BU to close in H2. I got moved to my new role beginning of H2. So I will now no longer get paid for deals that close in my old BU that I helped identify and expedite. This is a potential $20,000-$50,000 loss of potential ""earned"" income, depending on how my old team does for H2, but I set them up for success before I left without any heads up. I have let it be known that I deserve to be compensated someway for this, and I'm willing to get creative to come to an agreement.  
  
  
  
This is the first major change in my career as everything has been consistent and productive. My feelings and thoughts change all the the time regarding this whole ordeal and how it went down. IDK if i should be glad that I know I have atleast a year of job security since I am moving to a newly formed BU and have time to acclimate and learn a whole new line products and processes. But I also feel very disrespected and blindsided. I purchased a brand new car 2 weeks before I was told this was happening. I asked my boss if there is any reason to hold off on making a large purchase and was told I have nothing to worry about, so i did it.  
  
The job market is very saturated with people from my industry looking for jobs and I doubt I will be able to make the amount i've been making without being directly recruited by someone.  
  
I just really dont know what to think about the whole situation. I am glad to know that I'll have income while many of my colleagues will be let go. I really am somewhat relieved that I have some security and I want that to be known to everyone here. But all things considered, this is a demotion, while my results have shown that the opposite should happen.  
  
Looking for some advice, words of wisdom, how you would navigate this situation, etc. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read and comment. I appreciate any and all thoughts. I just dont know how to properly feel about this situation. What would you do?",North_Advantage_7586,1,0.6000000238418579,1,1693512686,2023-08-31 20:11:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166lll7/should_i_feel_thankfulblessed_for_job_security/,8,2023
166l3kh,I am SEO Entrepreneur with 6+ Years of Experience Seeking Career Advice,"Hey there,  
As an SEO professional with over six years of experience, I found myself feeling a bit tired and burnt out from this field last year.  
While my experience is quite diverse and could still provide me with a decent income without too much hustle, the platform I used to work on (Upwork), has become super competitive and definitely limits job opportunities for Ukrainians like me. I can still find jobs on LinkedIn, but they tend to be full-time, which doesn't quite match my lifestyle goals. I really love spending time in the mountains, going biking, and just chilling for a few days whenever I feel like it.  
I'm not ready to completely switch careers right now because I'm not sure what I'd do next. Also, I have like 2-3 years of project management experience as well - in SEO sphere and volunteering in NGO. So, I decided to focus on generating passive income by creating courses on Udemy. I've already made one, but it still takes quite a bit of time and effort to promote it, and it'll be a while before it starts bringing in some money.  
I'm exploring options to change my work style and earn enough to live comfortably (I've got some savings that can cover me for about six months). I'm not really interested in titles or climbing the corporate ladder; I just want to enjoy life every day - that is my life goal.  
Here are some ideas I'm considering:  
1. Keep Trying on Upwork: Even though it's crowded and you have to pay to apply for jobs around 1-2 USD, I might stick with Upwork for a bit longer.  
2. Look Beyond LinkedIn: I might start looking for jobs on LinkedIn and other less popular websites, especially for the U.S. market. This could be something I do during the colder months, starting around November, when I have limited outdoor activities.  
3. Focus on Building My Personal Brand: This seems like the best option for me. I'll continue creating and updating courses, try different ways to promote them, and even build my own website to sell courses directly and keep more of the profits.  
4. I enjoy coaching and mentoring in SEO, so I'm thinking of shifting my focus to business consulting and teaching groups and individuals on an hourly basis. I'll definitely need to find customers on my own outside of Upwork, but I'm prepared for that. It also seems like a good option for me.  
What are your thoughts on these ideas? What would you do if you were in my shoes?  
P.S. I thought about spending autumn'22 somewhere in Goa to completely reload myself, but the war in my country started and now I can't leave it due to restrictions. So, no international travel for now.",funkystyle177,1,1.0,2,1693511532,2023-08-31 19:52:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166l3kh/i_am_seo_entrepreneur_with_6_years_of_experience/,8,2023
166kwte,Disappointed and conflicted with my current job - any advice appreciated!,"For context, I started at this company as a sales associate in 2020, but had to leave after 2 months because I was in college and the pandemic had resulted in me having to move back home. In 2022, I rejoined as a sales associate, where I worked for 2 years. During this time, I was able to secure a marketing internship at this startup (yay!). My internship was supposed to be for the summer, but I had the opportunity to extend it and worked as a part time intern and part time sales associate during the school year. My internship and sales associate role had the same pay of $20 and hour and I got a raise in January to $22. This company is a startup based in San Francisco.

I graduated in May and was offered a full time position, which I had to decline because I was moving to Dallas because the role was hybrid. I got offered a contract position for 3 months which I accepted. The pay was the same ($22) and at the time I was so glad I could continue, I didn't even think to ask for more. A couple weeks ago I asked to see if an increase in pay was an option - I didn't hear back until today, which is also the last day of my contract. My contract was for 30 hours a week but got extended to 40 for the last month. So today I heard back, and was offered a renewal for my contract at 30 hours again and a raise of $2 (which I saw on the email, but on the actual contract it still says $22). I have a great relationship with my manager so I can bring this discrepancy up, but I'm not even sure it is worth extending. I do not have another job lined up and I feel like based on the market, the work I do is not in accordance to my pay, nor my raise. I feel like I don't have any flexibility but to accept this role, even though technically at my new pay, I'm getting paid less than I was for the last month. I feel taken advantage of because I'm a new graduate and I feel pretty discouraged to be honest, as I was very excited to see a large increase in my pay. I love working at this company, and I love my manager as I feel she did her best to advocate for me but clearly, it didn't work. Do I bring up the fact that my pay is even less than it was before? Do I decline my new contract? Am I being too greedy?

166ktx1,How well does your company have to be doing to consider staying with them?,"So far, I have been very lucky with my current employer, rising through the ranks and nearly doubling my salary (40k to 78k) in the last 5 years. That being said, my growth opportunities have already started to slow down, alongside any potential raises that go alongside them, leaving me with annual increases of around 4k per year. 

My company continues to grow at a very fast pace, around 25% for the last 5 years and is projected to continue at this rate for the foreseeable future. They have a flat 3% investment in your 401k and have a 3% company sponsored ESOP plan for which I will be fully vested at my 6 year mark and is already at around 10k. We also have full benefits and generally a good culture. 

Given the rapid growth of the company and myself along side it, I haven’t felt any need to look elsewhere, however with the slowing down of future promotions and raises, I am left wondering what I should be shooting for salary/benefits wise that would outperform the expected ESOP/401k match.",bluanzul,1,1.0,0,1693510925,2023-08-31 19:42:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166ktx1/how_well_does_your_company_have_to_be_doing_to/,8,2023

166kea1,"Laid off after 3 1/2 months, worried about how that looks on my resume","Hey everyone, really going through it today and would love any advice. Just started a job in travel advertising as an account coordinator for a company that wrote newsletter and web content for travel deals. Unfortunately today was let go due to “budget restraints” 

Very upset about this, I was told when I started that there was a lot of room for growth, and that I had a good track set out for me. The first few months were going really great, I had a few mix ups happen but I was told it’s all part of the learning process and that they were so happy to have me on the team. The work itself was chill, I was getting many of the lower earning accounts getting my bearings, I guess many of them were starting to wane off as they weren’t getting results out of our newsletters. 

So getting let go was really shocking and this is the first time it’s ever really happened. I’m worried how it’s going to effect my resume, they told me they would be happy to provide references but I’m not excited to enter the job hunt again. 


My experience goes like this: 2 marketing internships during school, one marketing associate job at a non profit, and then the 3 months of this job, making my total experience 2 years and 3 months. Is it still a red flag when I was laid off quickly but not fired? Are there any other career options with my experience that is more stable than marketing/advertising?

166kayr,Which job offer would you take? (Software Engineer),"The first offer is from a hedge fund that is very well respected.

166k0a7,Engineering Manager Path Advice,"A lot of people complain about being engineering managers.

Currently I’m 30 and a senior engineer. I do see myself becoming a manager because I love coaching and mentoring, although I am aware of the political aspect too and lots of meetings. It’s also an incentive that they are one pay grade higher than me. 

Is there anyone who does not regret going the management route? 

The only thing that scares me is that I have no desire to go extremely high to director level. 

I see myself going maybe one more level above a front line manager such as a senior manager who manages managers. But I still have 35 years to retire probably. Is staying a front line/senior manager role for that many years something that could be done or would I be forced to take higher positions like principal manager/director/vp etc.?

Also is being a senior manager who manages managers easier than a front line manager who manages engineers?

166jcfn,Thinking about switching from accounting to something related to supply chain. Is it for me?,"My first job was around 4 years ago, working as an AP accountant. Since then I managed to transition to a more advanced GL position in another company, hoping that the job will be more interesting and ambitious, and then after 1,5 years to the current one, simply for a pay bump.

The thing is - I find all of the accounting tasks (especially at month end), to be the most boring and frustrating things on earth. I think it makes me depressed and even suicidal at times. The only time I seem to enjoy it a little is when I can find some time to tinker with formulas and macro recording in the Excel spreadsheet templates and reports to make them more convenient/efficient.

I was looking at some job postings and it seems that the pay is at least similar in SC and accounting skills also seem to be transferrable - but are the jobs more enjoyable, less soul sucking? Less overtime?  
Would it be a right choice for me to try for some positions like Procurement Specialist? Can you recommend other interesting ones? I'm also interested in analytics and learning Power BI and SQL in the future if it could be used on the job.

166ises,"Just had an interview via chat for a Data Analyst position. Curious on if my answered were decent enough for the position; and what other people's thoughts are. Considering this is the job I've been dying to get and have applied for months now with no response, I'd really like some friendly advice.","Never really done a interview via chat before, but I've heard they are becoming more and more common in the workforce. Especially given since the pandemic. Anyway, I'm pretty sure these guys aren't some scam as some people may think, as I've done a bit of research about em, and understand what they do a little. Regardless during the interview, I had these questions asked, and answered them as following...  


 1: Are you presently employed?  
2: Why do you want this job?  
3: What word-processing tools have you used before?  
4: Have you ever worked from home & What is your current typing speed?  
5: If you had a job to do and there's little or no time to get it done, how would you handle the situation?  
6: What is the key thing about you that can give you an edge over other contenders of this position?  
7: This work can be repetitive. What inspires you to do well?  
8: What do you understand by privacy and code of conduct?  
9: Suggest 3 genuine reasons why you should be hired to work for us  


Additionally here's my response...  
1. No unfortunately I am currently not employed. But I hope and aim to change that given the opportunity.

2. The reasoning behind why I want this job, is mainly due to the ability to have a person growth while also striving to have the ability or freedom to work from home. Given the opportunity I know i can thrive in an adaptable environment; and help build my skills on both accords for both a company and my own personal ability on a daily basis.  
  
3. The word process tools I've used have been used as such, but not limited to,  
\- Microsoft Word  
\- Excel  
\- Google Docs  
\- VS Code  
\- Anaconda  
\- Powershell  
\- Microsoft Note  
\- And While I'm sure there a few others, for lack of time and efficiency, I cannot remember any others.  
  
4. I've not been given the opportunity to work from home, and yet while it has been an option for me in the past while working in IT Tech for Amazon, I had not taken it into consideration. My current typing speed I've not tested in a while so I am afraid, I cannot answer this one to the best of my ability.  
  
5. First and foremost I would assess the situation at hand. Then I would evaluate the three best options needed to handle it and select the most efficient and fastest method to do. From there I would remind myself to always stay calm, while executing the best method or approach to complete the task at hand.  After finalizing my result, I would then run through or proofread my work before sending it off. If there is no time to proofread it, then I would then acknowledge the client/supervisor of the work not being proofread, but still reassure them that I am confident in my work.   
  
6. The key and most important thing about me, is that I never give up. Given my age, and my past as a missionary kid; I am a bit different than most people my age. I am determined, focused, and willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. So much that if I don't know the answer to something, you can be certain that I am willing to immediately find out the solution or methods to learn how to get better at my job, regardless of the limitations. In short you can sum it all up with this one sentence that I live by; ""With Patience and determination, a man can accomplish anything.""  
  
7. What inspires me to do well, is the opportunity to constantly grow, being appraised for doing well, and having a peace of mind that I can manage my work despite all odds.  
  
8. While I'll be honest, I am a bit young so my knowledge on this may not be up to par compared to what you may have in mind, but nevertheless; I believe that by privacy and code of conduct, means that all information is confidential. Whether we are given the opportunity to share or even have the means to share it, we cannot as it is private to that specific person/client. Any and all information is intended to be respected, kept hush hush so to speak, and only shared when given the authority to do so. Aside from that, your work is to be constantly respected of the information that it belongs to.  
  
9. My 3 main reasons is this: My Drive, My Ambition and Passion to constantly challenge myself and always grow. I'm a young man with not much to lose, and when you have someone with not much to lose; then they know they can afford to do anything it takes to get the job done.",TheBlindSnipez,2,0.75,23,1693506257,2023-08-31 18:24:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166ises/just_had_an_interview_via_chat_for_a_data_analyst/,8,2023
166io0y,How to ask for my job back after leaving due to a mental breakdown?,"Hi everyone. A year ago, I moved across the country for my boyfriend. Pretty much as soon as arrived, he switched into a completely different person that caused me much emotional distress and emotional abuse. A couple months in, I got a really good job, and I did really well at that job. Everybody loved me.
I did very well.
Well, this is now ex-boyfriend put me through the emotional ringer. He broke up with me in a very chaotic way, and cost me an extreme amount of emotional distress. I started calling out all the time, constantly checking my phone at work to see what he was doing, crying at my desk, and my overall job performance just started suffering. I pretty much stopped trying until I quit, and I did so by ghosting them. I felt as if I was going to get fired because of my sudden shift. I feel ashamed of the way that I left. This was a very dark time in my life. I ended up moving back to my hometown because the pain of seeing him out and about with the new girl that he left me for was extremely unbearable for me.

It has now been five months since we broke up, three months since I left. I keep finding myself feeling the urge to move back because I did like the city, and coincidentally, the city I moved to was very close to my parents, who are my world. And unfortunately I just found out that my mom has cancer. I don't think I could live with myself knowing that I am so far away from her. Seeing him out and about, with this girl, who may or may not even be just his flavor of the year, will absolutely destroy my soul, but I also know that I can't let one person determine my life path.

My question is, I was going to email one of the owners of the company and ask them for my job back. It is a family owned recruitment company, so it is not levels of corporate. I was going to be honest and explain the situation, but of course I don't want to get too personal.
But I also want them to know that this is not a reflection of who I am deep down inside. I just went through a very hard time. One of my old coworkers even messaged me on Facebook and told me that everyone at work missed me. Do you have any recommendations of how to write this email? Do you think that they will even give me another chance? I'm going to try anyway, but I would just like advice.

Ps I know that I did not handle this the right way and you can't let emotions get the best of you in a professional setting, but this is what happened and I am trying to make it right.",whymeughhh,0,0.5,1,1693505978,2023-08-31 18:19:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166io0y/how_to_ask_for_my_job_back_after_leaving_due_to_a/,8,2023

I (37 M) hope you're all doing well. I'm at a point in my career where I'm considering pursuing further education to help me take my career to the next level. I'd love to hear your insights and suggestions based on my background and interests.

Here's a bit about me:
- I have over 7 + years of experience, primarily working as a BDR and currently as an account executive in tech companies that specialize in AI and ML-related products and services.
- I hold a BSC IT degree, which I completed back in 2014.
- I also have some experience with entrepreneurship.
- While I genuinely enjoy my work and have consistently been a top performer, I find the constant pressure of meeting targets and the associated anxiety a bit overwhelming.

I'm torn between a master's degree in AI, ML Vs MBA  Vs Executive MBA.

I'd greatly appreciate your input, Is this even a good idea? Making this decision feels like a big step, and hearing from those who have gone through it or have expertise in these areas would be incredibly valuable.

Ended up taking another PR job at a much smaller agency with a bunch of clients in areas I’m more interested in to see if that would help, but I’m still completely miserable. In fact, things have gotten worse. My client is borderline abusive and most of the time I feel like an island. The one thing I liked about my old agency was the team mentality and structure. Now I feel alone and I dread every day. I don’t mind working alone, but I do mind running accounts solo that should have 6+ people. I like writing, and I don’t get to do any of that here. I have absolutely no work life balance and it is only getting worse. I’ve had a handful of PR roles now across all types of agencies to know it’s the industry that isn’t for me.

Have spend days/weeks/months on LinkedIn and job boards looking for copywriting guys (which will come with a pay cut I can’t take right now) but can’t even get a message back.

166eobp,How quickly would you leave a new but miserable job?,"Like the title says. Imagine you just started a new job and you hate it. In fact, you were out of a job, and you knew going in you were going to hate this job, but you needed the income. Accepting the job offer made you feel more defeated than excited, and you had to fake enthusiasm when everyone congratulated you on finding something.

Conventional wisdom is you owe the company 2-3 years of your life, and perhaps much longer if the company took a chance on you while you were unemployed & therefore risky/unproven. And really, most career advice says there is virtually no reason to ever leave inside of a year, no matter how toxic the environment is.

How long would you stay in this situation before you started looking? Or maybe we should break this question into a few parts:

* How quickly would you entertain being headhunted (passively searching)?
* How quickly would you start actively looking for better jobs?
* Do you feel you owe a company more/extra if you were unemployed at the time you were hired, and display a next-level amount of professionalism and loyalty to compensate for the negative optics attached to having been jobless?",BluejayAppropriate35,64,0.9599999785423279,83,1693496683,2023-08-31 15:44:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166eobp/how_quickly_would_you_leave_a_new_but_miserable/,8,2023

166duoq,Struggling with new job. Feel like I’m going crazy.,"Hi. I’ve recently switched careers to being a groundskeeper at my local school. The first two weeks were actually not that bad and I was learning a whole lot. But now, nearly two months later, I feel like I’ve made a huge mistake.

So first off, I am the youngest person in my department. Everyone else is either one or two generations above me and it shows. I constantly hear about how “everything back in day was better” and how kids (my generation) are just lazy and spoiled. That, I can bear.

The second thing is that my other coworker (who is probably the only person I can barely relate to) is gone for surgery, due to messing up his leg pretty badly. Now, I am constantly berated by by boomer supervisor about how I’m not doing anything right. Going too fast on the mower? You’re not being through enough. Being through to where nothing above a centimeter is sticking up? You’re taking too long. 

Recently, I sprayed chemicals for various sports fields, since I’m still licensed from my last job and that is something I’m still somewhat familiar with. Spent an entire day making sure everything was sprayed, while also making sure none of the kids got on while I was spraying to reduce any health risks. Took the entire day, and then I get a text message (one of many that is incredibly inaccurate because I guess boomer supervisor is too old to type) telling me “you need to learn how to spray because you basically just wasted chemical”. Fucking furious.

I’ve tried everything to get good at this job and nothing seems to be working. I’ve done things at home differently in order to be better prepared, I’ve switched how I do things in order to be a better help, and I’ve even stopped bringing my earbuds to work that way I can focus. Nothing. Works.

I’m feeling lost more than ever and I don’t know what to do. I’ve spent most of this year trying out different manual labor jobs and the only thing I feel coming out of them is cursed to be stuck in retail.",Ok-Conversation6251,2,1.0,0,1693494763,2023-08-31 15:12:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/166duoq/struggling_with_new_job_feel_like_im_going_crazy/,8,2023

166cnt5,Help me chose a right path after graduating,"I am studying in the UK, currently in my last year getting a BA in Journalism. I am not planning to stay there after I graduate. My plan was to get a Masters degree in another country, preferrably a country I would like to settle in. There are two issues with that. First, the country I always wanted to move to doesn't have a Masters program in journalism. Second, I am not sure if I want to dedicate my whole life to career in journalism. It is an extremely challenging career choice. I do really enjoy it but it's very difficult to find a job, and if you manage to find a job it usually doesn't pay well. A perfect career in journalism for me would be to make documentaries, however it is very unlikely that I will ever manage to make a career out of it. I am not sure I am ready for the challenge, because in the end of the day I just want to live in a small house in the countryside, grow vegetables and work from home.  
Another thing is that I recently got into tech, specifically data analytics. I enjoy learning about it quite a lot and it feels like I have a lot higher chance of landing a well paying job in data analytics rather than journalism. But I don't want to completely abandon journalism, I just don't know how to combine them both and what path to take after I graduate.   
So right now I have these options:  
1. Get a Masters degree in investigative journalism in a country I would not want to keep living in and deal with the consequences it later. Pros - a masters degree and a possibility to network to build a career in journalism. Cons - moving to another country just to live there for a year is very expensive and just a hassle that I don't want to go through.  
2. Try hard to build a portfolio and apply for masters in data/business analytics in a country that I would want to settle in. Pros - getting a Masters in a country I want to live in will help me to move there, if I manage to enroll I will have a degree in something that can land me a well paying job that I enjoy doing. Cons - small chance that I will actually enroll and I will still need to think of plan B.  
3. Build a portfolio in analytics without a masters degree and try to land a job in a country I would want to live in. Pros - money. Cons - very difficult, don't want to abandon journalism.  
Any other options? How can I combine both paths together without abandoning any of them and making money in the end?   
Also worth to mention that I am married but we are in a long distance marriage right now because my husband was denied of visa to come to the UK. So a big factor is that I want to finally be able to live with my husband.

166c0x5,Struggling at work again,"Hi all, 

I'm a new therapist and I got hired at a group practice as part of a pilot program they're running for marginalized therapists to have an opportunity they otherwise wouldn't have.

During the first couple weeks of orientation they did a lot of presentations talking about how it's okay to be yourself, to be authentic.
That it's okay to not have everything together and that this is a family. That this idea of professionalism is based on white supremacy and we have to abandon that to move into more authentic ways of being seen at the work place. I took the bait and have been over emotional at work.

I've been really honest about how much I'm struggling at my new job. I'm a very heart on my sleeves kind of person. They've dropped the ball with me a few times (giving my office I reserved to other people when I have a client, not showing up to meetings with me, not finding me a supervisor and putting me in a spot where I have to make a lot of noise to get help).

When I've shown up to group settings I've expressed that I'm not sure if this role of therapist is for me and I've struggled with anxiety around the lack of support I've been receiving. I have also talked openly at work about other aspects of my personal life (I just moved here and im really struggling personally/emotionally). 

I keep getting feedback from my direct supervisor on ""taking up space"" and how I might be a verbal/external processor but I need to self soothe before I just say what's on my mind because I'm in a place where because of my identity (I'm the only white person) I have to earn trust in the group. They said I have to be aware that other people will feel compelled to soothe me around something I can work out on my own. I've gotten this feedback a couple of times now from her now so I'm nervous. She told me other people in our cohort don't feel comfortable giving me feedback directly so it's her job to monitor that on behalf of the group. I asked her if she's ever gotten told by anyone directly that I make them uncomfortable. She said no but she watches peoples facial expressions and takes the energetic temperature in the room after I share and can see people are uncomfortable.

So obviously I'm like mortified. I don't understand what work places mean when they give a lot of lip service to how they want you to be yourself/authentic/shirk professionalism and challenge the norms of what it means to be at work. I wish I knew better and didn't take it so literally because now I'm in a spot where I've shared too much with people and I'm being negatively evaluated for it now. The other thing is too is I'm required to do a lot of constant team building emotional labor that is part of the job description sadly so I can't even just do my own thing and pull back/withdraw without that being negatively evaluated too.

1666u1t,Anxious about my future.,"I'm turning 29 in 6 months. I gave up my career 5 years ago to help out our family business. I was hesitant because I loved my job then and I was really doing good. What made me decide to give up my career was my dad got hospitalized and they asked me to work for them and help them out. I couldn't say no. Who could? Your dad's in the hospital bed begging you to resign and work for the company. At this time, I was close to being promoted. Had connections that I was sure I could use in the future.  I was also able to enjoy life. I was able to travel, eat in good restos, party during the weekend, made friends. I was a different person back then. 

Handling operations of our logistics company for 5 years now and I hate it! It's gotten to the point that I dread waking up every day. The stress will be the death of me. It triggers my anxiety. I've been telling my parents about my problems even cried telling them how much I want to quit operations and move me to a different department but nahh. 

2 weeks ago, my mom and I had an argument regarding a certain part of the operation. After a heated argument, I told her ""I'm tired"" Well, we're not in talking terms now. 

I've been thinking of quiting my job now. Even finalized my resume and looking for job openings related to my course and career back then. 

Now, I can't help but wonder about the what ifs.

I’m interested in youth advocacy work (such as summer camps for youth leadership) and have done work in that area, and I’m also interested in social causes such as immigration and just helping people in general. I can’t be motivated to work for money, and need a good cause to work for where I can see myself making a difference in peoples’ lives. 

I also like systems and administrative work, such as arranging travel for other people, filing things, figuring out systemic patterns and organizing things to work more efficiently. I am definitely more of an idea person rather than a people person.

I’m thinking of working in the summer camp industry for a few years but I don’t know how long I can stay there, and also going into some other academic endeavour such as a master’s in something else after a secondary bachelors or law school, etc.

1663xvz,My manager is leaving and company wants me to take over her role when I just joined - how do I renegotiate my salary?,"I started a new job as a marketing executive on £33k in late June. In my negotiation stage I tried to get £35k but they upped it by £1k which isn’t bad and explained it was due to experience. Then I saw my contract and they left the edits on the document and my predecessor was on £38k
I’ve just been notified my manager is leaving and they’re not intending on replacing her.  it’s a small team of 9 people in our branch so I will be now taking on all marketing duties and other aspects of her role (she’s the general manager of sales and marketing) and they still haven’t fully disclosed what other aspects I would possibly take over. 

I scheduled a meeting next week with the managing director who asked if I’d be up for handling the company’s business relationships with retailers. I’m not against that as I’m interested in learning more about the business side as time goes on. 

As the duties and responsibilities will be changing to discuss this. I want to ask for my salary to be bumped up to £45k as this is industry standard from my research online and I would be a marketing manager essentially as I will no longer have my manager and she’s started handing over the key things she led in (e.g, managing the marketing budget,  management of work processes with our external agencies). Does anyone have any advice how to navigate this? 

A part of me is a little worried they may say because I don’t have a long period of experience in the company or within this kind of role it may not work to my advantage but I’m a believer of being fairly paid for the work you do now.

16626hf,First Startup Job Experience: Overwhelmed and Seeking Advice,"Hey everyone,

I hope I'm doing this right; it's my first time posting on Reddit. Sorry in advance for the long post; I'm still learning the ropes here. So, I recently landed my first job as a fresher in a startup. I joined on August 16th, and things have been quite a whirlwind since then.

To give you a bit more context, I'm a Computer Science Engineering fresher from a tier 3 college. Initially, it was a hybrid job, and during the hiring process, they mentioned being flexible about working from the office or remotely. However, after spending a couple of days in the office and then requesting to work from home for the rest of the week, they seemed alright with it but kind of leaned towards wanting me in the office for the first 2-3 months.

The compensation package they offered is 3.6lpa, including a 60k bonus split into 30k after 6 months and the remaining after a year. They also mentioned a re-evaluation after 6 months. The commute to the office is costing me almost 250 bucks a day, and it eats up around 4 to 5 hours of my day, which is a bit overwhelming.

Now, here's where things get tricky. My role is a backend Node.js developer, but they immediately tasked me with learning the NestJS framework. After grasping the framework and completing two sample projects involving jwt, joi, and bcrypt, they surprisingly put me in charge of a project just a few days ago. This project is more full-stack in nature, even though I lack experience on the frontend side. I assured them I'd study up, but the director - who I usually communicate with - started ignoring my messages and insisted on a project breakdown, including timelines.

Here's the kicker - the project also entails tasks that aren't directly related to backend work. Despite my constant explanation about my inexperience in both frontend and the unrelated tasks, he still pushed for estimates and timelines. It's been a bit overwhelming, to be honest.

To add to the mix, I had to take leave for Raksha Bandhan and informed them ahead of time. And now, due to a bout of food poisoning, I had to request sick leave for today. Just after I sent in my sick leave application, the director messaged me saying he needs to talk when I'm back in the office and asked if I'm looking for other jobs - which caught me off guard.

I was already feeling the pressure from the project, and now with all this, I'm not sure if this is the usual startup experience or if something's not right. Are all startups like this, or am I possibly in a tough spot?

Thanks for reading through this; any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.",Queasy-Cloud9260,2,1.0,0,1693460045,2023-08-31 05:34:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16626hf/first_startup_job_experience_overwhelmed_and/,8,2023

1660lc4,Seeking advice or your thoughts on how to deal with a frustrated employee,"  
I recently met with one of my subordinates to discuss our usual work matters. During our conversation, we touched on travel plans, which led to a discussion about a recent training session for the field sales department. Unfortunately, our team didn't have a representative at the session, while another team had three participants. Understandably, my subordinate expressed frustration about the perceived unfairness of this situation.  
  
I explained that our team was advised by our manager that attending the training wouldn't bring us significant benefits. I trust my manager's judgment, as he attended the training himself. Despite this explanation, my subordinate wasn't satisfied and believed I should have pushed harder for our team's inclusion.  
  
Looking ahead, there's a conference scheduled for March 2024 that I and other direct reports of the director will attend. My subordinate inquired about the possibility of additional participants from the other team attending. There was a rumor going on that someone from the other team will attend so my subordinate inquiries if that person will attend. I mentioned that while it's uncertain and not yet approved, that someone from the other team might be given a slot since it was requested since last year. I also stated that there's a chance for someone from our team to attend next year. However, my subordinate found this unfair, feeling that opportunities were disproportionately favoring the other team.  
  
I offered to give up my own seat at the conference but explained that I needed to confirm my availability first. I emphasized that our participation in conferences, meetings, and sessions should align with the company's benefit. Despite my attempts to explain, my subordinate continued to be frustrated, suggesting that I should push harder and not simply agree to the situation. I clarified that our approach should be objective, considering the management's perspective.  
  
I empathize with my subordinate's frustration, as we've experienced challenges with management in the past. While I relay their concerns to my manager (the director), the final decision rests with upper management.  
I'm seeking guidance on how best to address and alleviate her frustration. I wonder whether my explanations and actions have been inadequate or if her emotions might be clouding her perspective. Personally, I've found that by focusing on the logical aspect, I've managed to mitigate my initial frustration.",0101throwmeaway0101,1,1.0,0,1693454954,2023-08-31 04:09:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1660lc4/seeking_advice_or_your_thoughts_on_how_to_deal/,8,2023
1660ioi,My wife’s work partner is an abusive bully. Help me help her!,"As a little bit of back story, my (30f) wife (33f) works as an F&I manager in the auto industry. She’s been in her position for two years and she has consistently been a top performer in her auto group (many times THEE top performer), but despite her success & dedication, she is overwhelmingly “the woman in a man’s industry”. This is her dream job though, so she puts up with most of the bullshit with a smile on her face. 

Since starting in her position, she has gone through multiple battles for fair pay, at times has even gone without pay but that’s a whole different story, yet anytime she’s treated unfairly she opts out of speaking up for herself (unless she absolutely has to) because she doesn’t want to be the complainer/drama queen/whiny female/etc. Btw, these are all words she has heard male coworkers use when talking about their female counterparts so she rightfully feels this way even though it isn’t “right”. My wife is very non confrontational, even in personal life, and she is the main breadwinner for our family. I believe these two things also play into her decision to often put up with unfair treatment in her workplace. 

Lately, however, she is dealing with a new F&I partner who is a total lunatic (we will call him Bill). Bill (60m) disregards my wife as his superior, curses at her regularly, often threatens my wife to force her to take on his work load &/ any duties he feels are “clerical” and therefore “her” responsibility, and has screamed at her multiple times when she refuses his outlandish demands. He shows up whenever he wants, leaves whenever he wants, refuses to sign customers that aren’t “worth his time” so he can scroll TikTok instead, and is rarely reprimanded because he has made it his mission to manipulate the GM. My wife and Bill work in a secluded corner of the dealership, which is where his despicable behavior takes places, but whenever they are around GM or other co-workers Bill will go in for a high 5 from my wife and call her names like “buddy” to appear as if they get along. 

Thankfully, other managers have started to catch on to Bills manipulative behavior and off-putting demeanor. A few of them have witnessed mild outbursts of his, as well. However, we’re at a point right now where Bill has strategically and successfully swayed the GM into buying the bullshit he is selling. GM is typically a headache for all of the managers, and has been a source of unfair treatment for my wife in the past, so it is particularly inconvenient that Bill has become besties with the GM. 

My wife made GM aware recently that Bill has been speaking to her unprofessionally, she even let GM read the text message thread she has with Bill to prove his behavior has been unacceptable. Of course, GM tells Bill he “has to apologize” then moved on. My wife, being non confrontational, likely didn’t give GM as much of the story about Bill as she could (should) have. But GM also treats my wife like she’s an over-exaggerating teenager so can’t really blame her for wanting to keep complaints to a minimum🤷🏼‍♀️

Today, Bill had (yet another) emotional outburst towards my wife and aggressively threw a stack of papers at the wall directly next to her while cursing loudly. Prior to today, my wife has said many times she’s starting to feel increasingly more intimidated by Bill and does not want to be left alone with him in their secluded corner of the dealership. Now, she is looking into mace & tasers to carry incase these outbursts escalate into physical harm towards her. 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for hearing my ramble and pleaseeee share any insight, advice, or similar experiences you may have. My wife fears going to HR because it will completely change the trust she’s worked hard to build with her misogynistic boss. I am about this far 🤏 away from going into the dealership myself, but I don’t want to be “that spouse”. She’s becoming physically & mentally run down from this stress though, and I just can’t watch her suffer while I sit in silence.

1660g2v,Looking for Some Advice,"Just wanted to get some advice from others out there who may have been in my position before. I am a video editor currently working for an insurance company making training videos. I have 10 years of experience in my career and 2 years and 3 months at this company in this role. I originally was okay with being an individual contributor, but recently have been wanting to move up to a leadership role and I have wanted to earn more. There is unfortunately not a lot of room for a substantial raise other than the 3% performance increase per year. Also, there are no open roles and my manager just got into his role and has been there a few years so I don't see him leaving anytime soon. 

So my predicament is what to do now. My current job makes it easy to pick up freelance work for more money, but leadership roles do not come easy that way and are usually longer commitments than a few days of editing. The other option is a new job and look for a leadership role or a similar role to my current one with options to move up. My catch with getting a new full-time job is they have traditionally not come to me easy. I'm not sure if it's because my field is pretty saturated, my resume isn't attractive, or if I'm missing something other applicants aren't such as work examples, specific skills, etc.

165z25c,Which job would you choose as an entry level role?,"Which of these would you choose, were you just starting out in your career? Interned at company B over the summer and really enjoyed the work, but thinking that the flexiblity in job A would be nice. If I lived with my parents and commuted to work by bike for job A, I would not have to pay rent nor for gas, whereas if I worked for B, I would expect to spend at least 700/month on rent and 100-200/month on gas. I think that job A would be more intellectually challenging/interesting, but job B would be more fun and physical. The huge difference that I see is the time off and flexibility vs. pay. Right now, I'm leaning towards job B from a pure enjoyment perspective, but I also think that the time away from home, inability to travel, and isolation of the location would take its toll over time, and I might be underestimating the effect it would have on my mental health (as someone who struggles with depression/anxiety).

Both jobs have to do with the same industry and both would take me down trajectories that could take me to the same place in my career. I am not particularly concerned with salary.

165yi8r,"Contract to perm, is it unusual to be scheduled for termination before offer/negotiation?","
So as the title states Im in a contract job and the managers stated they want to convert me. Great, except they say that HR handles everything. I wait over a week and nothing happens, tell manager. End of week a person from HR let's me know what position to apply for and has me complete forms.  This week that HR person changes my termination from a few months to 3 weeks from now.  Hours later HR calls me and presents an offer lower than current hourly, about 4%.  HR stated it's top of the range and expected me to accept and have contracts tomorrow.

I at least want the 4%, I was expecting more as there's a new competitor in town hiring but everything is weird now. Also, a few people have left the team recently so I know they need me. I have that bad feeling about the compensation and I usually trust my gut. 

Should I just be happy and accept or is this typical to do it like this and should I negotiate?",Substantial_Mud777,3,1.0,8,1693449055,2023-08-31 02:30:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/165yi8r/contract_to_perm_is_it_unusual_to_be_scheduled/,8,2023

165vqkp,I've gone from entry level position to entry mostly entry level positions since I graduated from college 8 years ago and I lost my most recent job 3 months ago. How do I get a decent paying job and/or career?,"I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from a top ranked school in the field about 8 years ago. I was always interested in a wide variety of fields, even those outside of engineering.

When I graduated I wasn't exactly sure of what I wanted to do so I tried different things. I worked at this wildlife center, had an internship at a radiostation, worked construction for a couple of months. A few years of doing that I decided I should go back into the engineering field, so I worked part time for this solar system/microgrid installation company. The company was so small and had such little work that I barely learned anything. I ended up moving states to become a Civil Engineering technician for a year. I quit that to study a masters in architecture and half way through my studies I got a part time job at my states' department of health working as a biostatistician/data analyst. I learned new things about data analytics before my contract ended after 6 months. All throughout that I kept studying architecture until I got a job with a large Federal government agency as an Entry Level Buildings data analyst. I quit my masters and was working at this agency for the past 2 years until I was fired. Early on in my tenure there I switched roles from Data Analyst to Project Monitor/Analyst ,a role in which I work on the administrative side of things, coordinating research projects so that their milestones are completed on time, budgeting is accurate, and just general communication and management, I wasn't involved in any of the technical work in this role. I was let go about 3 months ago.

So...what the fuck do I do now? The advice I get is: What do you want to do, what are you passionate about, what are your skills? My skillset is a veritable mess of incomplete knowledge in different fields within engineering and in art and management. At this point in my life I just want a good paying job, preferably remote or one in the city I just moved to (dallas) a few months ago.

In the 3 months that I've been employed I've tried out sales (solar systems) and while that career seems so promising because of the financial growth that it allows, I'm so wet behind the ears in that realm that I didn't manage to sell a single unit in my brief time working them (so zero income coming in).",AnxiousSalary597,1,1.0,12,1693441811,2023-08-31 00:30:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/165vqkp/ive_gone_from_entry_level_position_to_entry/,8,2023
165vncf,I started a new job and yet I hate it already,"A bit about my background.

I'm 34 years old, I got my college degree in Cyber Security because I figured it would be a well paying path and because I was good with computers. it took me 2 years after graduating to land my first IT Help Desk job in the beginning of 2014, and I ended up hating it, and it's not just the work, I just pictured myself having to do some high level form of IT work with more responsibilities and immediately thought 'HELL NO!'. I worked there for a year until I got fired.

While I was working that IT job I came up with this idea for an all natural liniment (think tiger balm) and spent my spare time perfecting a formula that's all natural and fast working. My dream was to build this into a business and sell it so I can have the money to fund my dream to build my own studio to make art and build custom stuff (furniture & other craft ideas). The problem with it is that I don't have the capital to fund research to prove its claims or to find out if there's any potential dangers of using the stuff, as well as stuff like marketing, and the space to produce it since all the fumes from making large batches in my kitchen would stink up my apartment and get me sick for a few days despite wearing all the proper safety gear (face masks, goggles, gloves, lab coat, etc).   


I also occasionally freelanced work as a videographer/video editor from the time during my last year of college to 2016. Which was pretty cool, and I do love the creative aspect of it, but it still felt overall quite unfulfilling.  


I did another temp IT gig towards the end of 2016 at a university/hospital thinking that maybe I'd like IT in a different environment but still just kept trying to figure out other ways I could make a living.  


In 2017 I got a job as a Quality Control Lab Technician/Manager at a small hygienic wipe manufacturer, the company was a total shit show, I was really run ragged from the workload. They let me go cause the owner wanted to cut out a QC Lead from the 2nd shift (Me) and figured it would be cheaper to split all of my bench duties to the rest of the I was team I was managing and bump up their pay $1 more an hour. 

I didn't work at all in 2018

2019 I got a job as a night auditor at a hotel (working 12am to 8am), I figured if I was working part-time late nights I'd be able to get out of the house, and research my career options while making some money. and also worked as a temp as an R&D technician for 3 months. The hotel was cool at first, but the frequency of check-ins and answering phone calls got annoying and distracting, it threw off any flow of productivity for what I was trying to accomplish.

Then the pandemic happened. I worked there, and got another temporary job as an EZ-Pass installer at an airport, until 2021 I quit both because I was too burned out from working jobs that were taking me nowhere. Plus the night shift ruined my whole sleep schedule

I spent all of 2022 drawing my own NFT collection in hopes of it kicking off but the market for that sucks now. I don't feel like its a waste because it was something I thought I'd never pull off but I actually improved y drawing and design skills from doing it, and learned some coding as well.

Now just last week I got a job as an 'M5 technician' where I just load bills into this giant money counting machine and keep it running, stacks bricks of cash, collect reject cash, look out for counterfeits, and file paperwork. The pay is $23/hr which is more than any of the other jobs i've worked, but I hate it already, it's definitely not the career I want, I figured I could just do it to make some cash while I apply to other jobs/work on building other skills, but this job requires me to be on my feet all day without a moments rest, it's repetitive, boring, task monkey shit. I hate it. By the end of my shift I'm both mentally and physically burned out, I'm still technically training doing the morning shift, however afterwards I'll be doing the 2nd shift (2pm to 10:30pm) which may give me ample time before my shift to get up and work towards my other goals  


I might be able to do that  


I'm almost done with an online course in autocad, I figured I would get my autocad professional certification to add to my skills since I do like drawing and designing stuff. 

&#x200B;

Should I just quit now and focus on finding another job while getting this certification? Anyone successful out there who's been in similar shoes? Any advice 

&#x200B;

I'm starting to believe that I won't be happy in any work environment, and I'm supposed to carve out some sort of niche for myself that I could make a living off of.   


I don't really know where to go at this point. Any advice would be helpful

165usk2,Resignation - What to say?,"At my previous employment, the manager ranted at us (new employees) about how one of their employees quit while giving 'personal emergency' as an excuse. He went on to say how he doesn't like it when people lie. And on a separate rant, he talked to us in frustration how a new hire who no-show on his first day of work with no communication before or afterwards. As if those were not red flags enough, the manager would talk badly about current employees in front of them! I couldn't believe my ears.

I ended up leaving the job due to other reasons, but it baffled me how this manager would (1) say degrading, deprecating remarks about current employees both behind their backs and in their presence, and (2) have an issue with the reason given by a past employee when giving their resignation notice.

Anyway, I digressed, but question is: **What is the best reason to state when giving notice of resignation?**

For instance: Let's say Bob is working a random minimum wage job to support himself while seeking out his first, entry level, full-time employment opportunity. Once he secures that job, he must tell his current job he is quitting. -- Is the best practice honesty (quitting for higher wage and benefits) or keep reasons on the down low (quitting due to personal reasons, emergency)?",Heartfelt_Thoughts,1,1.0,4,1693439350,2023-08-30 23:49:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/165usk2/resignation_what_to_say/,8,2023

**Some context**: I work for a big firm doing a hybrid of data science and operations/process optimization. I have been with them for almost three years now and I pretty much love every aspect of it EXCEPT that it's a hybrid work where I go into the office 2-3 days/week. But I like my coworkers, work I do, perks of working here, income/bonuses, etc. I got this job through a recruiter who reached out to me about three years ago and we have stayed in touch since. Next year I want to pitch the idea to my boss that I am moving to another city (17 hours from our current office by car or 2-3hr flight). We don't have an office there so it'd be a pitch to request to be 100% remote. The chances of him saying YES to this are about 55-65% I think.  
  
  
  
**Some facts:** My company has a company wide policy that you must be in office FOUR days/week. About half of my coworkers DO work 100% remotely already because they have been doing that since before the policy of 4 days. Some from east coast, some in the bay area of CA, some in TX, etc. Just everywhere but it's about half of them. The other half of us are either hybrid or some show up every day because they like it. My boss and I have an agreement where 2-3 days is okay for me and I am fine with that but to maximize my happiness I would like to do 100% remote from anywhere. Being able to buy a home in the new city is far far more possible too. Where I live currently houses go for $1M and the new city has perfect homes for my liking in the $400-600K range. The city culture is much better to where I live now too.Now that you have some context and some facts, I can ask for the actual advice I need. What option sounds best?  
  
**1.** Call/message the recruiter to see what she has right now in terms of remote opportunities in my field/career. This would be January/Feb of 2024 where I could call them. And then go from there. Maybe go through entire process to get some offers and then once I know I have remote opportunities lined up then bring that to my current boss to see if he'd like to match the ""remote"" perk and just let me work from far away.  
  
**2.** Not reach out to recruiter in Jan/Feb '24 but wait until I talk to my current boss first in second half of 2024. Depending on how that conversation go then go to recruiter and tell them I am ready for a move.  
  
**3.** Other option I haven't considered?  
  
I am essentially in the dilemma of what is the right timing or the best order of events.

165sgv5,What to do when your 90 Day Review is tomorrow and you cried today from stress,"Just for context I work hybrid and thankfully just cried at home.

Today is my birthday and broke down crying at home. My blood pressure measured 162/98. This isn't the first time I've broken down (secretly).

I'm a financial analyst that started a new role recently. Have a Bachelor's degree. Experience. Excel skills. The interview promised training, SOPs, and a good onboarding process. The opposite has occurred. 

Admittedly most coworkers and management agree I was started at bad time, that my training hasn't been the best. Most of the team has lower tenure. Seems that there is high turnover. I'm given things that even my superior hasn't done. Sometimes you can ask for help and sometimes you're left to your own devices. I am learning things but sometimes I think the stress and my health can't take it. 

I might have just found a bad gig. But what the hell do you say when you've secretly thought about quitting multiple times?

165s4wq,"Very toxic workplace, more details listed below. Should I whistleblow?","Hi all! I’m trying really hard to not give away too many identifying details, but here goes:  
I work in a nonprofit program, and it is very toxic. This is all due to one person, (M) who is the program director, and she makes this workplace this way. It is because of her that many people quit. To make matters worse, she only got the job because her friend (K) got promoted, so K was able to get M at a higher position as well.

A little about M: She frequently speaks negatively about many of the staff under her. She fosters a very toxic environment. She gossips to her staff about other staff persons. She once told a staff that someone from another organization (that we work closely with) doesn’t like them. This is very unprofessional, especially as a director of programs. There are many instances of this.  
Example 1: About 4 months ago, M held an all-staff meeting, and told everyone that they may not have jobs by the end of the year due to poor performance / not meeting targets. To this, one staff person, T, asked something along the lines of “s there a letter or RFP saying that we will be out of a job at the end of the year, or anything that states that we are failing?” In other words, she asked for proof (because she had reason to believe that M was just saying that to scare people). To this, M said, “oh so you don’t believe me? Okay I’ll email it to you later” M never emailed this to T. After the meeting, T started to get treated very poorly. She had many responsibilities thrown at her from M. In other words, she got on M’s bad side after asking too many questions during the meeting. Of course this is all hearsay, but about 3 people have expressed that this is why T quit. She was pushed out by M.  
Example 2: This one involves both M and her friend K. When M was on vacation, K scheduled a zoom meeting with all of the staff under M. She started the meeting by saying that this is a “safe space” and assured the staff to be comfortable. She started recording the Zoom meeting, and then asked the whole team about their experiences with P, and pressured the staff to voice their concerns, any negative opinions about M. Then, allegedly, K shared the recording with M.  
Example 3: M had to do a performance evaluation with one of the staff. They reviewed it together in person. M did not tell the staff person that she had to improve on anything, except maybe putting their notes in a little more timely. Then, once the evaluation was uploaded on the system, the employee saw the overall grade they were given, and it was a very low score, stating that they are not meeting their work expectations overall. This was not at all mentioned during their meeting. Why didn’t M just speak honestly about all this during the meeting?  
Example 4: There was also a manager that just quit after being there for 6-7 months. M was speaking negatively about him of course, and saying “I hired him so he can create structure to the department. But that didn’t happen” Umm, shouldn’t there already be structure in the department? All we have to do is follow the protocols and policies that are detailed in the contract, no? Also, providing structure was not in the manager’s job description.  
Example 5: M encourages us to engage in behaviors that go against ethics. We are keeping our notes in a very unsecured way. Some of the licensed counselors can get in trouble if this comes out. Not even the staff, but I’m sure that this is enough to get the program itself in some serious trouble.A bit more background: We are funded A LOT of money from various govt agencies. From what I know about program development, no funders would just throw millions of dollars at a program and just ask them to figure out the structure the program themselves - there should be a guideline for every single detail of work. But there is 0 structure on so many things. It seems that M creates her own targets. Many of which do not make sense. (For example, our therapists are meant to be doing trauma therapy for the clients. M's exact words are ""we want the clients to be in and out. No longer than 5-6 months"" I'm sorry but that's not how trauma therapy works. In the RFP, it stated that the clients should be seeing the therapists for about a year. Nobody knows where M got 5-6 months from.  
Just one last side note, M was even bragging once how when she was interviewed for this position of being the director, she wasn’t asked any questions about how she could help actually run the program functioning, but just asked questions about how she is committed to DEI work. Im not saying she is unqualified, but it seems that her adequacy in running programs was not addressed or questioned during the interview (which makes sense)Please give me advice on what I should do. M is like an adult version of a “mean girl” and she has her higher up (K) on her side. She has friends in high places, that helped her get the job, and everyone below M is scared of getting on her bad side, due to her history of finding ways to pressure people to quit. The turnover rate has been crazy, especially for a program that is relatively new.  
I like the work I do, and I like the overall organization's values. I don't want to have to leave due to the toxic workplace. Please share any advice or input about whisteblowing, or what actions can be taken.",throwRA_abcsoup,0,0.5,0,1693432823,2023-08-30 22:00:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/165s4wq/very_toxic_workplace_more_details_listed_below/,8,2023

165rbd1,When is right to go to HR?,"When is it right to go to HR?

Without going into all the nitty gritty, I work for a huge corporation in a position as a team leader, and am constantly being asked to perform jobs that are outside the scope of what my job is. Not just me, but every associate with my title is feeling the same heat. Our company went through some major system migrations 2 years ago that are still being worked out, as well as some major leadership changes last year. As a result our inventory has majorly increased across the board in all departments, and we are all understaffed, and the upper management is making decisions to throw people in my position into roles we were not hired to do, and in some cases are of a higher pay level than what we are paid. They want us to be trainers (trainers get paid more than we do), they want us to be auditors (we are not auditors). Without getting into all the specifics, upper management simply has no clue what our actual job is, and think we have some super power because of our titles to just know how to do these different jobs. Meanwhile we are getting pulled away from our actual jobs to help out in all these other areas that we could potentially fuck up.  Our direct managers don't get informed of these decisions and don't get to have any input. Upper management simply makes the decision, and goes straight down to us to tell us what we're going to do without even giving our direct manager a heads up. I'm very close with my manager and others in my position, as well as the associates I am over, and every single one of us feels the same way - that we are being overstretched to do things outside our scope of work, that there is no communication at the senior level between departments and our direct managers are completely ignored, and that senior leadership has no idea what we do, and they have no interest in bridging that gap, and they are making us neglect our own duties to pull us in every other direction. We just had a company wide survey and it was very clear that the morale of associates over all is complete shit. At what point should someone go to HR? Should anyone go to HR, or are they going to be on the side of senior leadership no matter what? I feel like there has to be some option to make a complaint about this that will actually get heard, and not just bitch to my manager who has to bitch to her manager, who has to bitch to someone else. I understand that corporate bullshit happens and I wouldn't even think of going to HR if it wasn't so completely out of control.

165pr8b,Struggling in my internship,"I just started at internship with a big agency, and I am confused and struggling. Just to preface, I will be graduating with my undergrad in a health related field in December, and I have kept above a 3.5 GPA for my entire school career. I have always been a good student, quick learner, and I can generally figure out things on my own.

However, this internship has me feeling so lost and confused. What my supervisor is asking of me is very broad, so I have a lot of directions I can go in. They are having me take up a project that they have initially started and allowing me to take it on as my own. The part I am struggling with is I don’t know what exactly they want me to gather when I am researching for this project. I could definitely do what I want with the project, but I know they already have information on what they want/need included in this project. I feel like I have to pull for information, and it makes me feel like I don’t know what I am doing even though I am a capable person.

Today was my 2nd day. Yes, I know I have barely started, but it is not normal for me to not understand something or feel this confused and lost. I just want to prove myself and show that I can be a good worker. I am pulling together information, but I am afraid it won’t be good enough once I show my supervisor the work. 

I just want to know, has anyone else experienced this? What was your experience in your first internship? Is it normal to feel so lost. 

Another note is this is an unpaid internship and this is my first time working in a health related job. I have only ever worked customer service, so this is very new.",SeaSide6815,1,1.0,1,1693427334,2023-08-30 20:28:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/165pr8b/struggling_in_my_internship/,8,2023

My resume has 8 years of “jobs” on it, about 2 or 3 years in a position at most. Jobs in debt collections, logistics, management, accounting, and procurement, with a little data analytics experience as well. 

I understand my resume is a little all over the map, but I’ve simply done what I had to do to pay the bills preparing to go to college and working full time throughout college. Stuff happens, the pandemic happened, I moved a few times and unfortunately had to change jobs a few times. 

Idk if this is the problem, but I find it’s so hard to get an interview for a real career-starter like Financial Analyst or Audit Associate, something that puts me in a position to grow and get on track for upward mobility. 

I get interviews and job offers very easily for jobs like Warehouse Manager, Customer Support, Sourcing, Collections Agent, Clerk, Bookkeeper, Cashier, etc. 

A job isn’t gonna pay the bills and it’s certainly not going to help me grow. Not only that, but I don’t want any more “jobs” on my resume.

165nynq,What should my next step be?,"
Ok, I (33f) have been a SAHM(3 children from previous relationships, 1 from my marriage)for the past 6 years. I have become completely dependent on my spouse(33m) and have nothing to build on anymore. I gave up a great career in phlebotomy when I got married since my husband is active-duty military, we relocated, and I would only make $7.50 an hour at our new location. Not worth it for us. Anyway, fast forward 6 years, my husband is the only one with access to his income. He’s terrible with money, I am too. He will be on a deployment type scenario in another country for over 2 years(not sure when this will happen exactly. Could be in anywhere 1-2 years away) although, as they get ready for this deployment, he will be gone for a lot of other things for work. Our marriage is rocky and I absolutely hate that, if anything happened to him or we decide to split, I have nothing and no way to provide for 4 kids. 
Basically, he will be gone. The kids and I need to move and I will have to support us almost on my own.
What I really need advice/info on is life paths and careers paths/options. I don’t have a lot of time for school and he’s not what I call helpful or understanding of the fact that if I did go to school, I would need his help so I can set time aside to study and focus( also not helpful, is that I have severe ADHD and a plethora of other mental health issues and I am barely a functional adult. I don’t want to make excuses, but I’m being honest in the fact that my ability to get things done/focus/manage my time/stay organized is flat out embarrassing.)
I have no skills or education aside from a GED, any longer. I’m a sorry excuse of a person, let alone an adult. 
My kids are 14, 10, 8, and 4.
Luckily the youngest just started full time public school so this is a huge help.
Ok, so I could use suggestions on what careers/paths might be good if I have no education or experience and need to support a family. 
Maybe fast advancement or will train.
Or what courses or education I could get into and quickly start working in the time frame stated.
Or should I find a minimum wage job for the lack of good references on my resume?

165nwoq,How do I get my prospective employer to up their game since my current employer is fighting to keep me? How do I make the best of this opportunity?,"So I got this really incredible job offer for a similar position (in tech) from a competing employer to mine and in a different country. Now I must say I love my current employer, I have managed to grow and get recognized at top level, however as time has gone by, I do believe I have been strongly undervalued. While other people would have been on an expat contract, I have been in a slightly lower level, and now that the “sub par expat contract” is on its last leg, the best they could offer was to go back to my home country, or take a local contract where I am, which both would mean I take a pay cut. 

I have been consistently told I am top talent and they wouldn’t want to lose me, yet despite me following up at multiple levels regarding better pay, a plan for my next move etc .. I have either been ignored or “managed” through promises that have not happened. I eventually decided to take matters into my own hands and decided to interview with a competitor and i have recently accepted what I felt was a great job offer (30%+ bump). Now catch is that because I was in a key man position, I had to wait until all the paper work was in place. Everything is now good to go and I informed my manager and all the people required that I was going to leave. 

Now this is when it gets interesting. All of a sudden, the organisation is acting like this is the biggest shock of their lives and cannot believe I am leaving. There’s been one crisis meeting after another regarding how we got here, and how they need to keep me. So, I am having all sorts of mixed feelings because I have for the last 2 years, tried to get the organisation to make a concrete plan as part of talent planning and competence development, something which they didn’t think was important enough (tbh I think HR had a lot to do with it, with quoting global policies etc as to why they could have a clear path for me) anyway .. all conjecture. To note is I have been with this employer 10+ years 

So, I now need help on a few fronts and would like to know

165mao0,Marketing vs. Engineering: The Ultimate Fight,"**tl;dr:** should I choose the career I like, or the one that pays better?

I'm a woman in my mid-40s, two undergrad degrees (communications, business), currently doing a master's in marketing. Why marketing? Because, according to O\*Net, that's where I scored the highest in terms of what I like to do and what I'm good at. I also have some work experience in the area from my early 20s so it just feels natural for me.

However, for the past 15 years I've doing a lot of project support for civil engineering projects in the public sector. I've made great connections and people are constantly asking me to come work for them. These jobs are stable, pay well ($150K+) and come with excellent benefits and hefty pensions. 

The whole time I've tried getting back into marketing multiple times. But for whatever reason, I haven't been able to convince any prospective employers to hire me. I thought getting a master's might change that but I'm not even that confident, because they generally require a history of stellar, million-dollar generating campaigns and whatnot, which I don't have because I've been too busy doing project engineering work.

I could certainly forget about marketing and go for one of those engineering-related jobs, but then I run into another problem: I don't have - and don't plan on having - an engineering degree, which many roles require, although I might get away with having construction knowledge/experience as a substitute for the PE license.

I'm about 1/3 of the way through my marketing degree, and I have the option to change course and enroll in a master in Construction Management, which would take me a little over a year to complete but would make me more marketable (pun intended). The CM program would cost me about $30K, whereas the Marketing program will cost me a total of $10K-$15K (of which I already paid $5K).

&#x200B;

|Program|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Marketing**|the potential for flexible jobs with $200K salaries|hard to get a job|
|**Engineering**|guaranteed placement, great salaries|$30K, 1.5 year to get a degree|

Please help me choose! I want an interesting job that will keep me energized. I want to be respected and feel like I'm contributing to something great.

165ltqp,Advice - Move Abroad,"I have an offer to move abroad which has always been a dream of mine. I'm currently a manager at a public accounting firm. 

When I interviewed I thought it was for a manager level role which is what I do now and have over a year at a manager level. I just found out I'd be offered at a senior level role instead which is a tier below. Their rationale is that the move to a new country, new firm, and new types of clients could be too overwhelming at first at the manager level so they think it would work best to come in as a senior and learn methodology and software and whatnot first and then I could be a manager as early as a few months after hire. This timeline is not a guarantee though. The move was already going to be a haircut salary wise and now it's even less if I'd take the role at a senior level. But am still considering it because I feel like these types of offers are difficult to come by and don't want to miss out on a move abroad and do more fulfilling work.  
  
Wondering what y'all may think about this? I have a lot of confidence in my ability so I think I could be back at manager level within a year or so max. But I also feel like the rug was pulled out from under me a bit and the principle of the matter of being interviewed at a manager level and a strong resume to support that level only to be told I'd be offered at a lower level feels pretty shitty. The money isn't a huge factor for me as experiences and fulfillment means more than money to me and I still feel like my earning potential can increase by making this move albeit with a step back at first.

165lt9k,2 job offers. accepted one but starting to feel regrets,"a month ago i had 2 job offers. one would be similar to what i do (A) and the other would be more of what i really want to try and do (B). both had similar salary offers. job A is hybrid while job B is in-office.

after weighing my options for about 2 weeks and asking around for opinions, i decided to go with job A. my reasons were: it sounded more stable, and i heard bad things about job B's management and work system.

im 2 weeks in now in job A and im realizing how much i dont like it. my responsibilities are not looking like what was presented to me during the hiring process and since its almost fully remote, im having hard time feeling like i belong to the team. i still consider myself a junior and so i have a lot to learn and want to ask a lot of questions but im finding it quite hard to do so here. 

one thing that really made me rethink my decision is that there is this one aspect that i wanted to get better at and i thought i could practise my skills here. however, i was informed last week that my team has not done that kind of work and in the future, they want to leave it to me to do. (during the interview process and in the job description, they said that this particular aspect is part of the job responsibilities)

im wondering if im just being impatient and should just ride this out longer or call up job B now and see if they still have the position open.

165jtjx,Any advice on quitting a new job? Managing interview timelines?,"I’m sure this is a somewhat common dilemma, needing to quit after a short tenure, so I’m curious to hear how y’all would approach my situation. 

For background I am a mid / senior career professional with a Ph.D.  In April I left my former position due to an abusive boss. I was paid severance for one month but didn’t have something else lined up. In July all my applying paid off and I was interviewing with about 9 different organizations. All were jobs I would have accepted but two or three were ones I was really excited about. Three weeks ago I accepted an offer from organization A knowing that I was still interviewing for organization B and organization C. While org B and C were my first choices, there of course is no guarantee I would be selected, hence why I accepted offer A. 

Yesterday I started with org A, but found out today Org B will be making an offer. The extra tricky bit is that I’m a finalist for Org C but won’t have a final answer until end of September. 

For context, pay at org A is 95K, whereas pay at org B and C are 155K and 160K respectively. So, logically most people would accept offer B and break the news to org A. 

I’m nervous about tarnishing my reputation with org A, but part of me feels they would understand due to the big pay differential. However, I might be in this spot again if org C makes me an offer as well, (they are my absolute first choice due to the type of work and the highest salary)

How would you go about breaking news to org A? Would you accept an offer from org B or gamble on waiting for org C?

165gt3k,What options can I take?,"

So this might be a long, scuffed post. I am going to do my best to go over this and make this legible and coherent. 

The first half is the backstories. I’ll mark where the second half is. 

I am Nate. A 22 year old male living in Canada. In November, I finally got myself out of the fast food industry and into labouring for a big construction camp that pays really well. It’s one of the typical 2 and 1 shifts. 

I liked my bosses and the rest of the crew. And they liked me. I eventually earned the name Night Viper from them as a call sign over the radio. Everybody was solid. 

I busted my ass off and I got my tickets and worked my way up to operator. I was 21 at the time making 55$/h+. I was in a good position. I loved my job, I loved the people, I loved the location. I was legitimately happy for the first time in my life after such a hard upbringing. 

In around February, my foreman’s bosses daughter started working in our yard. Of course everybody wanted a piece of the camp tail. Except my friend and I kept our distance cause we liked how everyone was buddy buddy and we knew a female in our all male camp crew would throw things off for a bit. 

We were right. 

After a week I was tired of people hitting on her and nobody working so I called her over and put her to work. Turns out she was pretty cool. We started dating. 

I am young and didn’t realize my mistake in the moment and thought no harm could come out of the situation. And honestly, none should have. 

Fast forward to the end of July. We’re pregnant and I find out she’s been cheating on me with her ex, one of the foreman in another yard and the baby i was lead to believe was mine; might not even be mine. I confronted her about it and she was just lying so as she was leaving my room I took her phone. That lead to a whole series of events that night in which I was assaulted by her. I didn’t lay a finger on her once unless it was to push her off of me. 

                                         *
If you skipped the first half, carry on here. 
                                         *

After the situation, she ran to camp security claiming I assaulted her. I DID NOT. Later that night I was arrested for assault. I Was not given a chance to speak to camp security or the police. None of my injuries were documented by the police, I had to do it myself. I was released back to camp and then removed off site. Having to pay for a hotel myself. 

Both my mother company and the company we were contracted by did not believe I could do this. Did not believe it would impede my ability to continue working for them, they wanted me back because they liked how I worked. 

Unfortunately, the site decided I get a 6 month ban from site. The chargers were dropped due to a lack of evidence and never sent to the crown. 

I ended up getting a job in my home city. For the same company that we were contracted by. I knew the material and I already was a good enough operator. I impressed my new boss and she made me a foreman after a couple of days. In my second week I took a call with the father of my ex (my old foreman’s boss). And he wasn’t impressed. 

He called my boss and higher ups in the company giving them an ultimatum. Saying I beat his daughter. Giving them the choice between me or him. And of course they’re going to chose him. So I get fired again. 

Now I don’t know what to do. I’m lost and I hate life.

165eqx7,Brother Looking for a Career Change,"Hello all - my brother is in a bit of a ""unique"" situation and trying to switch careers. Could use some advice on what avenues he should explore.   
  
Background: 31 y/o, currently works in on-site catering at a large company (works for the company the catering and food and beverage operations are outsourced to). Makes OK money but can do much better. Has a bachelor's degree in hospitality. Located in the Bay Area. Worth mentioning that my brother is on the spectrum and special needs.

  
He has been looking for jobs in office admin, HR, and even event planning and has had 0 luck in getting any responses. He has sent out 10s of applications a day to no avail. I know that this job market is tough right now, but is there something he is doing wrong? Are there other avenues that he can explore, other than the jobs mentioned above which he has been applying to? 

  
If there are any resources you are aware of that help people with disabilities find employment, please let me know. Also, if there are skills that are worth his time to learn (which can lead to a, preferably, desk job), please do let me know. Feeling a little lost and could use some guidance.

165ekno,Am I doomed? I have no jobs/work experience or volunteering experience to put on my resume at all and have a little under a year to get any sort of experience before graduating from college.,"Believe it or not, I am currently an undergraduate senior in college majoring in accounting and have never had a job before in my life. My career advisors have told me to apply to internships as they will increase my odds of landing a full time job once I graduate. The problem is that the internships require work experience and I have none at all to list on my resume/internship application. I know that I could list volunteering experience as well but I don't have any either. I know that I cannot lie about work experience on my resume as it can be easily verified and get me blacklisted and was therefore thinking of getting a job as a crew member at a McDonald's as soon as my current semester ends and work for about a month until the beginning of the next semester without hurting my high GPA. So, should I work any job just to get experience or will I most likely be doomed and be unemployed once I graduate around June of next year? If so, what would even be the point in getting high marks and graduating if I'll just be unemployable while my peers with lower grades land full time jobs due to their job/internship experience?

165cbml,Do I choose happiness over a steady pay?,"I need some career advice, i’m sorry about the long post but I’m so torn over this situation.

I’m in a very conflicting situation with my current job. I’ve worked retail for a couple years now, that provided unsteady hours and a mystery paycheck each week. I’ve moved from retail to my current job where I am a barista in a corporate building that has a Starbucks and because it’s a corporate building I have a set schedule with guaranteed 40 hours, get home by 3pm, have weekends & holidays off, at $16 an hour. Problem is, i’m the only barista in the cafe. I was not told I would be working completely by myself when I was hired, and they have no plans of hiring a second barista. I am in charge of handling everything within the cafe and the mini convenience shop all by myself, aside from the manager and kitchen staff coming in once a while to point out something I need to do that I already know about and leaving me alone again. I am someone who enjoys working with other people, I love working in a team setting and sharing our responsibilities. This has caused me to feel extremely overwhelmed and very alone, paired with the fact that I have to wake up and leave before the sun comes up which I am very bad at lol. This is my first job with a steady paycheck and steady hours, I feel a lot of guilt at the idea of throwing that away just to have coworkers. I was thinking about leaving this job and just going to a stand-alone Starbucks location, where I would only be making $1 less but the hours won’t be guaranteed and I would most likely work every weekend. 
I have another opportunity to go back to retail, to a store I previously worked at in an environment I genuinely loved (Bath & Body Works) This job would provide retail hours, probably working every weekend, and I will make $2 less, but I was so happy when I worked there. I loved the work family I had, and I loved the environment. I was invited to come back for the holiday season, which did give me a lot of hours and a decent paycheck, but after the holidays are over it slows down and i’ll be screwed. I’m thinking I can maybe get a second job at a second location I also used to love working at, but that will put me right back in the same situation I left to be at my current job. Right before this, I worked two jobs and fought for hours and free time. 
I’m also considering keeping my current job and working at the retail location at the same time, since this job lets me out around 2pm. In that case, I would probably be working 7 days a week as the retail job would most likely require me to work weekends, my only days off. This is eating me up. I’ve talked to my current manager multiple times about needing help in the cafe, it was also run very poorly before I got here and I feel like everything is so disorganized. I can’t succeed at this job if they don’t have the proper tools to help me. I’m just so torn over what to do, do I keep this job to help me save for the things I need or do I go back to retail where I know i’ll have a more positive atmosphere?",punkmoss,1,1.0,0,1693395685,2023-08-30 11:41:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/165cbml/do_i_choose_happiness_over_a_steady_pay/,8,2023

1653zeh,What do I do when my manager wants me to teach a hard-earned skill to a coworker for free?,"I've been working full time as a contract specialist (not the exact job title) while going to law school part time so I wouldn't have to take out loans for school. I graduated and took the bar recently with minimal loans. Since my 3rd year of law school (of 4, since I was part time) and after a lot of persuading, my Legal Department gave me the authority to negotiate certain types of contracts on my own. I considered (and still do consider) it a win-win situation because I got some pretty sweet experience to put on my resume, whereas my job saw an 80% reduction in outside counsel fees.

The job has been pretty open with me from day I started applying for law school that I wouldn't have any position to move up to after I got my degree (Legal isn't hiring someone straight out of school, and my current department has no promotion system), and I was also pretty open with my manager that I would be applying for other jobs after I took the bar. My manager's only ask at the time was that I gave her as much heads-up as possible before I left so that she might potentially have the chance to hire and get me to train my replacement for at least a couple days before I leave. I told her I would, since it will likely be really difficult for her to find anyone with a legal background who's willing to work for my current salary (it's an entry-level position that I started right out of undergrad).

More recently, however, I was also asked to train my coworker on how to negotiate contracts before I leave. My coworker has zero legal background, and I had to start with some extremely basic things such as what indemnification is or how to use a whereas clause. I quickly realized that there was no way for me to teach my coworker how to negotiate contracts without also teaching her issue-spotting.   I've pretty much been doing that and training her for at least an hour per week for the past few months. It's been like hand-holding someone through 1L Lawyering.

While I understand the need to keep legal costs low, the entire experience has been demoralizing for me. There's something that feels insulting about the fact that I'm supposed to spoon-feed someone a skill that I paid and worked my way through law school for. I'll probably end up leaving ASAP (I've had a few promising interviews recently) while giving only the customary 2-week notice, but I'm a bit curious to know what others would've done.

Being the sole provider for my family of 4 (including 2 kids under the age of 5), I feel so stuck. I don’t know what else I could do that would make this much or honestly close to enough to give my family the life they deserve. I never finished my degree and we live in a HCOL area.

Has anyone transitioned out of sales to something more fulfilling that still pays well? Is it possible for me to find something remotely close to what I make now? Or do I just suck it up and keep hating what I do?

Long story short, I believe I have reached the end of the career path, as I have taken every necessary step to advance into the next step above me, which is supervisory, including leadership classes, developed a team that is fully behind me, with constant positive feedback to my superiors. good numbers, but I keep getting overlooked, bosses are always find something wrong, or always nag me about stuff. 

The thing is, this company has lots of room to move up, and not just at my facility. but I feel like I am being battled by these bosses at every step to keep me from advancing, and I dont know what else to do, the benefits are great, and the pay is well, I make 22/hr. I am just looking to break out of the stigma, as everyone else is. I have expressed to my superiors that I think I am growing stagnant, and have told them Id like some movement and growth opportunities but I think my pleas fall on deaf ears.

16508he,I am salaried but my employer docks my pay when I am under 40 hour work weeks.,"I posted this in legal advice, but thought I’d post it here for advice, and just general conversation. 

Here’s the original: Pretty straight forward, located in Michigan. Most
weeks I work anywhere from 40-50 hours a week. No overtime because I'm salaried at 600$ a week. Past couple of weeks it's been a bit slower, so l've worked right around 38 hours a week and I've
been docked for it. 

They said it's completely legal and that you have to work the 40 hours to get the full salary-this just doesn't make sense to me.
On another note-there's times when I work at home, or am not clocked in that I don't get paid for because previously I assumed I would receive the set salary pay, which has lowered me below 40 hours a week.",Miserable_Finance437,1,0.6700000166893005,8,1693357013,2023-08-30 00:56:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16508he/i_am_salaried_but_my_employer_docks_my_pay_when_i/,8,2023
16503kp,First job after graduation - negotiating salary,"Hello everyone,  
I'm navigating my first job hunt after graduating with a master's degree in engineering. I'm an international candidate seeking opportunities in an Asian country (with a local diploma). During a recent job screening that lasted almost two hours, I was asked about my salary expectations. I indicated that I'd be comfortable with a salary higher than $3,000 USD per month, which is actually at the higher end for fresh graduates in my field (I was unprepared for this question as it was supposed to be just a ""screening"", dummy me).  
After the screening, I received a follow-up call indicating interest in my candidacy. The company also mentioned that my salary expectation was acceptable but implied there might be limited room for further negotiation.  
I have yet to go through the formal interview process and anticipate that salary negotiations will follow. While I'm grateful for the opportunity and the role offers valuable experience, the salary would be just enough to get by, especially considering relocation and family support. Based on my research, there could be an annual bonus equivalent to 2-4 months of salary.  
I'm looking for advice on how to handle the salary negotiation, especially since HR might be anchored to the $3,000 figure I initially mentioned.

16500zi,Quitting new job during probation as a middle age person,"Hey there. I am a 40 year old guy who is used to working in the creative industries. So I spent my 20s as a designer, 30s as a production / creative project manager, and I got ambitious. I had capabilities and experience in resource management, so I applied to a large MNC that were posting for both account manager and operations manager. 

I applied for both, and I got both. It probably was a bad sign but I took it because I wanted change. The first 2 months I was so overwhelmed by both sides of work I could not sleep. I talked to my line manager expressing I considered quitting. They quickly actioned and told me I could cut down on 1 role only (ops part), and will send me to another office for training because they did not have this role in the local office, and there are new system being set up. 

The pay was cut by 15%, but I was willing to give it a go. 

I was in the other office, which was larger, and with the expectations of being ruthless and very office-y. Wrong. They were very relaxed and super friendly. Even my mentor expressed certain envy when I had my last review when they asked me the atmosphere. 

So in my 4-5th month currently, I feel like the ops work is really not for me because I don’t have the business acumen nor the right personality to push things. 

Since I have 1 month probation left (6 months in total), I want to use this month to really consider if it’s me, my boss (they’re very demanding and bossy), the company (I am used to working for much smaller offices), or the system (which will be in place).

I want to share this because I am confused by my feelings, as a middle aged person I should have known better what I want, but I feel like I may want to quit the creative industry entirely because my passion for it has essentially gone. 

I don’t have enough savings to soul search or spend too much time re-train, but my partner and family have expressed concerns over my stress. There may be a dash of imposter syndrome but there may be truth in my incompetence. 

Want to see if anyone has any advice. I truly think I will not be sticking around in the company for too long - I realised I really do not enjoy the grind.",linsensuppe,9,1.0,4,1693356447,2023-08-30 00:47:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16500zi/quitting_new_job_during_probation_as_a_middle_age/,8,2023

164zopx,Should I Accept this New Position,"I work in marketing and was just offered an internal position on another team, but Im not sure I should take it. For context, I love my current position, there's just no upward mobility at the moment because of the economy and Im getting tired of being underpaid. The new position would be potentially less desirable, but a 25% increase in yearly salary + 2 levels up promotion-wise. I think I'm hesitant to leave because I may dislike the new position and/or team. I know that's a risk anywhere but some things that the employees that I interviewed with said about their bosses gave me pause. 

I know the pay increase and title change are huge pros, but what's making me hesitant to accept is that I'd be leaving a lot of projects in flux that I'm genuinely excited to work on with my current team. I think the logical answer is to take the new position, and if I hate it look elsewhere next year. It would definitely be nice to make more money in the meantime.

164zgw4,"If I apply to a previous employer, what reason should I give as to why I left?","
I’m in Medical Sales

So I got out of nursing and began working as a “Clinical Specialist” for a small company in Cirtical Care Monitoring, but this company is best known for heart valves.

I did like the corporation, started in July and was told in November that I was being laid off but the boss said he would “try to save my job” and let me know by Christmas, I was being laid off January 1st. He was able to save my job as someone else quit but I would be covering four states now, January 1st came and one sales person quit so it was impossible to make quota.

Not long after that, the other sales guy found out his wife was having affair and spiraled out of control, drinking, drugs, and letting the territory run on auto-pilot, and was fired. he just wasn’t working so the territory went to shit.

Then a recruiter called me about a job in NYC , $30k increase in salary and up to $80k in commission… then our boss quit, so I decided to take the “Clinical” job in NYC.

Then I was offered an actual sales job where the money is insane with one of the largest companies in the world so I took that but now our company bought a smaller company, there was layoffs to assimilate the senior members of the smaller company, the territory will be split smaller, I’ll lose some accounts I’ve built up over the last 18 months, we’re all going to make less money and have to do more work.

I work in vascular but I’ve always wanted to do heart valves and I’m looking at multiple companies but my former company is the best in the world so I figure I’ll apply, I still have a few friends there.

I’m just wondering what would be the best to say in the interview, I left on a good note so I’m not sure if saying how crazy my time there would be best. I’m thinking of something like “my fiancé said she was moving to NYC and said I had to come or she would end our relationship.”

164zeqr,Am I doomed? I have no jobs/work experience or volunteering experience to put on my resume at all and have a little under a year to get any sort of experience before graduating from college.,"Believe it or not, I am currently an undergraduate senior in college majoring in accounting and have never had a job before in my life. My career advisors have told me to apply to internships as they will increase my odds of landing a full time job once I graduate. The problem is that the internships require work experience and I have none at all to list on my resume/internship application. I know that I could list volunteering experience as well but I don't have any either. I know that I cannot lie about work experience on my resume as it can be easily verified and get me blacklisted and was therefore thinking of getting a job as a crew member at a McDonald's as soon as my current semester ends and work for about a month until the beginning of the next semester without hurting my high GPA. So, should I work any job just to get experience or will I most likely be doomed and be unemployed once I graduate around June of next year? If so, what would even be the point in getting high marks and graduating if I'll just be unemployable while my peers with lower grades land full time jobs due to their job/internship experience? Does this also mean that work experience is now more valuable than a high GPA?

164z6ll,"graduated college 3 years ago, living on my own with no real job atm, my life is living hell","This is going to be a long post. If you take the time to read this, I appreciate you. I feel like I need to start from the beginning to really put everything into perspective. Maybe I'm oversharing

I'm 25, male, half-japanese. I was born into an originally very wealthy family with a horribly abusive mother who has instilled self-esteem issues and negative thinking in me, & a doormat father that just it happen (he was the breadwinner). We moved from Japan to NYC when I was 5 where I attended very prestigious private school, until my dad was laid off in 2013 and we moved to the suburbs. He has literally never found a job since, (tried to start a company for 7 years and failed) and continues to live in debt & off his mothers money. My mom divorced him and ran away to Florida in 2021 (she won't talk to me or tell me where she lives.) My dad has been an alcoholic since then, and living under his roof has been absolute hell.

I have horrible ADHD and have been heavily medicated with adderall since 16, which has most certainly helped with my grades but screw with my emotions a lot. I graduated in 2020 from a good state school with an English degree (3.2 GPA, 3.6 major GPA). I was bad at every subject except English/writing. Throughout college I always told myself I'd pursue something in journalism but never really took my career path seriously apart from writing a couple articles for the university newspaper, and one internship my senior year. I was too busy having fun; my social life as always been amazing and I was always partying with friends & getting into relationships. Also heavily addicted to weed from high school through college (I literally just quit last month).

I managed to find a job as a news producer at a Japanese news company during the summer after graduating (2020). As soon as I started working, my girlfriend dumped me, and everything went downhill ever since. I am very codependent and handle breakups very badly. I got let go from the job after the 3 month probation period, and I entered a depression & drug-filled hole for nearly a full year. I also realized news/journalism was not right for me in general. My ADHD was way too bad to keep up with the amount of multitasking and organizational skills required to be in news production, and there was no writing involved with the job.

After nearly a year (late 2021), I found a temp position with full-time hire potential as a Communications Coordinator at a college in the city (my college internship was a very similar position which helped), which was honestly not a bad gig at all. The pay was above 50k, and I got to use a fair bit of writing to produce internal content for the school. There was some multi-tasking required but nothing I couldn't handle if I had my mind right. But it wasn't. I was still smoking weed daily & very depressed. I was falling behind at very simple tasks. After the probation period, the school went with a different candidate.

In early 2022, I landed a part-time job as a freelancing reporter for my town's local newspaper where I got to write fully fledged articles for them at my own pace (about 1-3 articles a month). They loved my work and wanted to hire me full-time, but the pay was very little, and I only really enjoyed the writing aspect. It reaffirmed that newswork was not for me.  So I kept freelancing for them part-time for about 5-6 months for a total of about 12 articles, until I took a job as a ""college admissions consultant"" at a shady Chinese startup in the city. I really loved my newspaper boss and still keep in touch with her. I probably could have written more for them if I wasn't weed-addicted.

As for the Chinese startup, it was pure abuse. I took the job without thinking. I wanted more than anything to move to the city and get out of my dad's alcoholic hellscape. They roped me in by offering 50k + commission. They ended up paying me 3k a month with no commission. It was a scummy business where we basically wrote our high school clients' college papers for them. I was still smoking weed 24-7 but was able to keep up with the essay writing, albeit barely. I was very good at it though, and got all of my students into their top schools. After 4 months, I foolishly made a rash decision to move to Brooklyn with a friend ($900/mo) with $3500 in my savings.

2 months after moving, my startup let me go (last March). The college essay season was over, and I couldn't ""pull my own weight"" with the tasks they wanted me to do in the off-season. The startup was also bleeding money profusely. They did offer to lie to future employers and say I still worked there for me. I was completely fucked, but instead of panicking, I kept smoking weed and absent mindedly took a minimum wage job at my gym which couldn't even pay enough to cover my rent. I love lifting, have been doing it for years and built up a crazy physique. I was in complete denial of my situation and smoking weed every day, hanging out with gym coworkers and high off the female attention I was getting. That was until I met a girl there in late June who I completely fell for, which made me wake up to the reality of my situation and start panicking. I quit weed and frantically started trying to devise a way to get out of my negative income & move forward with my career. I think the panic pushed her away, because she told me we should ""just be friends"" after a month of the honeymoon phase. This happened 2 weeks ago.

At the same exact time, a friend from the gym hooked me up with a concierge job that pays $20/hr, just enough to cover my bills. The schedule is complete hell, though. 3PM-11PM Mon-Wed; 11PM-7AM Sat-Sun. The night shifts have been driving my body & mind insane. They say they will change my schedule soon, but I don't know when exactly. The good part about the job is I do literally nothing at the front desk computer the whole shift, so I can write posts like this and plan out my life and apply for job.

I don't know what to do. I'm really hurt over the girl and it's insane that she's even the reason I quit weed and finally started to ""wake up"" about my life situation, it really exposes my messed up priorities. I think it's from my mom. But I can tell I'm more alert & motivated to do something than I ever have been, for better or for worse. The problem is, I literally don't know what to do in life and I'm drowning in bills at my apartment. I really, really don't want to move back with my dad. He was making me pay for rent anyways ($500/mo).

I was thinking about reapplying for Communications Coordinator/similar positions since this time around I think I can really take the job on full-time. But I have no idea how to explain my scattered resume, the fact that I haven't been able to hold a full-time job for longer than 6 months max, or anything else. I feel so screwed and ashamed, I'm 25 and scrambling for an entry-level job that I'm not even sure I can get without lying like crazy on my resume and stretching employment durations WHILE working a full-time job that's annihilating my body&mind. And I don't even know what I really want to do for work. The shifts might get better, as my boss says, but I don;'t know. I feel like I'm drowning in life with nowhere to turn to.

Worst of all, student loans are about to be unpaused. And I haven't paid a penny,

164yepq,Underpaid and Overwhelmed. Advice Appreciated.,"Background: Hired in Oct 2022, coming up on one year soon. Hired as a Marketing Coordinator/Director under the VP of Marketing. VP left the company in November 2022, leaving me to fill his role. Since I was only about a month into the job at the time, I did not ask for a raise or any additional compensation. (big mistake, but that's for another time) anyways I just took over his duties. ALL of them. I am overwhelmed, and HIGHLY underpaid. He told me how much he was making, and I am making 1/4 of what he was making, since I was originally hired for different duties. Also I am a female. I want to state that I love my job, my duties and the people. 

BUT....

I am grossly underpaid for the position. I am busy 10-12 hours a day, and I am needed by ALL departments. I am always pulled in all directions, and everything is a priority. I'm designing, coding, writing, posting, delegating, traveling, managing, etc. The C-suite knows this, and got me an intern. My own intern. I don't want an intern. I didn't ask for an intern and did not know that I was getting one until yesterday when she showed up. 

I need to be paid fairly for the work I am doing. I have not brought this up with anyone because I wanted a backup plan first, i.e. have a job lined up before talking to C-Suite. 

Here is where it gets good... I am the sole planner/organizer of a MASSIVE event that we pay \~$300K every year to host. It's coming up in about 2 months and I'm super busy because of it. Not one person in the company has the ability to know what to do and plan this with all of the details if I were to leave. They could pull it off and show up, but it would be hectic, poor execution, and things would be missed and forgotten. I am the go-to person for this, when someone has a question about it - it's me who gets them what they need. I am not trying to toot my horn and talk about how important I am, I am just trying to paint a picture of how much responsibility I have regarding this event.    


Now here is my dilemma and where I need advice....I received a job offer. $25K more than my current salary. How should I approach this with my current job? Ideal situation would be I want to stay at my current job, but for a fair salary. I do not want to leave jobs for the higher pay.

Do I.....  


* Tell them about it an ask them to match it?
* Don't tell them about it, mention my role has increased in duties but not pay.. basically bring up everything I'm doing vs everything I was hired(paid) to do. Threaten to walk if they don't agree or we are not on the same page (by 'threaten', I mean professionally, I just don't know what word to use) this is the position I wanted to be in all year, was to bring up my duties and pay but not until I had something in my back pocket like this job offer. Goal would be for them to agree and increase pay $25-30K.   
I can either never mention the job offer or mention the job offer if the convo doesn't go in my favor... ? Which one?
* Something else or other advice?

&#x200B;

Follow up question: I do know, that if I stay for any reason, I will need something signed that they will not let me go after the conference. What if they match the job offer or agree to increase my salary, then I decline that job offer, then they let me go after the conference? **How do I communicate this specific concern with them professionally?** 

&#x200B;

Sorry this is so long. Thank you everyone.

164y3o6,My coworker physically inserts themselves in conversations,"Am I being irrational about my new coworker physically inserting themselves into conversations? I have worked at my current job for 5 years. This coworker started about 3 months ago and straight out of college. Other coworkers or myself will be having conversations (work related or not) and the coworker will roll their chair up to the group and start listening to the conversation, sometimes adding input. I think they have FOMO or trying to hear everything that's going on since they're new but that is an annoyance that I can get over.

I will be working on a personal project or a task that pertains just to me at my desk. My desk is right beside them and if they see that l'm investigating, trying figure something out or briefly asking my boss a question, they will roll their chair up next to me and start looking at my screen and just sit there. I politely asked if they needed something and they said ""No. I'm just nosy"". I understand they might be curious on what l'm doing and want to learn more, but the action of physically inserting themself in a conversation that they know nothing about (and don't really need to know) is what drives me up a wall. If they wanted to learn or are interested in a conversation or task that might pertain to them, I feel like maybe politely asking to show them or after the fact say, ""Hey you were talking about XYZ either, what was that about?"". I am more than willing to show them to have them learn.

A couple of weeks ago, I was asking my boss a question about my project at my desk. My boss was trying to answer a question that I had and they rolled their chair up to my desk and started looking at my screen. This wouldn't bother me so much if they had a resolution or any helpful input but that's not the case. They briefly heard something that they kind of knew about from college, and started spewing out information that I already knew (bc we have the same degree and was doing prior investigations).

164xvtg,Interviewing for new role while transitioning to full-time single parent.,"After months of rigorous job applications and interviews with various recruiters and hiring managers, I am finally feeling optimistic about a particular role that may lead to a potential job offer. 

I currently find myself in family court, engaged in a custody battle for the physical custody of my 11-year-old child, who will soon be starting school. At present, I have visitation rights towards the end of the week. My current employer has been supportive in allowing me to leave early and work remotely, one day of the week plus Fridays designated as work-from-home days. This arrangement enables me to fulfill my parenting and professional responsibilities on those two days when I am caring for my child.

In the coming weeks, there is a possibility of me transitioning to a new job role while simultaneously taking on the part of a full-time single parent for the first time. This shift would entail caring for my son from 2 days a week to 5 to 7 days a week, entirely on my own. While I am eager for this new chapter and the opportunity to spend more time with my child, I admit to feeling uncertain about effectively managing both aspects. My daily commute takes about an hour each way, which poses a challenge as most after-school programs conclude by 6 p.m., but my role entails that my work hours typically extend beyond 5 p.m.

I am enthusiastic about embracing the role of a full-time single parent and dedicating more quality time to my child. However, I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge my apprehension about effectively juggling these responsibilities while striving to excel in a new professional setting.

As I navigate the interviewing and hiring process for a new job opportunity, I am curious about the appropriate time and manner to discuss these familial circumstances. Would it be advisable to share this information once an offer has been extended, or would addressing it earlier in the process be more suitable? Your insights would be greatly appreciated",East0pposite,1,1.0,1,1693351107,2023-08-29 23:18:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/164xvtg/interviewing_for_new_role_while_transitioning_to/,8,2023

164x4cr,Applying to a company I was fired from?,"In 2016 I was fired from a company where I worked as a retail sales consultant. I wasn't a terrible performer (but also not the best), but during my tenure there I came down with some medical issues that resulted in my being in and put of the hospital. 

I hadn't worked for the company for a year yet, so I was ineligible for FMLA protection, and I never missed enough time to qualify for short term disability (I was missing 3 days here, a week there, etc) but I always had documentation of admittance to the hospital/notes from the Dr, etc. 

Ultimately I got better, didn't miss any time for about 6 months or so, but was let go due to all the time I had missed. 

In the time since, I've reenrolled in college, moved states, and plan to graduate next year with my BS in Finance. 

While looking for internships, I noticed that this company has a few of them in their finance department at their headquarters office in my city. 

Is it even worth applying to these internships? Should I write off working for this company forever, as getting fired from them in the past has probably stained my reputation with them? Should I slap in an application, but not get my hopes up? Or has it been long enough since I was fired that I probably have just as much of a chance as anyone?

I got a contract job offer from a third-party recruiting company and have accepted it. My first day is going to be sometime next week.

I have already accepted the first offer but it is a 3 month contract role and it starts next week. But the other role is a 6 month contract with higher pay, and a lot more related to my field of interest/study. I told the second recruiter that I would get back to her at the end of the day if I want to continue with the process and proceed for an interview because I did not want my name to be flagged or something. Both are contract-to-hire or extended role positions (second recruiter did say people get hired full-time at the end of the contract 90% of the time) I would obviously pick the second option if they were different companies but I am just afraid that it would be portrayed as a red flag or a snake move if I they find out that I withdrew from the first job offer as it’s within the same company… Should I just go with the first (3 month) and see if I can get hired to a different department internally…?

164uzoz,13 years in event operations/event management. Now what?,"Since I was 16 years old (now 29F) I have been freelancing in the events industry across Australia, but I’m feeling very lost on what to do next. 
It works that event companies will reach out and ask if I’m available to execute an event.
Pros:
- Flexible work and low stress work
- lots of fun and great way to meet people.
- great network and can pick the work I want to do, managerial role usually so higher pay.

Cons: 
- The pay has been very consistent over the years and can’t see myself going up from here (besides taking on a more stressful role).
- I don’t have any qualifications, didn’t go to uni.
- Climbing the ladder to an event producer would mean being chained to a desk, I love having flexibility of desk/on-site and lots more stress.
- I work really well with routine & want to enjoy weekends (which is mainly when events are on).

I started studying Project Management with College of Adult Learning, but found the course VERY difficult in terms of the layout and support. Never going to uni and always wagging school means my persistence to study just isn’t there. Plus I don’t know that I really wanted to do this. I don’t know what a project manager does. I think I’m afraid to loose the fun, glamorous, hardworking ops roles that I do now. But also don’t want to grow up and grow in a career. What is wrong with me?

164uag9,Am I being a baby?,"Background: I am a relatively young senior exec at a PE-back company. I was hired to lead all middle- and back-office business functions for a rapidly growing company. Division leads are P&L owners and report to my boss, the CEO. I do not own a P&L but have been introduced as the COO.

A month after I joined as the ""COO"", one of the largest P&L owners was fired by my boss without a plan for who was going to lead his division. After a month of floundering, I volunteered to lead the Division until a replacement was found. That stint lasted almost five months. In that time, my boss did not think to mention to the investor board that I was filling in as the Division-lead so I at one point found myself at a QBR reporting to the board and they were dumbfounded that I didn't have deep detail on the goings ons of my regular role. That had been my first interaction with them so I was surprised that they were surprised. After that call, I was convinced I was going to be fired. Afterwards, my boss told them that I had been filling in and they apparently said they did a mental reset on what I should be up to speed on. I don't believe that is possible, but oh well. 

So after filling in as the Divisional-lead for five months, we hired a backfill and I transitioned back to my ""COO"" job. While I had been gone, all of the business function support had really taken a turn for the worse. They had been bad before I stepped away and then we doubled in size in five months, so things got considerably worse. 

In my first two months back, I rebuilt my entire team. I fired the underperformers and hired some absolute rockstars. Half of the directors are brand new and a quarter of their reports are new. Fast forward two months and the functional support is getting kudos left and right. Everyone is in agreement that we are moving in the right direction. 

Now I've been back for about four months and my role is changing again. We re-org'd mid-year without changing our people budget but that meant we had to let some of my reports go (one of which I just hired) and in their absence, I am filling in for three of my former reports.  I am almost exclusively a direct contributor and my boss as of the last month has had a nasty habit of emailing my reports directly about stuff that I should at least be cc'd on which is awesome when I learn about stuff from the divisional leads that my reports are working on at the request of my boss. 

I like my company. I like my boss. But I was hired to be an executive/decision maker but find myself almost exclusively doing stuff I did as a brand new consultant ten years ago.  

My worry is that I spend the next three months being a team player and a ""doer"" and again lose touch with my team and in the mean time form other's opinions of me only as a doer (e.g., maker of an Excel model) and hamstring my ability to effectively lead my team once we transition all of my activities back to manager-level resources. 

Pay is decent. I have equity and the outlook is very favorable so that is good but holy shit. I'm sick of being undermined left and right.

The analytics department - where I was then an Analytical Scientist for two years. The role mostly involved analysing data from qPCR tests and contacting patients. Not a lot of data analysis using Python or anything, just excel.  
I have since learnt Python and some linux, modules including Pandas and Numpy. and have a better understanding of Bioinformatics.

What would be your advise for me if I want to move into Bioinformatics?

164qtqk,Struggling to decide on a marketing career path...,"I'm 23, a recent college graduate, and found a job as a Marketing & Community Relations Specialist at a small local regional hospital back in May.  The job isn't bad: there's a wide variety of work I can do, but there's some dull administrative work, and it pays $22 per hour, which is not bad for a first job in the area I live.  Overall, not a bad first marketing job. 

However, I am really struggling to see my career path moving forward.  I don't see myself working at this job for more than a year or two, but I don't really know where to go.  All areas of marketing seem to interest me a bit, but roles like Marketing Project Management, copywriter, Marketing Manager, or maybe even some roles on the analytics/data/research side of things all seem to be the most appealing to me.  All I know is that I want to stay away from sales, graphic design, and video editing; not my cup of tea.  

Really, since I'm young, I want to make the most money possible within the next 10-15 years, and I know I need to work hard.  Also, what certifications would be best for different fields of marketing? (PMP, CAPM, AMA, etc?) Are there any free or low-cost certs out there that are worth looking at too?

164qhsi,"Career Advice Needed, Stay in Current Job?","Engineer Career Advice

I need some major career advice. I graduated college just over 2 years ago and worked at a major defense contractor. My first role lasted about 8 months before I made the decision to switch to something more down my alley. I joined a program where you essentially do 3 rotations at different jobs within the company for about a year each. My first job was doing a lot of computer programming (with a mechanical engineering degree) so I made the decision to join the program and get in something I enjoyed more (and quite frankly, something I actually understood how to do). I really liked my 2nd rotation. It was stuff I knew how to do to some extent and the people were great. I was challenged every day but because I understood the work, it was very tolerable. I was by no means waking up every day excited to work, but I was tolerating it. 

About 1 year into this role, I made the tough decision to move back to my family a few states away. With no remote work being offered, I was forced to find a new role. I am now 6 months into this role and I absolutely hate it. It is not a mechanical engineering job, but there is no computer programming so I figured it wouldn’t be that bad. I was wrong. I don’t understand the work, I have no drive to learn the work, and I have absolutely no human interaction at work. This new job was a smaller company until a year ago when they were bought by the major defense contractor I worked for and it is very obvious. People there are like family and outsiders do not get accepted easily. It’s not that people are mean or rude, it’s just that everyone is so busy that they don’t take the time to get to know you unless you’re one of the people who have been there for years. 

My life outside of work is being affected severely. I can feel how unhappy I am, I am not treating my loved ones right, and I just feel so lost in life. I am no longer part of that 1 year rotation program (that will come into play in a second). I wake up every day absolutely dreading work. I know work isn’t always going to be glamorous and fun, but waking up every day and having to let out a deep sigh because of how unhappy I am with this role has been a tough pill to swallow. 

The easy answer is to switch jobs, right? I am stuck here for at least another 11 months unless I want to pay back my move bonus (which is close to 10k and financially would be a bad decision). And on top of that, I am worried switching jobs AGAIN is going to look terrible on my resume. I have stayed 8 months, 11 months, and now however long I stay here. I am worried employers will see that and point out that me leaving jobs so quick is a turn off for them (and rightfully so, I know it looks bad even considering the rotation program because I did not stay the full year at my previous 2 jobs like the program is designed for). 

I just feel lost. I am unhappy and don’t want to live my life this way. But at the same time, I know if I make another switch it could affect my career long term. This job has made me fully believe engineering is not for me, but I don’t know what else I could do to be happier but also not give up a good paying career. 

Any advice, opinions, etc are welcome and don’t hold back, I am fully aware my problems could be much worse and that I might have to make some tough decisions in this situation. Thanks in advance, any of you caring enough to read all this means so much to me and makes me feel cared for.",colton_zzz,1,1.0,3,1693334335,2023-08-29 18:38:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/164qhsi/career_advice_needed_stay_in_current_job/,8,2023

What was your experience and what did you say in your resignation letter?  
  
I've been working for a very short time in an international company and it's not quite what I expected. Despite apparently having a good work-life balance, learning about the product and my functions is being taught by a girl who leaves before the end of the month. She's been building great documentation and materials but more than half the time I'm on my own, because everyone is busy (the team isn't big) or leaving the company. I have been feeling very disconnected.  
  
In addition there is a lot of disorganization and change. This doesn't seem to impact work-life balance, but it makes me uncomfortable, more than I felt at any other company, in the early days.  
  
I've already given some of this feedback to my manager's manager, but I don't think there's going to be any changes anytime soon.  
  
I declined another offer from company 2 to work at company 1, but when contacting company 2, the job offer is still open so I would have a chance to work for them.

My salary is $46,000 a year with no benefits package. 

Quick searches on LinkedIn show average salary in my state a little under 70 grand with the average for someone in the position for a year averaging around 65k + benefits and sometimes profit sharing.

164njjv,"Can my boss discuss my lack of in office attendance if I have an ADA accommodation ""excusing"" me from it?","Can my boss discuss my lack of in office attendance if I have an ADA accommodation ""excusing"" me from it?

Hi all - 

I live in California and have a comfortable government job. Our fiscal year is July 1 - June 30 and just getting through my performance review.   Last year it was mandated we return to office 3 days a week. I had accommodations for a flexible work schedule and an excuse from working in office due to very valid medical reasons. Late last year I was hospitalized and early this year I was in daily medical treatments for 2.5 months. My performance review was good overall but my boss mentions: 

""Ezra had a steady year overall. Despite his remote work accommodation, not coming into the office too often at the beginning of the year, and needing to work more independently in the first quarter of the year due to -'s leave, Ezra worked to adequately to maintain - Program work. He increased his time in the office over the course of the year,""

It makes me feel really uncomfortable signing off on this when I have an accommodation. I've always been open with my in office schedule. I'm in a very independent role with very little interaction with others. It's very technical and the perfect WFH job because of the independent nature of the job. I conduct site visits but that's on my own schedule as well. When he mentions my lack of attendance earlier this year I was literally getting daily medical treatments. Since those treatments finished I've been coming into the office 2 days a week barring weeks where I'm having health issues.

Great manager and WLB, commute is about an hour but a mix of train and walking so not terrible, could see myself here for a long time except for…. No room for internal growth on current team, internal applications are discouraged heavily before you’ve been in your current position for 18 months, and this place is all about who you know. 

I received a job offer for a senior financial analyst at another large CPG company for $100k, 20 days PTO, and WFH Monday and Friday as well. It would be no question other than the fact that the commute is awful, roughly 50 mins - 1.5 hours (or worse) depending on traffic. The interview process was actually quite short so I’d like to talk with another manger anyway to get a better sense of the WLB there as well as how much support I can expect from my manager.

Given the commute, I’ve pretty much eliminated the offer as a potential (especially as I don’t have a car now and would need one for this position), but I want to know, is that a mistake? Should I consider the position given the pay increase, title promotion, and the fact that given I’m not a super social person at work and the fact that my current company runs on “who you know”, may hurt my chances at a senior position once I do really begin applying internally? I don’t want to kick myself down the road for missing out on a senior position that pays significantly more just because I don’t know everyone as well as the next guy, but at the same time, don’t want to ruin my life with a terrible commute and potentially losing my great manager and WLB.

I didn’t really pay attention when choosing my major and wasn’t really able to focus on building a good resume and skillset when I had the opportunity and before i knew it, I’d graduated. I managed to come out with great grades in a so-so major, but not much else.

I’ve been trying really hard to scrape myself together, and in the meantime my relative went ahead and secured a job for me to help me back onto my feet. At a really big and well known organisation in a prestigious department. They didn’t even interview me or anything, just gave me a nice job. I should feel grateful that the universe aligned to give me a second chance at life but I don’t know how to approach this at all. I know I’m going to walk in there feeling under qualified and paranoid about the entire company laughing behind my back because I’m the princess who got a job through family connections.

I at least wish they made me seriously go through the interview process and earn this.

Every call I’ve had with someone from the company has frankly been overly nice and explanatory at best, a little infantilising at worst (or maybe that’s my paranoia talking). I really want to work as hard as I possibly can and do a good job for those around me, but Im terrified that Im doing an unimaginably horrible thing by accepting this job while people around me struggle to find jobs. Im also scared of how these people are going to perceive me and what they’ll think of me before they even get to know me. 

I don’t know how common it is for people to get jobs through connections this way which confuses me even more.

If you have any general advice for me - about how to approach my first few days of work, about how to deal with my feelings or situations if I get treated differently at this organisation etc. - please tell me. And if you think I’m an idiot or an asshole, please at least go easy on me.",Business_Attorney853,0,0.33000001311302185,4,1693323546,2023-08-29 15:39:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/164ltin/feeling_terrible_after_a_family_connection_gave/,8,2023

I screwed around in community college in my 20s and somehow earned a 2 year degree in biology, which I’ve learned is essentially useless unless I use it as an experience equivalence.
My goal in college was to work for the local government (city, county, or state) to do environmental or agricultural research/analysis (I really discovered a passion for it in school), but I never made it to a degree that would be useful in that. I’d like to go back and earn a higher degree, but am unable to right now. Recently I’ve been looking at job postings on government sites, and I’ve noticed many entry level environmental technician positions ask for data analysis skills (SQL, spreadsheet/database, Tableau and other data visualization). I’ve started the Google data analytics certificate in an attempt to gain those skills.

I received a promotion to be a Senior on my role and I accepted it but, I got mad cause I received the work load immediately but the increase on my salary took 4 months. So on those 4 months I applied to other companies and got an offer for a slightly increase on the salary, over 10% of the salary of my promotion, and this was a position where I would be the team leader for a small team. So I took the offer, the new role on the company is so slow, and I feel I am not learning anything new and  that I don't have a lot of visibility...

  
My previous boss and company told me that if I wanted to go back, I was welcome to cause I was such a great worker, so, now after one year of me being gone, my ex-boss reached out and told me there are a role like the one I left being open soon , that it's mine if I want it, they would match my current salary...  
But I don't know, I am having doubts about it... had anyone gone thru this?

164i9js,Is this job worth it?,"I (44f) started my current entry level administrative (reception) job almost 7 years ago. When I was hired the organization told me it was entry level with opportunities to grow- training, tuition assistance, internal promotions, etc. For the first couple of years I was super happy and optimistic, learning new things and going to trainings. I knew from the start that we were understaffed, but with internal staff support, it didn't affect me too negatively. Things happened and staffing became much more difficult. My requests for training and time off began to get denied. Then covid. I volunteered to be the in person staff member because I hated working from home. I worked practically alone in the office for almost 2.5 years, bored out of my mind. I requested multiple classes/education during that time and was denied anything that was 'outside the scope of my position'. I was told I could pursue education in my own time and with my own money for things outside 'the scope'. Now here we are today and staffing is even worse, multiple people on my team quit, and they reclassed our job descriptions as a 'promotion'..... this was how they re-distributed the work of the people who quit. 
I recently met with my boss again to discuss career growth and geez it did not go well. Almost 7 years of showing up and I am still being told that my best skill is reception. Still told that I can pursue education on my own time, and that would demonstrate initiative to them. Still told that my expectations are too high. 
For context, I prepare and make travel and training arrangements for my coworkers. My organization spends thousands and thousands of dollars to send staff to conferences and classes, gives tuition reimbursement to other staff members, provides career path training for others. It's all about who you know and who your boss is... and what your job title is.
Last bit of context: I get paid very very well. My skill set has not expanded beyond entry level but my pay is actually extremely good. Like gross, good.
So what should I do? I am miserable working at a front desk. I have no schedule flexibility and I am tied to the desk for 8 hours a day, manage staffing and coverage and I am so burnt out. My work relationships are garbage, my self esteem is low, and I basically have no support at work or at home. But I get paid. 
Any advice is appreciated.",darkheartdreams,2,0.75,5,1693315050,2023-08-29 13:17:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/164i9js/is_this_job_worth_it/,8,2023
164hpc4,Working at Amazon with a bachelors degree. Am I settling too hard?,"Lol I feel like I just make chronically bad decisions which is why I ended up here in the first place. All I just want to do is live off of my art (maybe be a freelancers) or have a well paying job to where I can draw but my dream just seems so far away.  
For context I graduated with a Japanese major back in 2018. (Truthfully, even though I majored in Japanese, I was never really good at it and I'm still shit at it). Fast forward 6 months after uni I went to Japan to teach English for about 2 years. My life seemed to be going into the right direction until it wasn't. I came back to America due to some mental health issues and some difficulties I had with a coworker (who seemed like that had NPD but that's another story). I was invited back by my aunt so I could work on my mental health and get back on my feet. But, living with her didn't pan out so eventually I left and found a job at a daycare.  
I worked there for a short while until I found a job (kinda) relevant to my major. I got a job at a Japanese sales company as an inside sale rep. (Honestly I didn't even have use Japanese for this job at all). Just when I thought I was moving in the right direction I got sacked 3 months later for not meeting their expectations by the time my probation period came to an end. This really hurt me quiet a bit I'd say this was my first ""real"" job out of college.  
After that I got a job at the library as a part time assistant. I worked at the library for a bit over a year. Didn't pay anything and was difficult to move up in but it was a peaceful job for the most part. I decided that I would try to go back to University this year for a different degree in Digital Design so I  can go into an Art related career field (which has always been my real passion). Soon before this semester was supposed to start, I quit my job to  work at Amazon. At first, I though working at Amazon part time was an okay way to earn extra cash on the side to help me pay my way through school. I was only going to work there to help save money for car, pay for other expenses, and try find a good internship for a career field.  
Unfortunately my plan A didn't work at all. I didn't have enough financial aid to pay for my tuition this time around and I failed to apply for and grants of scholarships for this semester too.  I have the option to take out a private loan but my student loan debt is already high enough I really didn't want to go that route. Sadly, I had to drop out for this semester until I can save enough money for the next semester. :(  Now all I have is Amazon....  
I guess I can try to still find some type of internship still but it's hard with the hours I work. I basically have no life outside my job working here and I'm starting to feel like a slave. I remember about a week ago I cried at my station when my ""supposed to be"" first day of class came around and I was stuck in a crappy warehouse. I just felt so ashamed a like a failure for not amounting to anything and all of my plans not working out.  
I keep trying to cheer myself up saying to myself that working at Amazon for a short while isn't that bad. They do have a tuition assistance program that I can use if I start school next semester. I only have 1 year left for the degree I was going back for and the tuition assistance would cover nearly an entire semester for me.  
But honestly, my ego still feels shattered working here haha.  
I think about my family's criticism about me aiming to low in life and kind of makes me feel like I'm just a disappoint now.  
Just when I thought I was getting over my feelings at bit something today happen at work. I saw one of my former patrons who I used to help out quiet a bit with their projects at Amazon. They seemed surprised to see me there and lowkey even a bit disappointed (maybe that's how I interpreted it). Made me think that I gave the impress that I would amount to something more but here I am, just a another disposable warehouse worker at Amazon.  
Sorry a bit too much self loathing, I just got off of work this morning recently and I'm really tired lol.  
So after my very long explanation, what can I do to improve my situation? Am I really aiming too low and make dumb decisions? Should I stay at Amazon until I get the tuition assistance money?

I need some help making a decision do I either:

  
A: Go to university and study full time for in BEng Electrical Electronic Engineering - Aston University  (5 Years)  
(The reason why it will be 5 years of study full time is because I have to do a foundation year and one year in the industry work placement).

  
or

  
B: Study part time HNC/D remotely and top up to BEng Electrical Electronic Engineering - Oxford Brookes (6 Years)  
(HNC - 2 year, HND 3 years and top up to degree level is 1 year).  
For some context, I am 21 years old and a technician earning around £30k+ however the reason why I want to enter higher education is mainly because I don't see myself working in this particular role for the next 40+ years of my life and this job seems to have a shelf life; Ideally I would want to work in electrical engineering sector due to my own particular interests.  
I have listed the pros and cons for each option A and B - I would like a second opinion.  
Pros for option A:  
\- Have full access to universities equipment for labs e.g. oscilloscopes, CAD software, soldering stations and 3D printer for personal projects.  
\- Year in the industry placement this would benefit by giving me experience in my field and strengthening my CV.  
\- Networking with university and other students.  
\- Group projects and getting involved in university events to broaden my experience.  
Cons for option A:  
\- £9250 per year excluding the placement year.  
\- If I fail a year, I won't be able to get funding (four year SFE funding?).  
\- Always playing catch up with students that have done A-Level content before.  
\- Commuting to the campus (25 minute bus ride).  
\- Time consuming considering it is full time study - will be 26 when graduating.  
Pros for option B:  
\- Courses are a lot cheaper and minimal debt.  
\- Flexible and remote learning.  
\- Able to learn at my own pace.  
\- Mainly assignments and marked on pass, merit or distinction.  
\- Course is IET accredited (EdExcel).  
\- I can work full time and dedicate after work or weekends to study.  
Cons for option B:  
\- Not traditional route, application may be sneered at employers.  
\- Self studying.  
\- No access to practical labs or equipment.  
\- No placement year (experience in field).  
\- Unable to network with other students.

164go2i,I need help...,"Hi Everybody :)

I'm a 22M from Australia. Straight out of high school I studied physical therapy (or physiotherapy), and I'm about to finish the degree in a couple months. Problem is, for the past year all I've wanted is to do a different degree. I can't stand PT. I find it pretty mundane, and the lack of career growth once you're qualified scares me a lot.

I want to do a masters degree in something different. I am quite interested in medical devices/biomedical engineering/business. A uni in Sydney (UTS) has just released a new double degree: Masters of Science (Biomedical Engineering) / Masters of Business Administration. Would this be a good degree to do if I wanted to transfer to the medical device industry? Am I stupid for doing a degree like an MBA with no background work? 

Additionally, I could do a Masters of Science in Medicine (pharmaceutical and medical device development) at university of sydney. 

Ultimately, I just don't want to be a PT. I stuck through this year so I could get the undergraduate degree, and then can opt to do a Masters in something else.

Any advice would be so appreciated. I've been really struggling with this.

164g6c0,Advice for career progression,"Hi, 
Would really appreciate some advice of what I should do as I seem a little overwhelmed. I’m based in UK have been working for a company since I was 19 (22 currently) I work for a small business (less than 10 employees )and started off serving customers to understand the business for about a year. I then suggested that we should have an online website which I would create and run and they were happy to this as the company needed to grow and they had no online presence. I set everything up and now 2 years later I have created a online brand with over £30,000 per month in revenue which stated from nothing and is continuing to grow. Although the business is doing well I do take on a lot of responsibility which I am fine with everything from website maintenance, accounting, order fulfilment and everything in between.

The problem I’m facing is that I would like to go out of my comfort zone as I feel I’ve gained enough experience and the company I work for is a family run business so I don’t really meet a lot of new people. I’m looking for more of a career would love to move abroad for a year and really get out there. But working in the UK is also an option. The pay is decent but have been promised ‘bonuses’ in the future which doesn’t seem like the best way to motivate someone. I’d have to sacrifice a few things such as being able to start when I want as I get all my work done everyday anyway. Any advice on what to do, where to look or if I should just carry on with what I’m doing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",canthinkofaname124,1,1.0,0,1693309426,2023-08-29 11:43:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/164g6c0/advice_for_career_progression/,8,2023

I work in IT for a tech company and the constant lay offs, re-structures, lack of social interaction has left me feeling burnt out. After the last lay off I mentally told myself I would need to clock out for my sanity and that’s effectively what I’ve done, I just focus on the weekends, when I can next  take a break, doing the minimum that’s required of me. I am sometimes trying to engage myself in other areas of the business to spark a new interest and not completely waste a year doing nothing but it’s not really cutting it probably because I don’t want to be here. 

I’ve made plans to take 7 months out to go travelling next July. I would like to know from people’s experiences once you’re at that point, when you’ve clocked out, how long can you sustain being in that environment typically? 
Or is one year not too bad when you have a plan in mind?

Additionally I know a simple solution would be just to move jobs for a year but it feels easier said than done and I don’t feel like in this economy I can get paid the same amount if I go elsewhere, I’d prioritise my happiness in this scenario over money if I wasn’t trying to raise funds to travel.",fenris151,4,0.75,4,1693307819,2023-08-29 11:16:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/164fmop/could_you_hold_out_in_a_job_you_hate_for_an_extra/,8,2023

164e4o8,Second guessing my decision to quit,"I recently resigned from a job that I've held for 4 years, it was my first job. While I've received a good appraisal only once due to the constraints of the journalism industry, it's a prestigious outlet and I cover politics – a meaty beat. However, I felt a lack of proper mentoring and meaningful responsibilities. There are two seniors on the beat who overshadow my contributions, and I'm being paid less than my peers. Despite this, I was given a designation promotion, albeit without a monetary increase.

Since handing in my resignation, there has been a change in the behavior of my colleagues and managers. They suddenly seem more interested in keeping me and have even offered better work and increased responsibilities. My notice period is 3 months, which has affected my ability to pursue other job offers. While the main boss accepted my resignation today, I'm starting to second guess my decision. Financially, I'm not very well off and have minimal savings.

I'm torn between giving it another 6 months to a year to see if things improve or taking the leap now. The lack of a promise for a better appraisal is concerning – there's no clarity from my boss on this matter. During a brief conversation, the main boss mentioned that I should have discussed my concerns with them before sending in my resignation.

I'm seeking advice on what to do next. Should I stick around longer and see if things change, or should I go ahead with my original decision to quit? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",clumsyclown101,0,0.5,1,1693303068,2023-08-29 09:57:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/164e4o8/second_guessing_my_decision_to_quit/,8,2023

I have the least experience out of all employees ( about 8 months), I was basically choosen because no one wants to trouble them self of waking up 2 hours earlier and going to work 6 days a week instead of 5, as soon as I was told about this I told them that I will not be able to go on Friday since I have plans for the weekend ,and since the site job requires that I work on Sundays, I told them I also can't go on Sunday aswell.
(So basically 1 Friday and 1 Sunday, not every week)

Keep in mind that the company asks for the PTO request to be 1 week before the PTO date , which in my case was 2 weeks before the PTO date.

I was told that "" we can send someone in your place for 1 day but not both"" and I told them that I usually don't work on Sundays, and I actually needed 1 day, but the extra day basically fucked my plans

I have a friend coming over from overseas, he's just going to spend the weekend so I really need to take those 2 days off no matter what, I don't mind losing my job over it aswell, but would prefer to leave ""peacefully""

164bsnh,Science is no longer rewarding. Industry is soul crushing. What next?,"I'm working as a researcher currently after getting all the requisite degrees two years ago. I'm making decent money, but I've lost all motivation. My research has only really made me believe that the technology can't benefit humanity in any meaningful way. The work itself is tedious, and about as fun as solving a sudoku puzzle at the best of times. Academia is filled to the brim with corruption and obnoxious people. I have considered a shift into the industry, but friends tell me it's even worse there - long hours, crunch times frequently, and managers reaping all the rewards. I'm starting to think I just never liked my field (computer science) and that I only ever pursued it because it was the path of least resistance.


It feels like I've devoted too many years to getting all my degreees to just give up now after working just a few years, but I just don't like the work. I like the flexible hours and not having a manager breathing down my neck, but not much else. And even if I did decide to quit, I don't know what my options would be. I can't afford to start studying again. 


What should I do? How do most people switch career paths? Should I soldier on for a few years and save up a buffer so I can try something new? Should I take a risk and start something new from square one? Is this just how working life is for everyone - tedious and boring?

1648x13,Take my dream job or make money.,"I started my career in sales, did car sales, B2B. I wanted out of sales so I started working towards a career change to IT, almost have my degree, have several certs, and had an internship.

This internship had indicated to me they where going hire me full time, so I quit my sales job, and then this company was like ""no we didn't say that"".  


So now I'm jobless, and got bills due. Ended up applying for sales jobs to get an income. I literally took the first offer that provided me with a base pay.

Well turns out I'm pretty good at selling in this market, also right now this market is experiencing a lot of growth and I'm making a lot of money. Also, turns out I'm pretty good at this type of sales.   


Welp, a friend of mine got me a very good job offer esp. for entry level IT, he's really hooking me up. Essentially he's putting me under his wing. The pay is also very good with total comp being $80k for a first IT job its great, I am going be working under my friend who is going be training me up, and wants to accelerate my growth.

But $80k is like taking an $80k pay cut because I think if the current trend continues (7 months so far) I'll clear $160k-$190k this year.   


So if I do this change I'm going lose $80k at least, but the thing is...if I say no to this job I think my friend will be upset with me cause this is a really good offer. Also I do not love what I do, I know I would not want to do it if it didn't pay what it did. I can live on $80k, and it seems like that $80k is going increase quite quickly.

So torn on what I do, so I quit my sales job to take a great entry level IT job that is what I've been working towards or do I risk that dream and make money.  


I will say, when I was in B2B I was making like $75k-$85k and lived decently.",DREAM_OR_MONEY,1,1.0,2,1693285031,2023-08-29 04:57:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1648x13/take_my_dream_job_or_make_money/,8,2023

1647p8v,"I need to leave my job ASAP, but I don't want to screw myself over financially. I need some advice.","TL;DR - the company I work for sucks in multiple ways, is screwing over its employees, and I feel the need to get out now. I have savings and some freelance work in the pipeline, but I need advice on the best strategy for finding another stable job as quick as I can. Please help?

Full context:

The company I have worked for through all of 2023 is in complete shambles. It's a small media company run by one young entrepreneur, who took out huge loans in his partner's name to start the business. I worked there originally as a graphic designer, but am now in their video editing team.

Over the past few months, the company has been BLEEDING money due to a number of problems that have not been sufficiently resolved, and my boss has been almost entirely unwilling to be transparent with what's going on - instead, choosing to make radical changes to the focus and structure of the company, in a desperate attempt to regain his footing.

As a result, people are consistently not being paid on time, I believe NOBODY is getting paid superannuation (highly illegal from my understanding), and those who haven't already left or been fired due to downsizing have grown an extreme disdain and distrust of the boss - I am one of those people. 

I've concluded that this company's closure, due to lack of finances or government intervention, is all but inevitable, and I need to leave as soon as I can, rather than ride it out. Ideally, I want to be resign within the next few weeks. However, the industry (media/film/television) in Australia is small and difficult to find stable positions in. 

I will not be immediately struggling financially when I leave, as I've been saving consistently all year, will have some well-paying freelance work coming up in a few months, and currently live at home. However, the last thing I want is to spend months on end unemployed with my savings dwindling, and not making any significant progression in my career.

What advice would you give to someone looking to find another stable position in a competitive industry? What advantages can I give myself to increase my chances of getting hired again quickly? Thank you so much in advance.

1647ato,do I need to get ahead of this?,"I WFH for a really great company in New York (NOT NYC, the company is upstate).  While I am one of a few locals to our Home Office (I'm 45 minutes away), we are all considered remote workers as we have employees all over the country.  We were  a remote working company long before the pandemic.  One third of my team is not even located in my state - two in the South, two in the Northeast, one in DC.

My partner does not WFH. He has been in his job for two years (it's the job that brought us up to this area from downstate) and the situation at his company has become horrendous. It's a toxic, abusive environment, his boss tries to shield him from the worst of it but it's become untenable. He is depressed, angry, and dreads going to work. It's time to find another job.

I'm fine with him job-hunting because my job is portable (see: employees spread all over the country, four of my immediate department not local, etc). I wouldn't mind getting out of this area because it's a little too boonies for me and winters are brutal.

He's starting to job hunt, has sent out applications to a few places, got a few phone interviews and has progressed to the final stage of an interview process with a company in Philly.  It's not necessarily a given he'll take the job as it would come with a pay cut and title demotion, but it's with a solid company known for treating employees well.

My company has had employees who live in PA in the past.  At the moment we do not (the last one left for maternity leave and decided not to return).  If my boyfriend does take this job I am 95% sure that my supervisor and director won't have a problem with me relocating since I really only pop into the home office once a month for a lunch social for the locals.  (I am way more productive at home.) I am a high performer and well liked at work and receive exemplary performance evaluations.

That said, I am an anxious person.  Even though there's no guarantee that my boyfriend will get a job offer from the Philly company, we may have to relocate elsewhere depending on what the job market bares for my boyfriend.  Do I have an obligation to give my supervisor a heads up ahead of time that I probably will be moving sometime in the nearish future?  I know which states our company is not registered to operate in and those are not states we would care to relocate to.

Or should I just keep my damn mouth shut until we know 1) he's getting a job offer from the Philly Jones 2) that he's going to accept it?  Keep my head down do good work and continue to excel as an employee?  If you were a manager would you want to know this ahead of time?

Some of the issues are judging victims of crimes that I do not know or have never met and I would like to know how I can stop doing this?

When I only look at the crime that has taken place and the number of victims. I am passionate and I find it meaningful to make sure that the proper punishment is given whether that is a life sentence or the death penalty.

However when I start to think about each of the victims in these situations more deeply I start to doubt myself and think that maybe some of the victims were actually bad people. Once I start to judge the victims then my passion and meaning fade away because I start to feel like I might be helping someone who I would consider a bad person.

Like I said I don't know any of the victims and I have never met any of them but when my mind starts to judge who they might be them I begin to feel like I might be helping the wrong people.

I would like to know how I can stop judging victims I have never met and I don't know? How can I just look at the crime and the number of victims and think about the proper punishment without judging the victims.

Like I said when I don't judge anyone and I just look at the crime and the number of victims I do find it meaningful and I am passionate about making sure the proper punishment is given.

However it is only when judgement comes in that it gets confusing and messed up.

16463ft,"Not sure what to do, psychology / social work","I got a bachelors degree in psychology, minor in statistics, and am currently a year into a Masters in social work program. I have a very good GPA.

I do not feel like I fully thought this through. I feel like I just chose it because it was the logical next step to a psychology degree. Once I actually got a job as a case manager, and experienced what it’s actually like to work in the psych field, I’m not so sure I like it. I’m not as comfortable with the very people-based, emotional aspects of the job as I thought I would be. At all. I am not a very emotional or talkative person. But I am sensitive, and some of the things you see in social work are not things I am sure if i can handle every day of my life. I would much rather work behind the scenes. 

I still want to get a masters degree, but I wish I had chosen communications, journalism, or English, so I can do a job involving writing. Writing is something I know I am good at, and which I really enjoy. I would like to do something in entertainment journalism but I’m not sure if a psych degree is something they would accept for that kind of job. 

Like I said, I am 1 year into the MSW program, which is 3 years total, part-time program. I have been paying out of pocket but I’m not so sure it’s worth it anymore. The school is great, I have learned a lot, but I really don’t think this is what I want to do with my life.

I returned to school earlier this year, knowing my lack of education hurts my prospects. For practical reasons, I chose a degree pursuit based on what I know rather than what I'm passionate about. 

I live in the Rust Belt and cannot move for my family’s sake. 

I desperately wish I could move into a managerial role, even as I doubt my ability to manage other people. 

I'm passionate about government and politics, but hate both parties and have met enough politicians to know none of them cares about the public good. I'm also a terrible liar, and far too direct. 

I've passed my midlife crisis, and now I'm reflecting on where I am, unsure of what to do. I have about 25 working years left, and am so in need of inspiration that I'm turning to Reddit for ideas, knowing I'll get hammered for it.",JackalopeJunior,1,1.0,1,1693275927,2023-08-29 02:25:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1645ua0/i_know_where_i_am_where_do_i_go_from_here/,8,2023
1645kg6,Interview tips for person with criminal record?,"Hello! Hoping to find any advice guidance on this, thank you! I find myself back in the market looking for a new career. Unfortunately, I was recently impacted by the wide tech lay off within my org. Fortunately, I’ve been landing interviews and been moved onto final rounds without no selections and it is really becoming exhausting. In all I’ve been final listed 2x, ignored/no communication 2x and currently in the process for 3 other companies/orgs with one being a final round. I think the reason for landing these interviews is due to my  impressive resume, along with backgrounds and interests for all the jobs applied. I’ve managed to passed on phone screens along HR rounds but always failed to pass panel. 

I do have a misdemeanor conviction. In 2018 while In college, I pled nolo contedre to misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance. However there is also an article of the initial arrest along with the allegations for the arrest showing (14 felonies). All of these charges were dropped/dismissed and I  received 12 months of probations for this charge and attended drug counseling, for which I successfully completed. I made a mistake, but I have moved on with my life. I have worked hard on moving forward with my life in a positive manner. I’ve obtained my BA/ MA and have strived to be an impact citizen. 

Due to the recent layoff; I have recently been successfully of reaching the managing director to update the story to show future employers of the actual disposition to show I don’t have felonies but the article still remain on the third very top. Along with the articles are tons of other accolades and achievesments that’s on the corner of google under my name.

My question for you is how I can be more confident during a panel interview?

How I can own up to this story among panel recruiters? I’ve tried this tactic of being bold and it’s work before but I’ve always struggled with their reactions/lack of interests afterwards?

How can I share my story? / should I not?



I will appreciate any advice/guidance on this: thank you so much",Southern-Start2397,2,1.0,4,1693275197,2023-08-29 02:13:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1645kg6/interview_tips_for_person_with_criminal_record/,8,2023
1644p5q,Micromanagement misery,"I have 7 yrs experience in marketing as a coordinator or manager. I've redesigned 3000 page websites and done all sorts of digital and traditional marketing. I've been at my current marketing job for 6 months now. It's me and another lady. She's the director, I'm a manager, and it's just the 2 of us.  
  
Right after I started she acted threatened by me, even though I'm assuming she made the decision to hire me. Immediately she began micromanaging me. At the time I didn't realize what was happening because I was new, and training and micromanaging can look the same.   
  
She told me to copy her in on every email I sent.   
  
She hovered over every project I worked on and wanted to be involved in the tiniest details of everything.  
  
She would come in and overcomplicate every project to the point where it was no longer viable.   
  
She was constantly concerned over details that weren't important.   
  
She would constantly ask for updates or redo my work for me.   
  
A specific example:  
I'm supposed to answer customer complaints online. This should be typing a sentence to a customer, done. Instead, she came in and made me send a template response (that she wrote) to her to approve for every single customer. When she approves it I can send it to the customer. Then the customer needs to email us their contact info. Then I need to give this to a district manager to call them. So I'm not even allowed to choose between two template responses she wrote to automatically reply to a customer, I have to get every single one approved through her. When she was too busy to approve the comments, the customers waited for a response for a week, two weeks, and even 20 days, until the CEO found out and asked why customers weren't being answered. All of this was convoluted and unnecessary. I know how to type a sentence to a customer.   
  
Part of my job title is 'social media manager'. I've been here over 5 months and haven't launched a social media plan with regular posts yet because she won't let me. I've posted occasional things that she rewrote and picked at. I think I only posted one thing that was my original writing and picture. The company's pages are dead.  
  
She had me send her a social media plan over and over again, changing the months as the months went by and resending it to her. Recently, she asked me to send her yet another plan. I sent it. She said it looked good but that we should change things, add things, subtract things. She was trying to redo everything again. At that point I just stopped pretending all was well. I asked her when she was going to let me post on social media. I pointed out it had been 5 1/2 months. She acted scared and caught and started giving a bunch of excuses. She was too busy. The company wasn't ready.   
  
I asked her why she wasn't letting me do my job in general. She said it was because I didn't do it correctly and gave the example that I'd suggested telling a customer ""sorry"" for a customer review when we shouldn't admit guilt as a company. But the way I'd suggested saying sorry wasn't wrong. She was pretending that I'd messed up in a meaningful way when it actually wasn't a big deal so she could have an excuse to micromanage. So not only was she not letting me do my job, she was implying it was because I did something wrong, when in reality I've worked very hard for the company.   
  
I got upset and asked what was wrong with her. Why was she acting like this? I said she was bringing personal shit into the workplace and that she had such a need to be relevant and important that she couldn't just let go and let me do my job. I didn't word it professionally, but at that point I was done. Something was wrong in this woman's life and she was taking it out on me.   
  
I got up and left, and the next day I contacted HR. I've been in the workforce for 18 years, full time, with no breaks, and I've never contacted HR before this. But it turned out she contacted them first and said I'd called her crazy. She denied being a micromanager at all and played the gentle, caring victim. HR acted like I was in the wrong and needed to apologize to her, and tried to reduce my issue, like I wasn't being micromanaged. HR said she worked 70 hours a week and that I'd been rude to imply she didn't work hard. I realized they didn't know she didn't work much because they weren't in a room with her 40 hours a week like I was. She likes to create the narrative that she's busy and important, but it's a bunch of fluff. I saw how little she did because she spent a lot of her time tagging along with my projects and doing them after me, probably because her marketing skills seem expired and she doesn't have technical skills so she can't do work on her own. She wants to sit on a perch and oversee, but there's no team to oversee. It's just me.   
  
Next she and I met with the CEO of the company and HR. The CEO also acted annoyed and he, along with HR, tried to reduce my problem again, acting like it was just training, probably to protect themselves. They did say that now that I've been here for 6 months I need to be able to do my job and that I can be given more freedom to just do my job. But he said we need to work this out on our own. I need to have freedom to do my job but she needs to direct. How am I supposed to work things out with this lady when she doesn't seem ok? She seems like she doesn't have much going on in life so she makes work her life. She seems incapable and insecure and she's taking it out on me by being a bully and a picker, and doing it covertly so nobody else knows.   
  
The sad thing is I like the job otherwise. It's a great place to work and I like the projects and the pay is nice. It's just her. I don't know what to do other than quit.

1643bq1,"33 years old, tired of the tech industry. Where should I go next?","I work as a SWE at an internet company -- it pays OK, but I'm sick of it. I don't like the work. It feels like I'm making garbage apps that no one cares about, and doesn't make the world a better place at all. I see so much tech being made to sell useless and wasteful products. Maybe I'm burned out for this industry, or burned out on dealing with corporate bullshit.

My salary is $105k pretax, $75k aftertax. I have enough savings to take a break. Then I could keep job hopping in tech, but I'm sick of the whole industry. I have skills in SWE, software product management, and some software product design. But I don't really know what I want to do with these skills, or if I should leave them aside for now and do something else entirely. I feel like I want to make a career pivot, but have no idea which direction to go to.

I'd like to know if there are any other industries that might not be exactly tech but could use my kind of skills, even if I need to take a lower salary. I'm open to totally different industries or totally different kinds of employers (nonprofit? government?), and open to moving around the country. I've been in the tech scene for too long so I feel like I don't even know what's outside of it.

Has anyone else been in this position? Or does anyone else work in a field that uses similar skills as mine but is not strictly in tech, or is in tech but actually feels like making positive change in the world?

1640lgd,Advice needed recent college grad 22M,"Looking for advice on a career change (is it too soon?, or how do I figure out what I like? Is there anything that suits me?)

Background:
I started at my job in may of this year, it was the first job I landed after graduation and was able to start 2 weeks after. I graduated with a b.s. in kinesiology.  I schedule at a home health agency, where I’m in charge of recruiting and “management” in addition to scheduling everything. I’ve been there about 4 months now and I’m honestly starting to hate it. I’m conflicted because some of the things I dislike are due to the life change ( 9-5 schedule, limited time off, etc) but I’m starting to dislike job related aspects. I feel like I’m in a no win situation every day. Nurses get paid 15-20 dollars more at a hospital than our agency so it makes it hard to recruit and keep nurses. I honestly enjoy the recruiting aspect of this job. I hate getting all of the blame when i can’t control how many nurses leave or get recruited in a specific month. I dread anytime I have to talk to a parent on the phone because 9/10 times they are pissed and upset they aren’t fully staffed. I think my boss is nice and somewhat supportive but as middle management he gets a lot of uncontrollable expectations that inevitably lead to more stress for me. I hate that everyone expects so much of me but are unwilling to help out. Nurses, family members, my coworkers, the company itself. All expect perfection when I’m simply the middle man between all parties who gets screwed every time one of them does something that hurts another group.

Advice Needed:
I’m conflicted because it’s my first job and I don’t wanna leave too soon and I don’t know if this kind of stress is just in every job. I also feel like my company has a lot of redeeming qualities. There’s a lot of growth potential if you can stick around long enough (2 years or so) but I’m just not sure this is the type of work I’d want to do anyway. I enjoy that this job is challenging and I think at the end of the day what I’m doing helps medically fragile children, which feels good. But it’s getting to a point where I dread going in everyday, and hate everyone involved. I’ve worked a couple different food service jobs in college and high school, so I have working experience. I didn’t hate those nearly as much as this job. I’m stressed about leaving too as my student loan debt isn’t cheap and I’d estimate I’d need about 45-50k to live comfortably rn. 

I want to try something different at this point in my life but I’m scared leaving so early will look bad to potential employers. I’ve been curious in trying something in hr or medical device sales/ training but im open to trying anything. 

TLDR
Recent college grad worried switching jobs this early will look bad or be something I regret. Not sure what type of career to consider but I like interacting with people (when it’s in a more positive way), having variety in my day to day, being mostly in control of the result of my work, preferably in the medical field.",throwaway2001psu,1,1.0,1,1693262537,2023-08-28 22:42:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1640lgd/advice_needed_recent_college_grad_22m/,8,2023

I have two deputy directors (DDs) who only do the work on my team (let's call it widgeting), and a department head, let's call him Conan, who oversees widgeting and a few other teams. It's a large department with more than 50 people so Conan has a lot on his plate. There was a change in leadership last year and with that came a great deal of firings and other turnover. Conan came in with the new regime, the other two DDs - DD1 and DD2 have been there a while. Let's call the three of them ""the Triumvirate."" Conan came out of the widgeting field, so even though he's responsible for 4-5 other teams - two of which are also very big - he dedicates an inordinate amount of his time and attention into the widgeting team. The widgeting team is also short-staffed due to the turnover, so we have to work longer hours than ever before.

With Conan has come a great deal of micromanaging. Before, we could send distribute widgets without either him or an DD signing off on it, so long as it was approved by the person that had asked for it. Now, it has to be reviewed and approved by one of the three DDs before it can be distributed  - in addition to the person who asked for it and other persons involved. For big things, I need buy in from all three. I wouldn't have a problem with this, but they don't respond quickly. Only DD1 is good about getting to me in a relatively manner, and even with DD1, I have to remind them at least once or twice when things are busy (DD2 is lazy). The way things usually work is I send them something, it sits idle until I ping them (sometimes more than once), and then I get approval hours after I send it. This is especially bad when there are long-term projects that require the attention of the entire Triumvirate, or work-related trips that require all three of them to attend.

Essentially, they insist on micromanaging my work, but when it comes time to actually do the reviewing/approving AKA MANAGING, they're hard to get ahold of (it's not just me, this policy is in place for everyone in the department). I call it micromanaging without micromanaging. Sometimes I ping them multiple times before I get a response. Furthermore, I think the micromanaging has led our team to fall short in other regards. We've been short-staffed for 18 months, and even though we've posted jobs, there are hardly any new hires because they aren't recruiting, interviewing, etc. There are also people like me, who are extremely busy, and other people who aren't busy at all, because nobody is managing workflow.

This is making job incredibly frustrating and difficult. The hardest part about doing widgeting at this org isn't doing the work, it's getting everyone to agree on one thing in a timely manner. This wasn't easy before this new policy was implemented, but now it's a nightmare. It's creating more work for me because now I have to do my job, harangue my bosses for approval, and harangue the people who asked for the widgets for approval. What's more, the particular widgeting I do is very time sensitive, and if people don't back to me quickly, it creates all sorts of problems.

Recently DD1 told me that moving forward, all widgets will have to be reviewed by 2/3 of the triumvirate. This bad problem is about to get 1000x worse. Now there's going to be even greater bottlenecks and this problem I'm having - being caught between the people asking for the widgets in a timely manner and the triumvirate - is going to get worse. It's having a negative effect on my life - I have more work and more stress because of the non-management micromanagement incompetence of the triumvirate. 

The other thing about Conan is I think he sucks, for all of the aforementioned reasons and more. He also says he's going to do something, but then doesn't make good on his word. He's passive aggressive, arrogant, and in way over his head. He's fired people in the short time he's been here, which previously never used to happen at our org. 

I've been thinking about going to either Conan or DD1, who I have the best relationship with, and tell them that this process isn't working for the widget team and is creating problems and bottlenecks. The problem is, I don't know how to say this diplomatically and non-confrontationally. Please, reddit, help me write a script. And thank you for reading this whole thing.

163yrma,Burnt out and contemplating taking an adult gap year. Anyone have experience doing this and was it worth it?,"I have been working in my current industry (health insurance) for about 17 years, and been with my company (a Fortune 5) for about 16 of those years; I make \~$110k a year without my bonus.  
  
I think I've reached a point of burnout as I'm really unhappy in my role and have no motivation and feel really apathetic. Normally I'm someone that goes out of there way to help, find improvement opportunities, drive change, etc., but over the past year or so I feel like I'm just checking the box and doing the bare minimum required which is not how I operate at all. I've tried taking long vacations, and by week 2 I feel re-energized and more back to normal, but then within 3 days back on the job, I go right back to feeling de-motivated and terrible.  
  
Due to some company layoffs, we are getting a new leader with a terrible reputation. The type that's always out for themselves, not protective of the team, throws others under the bus, and has a reputation for not being accountable and an all around jerk. All of that is only making me feel worse than I already do.  
  
I have tried looking at internal postings which are slim pickings right now and also looked externally. Nothing I look at really resonates with me and almost cringe reading through a lot of job reqs seeing what they entail.  
  
With all of these factors I'm heavily considering taking an adult gap year and resigning from my position. I feel like maybe I just need time a way to rest and recover, then really figure out what it is I want to do. I know I don't want to continue what I'm doing now and don't think I want to work in the same industry or even for a mega corporation like I do currently. I'm thinking of a gap year as a way to really give myself some time to clear my mind, recoup, get more energized, then figure out what I can and really want to do. I feel like with how I'm feeling now, I'd have trouble saying yes to a dream job.  
  
I did a rough calculation and used a figure that's more money than I currently spend a month now, and figured out without touching investments, I could probably survive for about 4.5 years before I run out of savings and stuff if I literally did nothing to pull in any income at all.  
  
Has anyone taken an adult gap year like this and found it was totally worth it? And if so, do you think the amount of money I have saved is enough? My biggest fear is just running out of money or not figuring out what I want to do in that timeframe.  
  
Just looking to hear other peoples perspectives on doing this given what I said above, especially those that have taken a gap year. Did taking a gap year really help you and given what I said do you think that makes sense for me to do?  
  
Thanks in advance for your perspectives and thoughts!",alittlelost316,72,0.9399999976158142,45,1693258329,2023-08-28 21:32:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/163yrma/burnt_out_and_contemplating_taking_an_adult_gap/,8,2023

163yl5o,New promotion but can't fit in with the team -- should I stay or should I go?,"I've been working in IT for almost 5 years as a desktop support technician. A little over two months ago I got a coveted position as a System Administrator in the Cloud Services Team. Managers vouched for me, the pay went up by fifty percent, and I got the prestige and exposure from working with top level department heads and executive leadership.

Let me say that I never oversold myself in the interview. My resume showed, and by my own admission, I was a self-taught IT tech with CompTia certifications earned along the way. No server administration experience aside from what I performed in my own test labs.

They admitted that they too were needing updated training to cover the new cloud infrastructure the organization was transitioning into, and that it would be a learning experience for everyone.

What was my contribution to the team supposed to be? Being a quick learner with a stamina for research and problem solving.

But now I'm ready to quit.  


Most days, the teams is never in the office because they work remotely from home. Each member has his or her own specialty and are reluctant to train. My manager spends most of his days in meetings or assisting on other projects his subordinates are working on, and though he sits seven feet away from me, passes by me as though we didn't know each other (I'm always the one having to initiate conversation).

From what I've gathered, there's a lot of work to be done with deadlines approaching, and the team is actively talking about these projects all the time (over MS Teams), but despite being so busy, I'm never asked to pitch in and help carry some of the load.

Yet I've offered to do so on many occasions, telling my team members that I'm interested and willing to learn and help and asking if there's anything -- no matter how trivial -- that I can do. I've told my boss that I'm a bit lost trying to find my niche and asking for clarification about his expectations of me, but the theme of his response is always, ""we wear different hats and pick up what we can"".

Sure, I've picked up some work with different departments and have done a bit of technical research for my boss for meetings he attends, but it ultimately feels like I was just an adopted child that other departments encouraged my team to take in.

I don't even have a desk. The department is out of cubicles and I sit on a bar stool at a small table. My old coworkers who sometimes move through the floor are curious why I haven't been given a desk, even if it's across the floor away from the team. And while my other team members get a 3-day work from home allowance, my boss is having me wait an arbitrary 90 days before allowing me to have my own schedule.

I don't think this is a breaking-in, trial by fire, introduction. I've been very direct to my boss asking him about how I'm performing; what I need to be working on; what his expectations are; my concerns about fitting in with the team -- but I'm always reassured that nothing is wrong. I'm doing fine.

And as far as access is concerned, I'm obviously trusted to perform my own work without oversight. 

An analogy would be like saying I've been given a spare set of keys to the family car and a little spending money to see me through -- I don't have access to the checking account, but I shouldn't have anything to complain about either. In other words, I've been given some good IT Tools to work with as I see fit.

The problem is that I'm filled with anxiety. I'm not asking for micromanagement -- I prefer my autonomy -- but I'm the type of person that needs a mission; a clear objective that needs to be reached. Give me that and I'm a laser beam cutting through steel, but without something to aim at, I'm not sure where to put my energy.

Technology is too broad a field to try to absorb without direction, and I feel that I'm superficially jumping from one topic of study to the next, trying to anticipate what I might be asked someday to work on. But no one seems to care what I do.

Advice I've been given is to:

* Just stay quiet and collect a paycheck. Do the bare minimum and enjoy the perks.
* Be more proactive and make your own work. If they don't care what you do, do what you want and make a name for yourself.
* Move on. You're not going to grow professionally with a team that doesn't want to invest in your training and development. They obviously don't see a need to do so nor value the potential contribution you could bring. The longer you stay the harder it will be to explain on the next job interview how you stayed employed as a system administrator without learning how to be a system administrator -- Go somewhere where they want a hard-worker willing to learn.

What should I do to make this situation better? Should I stay or should I go?

163ygxn,Lost in career and don't know what to do next. Suggestions?,"4YOE, Software Engineer manager in a Fortune 100 company.   
  
Since getting promoted to SWE Manager about a year ago, I've been on the fence about my role. I absolutely love my team, but the biggest downfall is that most of upper management has left so we've had newer (very toxic) management come in. Since then, a lot of teams that I used to work with have been killed off, or have been moved to other teams to which their managers have also been replaced.  
  
Problems:  
\- My new to me manager is constantly expecting status updates daily. What is my team working on. What they're stuck on. etc. I'm fighting with him daily because there's no need for me to breathe on my engineers shoulders because I know they're getting work done and will get it in before or at deadlines and raise problems to me if they arrise. But then he goes on to report me to our director saying that I'm incompetent and slacking just because of no updates. My director(also a new guy) has a 1:1 with me and asks why I'm not providing a daily status, to which he understands, but still wants a daily update. So now, I just look at the JIRA board and just get notes to just post, so that way I'm not bugging my engineers for just an update.   
\- Promo. Before my previous manager left 2 mo ago, he said that he had been talking to the incoming manager to have me promoted because of all the projects I had been leading this past year. Incoming manager told my previous manager that he would definitely promote me. Come to promo cycle, apparently my manager and director completely denied my promo, but to make matters worse, they decided to promote someone they knew, who had only joined a few months prior. This person is a direct report, and has done nothing but do onboarding this whole time.   
\- These new managers have created new teams, to which they're extremely toxic. They're basically the ""my way or the highway"" type of folks, and will yell and scream at you just because you have a differing opinion on implementation or something. I've even had one engineer cry because a tech lead just yelled at her and be littled her.    
\- Meetings. We now have meetings from 8am\~5pm if we're lucky. We're constantly in useless meetings all day because management has the mindset that quantity of meetings > quality of meetings. I'm losing my mind because there literally isn't anything to talk about, yet we'll just sit there in silence just waiting to talk about something, to which it might not even be work related. A single 1hr meeting now looks like 5minutes of the actual topic, 30minutes of random chit chat of personal lives or something, and the rest being some random topics or finger pointing about how someone messed up. And the one time I dropped off call because I thought the meeting was useless, I had to have a chat with my manager because it looked liked I didn't care.   
  
Lost in career:  
I just feel absolutely lost in what to do next. I can't stand staying here another day, but also I don't know where else to go and what to do next.   
  
I love management, but the problem is I only have 1 year of experience as a manager so my resume is constantly getting ignored for management roles.   
I've thought about stepping down to senior eng role and applied to many roles with many positive responses, but with the fact that I've taken a year off of coding, I feel like I'm struggling to get past interview coding problems.   
  
  
I feel like I've lost interest in working but I feel like I'm just burned out 100% due to this toxic work environemnt.    
  
Anyone have suggestions on what to do next?

163yaxd,Thinking of leaving my current company 2nd times,"I am with current company (A) about 5 years. I have been working hard and view as top performer. I shared my intention to get a promotion to management role. However there is no opportunity available and I was tired of waiting plus a new opportunity arise so I left my current company (A) to join company (B) for pay raise and opportunity to further development my technical experience.
While at company (B) things did not go well as I thought regarding project, work life balance and they started talking about layoff so I left company (B) after 8 months and rejoin company (A) for the same position.

Recently I got an offer from company (C) which better pay and potential career growth. 

I just rejoined company A about 3 months however I feel it will take me at least 2 years to build back my case for promotion and get the same pay as C offered.
Only benefits I have with company A is familiarity with everything (workload, coworkers and work life balance). If I take C offered, I could start a new chapter and gain immediate pay raise. However there is a risk with learning new things and might face headwind (layoff) due to current economy.

Please advice what would you do?

163vd6v,"New Job, totally lost","I started a new job recently in a municipal govt facility. I have experience in this job, but with a different city. Come to find out, my new city is much more “proper” for lack of a better term - there’s red tape for EVERYTHING, and almost every single question I have is answered with “we have a policy about that”.

In some ways, it’s nice. That being said, I feel like any experience I had at my old city is useless because of it. Totally new (and irritatingly cheap) software x3 that im trying to learn, I don’t know the policies yet because there are thousands of them in the intranet and it’s a jumble of “policy file name xyz 10.2.2020 _ DO NOT USE” and “policy file name xyz 1.20.23 _ NEW FINAL” or “NEW NEW FINAL” etc etc etc, making it difficult to go through everything.

I’m still trying to even learn how my facility functions, but half of our staff  left either because of school or because they were planning to transfer departments, so I’m running this place on a skeleton staff while still not fully knowing what our daily processes are because im busy trying to learn all the new software while being looped into ongoing projects and doing end of FY processes , and a good chunk of the remaining staff can’t stand each other long enough to implement some of the new procedures the department is trying to achieve.

163u7ln,Would like some advice,"  
Hello,  
  
Just looking for some advice since I am interested to get into accounting.  
  
I am currently a school leaver at age 20 in the UK (highest Education: A-levels with grades ACC) and I am a currently banking customer services at HSBC (full time, btw) . My Shifts are usually in my case: Mon and Fri: 9-5 in office, Tues and Wednesday: 11-8 and Thurs: 11-5.  
  
I got advised 2 options on my last reddit post on the Accounting forum: 1) not fully complete the level 2 AAT qualification and only complete the '' Intro to Bookkeeping'' and ''Principles of Bookkeeping Controls'' modules of level 2, then move onto level 3 and so forth for other AAT qualifications, 2) got advised to do the ACCA straightaway since at some point, you will be doing it anyway when progressing in your accounting career path from AAT.  
  
Question is, which option would probs be best for myself, given my current situation? and if it is ACCA being recommended, can that be doable while working full-time?  
  
Btw, if anyone is wondering why I have not thought of going into an apprenticeship, I have basically been trying to get into an apprenticeship for nearly 2 years and I have not gotten any luck (with myself only getting to final stages in form of assessment centres) so that is why I am thinking of doing the self funding route.  
  
Any Advice is much appreciated and would love to get your thoughts on it.",SimilarDragonfruit19,1,1.0,1,1693248073,2023-08-28 18:41:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/163u7ln/would_like_some_advice/,8,2023
163u6ef,How to transition existing position from in office to remote - USA,"My +1 has to relocate for their job next year. I’ve been with my current employer for 9 years and I would like to continue working here. 

I already talked to my boss about this and they are on board with trying to make it work remote. 

I am an accountant 100% in office currently. We manage the assets of a trust (basically I worked for a rich person who died and now work for the trustees), so we have interest in lots of different businesses and I do all the accounting functions for those where we have a majority ownership interest. Payroll, bank deposits, new hire onboarding, tax return review, legal document filing, irs stuff, nonprofit management—basically everything an in-house bookkeeper would do, but at a higher and more diverse level. 

What are some things I need to think about for making the transition to fully remote within the job? Any advice you wish you had when you first started working remote? 

I have about 8 months to figure this out. I will start by listing out every company I deal with and then list the main tasks with a note of easily remote, something needs to change to be remote, not remotable in any way (hire out to someone local?). I’m also considering doing a hybrid work thing, where I come “home” for 1-2 weeks a month to do anything that I need to be in office for. New location and home will be about a 12 hour drive away.",lei3,1,1.0,4,1693247999,2023-08-28 18:39:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/163u6ef/how_to_transition_existing_position_from_in/,8,2023

163tj3g,"My first job post-grad is a 9-5 contracted position (no benefits, no PTO, vacation time, maximum pay 24k every 6 months, 48k a year without tax). My bosses told me they would offer me a full-time position in Sept. '23 after it gets approved by the city, now they're saying Jan. 24'. Should I leave? A","I am a 24 year old with a BFA in Graphic Design. My current position is a 9-5, M-F, contracted position. I was offered 24k every 6 months and have signed two contracts with this company. I do marketing, design, etc. work in a corporate office. At the start of this job, I was grateful and felt lucky, but now, I realize with taxes and moving out on my own in an apartment, that I am being severely underpaid. My paydays are not consistent (sometimes being paid 2-3 days late due to it being a contracted job) and I am realistically only making 35k due to paying eventual taxes next year and paying out of pocket for not having my own health + dental insurance. I am also getting tired of being forced to come to work if I'm sick or need a mental health day due to the inability to lose $200 not going in to the office.  
  
My mother had a life altering stroke in July of 2022 a month after I graduated college and I took a year off to be her full-time caretaker. I am passionate about graphic design, mass communications, marketing, etc., but feel as if I could be making a better livelihood + getting more experience elsewhere. My work environment is the only thing keeping me at this job currently with a lovely boss, coworkers, and office. I can take lunch whenever I want and can take vacation/absences whenever I want, but the cost of my own pay/income.  
  
Here is my call for advice: Do you all think it is a good idea I leave this job after I make a year (January 2024) and not sign an additional 6-month contract with this company? The full-time position they offer me will be the same pay (I assume) and will include all the benefits I'm currently lacking, but I am tired of waiting for a ""promised"" full-time position. I make 24k every 6 months with their contract and currently am technically making 48k a year, but owe 10k in taxes plus my own expenses. How would you suggest I phrase/write a letter to my bosses that I wish to leave for better opportunities/think I deserve more?  
  
(Side Note: I know there is other work out there because prior to this job I was offered a 52k full-time position, all benefits, same job title and field, but it was an hour away and I could not leave my mother alone.

163sdj6,I lost my passion for my career and have no idea where to go next. Any ideas?,"Having graduated with a liberal arts degree some time ago (an absolute mistake), I ended up in the advertising/comms industry. Being a naive and bright-eyed graduate, I walked through the glass door thinking that my experience would be like Don Draper from Mad Men (BIG SIKE).   
Unfortunately, that romanticized era of the industry was over and I was pushed head-first into a cesspool of social media, digital marketing, and business pitches.   
And early-twenties me loved the chaos of it all. It's a culture driven by young people, you get to represent some of the coolest brands in the world,  glitzy offices that came with always stocked pantries. Plus, did I mention the fun office parties and events? I was 100 per cent willing to work long hours (often overtime till night), I was always asking for more work exposure, and I made a ton of great work friends.  
Fast-forward to many financial quarters later, I became a disgruntled employee who was half dead inside. I was chronically emotionally burnt out and soulless (eyebags now replaced my once sparkly eyes). I started my work day with a long, exhausted sigh, ""let's do this"" turned into ""why do we spend hours changing captions in decks"" and my weekends were spent decompressing because I. was. so. tired. of. everything. But I told myself that I made the right steps in this career, one day I'll regain my passion for it, and that I love my clients (in hindsight, this probably was Stockholm syndrome).   
And then one day I just left it behind. I was free from the corporate shackles and I felt so relieved. In fact, the day after my last day of work I slept in for a solid 13 hours. I no longer needed to trudge through a barrage of Teams and Outlook notifications - everything was silent. That was a nice change for a while but eventually led to so what now?

I know what I am - I'm creative, have a knack for communication and I'm good at problem-solving. I find it rewarding to be able to help others at work. But I don't know what I should do as a job.   
What do ya'll think?

However, our products have become more advanced and now were basically back to square one (reliability issues, customer complaints, escalating rework costs, etc.). This cycle repeats itself every 2-3 years, and I'm asked to submit suggestions for overall improvements and processes for enhancing our product quality and customer satisfaction.

163qfbq,Back From Paternity Leave and Layoffs Coming - Should I Be Concerned,"Have been with my current employer for almost 10 years in various roles, but currently a manager with 10 onshore direct reports and also act as the liaison and onshore contact for our entire offshore workforce (approximately 60 workers).

Earlier this year I was heavily involved in projects relating to my team and not related to my teams, so my day was pretty full.  Then, i went on paternity leave (two sets of time, one for 4 weeks and one for 10 weeks).  Alot of my day to day work transitioned to my assistant manager and a few other folks.

Since coming back the work that transitioned hasnt transitioned back for one reason or another (mainly some automation came through).  Since I have been back I have asked my manager (who was a new manager to me while I was out in the 10 week period) a few times what she wants me to focus on and prioritize and havent gotten an answer.

Going through my emails I saw there is a “market assessment” being done on the company - basically being explained to me as looking at what we are doing and cutting back / layoffs.  My manager doesn’t expect our area to be impacted much since we are the highly profitable side, but we wont know for sure until the end of September.

In all of this, I am a little worried I could be on the chopping block.  I have gotten the highest ratings possible for the past few years on our yearly reviews, but I worry that the team ran so well when I wasnt here (I originally took that as a compliment to my leadership, career growth of my reports, etc) but now wonder if the company can use this as a reason to cut me, and save 20-30k (difference in salary, after bonus, of me and my assistant manager).

Ive gone through a few rounds of layoffs and never worried, and maybe its just summer slowness, but the timing of everything isnt ideal.

163q08w,Mental Health > Money?,"Hey all, I'm just looking for some advice, maybe some insight from anyone who's made a similar career move before.

I'm currently the Director of Marketing for a medical practice where I've been for nearly 4 years. Prior to this I was a DOM for a non-profit for 3.5 years. All in, I'm coming up on 8 years experience in this type of role, and to be honest... I'm burnt out. SO MUCH expectation, so little recognition or, in my opinion, fair compensation for performing well. My company has exceeded its financial goals 3 years in a row (since I started, strange coincidence) and my end of year bonus each year has been $200 cash TOTAL. In my current role, I make $75k before tax and I have WEAK health insurance, but it does exist. I work \~50 hours per week, including our 10 hour work days M-TR. My consistent stress level is at about 7 or 8 out of 10. I've found for the last year or more that I am, largely, not as fun to be around anymore because of how anxious I am constantly feeling over my job...

I've been deeply unhappy in my role and this company for some time now, and everyone in my life has been begging me to leave this place for a long, long time. It's just easier said than done, I suppose. For me, it's been a largely toxic and extremely stressful place to work. The company is also currently struggling due to some C-suite decisions that put a lot of financial stress on the owners. Not my problem, I know, but it's contextually important.

I am *STRONGLY* considering a Sales Rep position at a local merchandizing / production company where my roommate/good friend of 10 years works. He's been there for many years and loves his work / company. I actually love them too, as I've been connected to it all through him for years. I've been told that the starting salary for the role is \~$45-55K + 4-6% commission on sales, which they have plenty of reps pulling healthy 6-figures. The role would be at a much more established and diversified company which exists in the entertainment industry, which is MUCH more interesting to me than the Wellness/Medical space I've been in for years. It would also be MUCH more relaxed and flexible, and I can certainly envision myself hitting and exceeding my current salary. I have solid prior sales experience.

For financial context, I run pretty lean and have relatively low cost of living, so even $45K is workable, not that I intend to live off a base salary.

Do you think that you would be willing to jump ship and take a short-term hit for the peace of mind and more relaxed lifestyle?

163oni8,Job searching is not just sending resumes,"One thing I notice in my friends and family when they are looking for a job is that they just send send send send the same resume as much as possible and to as many companies as possible. The thing is... it doesn't work!  
The best that can happen is yes, you may go to an interview but more than often it's not going to be a great fit for you! It was more just a number game.  
Lots of things can be done to improve your chances of landing a job you actually like. Here's what I try to incorporate when I'm looking for a career change:  
\- Personalise every resume to the role I'm applying for: this means, using keywords used in the role description, metrics, and examples relevant to that role. Also, I try to incorporate some examples relevant to the company culture.  
\- Networking: Networking does not need to be super hard, and yes, it can be done 100% online! Reach out to past coworkers and managers, connect with some relevant new people, and send them a message stating how they might be able to help.  
\- Reach out to hiring managers so they REMEMBER you: After sending a resume, if you can (via LinkedIn ie) write them a message! You don't want to be a number among the other 200 candidates, you want them to remember you. So just write out saying you just applied to XXX role, why you are a great fit, and how you are looking forward to the next steps. The same goes after an interview -> send a thank you email! Summarize the main interview discussion points and I can assure you, they'll remember you more than 90% of the other candidates.  
As doing all of this is a job itself, I created a Notion Job Search Assistant Template to keep everything organized in a single place so that no step is forgotten. It also includes Resume + Cover Letter templates on Notion and you'll be receiving these thank-you messages templates as well. If you wanna take a look at it let me know and I'll send you the link.  
First ones to get it will get a discount!  
Anyways hope these tips can help everyone on their job search journey. I send you all my support cause I know how hard it can be!",bodegalaabs,0,0.5,1,1693235317,2023-08-28 15:08:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/163oni8/job_searching_is_not_just_sending_resumes/,8,2023

163nju3,"My job wants me to lie to customers about us having a functional bathroom, but it's obvious we do and I don't like to lie. What do?","We finally got called out on a review about lying to customers about having a functional bathroom, and honestly it was just a matter of time. Apparently they used to allow people to use the bathroom until someone broke it and it costed thousands to fix, so now the public isn't allowed to use the bathroom. 

The 2 main problems though are that it's very obvious we have a functioning bathroom, it's right in a main hallway where customers are frequently passing by and standing near and they can hear and see us walking out. I drink a lot of water on the job and in the beginning, I used to feel awkward about having to use the bathroom with customers in the hallway but now I don't care because if I have to go, Im going. 

The closest public bathroom is about 7 miles down the road at a gas station. People come for tours and drive hours (up to 2/3 hours) to come see the place, and the last thing they want to do when they arrive is to drive 5 minutes down the road to use a gas station bathroom and put the tour on hold even more. 

Someone finally left a bad review about it because my manager let someone use the restroom after my other coworker lied and told them we don't have one and we use the bosses bathroom down the road. 

What should I do and is this even legal? I haven't lied to a customer yet but I don't really feel comfortable doing it because it feels wrong. I don't know why they don't tell customers ""we don't have a public restroom"" instead of flat out saying we don't have a functioning one lol.",Odd_Guitar1512,1,1.0,1,1693232778,2023-08-28 14:26:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/163nju3/my_job_wants_me_to_lie_to_customers_about_us/,8,2023
163njif,Should I take a huge pay and title cut for a new job post lay off?,"TLDR; If I can live on it financially, is it worth it to take a 40% pay cut and title demotion months after a lay off?

CONTEXT:

I have been fortunate to have a pretty successful career in both title and pay. Only 4 years into my career I was making 6 figures and felt really confident in my trajectory. Fast forward a few more years, I found myself at a tech giant making a LOT more money. I also have 5+ years of management/leadership experience.

As many know, tech has been struggling and I was laid off a while ago. Luckily, I live relatively modestly and had a very generous severance package. I also have the privilege of a  very emotionally supportive partner and parents who are very willing/happy to step in financially during rough times as a safety net. Before I got laid off I also moved from NYC to a MCOL city where there is work, but the industries are very specific and there is just overall way less opportunity, especially as many companies have RTO policies in place now.

There is a company I've been gunning for and I finally got an in on an interesting team that matches my experience and expertise. However, the pay cut would be significant. I care less about the title, but its hard to feel like I'm going 'backwards'. It's decent money by most standards but it would be almost a 40% pay cut from my high paying job. I knew I wouldn't be making big tech money, but was hoping to only have to take a 25% pay cut. Based on competitive research/discussion/experience I think this is fair market value of my candidacy for a role I have a lot of direct experience in. I could definitely live on this lower salary with my current lifestyle but obviously it really interferes with saving/life goals. Its about a 1.5 levels below my last role (hard to compare by company/industry)

This company is continuing to hire and there are some roles that are more aligned with my salary goals, but this specific team is more interesting to me.

Will accepting a job at this level/pay 'set me back' significantly? I don't want pride to get in the way of making money and re-engaging in professional life which I have missed.  How do you 'get back on track' when you do take a pay/title cut? What would you do?  Would appreciate feedback, personal stories, or thoughts on this.

I would ask you to please be kind. Job hunting has been very tough and I know I'm lucky compared to many out there. Seeking genuine advice and looking for help.

163n9vb,Chef looking to transition into new field.,"Hey all,  
  
Quick backround on me: I've been cooking for about 22 years now, chef for the last 8. I've ran high level operations for many different types of business outlets from restaurants, large catering company's, and now I'm overseeing prepared and bakery at a small chain of organic grocery stores.  
  
Before I landed my most recent position (I've been there just over 3 years now), I was really starting to burn out. The current role was something different and required me to build everything from scratch (they didn't even have any documented recipes). Now I'm just bored, and the work is so easy that im worried I'd be too rusty to transition somewhere different. My worklife balance here is unheard of and I make the most I have made in my career so far, but the idea of going back to 60hr weeks just for ""prestige"" somewhere else feels daunting.  
  
My old end goal was to get into privatized consulting, and while I've done a bit so far, I'm not sure I have the steam to build enough clout to be fully independent at it.  
  
I'm really feeling like this is the right time to do something new. Because of my business acumen, I've been thinking about Project Management as it may allow me to still be involved in food but learn a new skill set, but ive also been considering going a step further and doing Data Analysis, learning some new tech platforms and setting myself up for the future.  
  
I'm 37 so starting a new career feels a little daunting. Especially knowing I'd be taking a pay cut for awhile.  
  
Are there any others on here, especially former chefs, who'd be interested in telling their stories about changing careers this late in the game? I'm not interested in trades as I'm trying to get away from manual labor.

163mg2r,Should I quit my job?,"I have a couple questions about jobs in general and am in a pickle. 

For context, I just graduated in May and I very recently got employed by the R&D department at Boston Scienitific on a one year contract. I was really excited about this opportunity because it's a huge company and there aren't many bad reviews. However, I fear that the lab I am working in is not quite the right fit for me. It involves sitting at a desk frequently and barely any time within the lab. I have also only been here for about a week and a half (I got done with onboarding very quick and am almost done with all my laboratory training). 

My question is in your opinions, is it a bad idea to try to find another job so soon into my employment? Should I take more time to truly evaluate my position? Would I be majorly burning a bridge? Is working with Boston Scientific such a good opportunity that I should just deal with the not-good-fit feelings?

163l053,Better paying for-profit job vs. less paying non-profit job,"Hello everyone.


I need to decide between two job offers. 


First job offer is from a non-profit organization. They are a well known, credible organization operating worldwide mostly dealing with refugees. I will be working with the refugees directly. Second job offer is from a for-profit company who is well known in their sector. As far as I can see they do have a good reputation in the sector and positive reviews from current and former employees. I will be working with the customers directly. 


They both offer similar benefits. The only difference is the for-profit company is paying better. Difference is not massive but has the potential to make my life a little better in this economy. My heart is telling me to pick the non-profit organizations offer. I truly want to work for something that really matters. Like, for the first time in my life I believe I could have the ability to change and effect people's lives in a positive manner unlike the for-profit corporate nonsense that they feed you. On the other hand, I am good at my job which can lead to better quality of life improvements in the mid- and long term.

163l000,Unsure if I should take a leave of absence?,"Hey all, I'm in a rough place right now and not sure what to do. Back in March of this year, I was hospitalized for about a week due to life-threatening complications from a miscarriage (I had a partial molar pregnancy and the initial D&C I had in February failed to get everything out. In May, I needed multiple procedures beyond just a D\&C; also received blood transfusions and had to return to the hospital weekly until about May, because there's a cancer risk associated with molars and my HCG levels were scary high when I was hospitalized). 

I informed my direct boss and HR while I was in the hospital about what was going on. HR informed me that because everything occurred due to a pregnancy, I'd be entitled to 12 weeks of FMLA leave. I opted to take one more week off (right after I got out of the hospital) because I was still heavily medicated and recovering from some of the non-D&C procedures and did not feel ready to return to work. I didn't take any more time off beyond that because my company is currently very understaffed. I'm on a team where several of my coworkers have quit/been laid off, and for the last year, I've been a team of one in an income-generating role, essentially doing the work of 3+ people. I've asked my direct boss about backfills multiple times and she always says it's not in the budget right now, but I should just keep doing what I am doing. 

I had concerns that if I took the full 12 weeks off, my direct boss would flip out. And she made some remarks when I came back from those two weeks off (just that she was ""surprised"" that I had taken an extra week off and it was ""okay"" but it was a shame ""my team""—which again, is just me—was now ""behind for the month."") During the two weeks I was out, no work was done on my stuff, revenue dropped by like half for that period, and about a month later my boss' boss, who I have very little interaction with, saw the revenue reports and sent me a message with her CC'd, essentially calling me out for how badly the revenue had dropped for that month. 

My direct boss also did not offer me light duty (her reasoning being, everyone is busy and there's no one else who can do ""my job""), I essentially came back from that ""break"" to a mountain of work and a big backlog, and it took me several weeks just to get out from under that. In the months since, I have continued being a team of one, but my performance has dropped significantly and so has revenue. My direct boss refused me a raise back in July, claiming there was ""no budget"" for it, although a coworker I have (who has less responsibility than me) did receive a raise and told me so. 

On a personal note, I've also been really struggling. Even though it happened in March, my mental health has really declined: On top of the near constant work stress, I am having trouble focusing like I used to. I have insomnia and then restless sleep if I do fall asleep; I feel very tired all the time and very sad sometimes for no direct reason, and I feel almost no motivation to do anything. I also still feel upset over the loss and a lot of medical-related fear now and fear of my body, because even for months after March, I still had to keep going back for tests/etc. 

I started working with a therapist in March who diagnosed me with major depression and thought I had medical trauma. She prescribed me some antidepressants, but then she had to leave her practice due to health issues circa June. It took me a while to find a new care provider, but I started seeing someone at the start of this month (a nurse practitioner who does medication management for a therapy clinic; I'm on a wait list still for therapists there but in the meantime she is treating me). I gave her a copy of my health records from the event and she has started to change my medication in an attempt to alleviate some of these symptoms, because she fully believes I have depression and medical trauma too. She also strongly believes that I should take an extended break off from work because she believes the fact that I didn't take more time off when all this happened is part of why my mental health is now so bad, and she said she believes I should still be eligible for FMLA because it hasn't been a year yet. 

In our last three sessions, she has brought it up multiple times and told me she will write a letter to my work in defense of this, as she believes it is fully linked to my miscarriage/etc. I've told her I'm not sure though. I know it might sound stupid, but I have never taken any kind of extended leave before and I've never used FMLA before (I don't know if I'm still eligible or what that looks like), and I'm also very worried that my boss/job will think this is bullshit because my health event was months ago and not recent. Anyway, I haven't made a decision yet but I have an appointment with the nurse again tomorrow and I know she's going to bring it up and I'm anxious. Reddit, any advice or insight for me? It would be so appreciated.

TLDR: Was hospitalized for a week in March due to miscarriage complications; HR told me I could take FMLA leave for but I only took an extra week off because my company is very short-staffed and I'm a team of one. Mental health has gotten really bad in the months since, and new care provider thinks I should take a leave of absence/FMLA and is prepared to write documentation to support this, but I'm scared and don't know what to do.

163khga,"Expecting an offer, how to negotiate over the phone?","Hello,  


So I believe I have an offer incoming, and I want to be prepared. The hiring manager and I hit it off, and they kind of hinted at ""expect an offer"", without legally being able to say it. My expectation is that the company would call me to tell me their offer and look for a yes or no.  


From prior conversations with the companies' recruiter, they had mentioned that the salary I was looking for(150) was above what they are willing to pay, so I told them there was about \~15k in room.(135-150) and that the 135 is where I'd start to consider a move and 150 you lock me in.  


However after going through the process, there are other benefits I'd be losing 150 is where I'd probably need to be at due to lack of bonuses and kind of weak PTO (which I plan on trying to negotiate too).  


What can I do to help me negotiate a stronger offer if they call and offer over the phone? I'm thinking I would be non-commital and ask for an emailed offer letter, so I can negotiate through email, or at least not have to say yes or no on the spot.

I have had another job since working in retail but I have helped  the visual merchandising team during many overnight floor sets with other sales advisors. I have always wanted a position as a visual merchandiser when working in retail. When I would ask my managers at both the stores I work at and it seemed like they thought I was good at recovering the stores/ the visual standards and basically wanted to keep me as a sales advisor to  depend on me close the store. 

Anyway, I applied for a position as a visual merchandising position at H&M(It says there hiring immediately and I think the job has been posted since Oct 2022 and has been reposted a few times. At the moment my application process is still on “New” and has not been reviewed it’s been weeks at this point. I’m not sure if it’s because I didn’t fill out the WOTC survey or not. I was thinking about calling or heading up to the  mall next week with my resume to ask about my application or to just hand them my resume in person. I’m not sure if it’s a good idea or if it looked at as weird now .

163kcyp,Overwhelmed/overworked and looking for advice,"Hey everyone! I have been working in my field for about 8 years. I’m currently at the top position of my field without actually owning a business. I’m making $70k a year, technically $90k because of my child attending school paid for. What this boils down to is:

-Lack of work/life balance (I’m leaving my house at 6am and not getting him until about 7:30/7:45pm; I do have my husband and two children)
-We attempted to create a schedule for me to leave work at 5pm (would be home by 6:30/6:45pm) but that typically happens 1x/2x a week
-My boss says that “the business is basically mine” and to make all the decisions, that I have no need to discuss with her, but if I do this and there is any disagreement with staff/customers, she constantly questions me and undermines me to change the decision. 
-There is constant turnover and I am constantly having to hire and retrain 
-Although I am paid high, I am technically working my position in addition to 3 positions below me (admissions and finance, HR, marketing)

These are just a few of the frustrations that I am going through. I am feeling incredibly guilty as far as my work/life balance. I don’t get to spend anywhere near as much time with my family as I would like. I feel like I’m missing everything. I’m overwhelmed and overworked. I feel like I miss things because I’m have my hand in so much other work so I’m not doing my job to the best of my ability. We’ve built some of our life around this pay and I am currently the only one working as my husband is starting up a business… I woke up this morning dreading coming into work. I know my heart isn’t in it. My husband is very supportive and understands my struggles but we also understand the reality of the pay and how we can manage our lifestyle and taking care of our family with the pay.

163kcga,How to understand what I actually want to do with my life?,"I have been doing a writing job since I was 21. I am 29 now and I have always felt that I want to do something different, that I have a different calling in life. I feel so confused and stuck up in life. I have changed several companies and at my current place I have stayed the longest - 2 years now. I couldn't be more thankful for all the places I have worked at, I have almost never had bad managers and toxic colleagues, or whatever. Especially at my current place, my team is just incredible - helpful, fun, friendly, my salary is okay  for the country I live in. The office is great, comfy, I have the freedom to take days off whenever I want, no one breathes down my neck as to what/when I should do. It's more than I could ask for. I am really thankful.   
The problem is that I am not motivated. I don't feel like the work I am doing actually matters to me. I don't much enjoy doing it. I have had several ideas about completely changing the sphere I work in but I am afraid of losing the freedom and security that I have now.   


I know it's late but I have thought about moving to Europe to study something else, to get a new degree. I majored in linguistics, now I am thinking of something related to social sciences, humanitarian field. I have thoughts of having my NGO which would be focusing on educational programs for children in remote villages. At the same time, I like doing translations.

  
I did some research on studying in Germany but the whole process seems so 'remote' and complicated, especially for non-EU citizens. Additionally, I have no savings at all. If I quit my job here to go to study in Germany, how will I be able to pay rent and for food? Is it possible to work and study there? I know that education is free there but non-EU citizens have to be a resident. The thought of bureaucracy pushes me back. I hate having to deal with unnecessary paperwork. I don't know what I should do, how can I understand what I really want? 

I am not married. I don't plan on marrying, but there is so much pressure and noise from the people around me that I sometimes think maybe I should just get married and see what happens, so they leave me alone. I am just confused, tired, and scared. 

I took a 2-week vacation last October, went to the sea alone, in the hope to find the answers to my questions, also to process a personal loss that was and is weighing heavy on me. I felt much better after that but as soon as I was back, it was not long before the same feelings came back to me. 

&#x200B;

I feel like 29 is the last year of my life. It's crazy. I feel like whatever I want to do will be too late to be done after 30. I don't know where to start. 

&#x200B;

163jg2i,I Asked For My Old Job Back...,"I left my previous job because I felt like I didn't have any growth opportunities.  I took a job that pays more and on paper looked great. It's probably a great position for the right person.  Great benefits, fully remote job, and stipend for phone and internet. I am a month into my new job and I already know this is not the job for me. Mostly due to the working remote aspect. I realized I NEED to work in an office. Work camaraderie is very important to me and being in the physical presence of the rest of my peers is what gives me the motivation to continue to preform at my utmost best. 

With all that said, I asked for my previous position back at my last place of employment. I made a professional exit with a two weeks so, I'm hoping they will consider rehiring me. I was honest in my email to come back stating and that I can offer a long-term commitment (basically sold my soul but idc) and even taking a different position if my old role has already been filled (and of course if they'll even consider). 

I figured the worse outcome is a ""no"" response so there can't be any harm in asking. 

Does anyone have experience with this? Both as the employee asking to be rehired or as the manager or supervisor who is being asked. What was the outcome? What should my expectations be?",OddOwl27,95,0.8199999928474426,113,1693221802,2023-08-28 11:23:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/163jg2i/i_asked_for_my_old_job_back/,8,2023

163fc1a,Was basically bullied out of a job and left without putting 2 weeks notice can I fix it?,"So basically I had an internal delivery job for a tech company. It wasn't a bad job, but I kept getting harassed by the former internal delivery person who is now a parts manager. Basically when the truck arrived it would be 15 min break after that i would sort (usually by myselfwith a min of 3 full pallets). I mainly focused on getting all of the packages that went to other departments, scan them into a spreadsheet, print the spreadsheet, & have someone in the department sign. Well every time I got back from break I would have either the former ID guy, the main manager for parts depot, or the douche bag from parts depot come over to my station and ask me where there stuff was on almost a daily basis & no they would NEVER help with sorting not to mention i would get constantlyblamed for things going missing when i took pto. I brought it up with HR because I was getting sick of it, i did alot of extra things to help other depots as well, & if I was gonna have to just deal with it I wanted more money. Long story short HR made things 1000 times worse. HR took the harassers side and basically made the few parts ppl that I was cool with & the few friends I had hate me on top of that one of my friends quit because they were going to cut his pay and move him to a different depot. I was told by HR that I'm just looking for more ""unnecessary work"" which was a load of crap considering the extra things I did actually helped the other depots. So I decided to move to another depot since HR didn't help only for me to find out that since I would me moving to another depot ""I wouldn't be doing as much difficult job"" so they cut my raise to just 15 cents, but they had to find a replacement which would have taken a month. I got so pissed off that I used up all my pto and got another job. I am probably going to send an e-mail to the main bosses of the company about what happened to see if  they can change my reason for leaving to something better than I just up and left. Does anyone know what else I could do to help my situation.

163drjz,Need advice on whether to leave.,"I recently got a job offer from the a different company to join a new team at a newly forming company. I would be the only employee on payroll, but the role would be one extra thing on top of what I am doing at my current company. I feel that things at my current have soured, as the company has always been terrible at communication, we have worked 126 hour weeks for months on end without overtime, and my boss is actively being passive aggressive towards me. I have higher chances of getting fired once the September performance review is out. He will also never train me to take over his job if he decides to leave, and there is no room for growth. The benefits of my current is that I just got a pay rise, my coworkers are okay, and it's my house is closeby in a quiet neighborhood (good for my disabilities). 

Pros of the new one are:
A fresh start
Opportunities to uplevel my skill
50% pay increase
Higher title 

Cons
My future direct supervisor already has shown red flags of the misogynistic sexual harassment kind.
New environments are not great (I'm autistic)
Higher cost of living at the new place

163di0y,Grad School end is on the horizon and scared of job search,"Hi all,

This is going to be a long rant. I'm a computational biophysics grad student who has been working on a hard method dev. During the initial days of my lab, my PI warned me that this project was just an idea and that I would be the one who would shape it and make it a reality. He also said that if I go this route, I'm likely to start publishing in the last year of my Ph.D. I'm from a physics background and loved the project. Learned a ton of biochem in process. Went through a lot of curveballs when my peers were publishing. But I loved the project as it was testing my limits. There were at least two points where I came up with a better solution when the project was at a standstill which my PI thought might not work. I finally submitted my thesis project article in my last year. There are other projects that we designed and churning data as we speak. But only one of them would get published before I get into the next step in my career. 

I was telling my PI, how this simple decision in my first year to chase a hard problem made me lose fellowships and prestige publishing numbers that would brighten my CV. Despite this, I did a full-time co-op for six months in the Cambridge area and a part-time follow-up. I was active in advocating for the grad community in my school. I hope I will get a good recommendation from my PI and my committee. But now, I see that my PhD is about to get done next spring and I can hear the clock ticking. I have been to numerous career stories, and panel discussions as an audience and I thought I figured it out. But nope! I'm kind of scared about what my strategy should be. Should I go with information interviews? Should I chase my immediate network, etc.? I have been a long lurker in this community and I love to do research and push my intellectual limits in a team setting. The biggest question is where should I start? 

I have a good knowledge of small molecule, protein, RNA, and lipid simulations and techniques and worked on a handful of projects during my thesis and internships.

163chwu,Where do I go from here?,"I'm getting to a fork in the road and trying to figure out where to go. 

I work in IT, academic IT. I've been in my position for 10+ years. I have a great boss, get paid well and have good bennefits, so I'm not unhappy with my job, but it's not the job I want to retire in. I'd like to move up. I'm also unhappy with the area I live in. I don't have much of a life outside of work, despite multiple attempts to build one, so I'd like to get out of the city and state I'm in and start fresh. 

The problem I'm finding is I'm not sure if I really have any skills. I do a lot of desktop support, purchasing, and have worked on some projects purchasing and integrating new software but it's usually me telling developers or engineers what to do. I never learned to code or script other than a few basic CMD scripts. 

I do have my Masters in Info Tech, my focus was in security and I do use it sometimes. I also have A+. 

I've never had the oppertunity to gain management experience. 

When I see Manager, Assistant Director or Director positions, they often require tons of experience I don't have and am not able to get, so I feel like I'm going to have to take a step back, which could mean a 30-40k pay cut, which I don't think is sustainable. 

So then I stop and think well if I've hit a dead end in IT, and would have take a step back, maybe I should follow a passion. I love traveling, and have no ties really to where I live, so I could easily become an OTR truck driver. I have even seen some OTR truckers rig up their trucks to carry a motorcycle with them for exploring on their off days. 

I've also thought about just leaving, going to a new city and getting gig work until I find something. 

I think I need some outside opinions about where to go from here. I feel like I'm in the ""jack of all trades but master of none"" IT position. 

I've also found myself afraid to leave as I do have a good supervisor, and a good office, and while I know there's a heavy sample bias, it seems like all I read are horror stories.

Because I had only had pet store experience, my boss wanted me to start in reception/pharmacy to get used to the flow of the hospital. This seemed reasonable. There are programs within the company to get certified as a technician and a lot of the girls at work had been doing that while training as an assistant. Long story short, once I familiarized myself with the job and medications I was supposed to move up. This continued to not happen. I figured they weren’t comfortable with my experience level yet until I noticed that a lot of the new hires were asking me questions about things and had about the same level of experience if not less. Eventually my boss hired a groomer who wanted to train me to restrain and bathe dogs to help her on days where her assistant isn’t available. I met with my boss who agreed to put me on the schedule for grooming to start training. Anything more hands on the reception feels like an vast improvement.  The grooming hours never showed up on the schedule. It has now been 4 months. The groomer and I have been inquiring to my boss about me starting and nothing has changed. I tried emailing her for a start date and she has not replied despite it being days. I have now been promised two different positions at my job with no follow through.

1638pli,Should I take a fully remote job?,"For context, I am a therapist in New England. was contacted by a company and offered a job that is fully remote, in a supervisor role, with only 2-3 client hours per week, the remainder is supervising staff and signing off on documentation. This is appealing to me as I have been burnt out with direct client care due to my current role and wanting to take a step back from therapy. I have been in my current role (as a clinical supervisor) for a year, and the whole year, I’ve been no more than 50% staffed, and am having to do the role of numerous clinicians in addition to a supervisor role, with a caseload of at least 150 (when I have been at my most staffed). I feel very under appreciated by my supervisor, and the job has been all consuming and taking over my life. But, I love the setting, it offers me 1-2 remote days a week, which is truly the only job in this setting that offers any remote time at all. I know that if I leave I won’t be able to come back to the same role if I miss the setting, and will take a massive pay cut, have to work just as a clinician, and have no remote time. I also fear the impact fully remote work may have on me. The last couple years I’ve been feeling unsettled and lonely. I don’t know if working remote will help me foster better relationships and self care or if it will exacerbate my current mental health problems.

1635oxp,Can anyone relate?,"Hello, any life advice or help would be appreciated:  


  
Within the realm of my career I am feeling stressed and unsatisfied with my trajectory. I am 25 and working an operations job where I complete mundane and what I see as useless tasks, constantly following up with other people to do their jobs, and all with little to no real world impact or change. My job actually pays decently, but I still feel unfulfilled and know that there is not a whole lot of upside for me if I stay doing what I am currently doing. I definitely want to make a career switch, but don’t know which direction to go.   


  
I think that a main fear I am facing is being rendered helpless, or incompetent in general. My dad is very mechanics based and I think my parents always thought I’d become an engineer, but I ended up attending business school and have a degree in MIS and Business Analytics with a Finance minor. Sometimes I regret this path as I wish I could gain more knowledge in automotive workings, agriculture, and other hands on ventures. Right now, I feel stuck between pursuing multiple professional avenues, including Real Estate, Finance, and Data Analysis - and a myriad of different directions within each of these general umbrellas. I definitely feel a certain sadness that by pursing one field, I am forgoing the time and opportunity to pursue another.   


  
I have been spending countless hours trying to research both why I feel this way and the best way forward given my personality type, but seem to get stuck in endless “Thinking - Feeling” loops, which is something I have recently discovered/diagnosed as part of my meyers briggs personality type and my enneagram, which is INFJ 5w4.   


  
I am trying to nail down my core values and use those to guide me. These include conscientiousness, curiosity, knowledge seeking, and compassion for others. I struggle, however, to align these to any real career path which I would consider as worth pursuing.   


  
I recognize that I can be perfectionistic, and I feel that this is preventing me from taking action towards committing to a path, as I find myself constantly going through cycles of researching a path, feeling optimistic that I could achieve it, but then seeing the negative and eventually poking holes in my own ideas. I know this is counter productive and needs to change, and I understand that action is crucial, but still I feel this sinking and dreadful feeling that I will either fail or that I am making the wrong decision whenever I get started.   


  
I know this sounds rough but from the outside my life really is not all bad. I have great friends and the support of my family, but I just feel that I am in a bit of a rut (quarter life crisis if you will) and am looking for advice on if anyone has ever felt this way or can at least relate, and how you moved forward on your path.

1635fj8,How to capitalize on this skill?,"Over the past 12 years, I've been consistently told that I am a phenomenal writer. I just brushed it off as people being complementary, but now in my mid 20s it has been steadily leading to real outcomes which seriously have me thinking - what can I do with this skill in a professional sense?

A few examples off the top of my head. 

\- I wrote for competitive awards and research grants throughout undergrad and graduate school and got every single one, my supervisor still asks me how I pulled off a specific grant that the whole country applies for (ok just the major college students and academics). 

\- Last year, I was helping out my sister's friend with college admissions and wrote a personal letter for her. She was aspiring to get into med school, clearly brilliant and passionate about the field but was waitlisted with average marks and her draft wasn't doing her justice. After sending the letter her status changed to full acceptance the same day. 

\- I was told by a former colleague from a government internship that a report I had written before I left was still being shared around a year later.

\- I generally get job interviews after sending my CV/cover letter, while I don't always get the job they often leave good feedback about my resume. In fact, the boss for my new job has asked me to redo her resume exactly like mine.

I am not sharing this to boast, but to express that I may have a knack for writing more than any other skill that I possess and it comes fairly naturally. Moreover I get excited at the thought of helping talented people with good ideas not being held back by poor writing. I enjoy tapping into other people's visions and projects and potentially helping them secure funding or land a better job.  I do enjoy writing for personal favours and side projects, but maybe there is more I can do..

First of all, is this skill profitable in your opinion, and if yes what do people suggest to take this skill further? Do I just go out there and market myself as a freelance writer? Do I specialize in something specific like resume writing, grant writing, proposal writing, etc? I've generally heard of copywriting as a profession but I don't actually have any formal training on it, is that going to be an issue? Are there any platforms to advertise such work on or just do cold calls? I'm used to job descriptions and structure, so no clue where to start! 

Much appreciated :)

Apparently the job requires travel 3-4 times a year to varying states. I have a huge phobia of flying, and have no desire to fly whatsoever for a job. I probably wouldn't be able to, that's how bad my anxiety is. 

The recruiter mentioned that some of the traveling involves places on the East Coast where I'm from for conferences, which is driveable. But she mentioned there are some opportunities to travel to the west coast as well (obviously can't drive there). 

I'm not sure if it would 100% be required, and maybe they could work around my issue and see if I can only attend conferences nearby.

 Should I mention my lack of desire to fly during the next interview? Or should I just say nothing until I get hired? I want to be transparent obviously, but also wonder if I would blow my chances.

1632das,How to pivot into business?,"Hi all! Quick summary about myself. Graduated with a BA majoring in Social Work and Spanish. Got a job right out of undergrad directly in the field of Social Work. I quickly realized that though I did enjoy working with people, I didn’t feel that I wanted to make a career out of it and could fill that bucket in my personal life.

I’d also like to break into management. 

I’m finding it hard to start doing research on how to make a career pivot from social work to business.

1631km1,Feeling desperate to find work and considering anything remote,"This job market has been kicking my butt. I know I'm not the only one - it's affecting so much of the workforce. I was laid off the first week of May from my remote job due to an organization restructure/redundancy, decided to sit back for a bit over the summer to relax and not stress myself out by throwing my resume out in the void, and am just now starting to attack LinkedIn (not really a fan of Indeed). Also, my unemployment insurance still has not been approved / paid out to me.

Like any of us in this position, or even those who do have jobs and are looking, I am completely discouraged and disheartened with the amount of immediate rejections, no feedback, or just seeing the sheer number of applicants to any role. 

I've been in touch with a couple of head hunters but no cigar yet. 

I have a lot of great experience from my past jobs in a major US city, and I know I'm a value add to any company but I don't want to settle for any job for the sake of having one. I'm still exercising some selectivity to align with my skills & career trajectory / ambitions.... but I'm wondering if I should just look for a remote virtual assistant job to keep me afloat while something more aligned comes along? My concern with that is although it would bring in some income, my pride is sort of getting in the way because I'd see that as ""peddling backwards"".

How are any of you handling balancing this sort of predicament?

1630p0e,Can I Pursue a Computer Science Career While Cultivating My Passion for Writing Novels?,"Hello everyone! This is my first time posting here. I am currently a college sophomore majoring in Computer Science. I am new to coding and eager to learn more about it, as I've noticed that I possess strong problem-solving skills and an analytical mindset. However, my ultimate dream is to become a novelist, as I'm passionate about crafting transformative novels in the future. I thoroughly enjoy writing and consider myself a skilled storyteller. Creating characters and worlds brings me joy, and my aspiration is to eventually publish at least one book in my lifetime. Nevertheless, I'm also grappling with practical considerations. I desire a stable job that offers decent income, and I see pursuing a career in the field of Computer Science as a favorable path to achieve this goal. 

There are two parts of me. One part of me wants to become a fiction novelist so badly that I worry I might waste my time pursuing a degree in something I am not fully passionate about. Another part of me worries about the financial struggles that this decision may entail. I want to secure a job in a career that enables me to earn money because I desire the ability to own a comfortable house and afford various things. Student debt is also a significant concern for me. I am keen on avoiding substantial debt for a degree that doesn't offer strong earning potential. Money holds significant importance to me, as I, like most people, aspire to live comfortably and afford a good standard of living. 

Now, don’t get me wrong! It’s not like I hate Computer Science or I am just tolerating it solely for the sake of money. I find the subject itself really intriguing! I possess a strong aptitude for technology and have a genuine interest in understanding how computers function and in coding. Nonetheless, I also hold the dream of writing a novel someday. 

I wish to know if choosing to become a software developer while writing a novel on the side is a viable approach to addressing this dilemma.",Apprehensive_Share93,1,0.6600000262260437,2,1693167309,2023-08-27 20:15:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1630p0e/can_i_pursue_a_computer_science_career_while/,8,2023

I am BIPOC, very amiable and likable, developed good people skills working with students with disabilities. No credit, no debt. 
 
-Worked all kinds of 16-19hr jobs between ages 20-30, from medical/wellness spa reception and phone scheduling, to recreational cannabis delivery service dispatcher and sales position.

-Worked retail at a metaphysical bookshop and gift store, well personally growing a plethora of knowledge in crystals, minerals, fine specimen collecting, and opened an online store through etsy. Even with over 2,000 sales over 10 years I've had it, it has not been financially sustainable or lucrative.  

-Only position that broke 20 per hour was 5 years teaching special education as an instructional assistant for public High School, that was far too emotionally draining and taxing for me to consider again. 

Now I'm 32, freshly moved to Portland, OR with a lower cost of living, but I have absolutely no connections, or knowledge about this community, workspace, industries etc. Got hired full-time at another Crystal and mineral shop, doing product photography, photo editing with Adobe photoshop, and WordPress/WooCommerce, helping transition this business is physical product inventory into an online store. Soul sucking and 17/hr once again, after taxes. Also working part-time at a kava bar, but barely putting away 200 a month in savings. 

My true interests and passions are people, being of service, health, and nature. Looking to either make steps towards a legit career, find a trade or get some certs. that makes sense and I already have transferable skills in, find a business mentor or support locally in the Portland area, or get into online marketing and sales and push my crystal business which I have interest and passion in as well.

162yfm4,Best career timing for maternity leave?,"I (30f) am getting ready to start a new job at the beginning of October. It’s a full time employee for a government contracting company. The current contract that I’m on will last 12-18 months and then I will supposedly be moved to work on a different contract. I’m excited for it, it’s a great raise and career move. 

My husband and I have also been planning on trying to have a baby next year. The company I work for does not offer paid maternity leave, but I will be paid through short-term disability. Thus, it doesn’t really matter if I’ve been with the company for a year or not when I have the baby because time taken for FMLA would be unpaid anyway. 

I don’t know when the current contract will end since it’s 12-18 months long. While it would be illegal for my company to not put me on a new contract because I’m pregnant/ am on STD for just giving birth, I am nervous that it would still happen under the guise that my current contract is over and they just don’t have another one for me. 

So I’m looking for career advice. I don’t want to wait 18 months to try to have a baby, but I’m nervous. When do you think the most ideal time to be out for six to eight weeks for maternity leave would be that would be least likely for my not being put on a new contract?",Dangerous-Wheel2004,0,0.5,2,1693161921,2023-08-27 18:45:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/162yfm4/best_career_timing_for_maternity_leave/,8,2023

162xxoi,Career Pivot from internal recruiting,"hello!

i’m a corporate tech recruiter with 11 YOE, 100% in tech recruiting. 

i’ve had a solid (though not remarkable career), currently a senior manager. i have managed up to 9 people at a time(but have not managed managers). 

i started in agency and then went on to work for a startup, followed by two unicorn startups. i’m relatively new in my role (under a year). 

i’m fortunate to work 100% remote. 

i enjoy the people management aspect. i love to help people succeed and unblock. i love to teach and give situational advice. 

i also enjoy the strategic and data oriented aspects of the role. data, reporting, and dashboards are my jam. i also love the strategic pieces of sourcing. 

what i don’t like is how emotional recruiting is. everyone is always in their feelings (the hiring leaders much more so than the candidates). 

it often feels like an admin job, and as though we’re stuck being the bad guys to hiring leaders at all levels (this role isn’t approved we can’t actually work on it, we can’t add more rounds bc it’s a bad experience and we have 7 interviews with data points already, we can’t ask salary as it’s illegal you moron, etc). 

i want to lean into the operations, data, and people leadership side.

162xxg0,What to do with a BA in Behavioral Science?,"Hello,  
  
I’m graduating with a BA in Applied Behavioral Science from an accredited school in the state of Arizona in a couple months. I chose applied behavioral science because, in my opinion, it’s generalized enough to be applicable in several areas of mental / behavioral health yet is narrower than a BA is Psych or social work. I feel like there’s so much crossover in behavioral science, psych and social work educational paths that it really shouldn’t matter. I’d expect anyone with a psych or other social science degree to have the same level of behavioral knowledge I’ve gained and vice versa.  
  
Main Question: I want to strengthen my resume and qualifications, so I’m looking for advice on what AZ state licensures or certifications are available to me with this degree and what careers I should be looking at.  
  
I honestly don’t know what I want to do in the field beyond making $50k a year helping people. I make $40k a year now in a benign job that does nothing for society, but I also didn’t just work my ass off to complete a 4-year degree while working full-time to make less than $50k per year. I’m also not interested in getting a Master’s, which I realize is usually recommended in these fields. Since kindergarten to this very day: I truly, utterly and completely hate school so it’s a miracle that I’m getting a BA.  
  
In the absence of working in the social or behavioral fields, I’ve considered law enforcement or corrections in order to meet my $50k+ year goal, but I want to explore other options first. I’m 36M, very able-bodied and willing to work ungodly amounts of hours.

162xvqn,Fearing layoffs - CRO,"&#x200B;

TLDR; long-term employee with imposter syndrome, climbed corporate ladder and now fearing role will be eliminated as company looks to reduce costs, and worried not qualified for anything else and will have to start over somewhere with huge pay cut.

I work in the CRO industry, data management specifically. I was hired at my company right out of undergrad 13 years ago, and have stayed ever since, working my way up to middle-upper management in my department  and now making mid-six figures. I started out as an associate data manager, and never shied away from a challenge and rarely said no to additional work or expanding my skillsets. My trajectory is different than most data managers in my company, in that I supported atypical clinical studies (registry, observational vs. late-stage trials) and also pivoted to project management and leadership before I could get very in-depth and knowledgeable in data management. I look at myself as a jack-of-all trades/master of none type person. A couple years back my company went through a re-org (we were bought by a private equity firm) and I was recruited by a colleague to my current position. I now do resource management for our entire department and support business development on the side (strategy, budgets). I feel moderately qualified for the former aspect of my job, and barely qualified for the latter aspect as many people look to me as being a subject matter expert when really I'm not. I've voiced this concern to my  manager, by the way. I also have a huge issue with imposter syndrome and something I have talked to a therapist about in the past.

Anyway, company was sold once again to a bigger firm a year ago and we've made several acquisitions since our initial re-org. We had never laid anyone off in the company's 40+ year history, until 2 months ago when some redundant roles were eliminated (mostly overhead). Last week, several direct-bill staff were let go. I am legitimately fearful now that positions like mine will be looked at and eliminated in favor of someone more qualified or cheaper salary. Work is not much fun lately, we are in somewhat of a hiring freeze as execs are fearful of adding to headcount and sales have been slower than expected this year. It's been very difficult to do my job as every new hire requires intense justification and an in-depth examination of all existing department staff and rationale for why one of them could not fill an open need. Communication from execs is terrible, rumors are flying every day, and I'm predicting a mass exodus as people look to greener pastures at other companies.

Because of my career trajectory, I feel like I will be under-qualified for typical data management positions and I have a hard time quantifying what I do now. A lot of my work involves communication, negotiation, planning, forecasting, and reporting. I don't really have a question, I guess just looking to get my feelings down and would love to hear from others who may have gone through a similar experience and how it might have changed your life. Part of me feels like a layoff would not be the worst thing in the world - it would force me out of a job I'm not particularly enjoying, a job that's giving me anxiety most days, and require that I look for other opportunities perhaps in a new field. The part that scares me the most is my salary and having to severely adjust expectations and lifestyle.",happy_camper69,1,1.0,1,1693160554,2023-08-27 18:22:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/162xvqn/fearing_layoffs_cro/,8,2023

162v2dh,I want to bring up some issues I've been having on my current team,"I applied for a new job on a different team which would essentially be a promotion. I had been transparent with my manager about switching and they even helped me update my resume. 

Since I didn't get the job though I feel like I need to talk to him about a few issues I've had, which made me want to switch teams in the first place. I sometimes feel shut out of opportunities and also people take credit for work I've done. 

For instance, I was working with our intern in some UX research right before leaving for vacation. This project was very important to me because it was the first time our research was gaining visibility, and I wanted to take the lead on it and show off my work and advocate for the importance of UX. In other words it was my time to shine. 

However, when I returned, he had asked the intern to put together additional research regarding a vital piece to the product without my oversight or bringing me in. I felt frustrated because this is work that was really important to me and he handed it off to our intern. It was not time sensitive, because we didn't present until two weeks later. She ended up getting all the credit and I was cut out of my own project because I was gone for two days.

Another example was when an intern on a different group presented my design work. She had modified the content to reflect the logo we use for Canada, but other than that, no changes were made to my original design. Still, she did not acknowledge my role in creating the designs. My manager IM'd our group and said ""Wow this is great work (intern name) did!""

I immediately messaged back saying, ""Not to undercut (intern name)'s work, but I built these designs."" 

I then private messaged him saying, ""I know I got defensive but these are my designs with minor content updates."" 

He said, ""I know and (intern name) knows this is your work."" 

But I am not convinced that if I hadn't brought it up he would know that or acknowledge my work. 

All that to say, these things have happened enough times that I feel like I can never let my guard down and I'm always in a defensive position. I am dealing with chronic insecurity because I feel like I have to constantly defend my position on this team. It's exhausting. I'm not going to tell my manager that, but I do want him to recognize some of the issues I'm coming up against and work to solve them. I wouldn't have brought it up if I was moving to a new team but since I'm staying I feel like I need to talk to him.

The training for this task specifically wasn’t exactly great but I also feel like my manager approved it and we should share the blame. I have been here for less than a year while she has been doing this task for 4+ years.

I’m going to suggest what I can do differently to prevent this from happening in the future but this has happened in the past with other things where she has approved things of mine for the first or second time doing it that ultimately have errors and I get the full blame for them.

Do you feel since my manager approved the work that she is also to blame or that the blame rests solely on me? Note that this mistake would be pretty glaring to someone 
experienced and less noticeable to a beginner.

162tp3w,Should I pursue a doctorate while not being in a university?,"I wanted to be a professor, but am now thinking that I should just re-enter industry.  I was working 50+ hours a week while completing an online masters in Canada.  I didn't renew my contract last November to concentrate on my studies.  They offered $90+/hr (CAD which is a lot of money to me) to convince me to stay, but I wanted to teach.  I applied for a Doctorate at a university with a relationship with my current university and was provisionally accepted in September of last year.   I am 46 and this was a massive risk and a huge life change.  My thesis got rejected in December of last year.  My prof read it and said this isn't what you proposed.  I told him that I informed him over 5 of our monthly bi-weekly meetings that the topic was changing because you insisted that I did enough work and I should just write down what I got in March of last year. He apologized, but stated that I had to fix the problem.  Fast forward to June where I managed to force my new topic into my old topic and I get my thesis approved.  Scheduling my defense took about a month and half because my prof couldn't find an external reviewer and there was a fight about using three internal people on my thesis panel.  With the additional university bureaucracy, including a mandatory 1 month processing hold, and my prof not submitting forms in a timely matter I will graduate in mid September.

My prof has informed me that the new university that I was accepted is probably going to reject me stating that I don't have proof I graduated from my masters, but we will see.  He started hinting that there was a chance I couldn't get in after deadlines for most applications for doctorate programs were past.  I was shocked that I could move from provisionally accepted to anything lower than that.  He said that I should do my doctorate work and have a paper read even though I am not in a program.  The idea would be that if I finished any paper I could submit them in a year from now and get credit towards my doctorate.  The assumption is that they will accept me next year.  He has promised to work with me, but there has been so many problems with him not paying attention or putting in the effort needed I know the only support I will get from him is him grabbing papers from archives that I won't have access to because I am not a student.

I see three choices ahead of me.

1. Complete papers and pretend to be a student accepting the financial outcomes that come with that decision.
2. Give up on my dream and go back to industry.  I have to say after all of this I have a bad taste in my mouth for the educational system.
3. Get a job and continue with the very late nights completing course work in the hopes that they will accept me next year.

In response to some expected comments:

* This is a throwaway account as I am trying to protect the university until I decide if there is something I should do about this situation.  My main account shows my activities at my university. A lot of things went wrong that I feel should be corrected, but I prefer to avoid the nuclear option. 
* My prof is a good person.  He is aging and taking on too much.  He legitimately forgets things and shows reactions of annoyance when facing that he isn't absorbing information.  He also has family health problems that he thinks he can just power through without being distracted.  I think he is a bad prof for not realizing his limits, but not an evil person.",LlamaNo85,1,1.0,0,1693150822,2023-08-27 15:40:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/162tp3w/should_i_pursue_a_doctorate_while_not_being_in_a/,8,2023

162r5sd,Where to start,"Need to start somewhere Again

 This is going to be a long post. The reason for this is to fully or partially understand my place. I'm a 24-year-old male and introvert who still lives with my parents and I know that's pretty bad. I don't have everything together either. I don't have the ""Spark"" or know what I want to do for myself. I am sick of hearing this question (What do you want to do when you grow up or where you see yourself in five years), mainly because I don't really know or am sure what I want to be in five years. I am pretty pathetic and defeated.  I'll be going to a four-year university and community college, both part-time. So, I need a decent part-time job or maybe even better. I worked as a cashier for about a year or so. (Quit during the Covid because of the dangers of infecting my family. During that time, I had a little raise and looked like I was going somewhere because the manager wanted me to start assisting closely. Followed by working at Fedex for several months as a package handler/ along with handling IC.(Quit because of the great distance, poor communication, and lack of promise.) How do I know if I correctly qualify or over qualify for a job? I figured that surely my Associate in Science and Pre-Med had to amount to something or something right? I never wanted to go college to at least not immediately after high school because, believe it or not, I lost interest in school. I did have a plan or some ideas to improve by joining the military. From there, I can truly learn to display, speak effectively, and to live independently. I have to hear from this guy who is my age who bought a car for his mom. So, I looked pathetic and always constantly compared myself to prized children. But when you have parents, especially foreign ones, they want their kids to be doctors. My parents, despite wanting me to be a doctor, barely give me any advice about getting there properly (Forced me to go several LPN even though my math is lacking severely) or getting back to the point of the post HOW TO GET A JOB or find one effectively. Which I find ironic and hilarious or maybe I am feeling pathetic because I have both parents and yet no one to help me understand the outside world. I wouldn't know because I don't have a ""big brother"" who looks out for younger people.

162mhga,I have no idea what career field I should get into,"I am 25 yrs old. I have worked at Kroger, living in Dallas, as an overnight stocker for the past 6 and a half years. I am paid relatively decently as a result of my time here: $17.55/hour as of writing this. I do not have a drover's license and feel as though I have no way to get one as the only person who could have taught me was my father and he's been distant from my life for quite a while and I cannot count on him to teach me. I have made bad decisions with credit that I can only bear full responsibility for and am working on paying off.

I don't feel satisfied in my current job. I don't feel like I make enough for the kind of life I need to live, I feel like I throw such a large portion of my money away on Lyft, food, paying a portion of bills in a ""three bedroom"" apartment(the third bedroom is a fucking joke and shouldn't even be called a bedroom as it's just an old sunroom) with my mom and sister, that I don't feel like I have much to spend on my own life and happiness. I don't feel like I can save enough money to ever be able to afford a house. I don't know what I'm passionate about because I've never really been able to explore my passions as I've always only been able to do what I've had to do my entire life. I don't feel like I've ever had true freedom.

My issue is: I don't know what career path I could possibly take where I would feel actually happy and have real financial freedom. Computers have always held a least a little interest for me, but I'm scared of trying to get into IT and regretting it and being miserable, or that IT isn't actually well-paying at all and I'll just make less money. I really just don't know what I can do. It's getting to the point where I feel like trying to join the Air Forcr is my only hope, though even then I wouldn't know what job to pick and am afraid that it'd be a waste of my time. Does anyone have any advice they can give?",Eldritch_Raven451,1,1.0,6,1693130956,2023-08-27 10:09:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/162mhga/i_have_no_idea_what_career_field_i_should_get_into/,8,2023
162ltyj,Should I leave medicine?,"Hi,

I hope you are having a good day. I am currently enrolled as a medical student. Much like every other person from the average brown household, I chose medicine partly out of my parent's will and partly because it was the only field that pays you well both in honor and money. However, after a couple of years of studying medicine, one thing has become very clear that practicing medicine in Pakistan is an absolute shit show. At this point, the only two viable options are 1) Either pay tonnes of money for USMLE, sacrifice what little of life you have as compared to your non-medical peers, leave your family behind, and if by some stroke of luck and years of struggle, you are able to finally land a residency in the USA, move to the states. Going through these things really makes me wonder if doing STEP is ACTUALLY worth it or not 2) The second is a career change. I often wonder which field I'd choose if I hadn't gotten into medicine. And every time I have the same answer. ''Probably computer science''. I will not say that I am in absolute love with CS but I do tend to enjoy learning Python and stuff. And CS as a field enchants me way more than medicine. 

 To all the doctors or engineers who happen to see this post, I just have one question. What would you do if you were in my place? Also, the one thing that I have learned in recent years is to live well in this inflation, the only way out is to have a remote job. To anyone who is currently doing a remote job as a data scientist, how hard is it to find and land one?",Mysterious_Middle_26,3,1.0,0,1693128678,2023-08-27 09:31:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/162ltyj/should_i_leave_medicine/,8,2023
162l4po,The Trials of a Fresh Graduate: Navigating Work-from-Home Job Hunt Amidst Personal Challenges,"Hey Reddit community,

I hope this post finds you all well. I'm here to share my journey as a recent master's graduate navigating the complex world of job hunting, particularly in the context of remote work.

The journey started with high hopes and enthusiasm. I scoured popular job platforms like Indeed, Internshala, Naukri, and more, excitedly applying to numerous positions. However, the reality has been quite different. As a fresher, I've faced my fair share of challenges in securing a job, and what's made it even more complex are the personal challenges I'm dealing with simultaneously.

Despite the extensive efforts I've put into crafting tailored resumes and cover letters, and preparing for interviews, I've often found myself caught in the cycle of rejections or no responses at all. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions, ranging from frustration and disappointment to questioning my skills and worth. The competitive job market, especially for fresh graduates, has shown me just how tough it can be to stand out.On top of this, personal issues have added an extra layer of complexity to my job search. Balancing these personal challenges while trying to break into the professional world has tested my resilience and determination.

I'm sure many of you have faced similar struggles, whether as fresh graduates or in other stages of your career. If you've navigated through similar challenges, I'd greatly appreciate any advice, insights, or success stories you can share. How did you overcome the initial hurdles? What strategies helped you secure remote work opportunities? And how did you manage personal challenges alongside your career aspirations?

This community's wisdom has the power to inspire, motivate, and guide others who are on similar journeys. Let's discuss, share, and support one another as we tread this path together.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story. Looking forward to your insights and experiences.

162l2gf,Should I attempt to get this law passed if I become a politician or should not?,"One of the laws that I was considering getting passed in politics is trying to pass a law that mass shooters would receive the death penalty.

However when I grew up the high school and college I went to were two completely different realities. In the public high school I went to fights broke out all the time, there was chaos in the classroom, the teachers were harsh and out of line. That high school literally destroyed my whole high school experience and I deeply regret every going there as it came to be the worst decision of my life.

Then the private college I went to was very different. The students there were more well behaved, most of the teachers were way better. My experience was completely different. I had two completely different experiences from high school and college.

What I am saying is that I am really only am trying to pass this law to help the type of people I went to college with. That is where the success in the law would come from me. The success would not come from passing the law to help a place where I deeply regret going to.

I am not saying that my former high school doesn't deserve to be protected or helped from mass shooters. However what I am saying is that I am bothered by the idea that the law that I am creating is not just going to go to the type of people and places I want them to it is going to go for everyone even places that I personally dislike and ruined my high school experience.

Do you think I should still attempt to pass this law or just forget about trying to pass this law since it will go to everyone and just focus on mass shooters receiving the death penalty on a case by case basis?",SignPaths,0,0.36000001430511475,3,1693126031,2023-08-27 08:47:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/162l2gf/should_i_attempt_to_get_this_law_passed_if_i/,8,2023

Now I have mapped out two possible options for me to pursue my interest ,which are-  
  
Btech cs with bioinformatics from VIT ( now I don't want any hate for saying VIT as my preference but like they are the only college in india providing cs for bio students )  
  
IMPORTANT  
  
2) BCA - there are some decent enough colleges offering bca for bio students but I do want to take a better college and for this I want to give CS exam as many of the colleges allow cs as an alternative to maths but as you know I am already half way through my 12th and I won't be allowed to change my subject so subsequently I want to give NIOS but I got no idea about it like can i give my boards through cbse and then fill up cs through nios or do i have to give all the exams through NIOS too ?

Classes begin on Monday, and I'm not sure if it's even worth pursuing at this point as I believe the program is unrelated to my career goals at the moment. I'm also not sure how recognized this foreign degree would be here in the US, especially since the school is relatively unknown. In addition, Sweden is 7 hours ahead of where I am, and there are a few times a semester where have to attend live classes, meaning I would have to attend classes at 2 a.m. followed by a normal workday.

So, I'm planning to leave once I complete my first year in the company which is in 4 months. I dislike feeling this way because it affects my mood and relationships with others.

**I'm a 23-year-old Ukrainian migrant who fled the war from occupation to find new life in Canada.** I've got a college degree in IT (web development) and recently completed my university studies in journalism. Over the past years, I've been involved in freelance journalism and worked with a public organization, focusing on human rights, politics, and war-related stories. Despite my passion for journalism, I've struggled to secure a full-time role in the field.  
**After arriving in Canada, I started with a Starbucks job, but a friend eventually helped me land an administrative role at a local school, paying $18 per hour.** This position suits my migration goals, but I'm eager to find a career that offers growth opportunities.

**My dilemma lies in my inability to secure a journalism job, even though I'm deeply passionate about it. I'm starting to wonder which career path I should explore in my new country.** Currently based in Ottawa, I'm renting a room and my monthly salary of $2,400 falls short of my aspirations. I'm keen on finding a career with a potential annual income of at least $50,000.  
**While I initially studied web development (JS, CSS, React) and had a knack for it, I chose to pursue journalism because I love to do this more.** Now, I'm at a crossroads and seeking advice on where to pivot. With my skillset including project management, marketing, basic design, and photography, I'm wondering which industry might be a good fit for my situation.  
I'd greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions on how to transition swiftly into a fulfilling career that aligns with my skills and values. Thank you for taking the time to read and help me navigate this journey!

I know most people think of it as a term of endearment but It's hard to describe how it sounds coming from him. The way he acts and talks makes him seem like he's always in a good mood and cheery but the tone is condescending, like sounding nice when you're not kind of thing.

162e8b9,Need advise. Want to quit my job.,"I (30M) have a job that at first seemed pretty good, but I have grown to despise it. Everything started 2 years ago when I moved to a new state for a job that was offered to me in an industry I knew nothing about. I have gotten two promotions in the course of those two years and am currently being offered a third promotion. Currently, I am making 90k a year, and the new promotion will put me at around 110k a year.  
The problem is, I am miserable there. I hate waking up every morning and going into work. I am overworked; I have to stay there until my boss leaves, and that is usually always at night. I am basically my boss's slave. (He sends me to run his errands, clean his house or garage from time to time and a bunch of other things that have NOTHING to do with my job)  I work at least 14 hours every day (and since it's a salary, I get paid the same as if I worked an 8-hour shift). He will usually also have me work weekends, sometimes 7 days a week. I wouldn't mind staying for work-related things, but most of the time is just waiting for him in the office while he is literally watching TV or TikToks, trying to avoid his home life.   
It's ALWAYS a yelling contest with him. He gets mad at everything, nothing ever gets done right, he is always right, and everyone else is wrong. He bullies everyone but gets mad when someone does it to him, and we are always in the wrong no matter what it is. He is a compulsive liar and manipulator who, after ""manipulating"" someone to do what he wants, then makes fun of the situation and praises himself for how good he is at manipulating people.  
At first, I thought putting up with it was worth it for the money, but lately, I just want to quit. I would rather work at a minimum wage job than have to put up with that job day after day. I feel like I am just wasting my life there. That leads me to convince myself that one of these days I am just going to quit.  
I am planning on quitting and starting online sales or finding a remote job. Online sales is something I've done before but have never done it as a full-time job. I have enough in savings to survive for 4 months. My only fear is that once I quit, I won't succeed on my own. I am the most responsible and disciplined employee at all the jobs I've had, but somehow when I try to do something for myself, I tend to sleep in, not give it my all, and eventually end up giving up.

Like i said i really don't mind working any other job even if it pays me way less, my only problem is i need to make somewhere around what i am making now to pay my mortgage, car, insurance, cc etc. while i believe in myself and feel that this is something i can accomplish on my own, i cant seem to bring myself to quit, because part of me is horrified of failing. I am also afraid that if things don't turn out the way i am thinking they will i will regret leaving that salary. 

Everyone i tell this to tells me i should just quit if i am not happy, and i agree. Yet part of me also feels that this is something i let happen for not knowing how to say no and not setting boundaries. And now it is too late to set those boundaries because it now became a tacit part of my job. I am conflicted because i am leaving a decent paying job for being a pushover and avoiding confrontation. However every time i think about leaving my job and how my day to day life would be i am really looking forward to it. 

I know this became more of a rant, but any comments, opinions or constructive criticism is greatly appreciated. ",Big-Appeal-3402,18,0.9599999785423279,25,1693103596,2023-08-27 02:33:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/162e8b9/need_advise_want_to_quit_my_job/,8,2023

162dxi1,How to approach for a major raise?,"My wife was recently laid off and it doesn't look like we'll be able to replace her income. Even after cutbacks and tight budgeting, we're in a household deficit monthly. I find myself in a position where I must request and justify a 50% raise from my employer to make ends meet. I've been with the company for 2.25 years and I did receive a 15% raise at the beginning of this year. 

I'm involved in a start-up so getting this raise could be tricky, even if I offer to take on additional responsibilities. I'm also a great fit for the position I'm in and don't necessarily want to leave. Should I:

A. Request the raise even though the company may not be able to afford it. (This could make them think that I'm planning on leaving, and try to replace me, or they may think I don't have a grasp on the company's financial situation.)

B. Just look for a new job. (Again, don't really want to leave)

I am good with understanding concepts and analyzing holistically but having troubles remembering facts and precise information. I more focused on understanding idea as the whole - not details.

Good at visualizations, style and design.

Interesting fact: In math class, I have always had troubles with formulas and solving problems using formulaic approach - equating things to one another. My head just can't do that. But can detect patterns and apply them very easily - really good at seeing a link between things.

With respect to math, discrete stuff was unbelievably hard for me while continuous much better

16281d0,offer negotiating advice?,"hi there! i currently am employed and like my job, but an old client reached out to me about a new opportunity and wants me to take a job with another company. i’m very interested in the role, and it would be a 25k-30k salary increase from what i’m currently making. the company is currently preparing an offer letter. 

originally, i told the managers at the company that my range was 95-100k, but then i upped it to 100-106k and gave good reasons why (i learned more about the role, learned i’d be the lead, etc.)

the benefits are better than my current benefits - employer-paid health insurance, and the 401k match is 1.5% higher. my current organization does offer a pension after 5 years of employment, but i doubt i’d be able to stay that long regardless as my current job is very intense with less pay and a pension is only valuable if you stay a long time. 

my question is regarding vacation days. the new company offers 15 days, with no designated sick time (just lumped into time off). after 3 years, the new company gives you 20 days. my current company offers 15 days and just recently gave us 160 hours of sick time a year. after 2 years at my current company (which i’m coming up on), i get 20 vaca days.

is it fair for me to come back while the new company is preparing the offer letter and ask for 20 vacation days because of their lack of sick days? or is that pushing it? it’s a smaller organization, and i’ve been communicating directly with the high-up management, and i worry about making a bad impression when i already upped my salary range from what i originally told them. 

it’s a way better situation than what i currently have, so i don’t want to put a bad taste in their mouth. i didn’t care about the PTO comparison at first until my dad said something…but obviously, more PTO is always nice.

1627b0c,Working remotely in a 'personal' business,"I work as a jeweler and jewelry designer for a small business in a major city on the west coast of the US. I've been an apprentice bench jeweler in the past, and my educational background is fine art and illustration. Part of our business is that we give at least 10+ % of profits to our charity. I've been with the company for about 3.5 years and with my coming onto the team we've seen exponential growth (previously there was no on site designer). My boss has told me I'm the best hire he ever made and he will keep me on as long as I want to stay. I like my company a lot of believe in our mission and how we do business- it's a refreshing change from the normal corporate and capitalist drudgery of the 'luxury' industry. I work mostly with couples for wedding jewelry where we meet up to figure out what they're looking for/ like, we pick stones together and then the rest of the work I do on my own/ the bench jeweler does at their home studio.  
I am originally from the Northeast of the US and have lived on the west coast for 10 + years. Between cost of living and separation from family, I'm ready to move back within the next few years. My boss knows this and is sad to have me go, but is very understanding and on board for taking up the challenge of making it work. I'd personally prefer to stay with the company rather than to try and find another job, especially since I have less than 10 years experience as an actual bench jeweler and no one wants to hire a bench jeweler with less.  
I've lived in the city for years and I need a change. Basically a post-pandemic pivot lol. I have good relationships with my clients and interface with people well, but as an artist first and foremost I am trying to have less face-to-face interactions. I've always been someone who values my quiet time. Currently I am in store 3 days a week and 2 days at home where I do the majority of my actual designing and various following up with my clients. I also design pieces for the store based on what we have, the majority of which happens on my design at home days. In the store I have the advantage of being able to use any products and tools, and meeting with clients face-to-face, but otherwise it can be a bit distracting.  
I mention the first part of this paragraph because I do not want to necessarily open up my own storefront. That would move more into the manager side of things and I am trying to preserve what I am best at- which is the creative element. I'm also not at a point yet of wanting to own and operate my own business- as I said I like where I work and my team and for my own personal discipline I do better when I'm not in charge of every single element. My boss floated the idea of me having an office space to meet with clients and maybe have a small amount of loose stone inventory. My thought process with this though, is that I'd have to have said office be in an even remotely urban area. I'm not trying to move out from one city just to jump into another one- I've spent the last 10 years not being able to afford any space and being crammed in with everyone else around me so I'd like to live in a quieter, more rural area. So I wonder about like, having an office at home where I meet with people remotely (already do a little of this), or having a small office space where I can meet with clients for initial consultations and looking at stones. The question then becomes, how often would I need to be there to make it worth it? Could it possibly be sustainable to just set business hours and load up with clients for like, 2 days in person and then do the rest from a distance? I'd still also work to make original piece  


Has anyone had any kind of similar job situation that they would like to put any advice out there? I apologize for things being a little vague. I've never been in a position where someone actually wanted to help me succeed based on what I actually want so I don't even know where to start thinking of the logistics. Thank you!!

1627745,"Need advice on how to fix big, stupid error","Trying to keep this vague since I work in a very specific niche environment.

I am the coordinator of a sponsored program and technically oversee the budget (in conjunction with my boss, who is the manager of said program + around 5 others). 

I started 6 months ago. It's my first time working directly with a budget and reporting system. The budget is not my main job; I do all aspects of admin for the program and refer to budget to make sure we stay in line. 

Within the first couple months of starting, I had to put the projected numbers of what we would have left by the end of the fiscal year. The process was confusing because apparently, they just needed numbers based on the primary sponsor, not other donors, and I was still learning how to use the reporting system. I came from a completely different area that did not work with sponsorships or donors at all and had minimal training, so it felt a bit sink or swim.

I went to my boss for assistance, he took a look at what I had put together so far, made a few comments. Overall said it looked great.

I submitted it to our directors and felt good about tackling a new task and kicking ass. They asked me if I was *sure* the numbers were correct, because apparently my predecessor had mixed them up. They also wanted to ensure boss had looked over it. I said yes, boss and I did it together. They were happy. 

I should note these numbers were in order to obtain an extension of unspent funds. Which is its own official process, and requires extensive approval. The numbers were approved, we've already celebrated. I'm excited. Job is going well otherwise. Around 4 more months pass.I should note I've looked at the budget plenty in the meanwhile. Everything looks great. Until I caught something and my heart dropped out of my chest. 

There is a line in the report that I had completely missed when pulling the numbers that refers to an amount contributed by a donor that is NOT a part of the funds we have to spend from the primary sponsor. I have NO clue why this line is in this report, the report should've been for the sponsored funds only. It's the same report my boss told me to use. It means that what I gave to my directors is about 200k off from what we really have to spend. AND everything already got approved. 

I'm honestly depressed and anxious about the situation. I'm frustrated that no one above me caught my error since I was still learning the system. I don't know what the process is for making the correction, but I know it will make our program look bad to sponsor and will piss off directors. I know ultimately it's my fault and I will get the blame. 

I'm scared of coming out with this and need some advice on the best way to handle it. I have some serious trauma related to my work history and a deep fear of losing my job. I have been doing extremely well otherwise and even recently received a sizeable raise.

16275no,I'm a new contractor on a multi-year project. How do I say no to an offer from client without awkwardness for the remainder of project?,"Pretty much as the title says. I'm a contractor for a Fortune 100 client on a project that ends in a couple years. Client is in hiring freeze that's ending soon and has previously stated they want me to join. I don't want it. I'm actually trying to transition out of my role early for something much better on a different team under the same client company. I fear my client manager is inevitably going to catch wind and use that opportunity to question me about wanting to leave. And likely proposition me to stay via an offer. I don't know how to say ""fuck no"" without burning the bridge and making my remaining time awkward while I seek an exit.

Reasoning:
My team/segment works as a pseudo PMs, but have essentially been downgraded to analysts as of late. And the growth trajectory is dismal. Most of the surrounding people are 50+ and some 60+. They don't go anywhere. This role is seemingly deadend, but maybe decent for unambitious people wanting to settle. However, the whole environment is increasingly less agile and overly bureaucratic to the point of excessive political tensions. To me, this department is a sinking ship and few of the client's employees have already switched out. We have a really good salary for the amount of work we do, but not really notable as a whole. I think this project ""cycle"" I worked an honest 10-15 hours in 10 days. Considering that, I'm both grateful and terrorized by it as I can't imagine leadership being comfortable with it financially. Also, most of the ""work"" is easily automated. Otherwise, it's mostly navigating stakeholder's ego and pride like an emotional minefield in order to get them to perform simple support tasks.

I'm eager to delve into the realm of part-time positions within software development in Auckland New Zealand, but obviously international positions are also a option.  
My career path has been a dynamic blend of project management, software development and systems engineering spanning over 25 years. Throughout this time, I've cultivated expertise in an array of technologies, including C, C++, SQL, and various other systems. My proficiency extends to HTML and CSS, and more recently, I've been venturing into the realm of JavaScript. In 2017, I opted to take a hiatus from the corporate sphere to explore travel and engage in a variety of pursuits.  
While I've honed my familiarity with Linux systems to a commendable extent, both within my personal environment on platforms like Proxmox and Debian-based desktop systems, I must admit that my skill set has gathered some rust over time. Recognising this, I'm committed to revitalising my competencies in relevant domains within the coming year to 18 months.

1626wbb,How would you handle a coworker who is being very persistent on taking you out on a date and won't take no for an answer?,"In my role as a quality assurance analyst, I find myself dealing with an uncomfortable situation. A colleague I worked closely with has taken to flirting with me persistently. Initially, I tried to shrug it off, attributing it to harmless banter. However, as time passed, the situation is escalating. What was once just playful comments has turned into requests to walk me to my car after work and even proposals for a date. And before you say, ""Well, have you told him no"" YES! I have and He is still very adamant on doing so after many refusal's.

Navigating this situation has become increasingly challenging. 'm not normally inclined to escalate things to Human Resources, as I have always preferred to handle things independently because people normally don't take these kind of things serious in the work play. Moreover, I don't want to create unnecessary tension in the workplace or cause unnecessary drama. However, the situation is reaching a point where my discomfort is interfering with my work and overall well-being, due to me having to work alongside of him everyday at work.

My hesitation to discuss the matter with my boyfriend is rooted in a desire to avoid unnecessary stress in our relationship. I fear that involving him could magnify the situation beyond its current scope.

Ultimately, I realize that my reluctance to address the issue head-on is affecting not only my work but also my peace of mind. As a last resort, I am deciding to approach Human Resources. I wondered if others have already reported the colleague's behavior, raising questions about the extent of his actions.

In the end, while it is daunting to involve others, it's essential to prioritize my own comfort and well-being and I do think that every workplace should provide a safe environment for its employees, free from any form of harassment or discomfort.

What should I do? Any Suggestions?",Existing-Parsnip1545,225,0.8600000143051147,417,1693084469,2023-08-26 21:14:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1626wbb/how_would_you_handle_a_coworker_who_is_being_very/,8,2023
16265u1,How to handle declining compensation?,"I've worked at a major tech company for over a decade. Total compensation is made up of salary, bonus, and quarterly vesting RSUs (grants that fully vest in 4 years). At my level RSUs are supposed to make up over 50% of total income.

Since 2021 my total compensation has been consistently decreasing, mainly because my RSU grants are expiring and I'm not being granted new ones. Compared to 2021, my RSUs decreased by 15% in 2022, a further 50% this year, and by the end of next year will reduce another 67% if I receive no new grants. In total I'll be receiving 85% fewer RSUs than in 2021, and they'll only account for 15% of my total compensation.  
My total compensation dropped 10% in 2022, another 20% this year, and will drop by an additional 20% next year. By the end of next year, I'll have earned 45% less than I did in 2021. To put that in perspective I'll need a 75% compensation increase to get back to 2021 levels.  
My reviews have always been good, and I receive plenty of praise from my colleagues. I complained about the compensation drop last year during my annual review but nothing was done about it. I was hoping things would change this year, but we just got the dreaded ""no compensation increases"" email.  
If someone had sat me down in 2021 and said, ""Look, we're going to reduce your compensation every year until you're making almost half of what you do now, that cool?"", I'd have been out of there in a  heartbeat.  
The job market is tough right now, and I know some talented people who have been out of work for over a year. I have a mortgage and other significant financial commitments, and I'm unsure how I'll cope if nothing changes. But I don't see what other option I have but to just if nothing is done about my earnings.

1625kgq,Considering changing jobs,"Hey all- so I’m considering leaving my current company due to an HR issue.

I’m a 32 (F) have always worked retail, or a combination of 2-3 jobs, + babysitting/nannying while also going to community college. 

I wanted to have the college experience but my parents aka my Mom and stepdad didn’t have a nest egg for me or my little sister for college. So yeah 😕

I got my liberal arts degree and my first corporate job/office was working for a pest control company. Worked for a third party vendor company that serviced many different clients and that gave me the experience to work ALOT of inbound and outbound customer service roles which helped me grow a lot in the 5 years I stayed there.

I now work for well known vendor company now, and am in IT sales and make over $57 K a year however I’m in a HR thing where I don’t live within a certain mile radius policy so my days are numbered essentially :( I have until May of next year and I’ve been looking for a new job since Feb of 2023. No luck- and the companies I’ve had phone interviews for, are start up companies who unfortunately can’t price match what I make now. So I’m trying to hang in there and be strong but it’s discouraging when all you get is rejection emails :(

I recently had a Zoom meeting w/ a recruiter for Toptal for an inbound sales rep role. I’m hoping I get asked back for the next part of the hiring process- however the explanation of the exact role was a little confusing. 

Has anyone worked for TopTal within the sales dept and found success?

There’s 3 parts of the hiring process I’d have to go through, which I’ll think of doing but I want to know it’s worth it beforehand. ( and yes I’ve done research on the company) from what I’ve read it appears to be where I’d be selling the platform to business professionals, engineers etc to use for their company.",beachbum_007,5,1.0,5,1693081322,2023-08-26 20:22:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1625kgq/considering_changing_jobs/,8,2023

So, I am an M/26 physically disabled guy and I am at the crossroads of my life. 
I come from a dysfunctional family. This was the behaviour of my family towards me in the past and I want your opinion regarding my future. 
Parents: I don't care or respect them because, for my undergrad studies, they said it was a waste of money to spend on my education. So, I studied on scholarship. 
The only thing they have on my name is money which is equivalent to $16000. 
Sibling number 1: So, we are three brothers and I am the youngest. The rest are able bodies. This sibling number 1 is in the States working for Amazon on a managerial level job. He is pretty insecure and narcissistic. 
After my undergrad studies, I completed and succeeded at getting graduate admissions in the unis in the States. This guy told me that he is not supporting me in terms of finances because seemingly I did not consult him. So, he lost my respect after that point. 
Sibling number 2: So, this guy is pretty gullible and the first one used this one for his purposes. Now this guy is in his early thirties and with no solid income. This guy you can say is pretty jealous of me and also physically assaulted me once. But financially, he is of no use to me. 
Now the situation is that the first sibling wants to dictate my every move and wants me to live life his way. I want to go to countries abroad for education in business analytics but I don't and the same is the case for my parents don't have enough money. 
I have to talk to this number 1 sibling lunatic who is pissed at me till now that I chose to go to the UAE on a visit visa to live with my cousins when the situation at home deteriorated for me personally. 
The second path (which my heart wants to take) is to go to the UAE leave this household and find a job there. No loans to take from any sibling, no contact, and no obligations as well.

Last year I was promoted to a higher position which includes strategy and project management. Based on AI, my title should be Digital Operations Manager. Currently, I am the highest person in the team after my boss.

Here are some tasks that I am responsible for:  


* Discussing, brainstorming, and defining the focus and goals of the business mostly with the founder
* Creating a plan to execute those goals
* Hiring freelancers & managing them for various marketing, dev, or other areas
* Solve our technical issues or collaborate with someone to solve such as CRM issues
* Define more efficient processes and collaborate with the team to implement
* Creating a plan to automatize our daily goals
* When something goes wrong in the team, on the agency side, reaching out and offering solutions
* I have a design background so I designed our 3 websites and do other miscellaneous tasks every once in a while

I was getting $2200/m as a video editor and now I get $3000/month and I have no benefits other than 20 days paid off per year. Over this one year, my responsibilities spread to all parts of the digital side of the business.

I feel I am doing a lot of things but there is no upper position where I can be promoted and because of that my salary will not be increased dramatically.

My boss is keen on understanding the finer details as he likes to take well-thought decisions, and on several occasions, I've failed to provide him with them. I've sensed his frustration at my inability to provide detailed and convincing answers, and it's led me to wonder if he's losing trust in me. I genuinely feel terrible and believe I've let him down. The thought of resignation has even crossed my mind. Though he has been patient and never treated me harshly, having worked with him for many years intensifies these feelings of inadequacy. I'm beginning to lose confidence in my abilities.

Could you please offer some advice? Should I resign, or should I confront this challenge? If I choose to address this issue, what steps should I take? Would establishing a PMO (Project Management Office) alleviate the situation? I'm uncertain.

Thank you.",talaat123,3,1.0,7,1693060657,2023-08-26 14:37:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/161wx5s/losing_confidence_over_my_abilities_please_help/,8,2023
161vyiw,I won my company a huge contract and saved my department. How do I best capitalize?,"I've been working for this company for about a year. My work was apparently interesting to a huge customer. The customer requested a demo, so the company gave me a small team and a few weeks to develop it and we exceeded all expectations. The customer is going to award my company a ~$50m contract in the next few months. My department had just lost its main source of funding, so people are going around calling us 'The Avengers' because we saved our asses.

My question is how do I approach my leadership about this to leverage the best benefit for my career?

161usro,What to choose: a new career path or the current role?,"Hello everyone,  
I graduated with a bachelor's degree just a year ago and luckily landed a Marcom job right after. Recently, the senior colleague who used to guide me left, and I've taken on a lot of responsibilities. There are many processes and specialized knowledge that I haven't fully grasped yet. I've discussed this with my supervisor, but there hasn't been a concrete action regarding hiring additional help. As I've taken over, I've made some mistakes that affected multiple teams, and it has really shaken my confidence.  
Furthermore, the more I work, the more I realize I might not be the best fit for Marcom. I'm somewhat introverted and feel I'm not quick with numbers and people, which makes tasks like events, communication, and frequent meetings draining for me.  
Feeling lost in direction and confidence, I'm torn between two paths:  
On one hand, I believe I have a knack for delving into problems, being meticulous, observing, analyzing, and experimenting. I'm currently exploring analytics and considering pursuing a Marketing master's degree to explore different opportunities such as digital marketing.  
On the other hand, staying in my current role, as I know overcoming this phase could lead to significant personal growth.  
I do need to consider everything very carefully. I'm an expat in Europe, so if I make the ""wrong"" move, I might not get the visa to stay here or cost much more than normal people (the master fee for internationals is x10 more than local).  
I'm eager to hear opinions and advice from you all. Thank you so much.",katewoo72,3,1.0,3,1693055300,2023-08-26 13:08:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/161usro/what_to_choose_a_new_career_path_or_the_current/,8,2023

I’m currently in a situation where I could use some advice and insights from anyone with input. I'll lay out the details for you:

I'm currently working as a transaction coordinator for a business brokerage in Los Angeles, and I'm making $52,000. Recently, my boss approached me with a unique opportunity. Her husband is the CEO of a private equity and holding company, and they are both proposing a 3-tiered role for me:

1. Transaction Coordinator: I'll continue with my current responsibilities in this area.
2. Administrative Support: I'll assist in building her company with scheduling and admin duties.
3. Family Support: This involves helping with her kids' school activities and transportation, which is new for me as I'm used to taking the bus. I have taken her kids to and from school activities in the past. 

The catch is, this expanded role would add an extra hour to my daily commute, and my car is nearing 200,000 miles. Considering this change, I want to ensure that my compensation is fair and reflective of my increased responsibilities and the changing circumstances.

So, here's where I could use your help and insights:

Given the situation, what do you think would be a reasonable and competitive salary range for this new role?
Any advice on how to approach negotiations for a higher salary?

I want to make sure that I'm making an informed decision and that I'm advocating for fair compensation.

I have Asperger's and I can mask but the mask got heavy plus it was really hard to deal with the lack of authenticity in the office so I lived off the rental money and kept my ass at home avoiding society... that is until I sold most of the rentals.  Now I need a job.

Is having 8 rental properties a good enough excuse to not  have a job since 2008? I did 4 or 5 flips too. Or do I need to have some friends that own businesses say I was working for them?  I was recruited out of college so I really have no idea what it takes to get a job.   I have a BS in the dollar tree version of CS (all the programming courses, none of the math) but I was recruited to do search engine optimization.  I don't know what kind of job I'm looking for but it looks like people doing search engine optimization get paid the same as 15 years ago so its not going to be that.

For the record I'm 100% ok with lying on my resume about work history.  Worst case scenario they fire me when they find out in 2 years but in 2 years I'll have some recent experience. I might have autism but something tells me many of you will give me advice on this instead of what I asked.

161ts5c,Take the internal promotion or new job ?,"Hello,  
  
I've been at my company for 3 years now, first job after college. Things went well with this first job, but I decided about 2 months ago to start applying to new jobs, for both money and career advancement.  
  
I couldn't see any opportunities for me there, the work started to get boring and not challenging enough; I was afraid this complacency would hurt my career since I'm still quite young professionally.  
  
Money-wise, I would say that I was fairly paid at the beginning (from what I heard from former classmates, I started the highest out of the bunch). Never really dare ask for salary increases, but I did get some, about 6% annually. However, I know that in my field (data science), salary can go up very fast with little experience, hence why I decided to try and look elsewhere.  
  
Fast forward to the beginning of this week, I was announced by my manager that I was given a promotion (+30%), as well as an opportunity abroad (about 10 hours flight) to spearhead a new project if I was feeling it. He said he'll let me think about this move abroad and HR will contact me next week for the promotion. I've also been told they would agree on sending me there for a month just to try it out, they'll cover all the expenses (flights, transportation, hotels, meals). My manager was quite happy for me and joked about this being free intermittent vacation for me. Sounds great so far, but the thing is, I'm not really convinced by the new project and what they have told me about.  
  
Then by the end of the week, after long and painful interview processes, I would have received 3 job offers. 2 are about roughly the same salary I was making before the internal promotion and the best of the 3 is about 8% lower than what I would get with the internal promotion. I'm only considering the latter. I would say the job doesn't seem necessarily more interesting than my current one, but at least it has the new factor.  
  
I'm having serious trouble choosing and I'm scared to do the wrong choice. Safest choice would be to stay and see how things go. But I'm wondering if I'm not getting myself into some career trap; if I'm staying at my job, I'll have to take this opportunity abroad if I want a little bit of challenge and new. This means uprooting myself, which tbf is not such an issue for me personnally. However, if I do stay and take the promotion, I wouldn't consider leaving the job for at the very least 1-2 years, to avoid people categorizing this promotion as a failure.  
  
In terms of career prospect, would you say my resume will look better with the internal promotion + assignment abroad versus a new job ?  
  
Thanks",MostTiger,1,0.6700000166893005,5,1693052490,2023-08-26 12:21:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/161ts5c/take_the_internal_promotion_or_new_job/,8,2023

161tk0i,"I’m miserable with my career, I feel stuck. Need opinions?","I’ve been working in the legal field and I’m miserable. I feel stuck and lost.

24, F. Im currently a criminal defense private investigator. Today my final job interview to be a civil litigation paralegal with a law firm was canceled two hours before I was suppose to attend. I was SO upset at first but it gave me an epiphany. Why am I doing this?? I don’t even like legal work. The legal field is cruel and cutthroat. I’ve cried so much from irritated attorneys or witnesses! I’ve been cussed out, spit at. All of it. 

I got a criminal justice degree because I was obsessed with the liberal social Justice agenda in Highschool and College. I wasn’t focused on a real career or what I really enjoy.. 

In the end, I hate my job, I’ve had it since I was 21. I work in criminal defense (I defend your local pedos, and murderers). It’s horrible. Two months ago I was held at gunpoint while working a case. It’s changed everything. My mind, the way I view life, honestly criminals can burn for all I care. 

I was going to give it one more shot in the legal field but I actually maybe I shouldn’t. I don’t believe I’d be a good fit tbh. I’m trying to be real with myself. I’m not smart and quick like I thought I was. (That is needed in the legal field). 

I know I love admin work and would have no issue greeting people and handling invoices. It will be a huge pay cut but will save my sanity I hope. 

I’d like peoples opinions. Has anyone gone through something similar? Change of careers? Going to college and hating what you studied after the fact?

At my current company, I am one of the first employees to be hired when it was still a start up. Technically, second hired with another senior.

Now, after 5 and a half years, the company has flourished, and we already have 20+ employees.

As an employee, I did exceptionally good; I have no lates, almost no absents besides the occasional one week vacations, and also got best employee awards for some 3 straight years.

My boss is very generous and gives us, his employees, the things we need and sometimes would sprinkle up some random stuff, treats the occasional pizza and get togethers with his employees. He's a good dude and a close friend of mine.

Our company would have our new office blessed in 4 days and have some sort of celebration.

Now my concern is, as I am nearing my 6 year to the company, I still have no pay raise.
And coincidentally, I planned emailing him my concern almost on the same day as the blessing/celebration. Would that make me a jerk after sending it a day after the celebration? It's sounds like ""we big, now I ask raise"" kind of thing in my head.

161kvko,I quit real estate. Now what?,"After 8 years and just over 300 closed transactions,  I’ve made the decision to call it quits in real estate and here is why.  

Prior to the pandemic,  I had it going on,  the midas touch, and everything I touched I sold it.  Eventually became principal broker, had a few agents and things were going quite well despite my personal feelings about the industry in general.  

I stepped into the industry in 2015,  right out of college.  After orientation at the local board, I couldn’t get over what a backwards and cumbersome shit show it is.  My biggest complain is being forced to join a trade organization with a tarnished reputation to the public, but I went with it. 

But what happened during the pandemic completely changed my perspective.  Prices here skyrocketed, and all I could see were extremely greedy people.  Sellers and agents both were acting like they were hitting the lotto,  and most made a hell of a lot while buyers couldn’t even win bids making  unfavorable offers just to try win a bid.   It made me sick.  And I can’t ever see it the same way.  

Now,  the thought of “selling” a home to anyone or even spending another second cold calling “ leads” off the Internet makes me feel like plucking my eyes out. 

I tried to come out of this funk,  and have blown way too many opportunities to step myself back into the pinnacle of power.  I just don’t want anything to do with another realtor unless my life depends on it.   There’s got to be a way out and another industry that could use whatever skills i have in a non competitive, stable field.",Easy-Bag-5284,5,0.6700000166893005,5,1693023411,2023-08-26 04:16:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/161kvko/i_quit_real_estate_now_what/,8,2023

161kcpj,I'm looking into a career in firearm design. Where should I start?,"Hi guys,  
Currently I'm 17 and about to graduate from highschool. All my life I've wanted to professionally design guns for a company like Glock or Colt. I'm not super into the physical designs elements (CNC machining/metal stamping), and I picture myself working with a team using a 3d software to design a new firearm. I've done a ton of research and the closest title I can find is Weapons Engineer or Product Management. The problem with those is I'd like to focus on small arms, and with those two titles they seem more oriented towards larger designs. I don't want to get stuck designing a new anti-aircraft missile or something.  
I'm considering just biting the bullet and joining the armed forces to get some hands on experience with firearms. Any advice on military pathways that will let me handle different kinds of guns?

I have only had hands on experience with coding for 16 weeks (length of the bootcamp) and I have not had that much time to practice outside of assignments because I was working full time during this whole thing and had other commitments. Needless to say, I feel unprepared. I have also just been through our final group project which made me painfully aware of the gaps in my knowledge. 

I am afraid I won’t do well and really want to stay at this company as the culture seems great. Do you have any tips for me on how to succeed in this new role? But more specifically, any tips on what I might do to have a successful probationary period?

161ewc1,"I'm in FBI background check hell right now, I hope this helps someone in the future.","This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I just got a dream job offer in an industry that requires fingerprint based FBI background checks. Well in 2010 I got a truly BS charge that was in fact a felony. Fortunately for me I had never been in trouble before and was in a a state that had first offender law that effectively and legally sealed the case pending successful completion of the sentence (in my case was years on probation) 

Fast forward to 2016, I successfully petitioned the court to seal my case. I applied and got my first job out of college and the background check came back clean. (This was NOT an FBI background check just a regular state and local one)

On to 2019, since all my civil liberties had been restored because of the sealing of my case I tried to buy a gun. My background check came back denied. I went through the ""Dispute Process"" on the FBI's website and uploaded all orders for the court sealing my case. A few months later I received a packet from the FBI saying all was fixed and I was eligible to purchase a firearm. They even included a copy of my FBI background check and it states that I had ""no arrest data on file""

A little later in 2019, I applied for a CCP, which my local sheriff's office ran a state/local and FBI background check w/ fingerprints. All came back clean and I got my CCP.

In May 2023, I paid to get my own fingerprint FBI background check and the case showed back up on the background check. I didn't put 2 and 2 together until recently when I was asked to submit fingerprints for an FBI background check for employment.

So here I am, I have good FBI background check from 2019 that doesn't show my case and another one from 2023 that does show it. I have started the Dispute Process again in hopes to get this straightened out soon. If you have any helpful insight please share!!

161dj55,Should I get my Masters?,"Hello all, 
I (35M) have a stable/(relatively)awesome job with the state of Oregon in the department of human services. I have a bachelors level education and am currently topped out in my pay range (80k). The only debt is a (comparative to others) small mortgage and live pretty comfortably with roommates. 

My current position, while awesome and fulfilling, is a bit underappreciated by the system in which I work. If I were to go back to school and get a Masters degree (most likely in counseling/LPC, Occupational therapy, or social work), I would quality for a higher paying job within my facility, be appropriate for other employment opportunities, and be greater appreciated/valued by the folks I work with.  This would come with a decent pay increase. Most likely an extra 10-12k a year.  To top it off is that I do trainings and groups with people that have higher education and feel that I can provide adequate if-not better programming than their positions. 

After looking at programs I can expect to probably spend 50k on a masters degree, and have to bust my ass while working full time.

This is a stupid idea right? Going 50k in debt to make an extra 1500 a month (in 2/3 years) seems like a waste of money a bunch of un-needed stress. Perhaps its best that I consider that I have a decent setup and try to not think about being undervalued?

161dibf,Do I go into work Monday,"I was offered a new job. The start date is supposed to be this upcoming Monday. I was told I would be given more information closer to the date, but now it is Friday evening, 6:30 PM, and I have not received any information. I emailed my contact that I was directed to send any questions and concerns to at 2:00, and then I called at 4:00. I never heard back. I was also told I needed to approve a background check through a link that would be sent to me via email from this same person prior to working, but never got it. 

This workplace is 30 to 45 minutes from my house. I have a few different options here. I was considering sending an email to the person I interviewed with, which would be going out on a limb because they probably will not respond on the weekend but it could be worth a shot. I could also try to call Monday morning, but I suspect that if I am supposed to go in, I'm supposed to be there when the office opens and if I wait till the office opens to try to call then I will not be there in time for my first day (assuming I'm supposed to be there). 

So, two questions. 

1. Would you email on a Friday evening? I normally would not, but this is a little bit urgent in my opinion because I need to know where and when I'm supposed to go on Monday. 

2. If you were unable to get a hold of anyone, would you just go to the office at the time it opens?

161cna3,Which psych career is right for me?,"Hi all, I hope this isn't too broad a question. For some background I'm 20F, based in Northern Ireland (UK) and going into my final year of an undergrad degree in Psychology accredited by the British Psychological Society. I'm currently assessing career options and I thought I'd ask for some input.  
I'm willing to complete a masters or a postgraduate diploma. It would be amazing though if I got some sort of sponsored masters or course that I could study while working. I am equally happy to work for the NHS or in the private sector, and I'm happy to work in the UK or in Ireland. I've studied in Scotland for the last two years and I love it there.  
If it helps I'm an ENFP and Enneagram 9.  
What I know for certain is:  
1. I want to work in a helping profession. I like one-on-one work — I wouldn't be suitable in a job where I would not be actively talking to clients.  
2. I enjoy a consistent routine. A 9 to 5 would actually be perfect for me. I don't love shift work and especially would dislike always having to be ""on call"" and unsure about when I would be working.  
3. I love kids and I know I'm good with them. I've childminded children ages 3-12 if that helps. I was really considering working with kids for this reason. I was very inspired by a presentation at university where a man came in from a service that worked with children who were dealing with issues like families divorcing, siblings with additional needs, anxiety, difficulties coping with minor health conditions like eczema, etc.  
4. I'm very interested in counselling. Last semester I did a counselling course which I adored. My prof said that I had a natural aptitude for counselling. I also did a mock counselling session for an assignment with my classmate who said she felt I did a great job listening and engaging with her and made her feel a lot better. Particular counselling interests include child psychotherapy, REBT and CBT.  
5. Personality wise, I'm warm and patient and have been told I have a gentle way about me. I'm really passionate about psychology so I know I'd dedicate myself to my job. I'm a good listener.  
6. I've previously worked in retail (just odd jobs between semesters/throughout high school) and loved it, I love customer service.  
The careers I have been considering - in no particular order - are:  
1. Occupational therapy:  
Pros: I was particularly thinking of pediatric OT. I love the idea of working one on one with kids. I also have a real admiration for services that help those who may be considered ""behind"". I think everybody needs a helping hand sometimes and I would love the opportunity to see kids really flourish and develop. Seeing the tangible results of my work, yknow? I also like that it has less potential to be emotionally taxing than talk therapy — but then I might be overworrying about how much talk therapy WOULD emotionally affect me.  
Cons: I'm not sure how consistent the job would be — I like a routine so I really just don't know which set up I'd get. Additionally, I worry I'm not creative enough to come up with innovative ways to help these kids as I know with OT you have to think outside the box for solutions. I'm also not particularly interested in the physical health side of things - biology and physical science has never been interesting for me. I'm much more interested in the psych side of things than the physical side.  
2. Counselling  
Pros: Counselling is a big interest of mine. It'd mean a lot to me if I could provide people with healthy coping mechanisms and give them a listening ear. I'm a compassionate person and I want to help, so if I could do that through counselling that would be great. I also like a structure to my work which attracts me to specific types of therapy/counselling, particularly CBT and REBT. I know that you don't follow these therapy styles step by step, by the book and it's just a guideline, but it would be nice to have that guideline. Lastly, I like that it could be a well paying job with a steady routine.  
Cons: I worry about whether I would be able to get a job in this profession. I worry a little about the type of clients I'd receive - some come into therapy for every day worries which I would definitely be able to cope with, but some come into therapy with a history of suicidal ideation and self harm, and I would feel so anxious about whether I'm helping them enough.  
3. Child Psychotherapy  
Pros: Similar to what I said above. I would love the opportunity to help kids feel more confident and happy. I feel so happy when I see psychotherapy help kids who are very frightened with something or who are unable to compete a certain task, overcome those feelings and live with less worry.  
Cons: Again, I'm not sure how many job opportunities there are in this field.  
4. CBT Therapy  
From the NHS website I saw that this has a pretty great training programmes and good opportunities to move up. Having gone through CBT myself I found that it was such a helpful form of therapy. I like that its straightforward approach and I would enjoy working with clients to find good coping mechanisms. I'm really leaning towards this. I like that is has a short term therapy plan so that I can see my clients' progress - I think this would be really rewarding.   
Cons: The obvious emotional toll, as well as tricky cases.  
I know this is a long post so thank you so much if you read to the end. If you have any input or alternate career choices or any advice really I'd appreciate it.  
Thanks :) ",romancerecs2,1,1.0,1,1693000923,2023-08-25 22:02:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/161cna3/which_psych_career_is_right_for_me/,8,2023
161cm6p,"Workload is doubling, how do I ask for compensation? Indirect Sales role, ICM.","If you work this realm you’ll understand the few acronyms I use to describe by role, this is for anonymity sake to a degree. 

I am an ICM ll for an indirect sales channel for a major corporation. I work beside 2 designated CM and juggle an additional 2/3 when needed for back up within our regional group. I am exceptionally skilled in my position and have turned down my counterparts Role for myself. I love my role. However, it’s a lot of work but I make it look easy due to my routines. 

I was just informed a CM within this region is being let go. His accounts are being split between my counterparts - but the reality is the bulk of the heavy lifting is on me since it all just completely falls on me to juggle what would essentially be 3 CM (workload) full time and then still float? 

Up to this point I’ve been collecting OT as compensation for extra work. My bosses are great and respect me. They encourage me to clock what I need. But they aren’t back filling this CM departing role. This is genuinely MORE work than any other peer that I am familiar with within the company, in this same role. 

I need more money and it wasn’t brought up when I was told there would be more work. I’ve asked to be promoted already to a senior role that would provide what would suffice to carry that 3 CM quota. But if I have to tick of boxes and wait for reviews I’ve got a long road ahead of me. This must be a situation I can approach given the circumstances and politely request/demand more, immediately?

161bfdp,Interview with CEO: advice?,"Hi everyone!

I'm completing my Magistrale very soon and looking for my first job as a Robotics Engineer in Europe. A German company I am suuuper interested in has requested a second interview with me, after a first tech test followed by a live tech interview (which, if I may say so, I absolutely aced). I am trying not to get my hopes up because one can never know, but this second interview will be 90 minutes long with 2 department heads, the COO and the CEO as well! Is this a good sign? Any super secret advice on acing this interview? 

They let me know that if this second interview goes well then they usually make an offer, and quite rarely they may ask for a third interview. I'm reminding myself that that they are probably interviewing a lot of other candidates as well and to not get too excited. 

Thing is, I genuinely love this company from what I have learnt so far and I really think I can bring in some great contributions. I already have some ideas to improve their robots and I think I can really make a difference. But maybe I am just being naive, I am still basically taking my first baby steps in the job world!

161aaxd,Career Advice Needed. Am I Burning Bridges?,"Hi, here's my situation.  
  
I'm finishing up a data scientist/analyst internship for a tech startup and have had a good experience. I've learned a lot, grown professionally, and have received glowing performance reviews from my managers and leadership team. I also mostly enjoy the work and people I work for.  
  
As the summer is ending, my manager has really pushed for me to work part-time during my final grad school semester (graduating this December) since the team really needs the extra help. They're offering good compensation, but would need me for 20+ hours/week and have not committed to offering me a full time role once I graduate.  
  
Working 20+ hours while finishing up my intensive masters program will be difficult, since that requires \~50 hours/week on its own. I'm willing to do this if I get a written commitment of a job once I graduate, but am far less inclined without this commitment. To me, the worst case scenario is committing to working for this company part time, not having much time to socialize/network/recruit due to my crammed schedule, and getting denied a full-time position at the end.  
  
I want to look after my own interests, so I've made it very clear that I will only accept this part-time contract if I get a written full-time offer once I graduate. This way, I have some semblance of job security; if not, I'll have extra time during the fall to recruit and find other opportunities as I won't be working for this company part time.  
  
However, I feel like I'm letting my manager down, since she's always advocated for me and has put in a lot of time helping and vouching for me. In addition, my team is already very busy, so me leaving would add additional work. My manager also seemed very caught off guard by this when I let her know my position/terms. At the end of the day, company loyalty and lip service only goes so far; I need to look after myself. But, don't want to burn any bridges and want to use people I've worked with as references.  
  
What do you guys think of my strategy and actions? Am I being too unrealistic or unreasonable in my expectations?  
  
Thank you.

1619cx5,What a Mess,"This may be a confusing post, but I will give it a go. 

  
I was feeling like I was not progressing in my career the way I wanted. I had a recruiter contact me with an amazing opportunity that would launch me in my career, and I got excited. I was given an offer and I accepted it, easy as pie- big raise and promotion. 

  
After I put in my notice to quit, I found out that the place I was going to be working at was not a happy place and people there were quitting. I also found out that they were applying to come work at my current employer! So, I changed my mind and decided to stay, because my current employer countered and wanted me to stay. 

  
Here is where I need the advice. My boss has now hired some of the people who were leaving the other place; they were people I was going to manage, who knew I had accepted the offer (later to withdraw it). One of the reasons that some of them quit was because they felt I had less experience than them and would be their manager. Now, they have been hired where I decided to stay, only to end up with me now being their manager (due to a promotion I got for staying). They are not happy about that. I do not know how to interact with them and could use advice. I feel like even though I have a tad less years of experience than them and I am young, that I am more than qualified to manage them and have a really good work ethic and reputation. I just feel like no matter what I do or say, they will be upset.

1618xny,I feel so lost… Any Advice/Encouragement?,"Howdy, y’all.

I’m 32 years old, and have been working in the food industry since I was 15.

I started washing dishes, worked at various restaurants (one of them for 7 years,) went to culinary school, worked at a private club, spent 6 years as a private chef on motor yachts.. Now, I just had a baby (well, my lady did) and I moved back home and opened the quickest business I could get started. A hot dog cart.

After culinary school, and before working on motor yachts, I wanted to try opening a hotdog cart.. just because I wanted to work for myself. Well, it’s just… okay. I’m pretty dang burnt out on working with food. I feel like I‘ve backed myself into a corner with the hospitality industry. 

I want to work in a different field, but whenever I think I figure out the route I want to take… I get discouraged, or realize it’s probably not right for me. I love stand-up comedy, photography, flying my drone, making music, and enjoy fooling around with photoshop. I’m into tech/computers/gaming although I don’t mess with them much, as of recently. I thought IT might be a good field to go into, but once I started teaching myself (CompTIA A+ and some coding) I get absolutely lost.

 I really want something much more remote.. but it seems like everyone wants that nowadays. 

I tried making a cooking YouTube channel. Felt like an absolute douche while editing the video and couldn’t even post it.

Clearly, I’m lost. My stepdad (a blue collar redneck, who owns a very successful business) thinks I haven’t given the hotdog cart enough of a chance. My issue with it is that I’m working my butt off for pretty low pay, and it consumes the days I’m not actually out selling hotdogs. I could be picking up more shifts/events/locations, but I just don’t feel motivated… 

Am I an idiot for completely switching fields after investing so much time in the food industry? I just wish I could make a decision and run with it, but I’m really having trouble. I truly feel like I can do anything I set my mind to, but struggle to set my mind to anything… lol. Maybe someone on here can talk some sense into me.

16181hz,"Old VP becomes current VP, carries his distaste for me into my new org","I work at a large US based tech company, >100k employees. I was on the same procurement team for over 5 years, did every role on the team, covered multiple roles through a significant amount of attrition, etc. We had a new VP come in from year 4.5 into year 5. He immediately trashed our current suppliers, plans etc. Suggested changes that were so radical and would be so costly so I put together a presentation on what it would take to do what he asked. Disagreed and it was the last I heard of it, but we did do his changes.

Manager role came up in our group, still reporting to the same director. The job was posted and then taken down due to hiring freeze. When it was able to be posted again, the job was downgraded and no longer a promotion because he knew it was meant for me. I told them in the time it took to get the post back up (6ish months) I had a change of heart about my development and wanted to be an individual contributor for longer and try something new. They obviously weren't happy but said ok.

I got a promotion moved to a completely new org and everything was great. Then, old VP gets moved to my new org because of a departure. After 6 months my new boss was starting to ask me about changing my responsibilities to something more high visibility and I agreed. Boss just calls me and said new (my old) VP turned it down and said I wasn't ready for it so I'm going to stay in my current responsibilities, which I like tbh

Do I just lay low until I am able to search for new jobs in the company (12 more months)? I simply don't want to work for this VP. It's not about my personal issue it's more about him not listening to his people and his superiority complex - waltzes into these new orgs and tries to discredit previous strategies, decisions, etc.....maybe it's a little personal 😂

1616rnu,"FINAL UPDATE TO: I have signed and accepted a job offer and put in my notice at my current company. Suddenly all the big plans they had for me surface and the ""what can we do to keep you?"" is also being said. What's the best course of action to navigate?","TL;DR from last 2 posts: Recruiter reached out, gave me lucrative job offer. I resigned and was given counters that were not all that great (pay was good but the role sucked). I left. 

***

So I started the new job and immediately it felt like all those conversations on what I was going to be doing at this new place were forgotten as if they never happened. The Analytics/Data Engineering they said they wanted turned into something different and weird. They basically had me just learning others' jobs ""so that if someone goes on vacation, we have redundancy.""

I was excited about the role, so I was constantly looking for ways to automate, clean up data, set up a data governance plan, figure out warehousing...hell...I looked for ways to demonstrate my abilities with Power BI...since ""Power BI"" was mentioned by them about 1,000 times during the interviews. 

But day after day it wore at me - I wasn't sure what the hell I was supposed to be doing. I worked hard to do the things they asked me, but ultimately I tried to carve out time to do the parts we actually talked about. 

Situated in a big office, I had plans up on the whiteboard, workflows, sticky notes - I scheduled meetings with everyone in the office to fully understand how the place worked. I was not enjoying it, but my personality is simple: Stick with it and work toward something better. 

Then Monday comes along. 

So I go in and say hi to everyone and sit down and get started on my day. An hour later, the owner of the company calls me into a meeting with HR. My thought was ""no way...""

Yes way.

They wanted to part ways and gave me some garbage how they were looking for someone to help with a big ERP integration (something I'd been talking to the vendor about) and not someone who does Walmart Analytics (which was one tiny report I did in Power BI...oh and ""Walmart"" was mentioned about 1000 times in the interviews as well, and my boss told me to go ahead and do a Power BI report). It was frustrating to hear how they were like ""we wanted someone who can do what you said you can do and were demonstrating well how to do it, but we're asking you to leave because you did a report on one of those things.""

So on my 10th day on the job I packed up a box and left. 

***

Immediately I called the COO of my old company. We talked and he was like ""yeah we need you."" (I didn't tell him why I was leaving other than ""it's not working out here."")

I popped in the office and we talked about what I needed to resume my old job.

- They said that HR did a salary review and said that my old rate wasn't competitive so they would execute the match they promised right before I left
- They hired out for the part of my job that was holding me back last month. I was always being asked to do my old job and not grow my new one. 
- They took a TON of work off my old boss so that he could effectively manage me
- They agreed to pay my COBRA premiums in full until I could get back on the plan normally (2 months)
- They never wiped my PC, so all my work would be waiting for me like I never left
- The owner of the company sat me down and said ""you took a vacation, we'll leave it at that, no one's looking back, only forward""
- I kept my seniority (includes PTO accrual rate, 401k match)
- The only ""bad"" things are that I lost my accrued PTO (they paid it out in my last check), and they are going to prorate my 2023 bonus to September instead of a full year, which I'm not concerned with. 

***

As for the place that let me go...I realized that I got paid (gross) about $21,000 for 8 days of work:

- I started on a Monday of a pay week. They pay exempt people in full by week.
- I worked the full week
- The next week I had to take Thursday and Friday off (arranged before I started). Worked for 3 days.
- Monday they canned me before 10am.
- They agreed to pay me the full 2 weeks coming AND 4 additional weeks severance. 

And I have my old job back with way more pay than I had before and tons of people are happily shocked to see me/hear I was back. And here I am, today, back in my old seat making a buttload more. 

***

I know much of the response was ""never take the counter"" and it's good advice - even for what I was doing, but so far this ""boomerang-counter hybrid"" seems to be working out. We have already discussed long term plans, key initiatives, and I got my boss on a schedule to actually catch up with me and help me continue to push projects forward and get away from doing the old work that was holding me back.

What a fucking week. I have to say, I feel at home again, and I'm glad that me leaving lit a fire under some asses to put pieces into place that wouldn't have this role (my job) so entrenched in that work. 


***

TL;DR - started new job, felt massive disconnect between what was promised and what they had me doing. They canned me on my 9th day there with a massive severance and I snagged my old job for higher pay, clearer responsibilities, and less bullshit than what I was leaving.

1616o81,Boeing Job Offer,"Hi guys, I have recently accepted an offer at Boeing Everett WA. Boeing was always my dream company to work for as being an Aerospace Engineer. Base salary and all the benefits are amazing. They are also covering every single sort of relocation costs. I'd say, the relocation package they provided me, is one of the best now a days.

But I'm worried and stressed out because I'll be moving from east coast to west (from automotive industry to aerospace) which requires me to burn all the bridges. This sort of feeling is haunting me because I don't know how would be the work culture and whether will I be settled down there or not? Is this natural or am I just overthinking it? 
What advice would you guys give yourself in regards to career at Boeing?

1616jov,I need some outside opinions...,"Let me fill you in on some background stuff so you know a little more about me. I have ADHD and have been diagnosed since I was 9. Did really good at school my earlier years but ended up graduating HS with a 2.4 GPA, I never really cared for my education back then. Once I got out of HS I tried to do a community college and eventually I would transfer into a Uni for Graphic Design.  
  
I ended up not really liking community college so I dropped out before the end of my first semester. I then joined the army for a couple years but got out due to medical issues and now I'm here, not really sure what to do with my life but I have always been surrounded by computers and always kind of thought about doing IT. Over the past couple months I have seriously been doing a lot of research into what kind of jobs there are in the IT field. For what I want (remote job that pays well) I decided I was going to get a degree at WGU for Cloud Computing, then I could use my GI Bill and get paid while I go so I can focus 100% on that. Currently I am about to start the IT cert program on google so I can get admissions to WGU since my GPA was too low in HS.  
  
  
  
I'm mainly just lookin for some words of inspiration from anyone that was sort of similar i.e. not very serious about High school or had no IT experience and getting a degree.  
  
TL:DR : I am someone with zero IT experience other than some Computer Science AP classes in high school that I enjoyed and had a low GPA (2.4) in HS wanting to come back to school after 5 years of barely any schooling. Have any of you done something similar to get where you are now?",TheDevastator24,1,1.0,1,1692986757,2023-08-25 18:05:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1616jov/i_need_some_outside_opinions/,8,2023

It’s unfortunate that I have been let go twice in 2023. Finally after being on unemployment for 6-7 months and interviewing for my position for a month.

16166oo,I think it may be time for me to move on to another employer but I'm scared. Any advice?,"I work for a small HVAC contractor, 34 years old, came here 8 years ago right out of college. I'm the lead engineer here and the only other engineers are two new guys I'm training. So I'm a big fish in a small pond.

For the last few years, we've mostly been doing apartment buildings and office remodels so the engineering intensity and learning is pretty stifled and it's honestly a bit boring sometimes. 

We rarely get the cool, energy efficienct projects with cooling towers, cutting edge technology, or anything.

I'm worried that I've learned most of what I can learn at this company and I'm afraid of being a 15 or 20 year experienced engineer who doesn't know as much as he should, if I ever need another job. 

I'm also content at my current job, the owners of the company treat me with respect, they're lenient on days off, leaving early/late, going to doctors appointments, etc. I make good money when compared to the number of years I have, when I compare to salaries online. The workload is very comfortable.

I fear that if I leave this company, I may have horrible bosses at the next one or I may be slammed with a high workload or overtime (big no for me). Or I may not have as much leniency to do personal things. I may get laid off much more quickly in case of an economic downturn at another company; my bosses really like me and want me to stay here.

Anyway, does anyone have experience jumping a comfortable ship for more experiences? Was it a good or bad thing for you? Thanks!",nuupdog,3,1.0,10,1692985924,2023-08-25 17:52:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16166oo/i_think_it_may_be_time_for_me_to_move_on_to/,8,2023

1615kbp,Cannot tell if I should stay at my current job or leave,"I have been working with this company for about a year and 8 months (25F). The company I work for has 2 offices. One in the US and another in the EU. When I was hired I was told majority of my team would be located in the EU and I would be working with/under the one person in the US. On my first day, I was notified that the guy who hired me was leaving and gave his 2 week notice. At this point I was the only person on my team in the US and completely new at the job. 

I decided to push through and try my best with the support I had. I was leveraging another manager for a similar team to help guide me. She is truly the BEST and I wish I could work underneath her. She has given me amazing support, guidance, and help when I have needed it. 

They promoted a senior member of my team to be my team's manager. Now I am reporting to someone in the EU, which is fine. After a while of this system and my workload increasing I realized that this set-up was not working very well for me. On top of that my new manager hasn't had much manager experience before and is new to people managing. I have noticed that there seems to be a disconnect between myself and this manager in how we communicate and how he understands what I say. I also noticed that he hasn't really been helping me develop as much in my professionalism and people skills. 

I have told him about some of my struggles where I needed more support in the US and that I also told him about how one of my coworkers constantly gives negative feedback and never really compliments or tells me when I do something right. I asked him for advice on how to talk to my co-worker about how she is super negative and it is draining. He totally glossed over what I said and mentioned ""I like getting feedback like that because it helps me grow"" I was very confused because that was not at all what I was trying to say. It felt as if there was a huge disconnect and it makes me even more discouraged. 

I even found a few projects that the entire team was working on but no one included me on them. It would have been a great learning opportunity for me and I was upset I missed out on that. 

It just frustrates me and makes me feel like I am not part of the team. I feel really isolated since they are all in the EU (same city) together. They get to have work sessions in person together, do team bonding events together, and also are all in the same time zone so are available for each other throughout the day. I feel as if it's really hard on me to not have those things. 

As someone who is newer to the work world I feel like it's crucial to have a manager to help me grow professionally and with interpersonal skills and I haven't had that support. I'm really on the fence about leaving, but the old manager I was working with has been really encouraging me to stay and to work on her team. The issue with that is that I'm not sure if that will work out. 

I'm really conflicted on what to do here. Thanks for anyone who read this and anyone who gives advice.

1615bzo,"Advice Appreciated | Hybrid, long commute, exempt employee, and was asked to relocate? Feeling Cornered and Need Advice?","  
Hey everyone,  
  
I've recently run into a difficult situation with the owner of the small company (A mom&pop shop that has no HR) I work for, and I'd love some advice on how to handle it.  
  
**Background:**  
  
I've been with this company at an entry-level position for just over half a year. According to my contract, I come into the office twice a week, but I face a grueling commute: a 50-mile drive becomes a 2.5-hour journey each way due to heavy traffic. Initially, I'd drive one day and take a train (followed by an Uber) on the other. The catch? The earliest train makes me 80 minutes late to the office. Despite this, I've maintained my 40-hour work commitment, often after regular hours. My managers can vouch for my availability adn accountability post 5 pm. TRUTH is: I am salary exempt, and I work > 40 hours for most of my weeks though I'm always 80 minutes ""late"" to work on one of the in office days. (I check emails and do preparation work, or log on to meetings if I have one when I was on the train because there's power and wifi).  
  
**The Issue:**  
  
The owner recently confronted me quite directly, saying that I'm always late and questioning my time/schedule management (it's only the lateness but not the performance) But, in a rather uncomfortable manner, she's asked me twice now to consider moving closer to the office. This, despite knowing that the salary she pays wouldn't feasibly cover the cost of renting near work, especially for just two days a week. Furthermore, this ""timeliness"" doesn't seem to apply across the board; we have VPs and managers with varied schedules, some fully remote and others regularly coming in late.  
  
Her approach made me feel like she was trying to push me to resign. There could be so many possible better ways to address the matter to show leadership but she chose the worst possible ways. If she assumes I come from a rich family and have parents to pay for my rent and relocation, well in that case, I could also quit. The first time she asked, she suggested that for whatever time I missed in the morning, I should make up the time after 5 pm in the office. I agreed and did as she suggested. But she is apparently still mad at seeing me doing it, and she asked me the second time to relocate.  
  
I recently switched my second-day commute to an expensive Uber ride to ensure punctuality and started adhering strictly to my 9-5 schedule, NO extra hours. This seemed to irk another senior employee (she's like the human-form surveillance camera), who seemed to monitor my timings. Honestly, you guys were the ones to ""friendly remind"" me about my 9-5 shcedule, so I'm sticking to it..both the 9 AND the 5) Frankly, the work culture here has been draining, bordering on depressing.  
  
**Seeking Advice:**  
  
Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice or perspective would be invaluable right now.

I have been working for this company for about 4 months now and last week my boss wanted me to make a weekly work log for me and the guy working under me. I’m pretty sure it’s for tracking how busy we get during the week.

She saw how much down time we get (about 3-4 hrs) considering we only work per art requests. Now, she wants me to assist two other employees working in the warehouse to help them get caught up with the orders, etc. I don’t have to go to the warehouse, all I need to do is sit in my office and email follow-ups until they find a new person for the job. 

Although it seems easy enough, I am worried this may go on forever and they won’t need to find another person for it. I’m only doing this to be a team player and show them I am an important asset to the company. How long should I do this for until I need to ask for a higher pay?

1612ucb,English Degree with No Experience; is a WFH Job Possible?,"So my current job finally announced back to work and taking a 1.5 hour bus to and from the office for $25/hr is unreasonable to me so I’m trying to find a new job that allows me to work from home.   
The thing is that I’m not sure where to start looking. I have a BA in creative writing and I’m pretty good at translating esoteric information. Given that I dropped out of Engineering prior to taking the degree gives me the ability to understand some pretty complex things and translate them into something for a board of directors to look at.   
I’m currently working in Los Angeles as a data entry position as an estimator, prior to that I worked in the call center section of that same company, and people actually praised my ability to deescalate some fiery callers which, although I didn’t like, I was pretty good at. Outside of all that my experience only boils down to retail and dominoes.   
What I’m trying to look for is a job that pays better than $25/hr and that actually would be good experience for a blossoming professional career. Total WFH would be perfect since I’m used to it and i love not getting ready until after i complete some morning assignments, but since I live near DTLA an office job wouldn’t be completely out of the question.   
I’m also trans/non-binary, so it would be wonderful if that job related to the Queer community in any way, though that is also something that doesn’t really bother me if that’s not in the cards.   
So what should I start looking for? Writing Copy sounds great but they all require 5 years of experience in the fields that they hire for, outside of that I don’t know of any other positions that would fit with all these skills I have. The only other thing on Indeed with my skills is English Teacher and I’m staying far away from Education for the time being.

It can be high stress, fast paced and long hours sometimes. I’m on salary so hours can be more or less any given time. I have recently been overwhelmed by volume and neglecting communication with customers trying to focus on my here and now. I have been slacking on all of it just trying to tread water so to speak. I have thought recently and in the past I may enjoy truck driving. Although the time away from home would be rough. Mainly because I enjoy spending time with my wife. However, I feel at times as though in the back of my mind I don’t really care about it and would rather do something else. I’m not even sure this makes sense. My job has great benefits including a pension. Almost unheard of in the private sector. Loads of PTO, flexibility on scheduling and working hours etc. I have trouble getting motivated to do the basics most days. Tried to renew my interest in what I am doing but have not been able to so far. Have a couple of long stretches of PTO coming up so hoping I just need a break from the burnt out feeling.

16122ts,Need support and advice navigating ADA accommodations with employer,"I will not be giving any specifics, but essentially I am in a situation in which I have requested work accommodations but have been met with little support and understanding from my employer. They are willing to make certain accommodations with limitations or conditions, which I can work around. I have asked if there is anyone in the company with more knowledge on how to effectively supporting employees with disabilities and have received zero resources nor have been directed to anyone who can help me. 

There are pre-existing issues that have nothing to do with me, but I have been investing so much energy into improving myself and being a better team member. Despite my effort, there has been a growing feeling of coldness from my team and it sucks. It has affected my mental health and makes me feel on edge at times. It seems like everyone focuses on my shortcomings rather than what I am doing well, even though I know I have ample skills to successfully fulfill my role. I am 100% willing to do whatever it takes to meet expectations, however, I need more support in certain areas to complete my work in an efficient manner and have not been getting that. My issue is more about bridging the gaps between my disability and having a more effective workflow that integrates with our process.

I often feel defeated, alone, and lost and don’t know who to get help from. I love this job and the work we do, but it has been feeling like many odds have been stacked up against me.

recently, there's this competition that requires a handful of money that is kind of out of budget on our side. though i really want it as it is aligned to my desired future, the money is stopping me from grabbing that chance. i'd much rather spend it on my family's needs over my desires. though, my parents assured me that if i wanted it that much, i should take the risk. but realistically, we need the money for our other priorities. also, for context, yes i am still a full-time student.

do you think such extracurriculars (or co-curriculars) lowkey guarantee a good future? are they worth the risk? should i grab them while i'm still (relatively) young? do these activities increase the chances of securing a good job when i grow older?",Lonely-Lack-9122,1,1.0,5,1692975717,2023-08-25 15:01:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1611po9/hi_i_would_like_to_have_some_advice_from_whoever/,8,2023
1611fv9,Dealing with being under appreciated at work? Is it to he expected?,"please excuse the formate I am on my phone. 
I (22M) just graduated and work in a small company in California. It has the typical culture of “We are all a family” which ofcourse means I am overworked and right now I feel so resentful. 

My boss has always had issues with slackers and people doing the bare minimum and before I joined the company was unorganized and lacked structure. 
My work is pretty unique that I manage a team but also end up finishing alot of projects myself. I came in I was giving a 110% trying to prove and esablish myself. I dont want to boast but I’ve managed to do some amazing things and finish some important projects with great results. Everyone can see it. 

Now my problem is that my boss doesn’t seem to acknowledge my work. he sometimes says a throw away comment about how amazing I am doing or in a conversation with a 3rd party he’ll boast about me. I am usually surprised at these moments because he doesn’t praise me directly or treat me the same way he treats others. I feel neglected, overworked, and under appreciated. 

The worst thing was that I finished a 3 month long project. It was with a very important client. It was a huge success for our company. All planned by me from scratch since it was a new type of work for the company. At the end my boss acknowledged all my direct reports, it was not much but he spoke with them individually and he gave them gift cards for appreciation. 

Meanwhile he completely ignored me. Just swept it under the rug and starting talking about a different project we now need to focus on and we spent the rest of the day working on something else. Zero appreciation. Zero acknowledgment. Not even a discussion or follow up about how the project went, how to improve etc.

The high and success that I felt after finishing the project all dropped down into resentment and depression. I don’t understand why he treats me like that or if he is pushing me too much but its so tiring. 

I dont have a lot of experience. Is this normal in the workplace? I know the view “ thats what the money is for” but I am not getting paid enough for all the effort I put in. 
Am I putting weird expectations on him because of the relaxed family culture?",SeriousBottle1629,1,1.0,3,1692975086,2023-08-25 14:51:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1611fv9/dealing_with_being_under_appreciated_at_work_is/,8,2023
16118u1,Regretting accepting promotion?,"I (37F) work for a company and was recently promoted from Business Development to Sales Director. I feel like I was tricked into taking this promotion, and am seeking advice on how to handle my situation.

Backstory: I've been with the company for 4 years. My boss, who was a friend, created this position for me, and I have built this into a 6 figure income with a solid sales pipeline and client base. I have largely done this by myself as my boss never trained me, just put me in the position and I took it and ran with it. 

In my original position as Business Development, I was only accountable for my own work, but they asked me to start helping the sales reps by following up on their work, which I was ok with because we all made more money with my follow up. My position was low stress, I made my own schedule, and I liked being responsible for myself only. 

Fast forward to 2 months ago, my boss told me he wanted to recommend me for the Sales Director position, putting me over 8 of our sales reps. He said I was already ""basically"" doing the job, and it was time to make it official. I recently had a hand in bringing on a new estimator who we expect to generate about 2-4 million in sales this year, which I will benefit from commission-wise. My boss told me that hiring this new estimator at a hefty salary would be considered my raise, and that ownership ""may"" increase my base salary because they felt it was strange to give me a title change without a salary increase, but it may only be $5,000 or so. I have never had a salary increase at this company, and I understand in sales positions like this, it's not always done because as you grow in your position, your commissions increase. There is no cap to my commissions. (We already hired this estimator, so it seemed weird to me that I should consider this my raise.)

My main problem is, as I've gotten into this, I am finding I was not already doing this job, and it is highly stressful. I feel like I would have been collecting commission on the new estimator's contracts anyway, and it's not even guaranteed what he will be bringing them in. But I have already made a huge difference in my new position by bringing to everyone's attention a huge discrepancy in our material pricing vs our competitors', so will be saving the company millions, as well as bringing in millions in new contracts by getting lower pricing from other manufacturers. I have already gotten one million in contracts with the new pricing that I led the team in securing. 

In my new position, I have found that my boss is doing almost no work, and I am picking up all of his slack - quite successfully though. I know that I and my team will make exponentially more money with me in this position, but I also feel it was unfair for the company to give me a ""promotion"" in title change only. Our sales have been down so far, but with me in this new position and the new contracts we have coming, we will now be on pace to hit our goal of 20% growth this year. 

I know that I will use the leverage in my new position to really drive growth for my department, and in turn make a LOT more money for everyone, but I feel I am being exploited in a way. They didn't replace me in my last position, so I am still doing my other job on top of managing everyone in my department now too. I feel I am doing my boss' job as well, which all my sales reps have noticed. 

I believe it was my fault for accepting the position without having a more concrete compensation package in place before, but I was told my job function wouldn't be changing much, and I figured it would be good for my resume anyway. I'm not wanting to back out of the promotion, but feel the company should have increased my base salary at least by something so as to not make me feel like I just got way more work and responsibility dumped on me for nothing really but a title. I also feel like as a woman, I might be taken advantage of here and I doubt they would give a man a promotion with no increase in salary. 

On one hand, I will make more money in this position because I'm a go-getter and will make the most of it, but I don't feel the company handled my promotion properly. I know this is partially my fault. What would you all do if you found yourself in this situation?

1610yb6,New graduate - do grades really matter?,"Hello everyone,

I have recently graduated and have been looking for a job for about a month now, with no luck so far. Of course I understand things like these take a long time, especially when reading other posts and hearing how long it took for my peers to land their first job after graduating, but I can't help but to worry whether I might have messed up my chances by not working hard enough during my studies. 

I've recently graduated with a master's degree in economics with most of my grades being the bare minimum to qualify as a pass. Now I could rationalize it with excuses but the reality of it is, at least in my head, this is sort of what I need to work with right now and hope that someone hires me despite my grades being horrendous, so I wanted to ask all of you: in your experience, do employers care a lot about the grades, particularly in business related job positions? Am I screwed now with garbage grades, accept it and look for jobs outside my education? Going back to school, at least for now is definitely not an option as my financial situation is in the gutters too.

I'm from Europe, looking for jobs within finance, accounting, business administration etc., of course applying for entry/junior positions given I'm just a recent graduate, in case that matters for Your input. Not a native English speaker either so let me know if something I've written makes no sense, I'll try to rephrase it.

1610fwt,Stay or go?,"What would you do if you were in my shoes?

Currently, I work remotely doing data entry. I like this and appreciate working from home. However, I only make about $35k gross I’ve been in this role for 6 months and have kept my ear to the ground for opportunities to advance & earn more, but have been unsuccessful. I’m interested in being an implementation specialist. 

Before doing data entry I was (and technically still am) a registered dietitian. I was working in a LTC/SNF facility and got a bad taste in my mouth from admin. I appreciated the overall routine of it (sometimes things would pop up, but nothing crazy), and the support from the company I worked for. However, it was obviously a grim environment to work in. I made about $64k gross at this job. 

Recently, I’ve been presented with an opportunity to go back into LTC but for travel work. I’d be covering multiple facilities in my region, so I’d be traveling up to 2 hours for some sites. I’d only have to go to each site about 1-2 every other week. The salary would be $60-65k and I’d be reimbursed for mileage. 

Right now, my partner makes ~80k. We are striving to own a home one day and upgrade his car, along with paying off our student loans. We each have about $30k in our bank accounts combined. 

Is it worth it to go back to my higher paying role, or should I be patient and hope for some opportunity to grow in my new area of work?

16102h0,Los Angeles Job Oppurtunities,"Hey guys,

I’m 22 and I’m thinking of moving to Los Angeles/Socal in a years time.

I’ve graduated with a business degree in Ireland with an A (unsure of GPA equivalent). I also have a 4 month internship that I did with EY Dublin in audit that I decided wasn’t for me even though I got a offered a spot of their grad programme.

I also completed a 3 month internship as a data analyst which worked out about $55k a year in the office of a food manufacturing company after I did a semester studying at the University of California. Both jobs I didn’t learn a ton of skills as they didn’t have a lot of work for me but still got them on my resume and would get good references from both if requested.

I am now about to complete a masters in Financial Management in a reputable university in the Netherlands which I assume I will get pretty solid grades in.

I plan on coming over on a J1 graduate visa and then transferring to H1B once if I can get a better job at a company will sponsor me. (My previous LA internship already said they would sponsor me)

I’m just wondering what kinda salary I should expect moving over and if I would find it easy to get a job giving my qualifications and employment history? Also would it be much better in Chicago or New York?

160y8y1,Stay at easy job or go back to old corporate job?,"I’ve been at my current role for about 3 years. I got it when I moved back to my hometown during the start of Covid and took at 25k pay cut. I also have limited benefits.

The job is easy compared to my old one. I’m left alone outside of work hours and vacations are flexible. I enjoy the freedom and it leaves me energy at the end of the day. I don’t get the morning dread most days. 

The downside is that the company has a terrible reputation and I’m sort of embarrassed to say where I work. They recently hired some new people who are doing things to turn it around but I don’t know if it’s too little too late. I’m not a fan of the boss and one of the people I have to work with there aggravates me to no end. The rest I really like. My work load is going to increase soon though because we hired another sales person. 

My old job reached out with a fully remote (+travel) position. I enjoyed the job because of the creative aspects and I liked working with them. The firm is respectable and I got to use my brain. What I didn’t like was the workload and travel expectations. At the end of my career there, I felt like I had no control over my life and was checked out and bedraggled. I had no energy at the end of the day but I was also in an unfulfilling relationship and didn’t have friends in that town.

They came up to my hometown and took me out to dinner on Monday. I explicitly stated my concerns. They said that has gotten better as they have grown and the workload is more distributed. Basically I name my pay/terms and we negotiate from there. They did send me average hours for different roles over 33 weeks and it was around 42. But I’m not sure if those are billed hours or working hours. They aren’t always the same. 

I’m fairly torn. I want to use my brain, like my coworkers, work for a respectable firm, AND have a life outside of work. I want to feel in control and not owned. New/old job said there will probably be an adjustment period of six months as they acclimate to my demands but I should still expect a few long weeks and some travel. However, no one has worked a weekend in a long time.

I was even praised by senior management for exemplary performance within such a short time frame.  However, following my 90-day review, my boss threw me a curveball.

This would involve sitting in a small room with the rest of the team, which isn’t ideal for the nature of our work, which involves a lot of phone calls.

As such I have been applying to many different engineering jobs to start my career.I have received two offers thus far.  
The first offer is at an Australian Defense Company in Sydney as a graduate hardware or systems engineer (P1 level). Pay would be a total package of \~85k (AUD) with clear progression.  
The second offer is at a well known Automotive company in America as a Mechanical Design Engineer (P2 level). Pay would be a package of \~120k USD (still negotiating). This job would have a much higher workload (I am sure you can guess which company it is lol).  
In terms of actual work, I feel that I would enjoy the job in America much more, however, long term I do want to be back in Australia (If I took the American job I would aim to be there for \~2yrs before returning, of course things may change). I am a bit concerned about how hard it would be to find an engineering job if/when I come back after this time. Furthermore, perhaps I would end up in the Australian Defense industry as an engineer anyway when I come back (there doesn't seem to be much else in terms of engineering in Aus... besides mining/consulting/startups.)  
So I am a bit conflicted. One one hand I have a great graduate position in Sydney (where I live) with lots of room for progression in the industry I would likely end up in regardless (the safe option). On the other hand, I have an amazing opportunity at a company with a high degree of engineering recognition, a job I would likely enjoy more and much better pay. Any advice on this/how to make a decision would be greatly appreciated!

I'm planning on choosing a career in engineering, but friends of mine have told me not to. They say that most engineers do not end up in an engineering job, and that most of them change fields futher into their career (they say data science,etc is what they are changing to).  
  
I really want to know, is this true?  
  
I've got pretty decent highschool grades, and a lot of people have advised me to become a doctor as well because of them, but I'm unsure of the life that lies beyond university... life as a doctor?  
  
One doctor told me they wished they had changed careers, which I really don't hear about much. He told me that there are many more fields out there than medicine, and advised me to choose a better path. Then there's my uncles and aunts, who are engineers, telling me to become a doctor, which they see as better.  
  
I would really like any advice you have to offer.

160ukg2,Need some post-MBA career advice,"I currently work in healthcare administration, and getting my mba from a state school has given me a good pay bump. However, I have my eyes set on either working for a pharma company or worst comes to worst, staying in healthcare administration and trying to rise up the ranks.

 Do you think getting a masters in public health would be a good idea? Or a masters in comp sci- data analytics? There are some Ivy League MPH programs that offer online but I don’t think MPH would help for pharmaceutical roles. A little lost, the mba got me so far but I’m looking to continue getting educated.

I have dreams of being closer to the world of European football (not playing, but working for the club or being an agent) but I don't know what's the path to reach there. I'm preparing for GMAT/GRE because doing masters leads to more job opportunities, but I don't feel like studying, and I have no interest in the real world. All I care about is watching football, reading news related to it etc. Everyone around me is saying to get serious, and following a form of entertainment (football) so passionately will not lead my life anywhere.

160ub8n,What fields of work are there which utilize the work experience I have thus far?,"I have been working in research and development, mostly at universities, for some years now. I have some ability in coding, research and development, algorithm work and coming up with independent solutions to problems. I am unsure at this point what my current coding and research skills qualify me for and what kinds of options and careers are out there for me, including options I haven't thought of.  
  
I have a physics PhD and research experience in thermodynamics, systems at equilibrium, information theory and machine learning. I suspect that I would not be able to work in fields such as software or web development; plus from what I have seen these fields are oversaturated and will only become more crowded as development work becomes more remote and workers from East and South Asia and elsewhere flood the market. I am trying to find out what roles in research and development, algorithms, data science or related fields are out there where I can use the experience I have so far and perhaps be trained and learn on the job as needed.

160tlpe,Worried I have been scammed with a generous job offer. Next steps?,"Hello all,  
Recently I received a job offer that seems too good to be true and I proceeded with the process out of sheer enthusiasm and poor judgement caused by chronic sleep deprivation over multiple weeks. It was only after I got around 5 hours of sleep I woke up with a bit of clarity and realized something seemed amiss. I realize now what a fool I've been and am quite scared about what's going to happen next. I understand it will be tempting to ridicule me for my gullibility, and rightly so, but please also help me with resources or guidance if you feel so inclined. I will detail the timeline of events ad they have occurred and list some concerns and then some questions. I truly appreciate any guidance rendered. Thank you.  
After writing this all out I feel fairly certain now that I was scammed. So, if you don't feel inclined to read every detail then please at least help me out with this question: What can I do to mitigate the damage coming my way and protect myself now that I seem to have given a picture of my ID,  sensitive information like the bank I use as well as my social security number to a person who is potentially malevolent, as well as cashed a check from them? What are my next steps? Do I contact the police?  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
The Timeline  
2 days ago (8/23), I received a text message from a number I didn't recognize claiming to be a recruiter from Company X (I won't be using any real names here). The text message started by asking my name then went on to say that my resume was reviewed on their company applicant stack database (indeed/ziprecruiter) for an open position as a data entry clerk. He mentioned the position was remote and the pay rate was $32. He asked me if I was interested, to which I replied yes. Now, I hadn't applied to this company before, but I had in the past few days been applying for data entry positions.  
The next day, I received a text from the recruiter mentioning the interview would be conducted via text over Microsoft Teams. After confirming I had the software for the interview, he sent me a link to send a message to the interviewer. I linked up with the interviewer and answered a few questions. The interviewer then said he ""I need you to stay online in order for the Head Department to ascertain the interview process"", he then said I was qualified and offered me the job. He reiterated the benefits of the job as well as the fact that I would be receiving a start-up check to purchase a laptop, the software as well as a Cisco UCSC C480-M5 Standard Base Chassis Rack Server and storage cabinet. He then went on to explain how the training would go (I would respond to him as my supervisor until the training materials had been acquired and then would be assigned a training supervisor who would reach out to me to schedule the virtual training) and the next steps. Asking me for my Full name, Address, City, State, Zip Code, Cell and Email.  
After that he mentioned I would be receiving some paperwork that I would need to fill out and send back as part of the onboarding process. I received an email from a third person (ostensibly) that was from HR with a copy of an I9 form for me to fill out, the employee contract for me to sign and date and then he requested I send a picture of my ID for verification as well as a voided check - which at the time I thought would be for direct deposit purposes. I did everything except send a voided check as I don't have a checkbook on hand and my bank was closed. I mentioned this to him and he said that was okay to send it tomorrow. The sensitive information I gave out was my ID and my social security number, as well as the bank I use and my contact information as well as address.  
After sending the information and having it seemingly approved, I received a message on Microsoft Teams from the recruiter mentioning that the financial department approved of my procurement for the training supplies and the HR department would be sending me an echeck that was for the purposes of procuring the laptop as well as other training materials aforementioned. Up to this point I had been getting a strong sense that this is too good to be true but my suspicions were quelled a bit when said they would be sending me a check. I reasoned (such as it was in my addled state) that usually scams are identified when people ask YOU the send THEM money, not the other way around. However, I've since come to realize that any request of monetary transfer should be met with suspicion.  
I received an email from the HR person I spoke with before with 2 documents: one the front of a check for $2100 and two the back of the check for me to endorse and deposit through my mobile deposit on my banks app. I did so and received confirmation from my bank that the check deposited and would be available within 2 business days. I checked my account and saw the deposit there with tomorrow (now todays 8/25) date on it. The HR person and the recruiter mentioned that I should screenshot the confirmation receipt and send it to them. I did so, reasoning that they needed that for accounting purposes.  
Finally, after all that was completed, I received congratulations and welcomes again from the Interviewer and the HR person via their respective communications platforms (Teams and Email) and was told to report back to the Teams conversation today at 8 am to continue with the procurement process. Currently it is 4:46 and I was awaiting my time to report to the Interviewer on teams and take the next steps. Now it seems, I am awaiting to hear back from much wiser and more experienced people with what to do to protect myself going forward.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Concerns/Red Flags  
1. The recruiter and the interviewer seemed a little pushy. Automatically assuming the interview would be conducted once I confirmed I had the software. As well using terms like ""you are to report now"" frequently. Also, two of the requested I reply with specific terms like ""I'm open"" or ""Done"" during various parts of the process and would signify the term to use in the same manner (by putting it in parentheses). The recruiter also would often ask ""how many minutes will it take"" when I mentioned I had to go to the bank to get a checkbook or go to the library to print the documents out.  
2. All 3 of the people I had contact with seemed to use strange grammar and have a peculiar manner of speaking, as well as some typos. I had the slightest suspicion they were all the same person at once, but I think I was blinded by my excitement and downplayed it as some sort of 'nonchalance'. Also, the use of the phrase ""You have done well"" a few times through the process struck me a little funny.  
3. They asked for my ID and other sensitive info that one would find on some onboarding documents - which I should have thought at the time to determine if that was standard practice but have since come to realize that could be a potential red flag. I guess I thought in the moment that as a remote job it makes sense that I would need to provide proof of identification.  
4. The interview was quite easy, asking general questions mainly and the interviewer didn't seem to response too much to what I was saying during the process itself. After the process he seemed to respond more pointedly to my questions and seemed to be understanding about my circumstances.   
5. I heard back in around 20 minutes that I was qualified, and they offered me the position. Again, I really should have seen this as a major red flag (considering a position like this would be highly sought after) but I just was not using common sense. As previously mentioned, I've been chronically sleep deprived the past 2 weeks and things that normally would raise suspicion just didn't at the time.  
6. Throughout the process I quelled my suspicion by looking up company X and found that while they didn't have great reviews by consumers for the products, they sold they did have a 91% with the BBB. However, I later realized that there wasn't any real concrete information given to me that confirms I was speaking to someone from that company. They supplied the company website during the interview process, which I perused and noted that they weren't advertising an opening for a data entry position.   
7. The employee contract didn't strike me as suspicious at the time, but I haven't seen many as I'm quite young and couldn't fully judge. It was short however (2 pages) and didn't list all the benefits one would expect for working full time (like health care, dental, 401k, etc..) rather under the Benefits subsection it says ""As a regular employee of the company, you will be eligible to participate in a number of company-sponsored benefits. In addition, you will be entitled to paid vacation in accordance with the Company's vacation policy, as in effect from time to time."" Rereading this is striking me as suspicious now given the omission of standard benefits as well as the phrase ""from time to time"".  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
To recapitulate: I am very concerned now that I have provided sensitive information to someone with malicious intent. Specifically, I am concerned that my sharing of my SSN, address, contact info, ID and cashing a check given to me from them has made me vulnerable to identity theft among other deleterious financial circumstances. I am imploring the good people of this subreddit for guidance on how best to proceed to save myself as much pain as possible. How can I get ahead of this and shut down any potential malfeasance? With whom should I be in contact with to facilitate a safe resolution to this problem?

160sp08,I think I hate my internship.,"I secured an internship at a prominent bank in my home country, and I was really excited to learn about banking and build a foundation for life after school (I'll be graduating in a year).

After just a month, I'm very unhappy for two key reasons:

1. Mismatch: The department I'm placed in doesn't align with my skills and ambitions. I suspect I was stereotyped due to my psychology major. The department focuses on loan collection using calls and emails, and interpersonal relations are not my strength, and neither did I focus on that in uni. I excel in research and numerical analysis within psychology.

2. Basic Work and Scarcity: The work revolves around basic Excel tasks. While my team lauds my proficiency, it's far below what I'm capable of, having worked on basic machine learning models. I tried to contribute with advanced BI tools, but my team only has access to Excel due to limitations. Moreover, I'm not getting enough tasks. I take pride in my work quality, but I've received minimal tasks and even though I've asked for more, my requests have been ignored.

Other interns in different departments share their workload experiences, making me and a fellow intern feel ashamed of our lack of accomplishments. Although the people and perks are great, I haven't made any meaningful impact. I sought to switch departments initially, but HR declined. I'm looking to break into finance, even though it's not my area of expertise, and with the internship season over, leaving now feels like a waste. What should I do?",-deji-,3,1.0,1,1692950435,2023-08-25 08:00:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/160sp08/i_think_i_hate_my_internship/,8,2023

I've been at my role for a little over two years and in that time I've also gotten promoted. The projects that I'm on are challenging, mostly because of misalignment between team members. Too many cooks in the kitchen or maybe not enough. I've always thought that if you weather the storm you'll end up on the other side a little better for having stuck it out. But lately I feel like my job is taking a huge toil on me and I feel that my work is suffering. I feel as if I have the biggest opportunity of my career but it's making me miserable and I don't feel like I am growing in my profession. I've just had to learn how to handle people who make it difficult for me to get my projects across the finish line. I just feel like looking back on my time at my current company has been nothing but failure. I want to start looking for a new job, but I also want to be honest about why I am leaving. I don't know who I should talk to about this. I feel that my manager has added to the problem, but I also feel a sense of loyalty towards them. I am hesitant to talk to HR because that's a major escalation that might do harm to the team. 

I still somewhat want to leave on good terms because there have been people here that have been kind and helpful.

160nn89,Bullied at work,"Hi, I’ve been having issues at my current job. I won’t give too much info on my job, but I work in tech at a school. I’m younger, 20 year old male, while the majority of other people at my work are 20+ years older than I am. I got this job because I recently graduated college and getting started in my career. 

The issues I’ve been having is that I feel very bullied at work, if the title didn’t give it away. Some everyday occurrences are me being called a dumba** everyday and always made fun of. It’s hard for me to work a lot of the times because I’m put under a lot of pressure from always being called stupid and I don’t want to mess up. Which makes me mess up even more. Ever since starting one specific coworker pawns off a lot of work onto me. I have basically been given the responsibilities of another person most of the time plus what I try and do. Since there is lots to know at my work I am still needing to learn certain things often. When I ask in how to be taught these things I’m often told “you’ve learned this already” in a very rude and threatening tone. Or once again called inappropriate names. 

I am also very frequently made fun of for my appearance. Especially my hair, I’m ginger. Trust me being made fun of your whole life for something I can’t control is not fun. Another thing is that I do very intense exercise frequently. I eat ALOT so I don’t starve to death. I’m always called fat boy and told I shouldn’t be given lunch breaks.

The other day the stress was just too much and I really got close to snapping. I got very emotional and now am being picked on for being too sensitive. I tried to stand up for myself by telling my coworkers to knock it off, but just get told I need tougher skin. But does that justify being called vulgar names all day and making me stressed so bad I mess up alot of my work?

I have been applying all summer for entry-level healthcare consulting & healthcare admin positions to no avail.  
I am becoming frankly depressed, stressed & discouraged. My major seems to hold no value in the real world. I see all these liberal arts majors, community health, health admin, global studies & business majors get chosen over me for positions I am qualified for. My major was much tougher than those & I know this bc I have taken upper-level community health, admin & fin/accy classes for my own electives and I have seen what my close friends studied over the years. I have exhausted my connections, I reach out to recruiters & people in a position I want to see myself 5 years down the road but nothing materializes. My applications never get past the screening system.  
I am at the point where I am willing to work a year at minimum wage to gain experience and I am not even kidding. Fortunately, I have supportive parents that let me live with them while I figure this out but I cannot imagine being in a position that does not have this safety.  
I am not a cocky or egotistical individual but I am very annoyed with how little credit my STEM major proves intellectual competency to employers, especially when compared to non-STEM degrees. I have obtained two sought-after certs in the healthcare finance field.  
At this point it seems like going to medical school is the easier alternative although I really don’t want to pursue that career after finding a passion for healthcare consulting/admin. Any advice and words of encouragement are appreciated.",lidy421,1,1.0,1,1692933829,2023-08-25 03:23:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/160njsn/having_issues_finding_my_first_job_out_of_school/,8,2023
160nizn,Asking for better title,"I'm thinking to ask for a better job title that more closely aligns with what I do. Manager - vs specialist. I've had a productive stretch with many great results. I'm a very smart and hard worker. The boss and senior leadership is always impressed with my work. Also, a newcomer with much less experience than me recently joined a related department and got a similar title. In previous job roles I had manager titles. 

My boss is quite supportive in general so I figure it might go well. My work is impactful and even exceeds that of some of the other managers. Do you think I should proceed?

160n6r9,How to handle a coworker,"Sorry for formatting I'm on mobile.

For the past few years there have been no issues with my coworker. They are a quality worker and I have ended up as a jack of many things.

I have been handling process related materials for a few years now with no issues. The past 2 years as a team we have changed up a lot of things to stream line getting tasks done.

Recently this coworker has been talking over me in meetings. They don't seem to listen when I explain that some changes aren't as simple as they seem. I am told that they know how to do it and it shouldn't take the time frame I am saying I can do the work in.

They have also been wanting changes made because one employee has questions about something that I handle. In the past the process for changes or suggestions was put in as a ticket and brought to our working teams to see if they wanted to make changes.

Since this worker has been doing a lot of meetings I think in an effort to get more accomplished the voting and asking others has seemed to stop. When someone makes a comment about how something could be better the change is expected to be implemented.

Similar things have been happening with documents as well. In the past documents would be reviewed updated and changes checked and voted to finalize. Now the documents we use to track with change logs are not being maintained with major versions. They are being updated with changes saved as if it were final without updates to the change logs or version.

I had been asked a month ago by my boss for some information this coworker had and then asked her for it. I was then asked why I am asking about her job and she wouldn't share what I was asked to get. Then I was told I must have misunderstood what my boss was looking for as she understood him to be wanting to know specifically what I am doing.

Now she has been going over any work I post or have done. I understand that their job is quality but the issue is that all emails withe always have multiple people. I'm being called misleading with information or wrong. Though when I reply with explanation about why something is written how it is she will respond after removing most of my original reply. Her reply will contain heavy criticism and she will copy the boss. 

I am not sure why my full responses are not in the email chain or why they are removed or picked apart line by line.

This person is not my boss but does work close with him and another person.

Is this concerning?


For clarification I don't have issue with making changes or updates and I do say this all the time. I am open for making things better. It just seems recently this is a bit heavy handed. I was pretty much told to stay out of her work but why is mine being dove into?",thistle_thatch,1,1.0,1,1692932810,2023-08-25 03:06:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/160n6r9/how_to_handle_a_coworker/,8,2023

160m317,Need some advice on what to major in. Computer science or business?,"Need some advice on what to major in.

So from the title, I’ll just cut the chase.

I’m really interested in both computer science and business.

Im gonna talk about computer science first here
So yeah I love the idea and programming am getting some experience in python and wanna major more in cybersecurity 
Pros.
It’s in high demand and that’s only going to increase 
Pay is pretty good 
4 years of college and then that’s about it for the bachelor’s degree at least here in my country.
It’s going to probably expand more in the future by banks,companies, online businesses 
Who knows what else maybe even future cars with a software or smth.
Cons
LITERALLY EVERYONE IS MAJORING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE/IT RELATED STUFF
High competition am not the only one who wants to do this
Again, can be self taught so really why go to college if u can self study and get some experience then move on to an entry level job.
U gotta keep up to date and languages used by the computer so constant learning I think meaning am not just going to use python maybe some other thing Is gonna up and I might have to learn it.
From what I’ve seen it’s not easy to get that first job.
U also have to be kinda outstanding and not like the rest cuz these people get cut for reasons I can talk about if someone’s really interested.


As for business
Am not too sure about the pros and cons I can research that but what I know that it isn’t extremely difficult compared to CS.
I can get into management of information technology which is smth I want to do.
I heard that business degree is versatile but you gotta work up the ladder.
I would guess it isn’t as competitive as computer science.
Am not sure about the cons



Now moving on from this am sure both of them require math skills and my math skills are not that good. I don’t hate the subject, I simply suck at it. That was one of the reasons that made me wanna back out of computer science and cybersecurity.

I feel dedicated and am willing to put in the work needed for computer science the thing is my parents keep telling me it’s competitive as hell and other ppl with less qualification might have the chance that u have.
To be honest that discourages me a LOT.
Like all the excitement and dedication I had to learn python C+ all of these things are getting much smaller compared to before and am at the point where I went from “yea I’ll put in the work I’ll self study I’ll teach myself those required skills and even look for an internship last year or 3rd year of my college”
To “am not sure anymore if it’s worth it or I’ll be able to stand out.”
Business feels less mentally exhausting than computer science but I don’t know what to do or pick anymore

160lpb7,Do I say in resume/interviews that I don’t currently live in the city I’m applying in?,"Quick question here. I’m pretty fresh in my field (graduated in May). I’m currently working full time, but am going to be applying for jobs pretty soon in a city that’s an hour/hour and a half away depending on traffic. I am in month-to-month right now in my current lease, and will move once I get a job.

Do I say in my resume/interview that I don’t live in the city, but will be moving for this job? Does that look bad from an employer’s perspective and potentially might lead them to passing me over?

I’m hoping to get my start date pushed back about a month from when I get an to give me time to find a place to move, is that common for an employer to be cool with that? I know a month is pretty quick to find a place to move, but can commute if I have to until I move, and have a buddy in the city I can crash with.

I don’t feel like I’m the best on the spot liar, so not sure if lying about my location is the best route, but am not opposed to it if it seems like it will greatly increase my chances of landing a job.

160kilb,Should I report a coworker?,"I'll start off by saying that I work for a police department as a community officer. I have a co worker that seems to act like Mr nice guy when around co workers. As soon as I'm alone with him he treats me like garbage. Today he was blocking a road so no traffic could come that way because there was a search warrant going on. He gets off work at 4:30. I finish school crossing at 4:00 so I called him to let him know I would head that way when finished to take his spot so he could go home. Apparently I didn't get there fast enough. He called me 10 minutes later asking where I was. I told him on the way be there soon. When I arrived he had a dog on a leash. Apparently a lost dog came running up to him. He attempts to hand me the leash. I I tell him that I cannot take the dog as I am there to block traffic. He instantly gets red faced and tells he isnt dropppijng it off on the way back and he'll just leave it here or give it away. I suggested again he take the dog not even 5 minutes down the road and drop it off at the shelter or I can do it but he'd have to stay and block traffic. I can see in his eyes how angry he was. He explains in an angry tone that's he's off work. Its 4:17 at this point. I tell him you'll just have to stay late today then and explained that I stayed late 2 hours last shift because I work the night shift and there's nobody to cover for me. He then goes on to tell me "" you'll never work like me"" which I'm assuming means "" you'll never work as hard as I do. I replied with guess ill have to talk to someone about your bad attitide. I've dealt with this person in the past before but never reported him. He once told me in the past to"" just get out of the way because I'm just getting in the way"". I'm not sure how to deal with him. I ended up finding the owner of the dog and he refused to answer his cellphone and ignored dispatch when they called him to a call after he left. What should I do?

160jx20,"Is it okay to do an internship in policy research after full time work experience in a (slightly) unrelated field? (NYC, USA)","I graduated a couple years ago with a Master’s in political science and have about two years of full time work experience, not counting internships. I’ve been looking for a policy/data analysis position at a policy org, think tank, or government. Looking for a few months now and no luck (very low interview-application ratio). I don’t know why that is; I’ve spoken to several people in the field and the only advice they had was to keep trying and networking. But since 1- I’ve gotten good feedback on my resume; 2- I usually meet most of the qualifications for the job I’m applying for, I suspect it’s due to the lack of relevant experience.

Although I have the relevant degree and transferable skills, my professional background is mainly in communications, PR, and data analytics in marketing, not policy analysis. I suspect that people who have more relevant experience, e.g. internships or work for govt agencies, policy orgs, etc., are probably more desirable to the places I’m applying to. I don’t know for sure because almost nobody provides feedback if I get rejected after an interview. But since this is my best guess, I got offered a policy research internship at a non-profit and am considering taking it to break into this field. Is this a good idea? Would it help me get a full time position as a policy analyst?

The only concern I have is my earning potential dropping after the internship—I’d be starting from scratch even though I already have a couple years of work experience under my belt.",akkountthrow,1,1.0,3,1692924290,2023-08-25 00:44:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/160jx20/is_it_okay_to_do_an_internship_in_policy_research/,8,2023

160ikms,Career coach? Worth $11k?,"Hey there!

I’ve been working with a career coach the last 8 weeks as part of a program. It cost $4k for 8 weeks.  They’ve been great and I learned a lot. I applied for more jobs than I ever thought I possibly could. I put the work in. I’ve taken several interviews and have been developing my interview skills and crafted my answers. I’m still on my job hunt 2 months into it. I am employed but would really like to shift careers. 

Now that I’m through the 8 weeks. I have an opportunity to join his scale program. To get help to continue my job search and then develop my skills and career related things after I’ve gotten my next job. It is $15k for 12 months. If I agree to join the program by Monday (8/28) he’ll count the $4k I’ve already paid making it only $11k with a monthly installment of line $915. 

That just seems like so much money. I really don’t have the money to spare. I already put part of that first $4K on a credit card. I haven’t used my credit cards in two years aside from that. And I really don’t want to rake up more debt month to month. I COULD afford to make payments on my credit card but wouldn’t be able to pay it off soon until I have a better paying job. 

I need advice. Is this $11k investment worth it. I’m trying to get a job that pays minimum $20k more than I’m making now but some of the salaries for the positions I’m applying for pay even more than that. It just seems difficult to justify right now.  My family is strongly against it. So I’m just looking for unbiased opinions. 

Are career coaches worth it? Mine has been great so far but spending so much money and locking myself almost into a “lease” with him and his services gets my stomach in knots. I don’t regret spending the $4k for the 8 week program and I gained a lot from it. Just want some outside thoughts. Has anyone used a career coach?

160i1gy,Should I Quit My Position I Helped Make?,"I live in the United States, A couple years ago I was telling the owner of the restaurant I've worked at since I was 16 (22M) that my dream job was to own a food truck or a coffee shop/cafe. His reaction was ""let's open a coffee truck!"" I was making 16.25/hr at the time.

Time goes by of planning, waiting, ordering supplies, a custom-built food truck (25x8ft). Which the owner fronted all of the expenses. In the meantime, I was in CC getting my AA in CIS. I had made a website, did some design work on the truck, and worked in the restaurant still. The owner had said I would be getting a manager position when the truck opened with a pay raise and such.

A few months down the line we were talking, and the topic got brought up again. Except this time, it was ""we will have to keep you at the same pay until we know the food truck will be profitable."" I understood but wasn't really happy with it. This restaurant doesn't have any management structure other than the owners and the owner's sons are definitely in charge, the expeditor is 2nd in charge. But the expeditor changes about 2 times a day. This let to tension between cooks, a lot of chests puffing and conflict because everyone felt they were in charge and didn't respect each other. This led me to leave the restaurant and pursue a career with my soon to have degree (Field Systems Tech at H&R Block.)

About 10 months down the line, I got really bored of my job and heard the food truck was going to open again, asked for my job back, got it back, and helped put together the truck (created a whole menu, made a website, marketed, did bookkeeping for everyday cash flow). While I was gone, the other senior kitchen staff got a rase to 17/hr. from the 16.25. I didn't get it until about two months after I came back. I have been back for about 5 months now.

Now the truck has a dual purpose, I am open in the restaurant parking lot weekday mornings for four hours a day selling my breakfast/coffee/boba menu, we also bring it to events around the state. I cook by myself in the mornings, clean, prep, close, and do bookkeeping every day. When we go to events, I stock the truck from the restaurant supplies, do the graphic design for the menu for the day (which I also did the graphic design for my menu) cook/serve the entire event. At the end of the event everyone helps clean, but the day after I go in to bring all of the food into the restaurant we didn't use, all of the dirty utensils, pans, and cookware. Chemical clean both flattops, scrub the grill, just do a deep clean after events, and unpack everything back in the truck for the mornings that I put away before events.

My issue is, I feel that while I get all of the tips for the mornings, I work by myself, the tips from events are split equally among everyone who works them, even though I make the menu, stock, cook, load, unload, and deep clean at every event. I also have not been given a raise from the 17/hr. that all of the other cooks in the restaurant make, even though they just cook or open/close. I am not offered serving shifts like the other cooks even though I give light hints that I could really use the extra money for bills and such. I work 20hrs a week at the truck and make up the small hours by working a 12hr shift and 10hr shift on Saturday and Sunday respectfully.

Now that I have my degree, I want to work at an IT job and make more money, have benefits, and have the weekends off, but nobody else knows/wants to run the truck but me so the \~10k of equipment used for the mornings at the truck would be a waste. Am I being overworked/undervalued or am I just being entitled?

The owner says if it does good, I could end up running my own truck one day, I'm hoping with time and patience that will happen, but I don't want to miss out on experience from my degree that could help me make more in the future.",samarium_97,2,1.0,1,1692919737,2023-08-24 23:28:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/160i1gy/should_i_quit_my_position_i_helped_make/,8,2023

160g9s4,I want to quite nursing to be a programmer. Help.,"To start, I'm 33 years old and have been practicing as a registered nurse for a decade. I've finally decided to gradually leave nursing to pursue a path towards being a programmer.  
  
I'm scared. I do not know anything about programming besides learning the basics of HTML and CSS. I bought this big book of Coding for dummies, started a tutorial on web development on freecodecamp and mimo and find it really enjoyable learning so far. I plan to self-learn moving forward because I want to be able to do this at my own pace and work around a full-time job.  
  
I've always been interested in tech but have been discouraged by family and peers because 10 years ago nursing was deemed a stable job. That bit might be true then and even now, but nursing has just taken a toll on my physical and mental health. I'm constantly in fight and flight mode at work and being around people who are also equally as stressed does not really allow me space to shift to a different 'mode' even if I wanted to. Also, being naturally introverted, the constant interaction with people can be super draining. This is what motivated me to transition into a career than might suit me better.  
  
As a nurse in 2023 I earn around $100k annually (gross, incl penal rates and overtime). I have no debt, no mortgage, I live with my parents (just culturally normal for me and also practical). I actually feel that I'm in a good place to start transitioning. Eventually, I plan to take less shifts at work to devote some time to learning and starting small projects to apply what I've learned.  
  
My question is...  
  
Given where I am NOW with what little I know about coding - how long will it generally take to be able to secure a job in IT? I'm not expecting to be a developer straight off the bat, I just want to be able to get my foot in the door and work my way there.  
  
Also, I'm not looking to get rich - I simply want to be able to work without compromising my health and work-life balance. However, I'd be lying if I said money doesn't matter.  
  
My next question is...  
  
Am I absurd for thinking that I may be able to earn around $100k again say in 1 or 2 years after switching careers?  
  
My last question is...  
  
If there is anyone out there who has done exactly what I'm about to do here at 33yo or older, was it worth it?  
  
P.S. I'm a total noob. I know I am naive, but I'm genuinely wanting to grow and learn and contribute to society better than I am now.

160g1so,Does Linkedin help any? I want to close it but don't want to hurt future opportunities,"There's a couple of reasons why I would prefer to close it.

\#1. I changed jobs and moved on, but I feel seeing all these contacts from past job and their posts, it's holding me back, like emotionally attaching me to a place I'm no longer at and which was actually very toxic.

\#2. I also keep seeing everyday announcements about people getting this manager position, or that director position, etc... and while my current job is not bad at all, it's stressing me to the point of feeling like my next gig has to be a big jump or something but I don't really care, I just want a job that I enjoy and which pays enough to do what I want. 

\#3. Also very annoying when one of them gets a good gig, they go from having been inactive for years, to being extremely active so that they appear on people's feeds. 

\#4. I feel seen by people that probably don't have my best interest at heart. ( even turned public off I guess if people are on the app, they still find me).

With all this said, if I shut my linkedin, will I hurt my chances of landing a great next gig? Or should I Just change my perspective on it and ignore all the stuff I dislike about it?",False_Lingonberry919,1,0.6700000166893005,17,1692915274,2023-08-24 22:14:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/160g1so/does_linkedin_help_any_i_want_to_close_it_but/,8,2023
160fj7d,"I went sour on Nursing and don’t want to go back, but","So I used to work in Nursing, for about 3 years. My longest job. At first I mostly enjoyed it, with a few duties I didn’t like: So much nudity, intimate cleaning, back injuries, unpleasant coworkers. Also sexual harassment ignored by supervisor.

Anyways, I felt I had to leave. The good parts were gone, it was just all terrible.

My last 2 jobs are Tech Phone Support. I hated them in different ways than Nursing, but at least no nudity or gross smells.

My mother thinks I should go back to Nursing. She remembers my first months there and thinks I loved it. That’s true, but she forgot how much I hated the last few months.

160ecdv,Have a question about medical guidelines for being a pilot,"   I am from the UK, and I would like to be a pilot for various reasons. It is one of my top choices for careers, but I am concerned about whether I would pass a medical evaluation.

   So, I always had fairly low blood pressure (not anymore though) and I used to faint. Generally at pain or shock. Then, when I was 10, I had a grand mal seizure. I had three more grand mal seizures over the course of 2 years, until I was 12. 
 
   My first was from a twisted ankle. My second was from a blood test. My third was from a tilt test. My fourth was from a vaccine. I am 16, and have not fainted or had a seizure for 4 years. I can always tell when I am about to have a seizure, and while I do now get the “feeling” of having one, I do not get get them. I have a clear trigger for them (pain, shock, and discomfort) and when I had them, they never lasted for more than 20 seconds. I can communicate before and afterwards.

   So, if I did not have another again, would I be eligible? I have checked the guidelines but I am not 100% sure and if I am flat out disbarred, I would rather know now so I don’t get my hopes up (I am 16 now, and about to enter sixth form, so I need to become more sure on my career path).

160dl36,Medicine vs Big Tech /Other Tech with Similar Pay,"I recently finished undergrad and wanted some opinions about establishing a career in medicine versus technology. I know that both career options are rewarding yet challenging. People switch careers all the time but I don’t want to do that if I can avoid it.

I know which medical specialty I want to pursue and I’m less certain about tech overall. The pandemic showed the world about how quickly companies will let workers go. At the same time, work-life balance is generally better in tech compared to medicine, and you get to earn money sooner. Debt is another thing to consider although most physicians say that repayments are quite manageable once they start practicing. Really its radiology (diagnostic or interventional) vs SWE or IT.

160dl10,Higher paying job in the US (which I like less) or lower paying job in the EU?,"Hi folks,

I currently work in EU working as a BI Engineer (even though I'm doing more of a Program Management job rn) earning about EUR 4k and doing a job that, even though stressful and with some overtime, has a lot to teach. I personally enjoy it, learn a lot from very smart colleagues (some of which have PhDs) and feel I can still grow where I am.

However, an opportunity came up to go work for the US for the same company earning almost double of what I earn here. However, after talking with the hiring manager I feel the role is way more limited in terms of scope than I wished. In the end it's more of a pure tech job with way less scope and opportunity to grow. 

I've always wanted to live in the US, at least for a few years but I'm not sure I should take the job. Also, there are really few opportunities to move due to a hiring freeze.

Would you take the job?

160da04,Experienced Developer with Career Gap - Struggling to Get a Job in Tech,"**My Background:**

  
I've got a broad tech background that covers lots of different things. I have years of experience working with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap as well as using PHP and MySQL for backend development work. I’ve also have working experience with iOS development using Swift. I can build different categories of web applications from simple websites to more complex SaaS platforms. I know how to create and consume REST APIs and know how to integrate GraphQL.

  
I'm comfortable with different programming languages like PHP, JavaScript, Typescript, and Swift. In web development, I'm experienced in HTML, CSS, and have used tools like ReactJS, NextJS, Gatsby, and more. I've also worked with databases like MySQL and others like MongoDB, Firestore, and Realm. I've done UI/UX design and making prototypes using Adobe XD and Figma. I have experience working with CMS platforms such as WordPress and Contentful, and I'm also well-versed in utilizing headless WordPress setups. Alongside my technical skills, I also possess leadership abilities, having led a team of 26 personnel at one time.

  
Prior to migrating to the US, I have 15 years of experience in the tech industry. When I moved to the US in 2017, I got a job in NYC working as a Sr. Software Engineer.

  
**Last Job Position and Covid:**  
Back in 2017 - 2019, I was working as a Sr. Software Engineer with a focus on iOS Development. Then came 2020, and we all know how Covid and lockdowns changed everything. During that period, I took the time to invest in my professional development and growth.

  
**Challenges and Timeline:**

* **Early 2021**: I provided care for a family member, leading to a temporary hiatus in my career pursuits.
* **Mid 2021:** As I resumed job hunting, I faced a 1.5-year gap that recruiters were curious about. I was asked, ""Why the gap?"" I explained my circumstances, including the family care responsibilities. To demonstrate my skills, I created a personal website showcasing my work and kept learning about other technologies.
* **Entering 2022**: With a 2-year gap by this point, I was actively applying to various jobs, sending out 1-2 targeted resumes each day. I explored job boards like Indeed, Wellfound, Jobot, Robert Half, Redballoon, Ziprecruiter and LinkedIn just to name a few. To demonstrate my adaptability, I created a sample web application that aligns with the technology utilized by the company I am applying to. I continually invest in learning and refining my skill set to tailor my resume to the specific roles I pursue.
* **Late 2022:** I almost fell victim to a scam, which understandably made me cautious. This fear set me back for a couple of months in my job search.2023: Fast forward to 2023, I'm dealing with a 3-year gap on my resume. I've been relentless in my job search, updating my resume once again and even branching out to apply for non-IT roles. However, despite my efforts, I'm yet to receive any return calls, emails, or even the tiniest glimmer of opportunity.
* **Mid 2023:** With a 3.5-year gap looming large, I'm still determined to persevere in my quest for a job. I've taken the initiative to showcase my skills through portfolio designs and continuous skill refreshing.

**Seeking Advice:**

* Have any of you ever faced those extended periods of unemployment in the tech industry? I'm particularly keen to learn how you tackled the challenge of explaining gaps in your career journey. 
* Are there companies out there that appreciate the skills and experience someone brings, regardless of a gap? I only apply to job posting where I meet 90% of the requirements. 

In my job search, I had employers / recruiters say ""I'm over qualified for the position"", some say ""I don't have enough work experience as a <job title>"" or ""We want someone who uses the <technology>, professionally"". They are not even looking at transferrable skills anymore.  
I believe that proficiency is not solely determined by professional experience. Side projects, personal projects, tutorials, and self-directed learning have all contributed to sharpening a skillset.  
Personally, I've encountered a frustrating trend where my qualifications seem to get overlooked due to these career gaps. It's disheartening because I know I have the drive and dedication to excel, but sometimes those gaps on paper can lead to unfair assumptions about my work ethic.  
**TL;DR:**  
Unemployed for 3.5 years in the tech industry due to a mix of lockdown, professional development, personal responsibilities, a scam encounter, and tough market conditions. Looking for advice on overcoming the challenges of having resume gaps and strategies for re-entering the job market.

160d6z1,I am debating switching from medicine to education. A lost 25 year old.,"I received my bachelors in biology at UCSB. I was pre-med as long as I can remember but after graduating and moving back home, I started having doubts. My doubts increased after a health crisis that scared me to my core. Since 2021, I’ve been dabbling my feet into the medical world and education world. I became a private tutor and substitute teacher but I also work as a emergency department medical scribe. I switched from wanting to become a doctor to a PA. Both areas are rewarding in one way or another and both have setbacks. How do I choose? I just turned 25 and I feel a ticking bomb which I know is just set by societal terms. My issue is I don’t want to be a high school teacher. I want to teach at college level in math. Math is my favorite subject, however since I received my degree in biology, I would have go back to school and take some undergraduate math classes to apply for a masters in math which will set me back even further. And professor jobs are low here. 

However, I have applied to physician assistant schools this year which I spent a whole year in community college getting those classes I needed that I didn’t do in undergrad. I got denied from two and waiting to here from three others. My thing is if I get accepted, I’m there basically but physician assistant school is so hard and mentally draining. But if I choose math, then that means more community college for me which I’m sick off.

I come from a low income background and first generation immigrant so this is all very hard. I can’t sit around forever. I need to make money and start helping my family as well. I know I can’t keep pondering but I’m afraid one day I’m gonna regret the choice I didn’t take.

160bsxt,Feeling lost and hung out to dry...(Long),"Hello good people of Reddit, I’m in a tight situation. My apologize if this ends up long.
I am a 29-year-old male currently living in a middle sized midwestern city. I have been diagnosed with ADHD since I was about 6 and later with depression and anxiety when I was 22. I come from a customer service and hospitality background as I have worked in retail and hotels since I graduated high school in 2013. As I’m sure some of you know, this is thankless work where the pay is low, and you must deal with very difficult people, customers and managers included. I decided that I had enough and enrolled in an online university to pursue a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity. I’ve had a love for technology and computers since l was little and wanted to learn more about them. In addition, one of the hotels that I worked for had a major data breach, so I took this as my call to action. Cyber criminals hurt thousands of people every day and I wanted to do something to make a difference.
School was hard due to my mental disorders, but I pushed through and graduated in the summer of 2022. I did very well, graduating with honors and a GPA of 3.8. Shortly before I graduated, I applied for a job a cybersecurity technician job for a media company based out of my city. The interview was very difficult, as they asked questions, I wasn’t sure how to answer due to my lack of experience and it quickly became clear to me the areas that my education was lacking. However, I got the job and was excited to start. Finally, I could make some decent money, gain valuable experience that I could start improving my life.
My first week should have been a sign. After the first few days of orientation, getting to know the team, my new boss, and completed small projects, the work stopped coming in. I would spend most of time just sitting there, wondering what exactly I was supposed to be doing with my time. I would go for periods from days to weeks where I had little to do or even hearing from my boss or coworkers. I would spend most days online, waiting for an email or message with a task that I could complete. I would get these tasks done quickly. To fill the dead time, I would take online courses, read about cybersecurity related topics, or work on homework when I was going to school. At the time, I was working from home, so it wasn’t too boring or stressful. Thursday mornings would get a little stressful as my boss would hold weekly meetings and we would go around the room talking about the things that we were working on for the week. Be that I had already gotten my tasks done, I would instead share topics that I was researching or studying to make it seem like that I wasn’t wasting the company’s or my time doing nothing. I would do my best to ask questions and contribute where I could but would mostly stay quiet to listen and learn as I was still so new to the role and the industry as whole.
My first performance review came in October of last years, and it was abysmal. My boss heavily criticized me for “not playing an active role in the team”, “not continuing to workflows” “not contributing to the team”, “lack of technical and professional knowledge”, “poor work performance” and other related criticism. I was deeply hurt and confused by his comments as of course I wouldn’t be performing well, I had just started and wasn’t being trained on how to do anything. I told him this, he said that he and the team would take more time to giving me growing opportunities and I should do research on areas on interest so that I could contribute to the team and company better.
Fast forward a year from now, the company has moved us to hybrid schedule, so I spend most of my time in the office. This is the first time I’ve been able to physically interact with my coworkers, boss, and other people from my company. The training however never came, as reality of the situation soon set in. My other three coworkers don’t seem to be doing much worker either. The senior analyst spends most of the time on her phone with work on her screen, but she spends a few minutes each hour doing smalls bits of work. The other analyst is sitting on his personal computer writing his science fiction novel and talking to his friends on Discord. The third analyst I barely ever see because somehow, he is allowed to keep working from home. I have no idea what my boss does as he spends most of this time locked up in his office. So once again, when there is little or no work to do, I pass the time doing what I did before. Online training classes, reading, research, talking with my coworkers about topics and concepts that I didn’t understand. Overall, I felt that I was getting better at my job as I was asking questions that would facilitate health decisions during our weekly team meetings.
However, the company soon implanted a new policy were we now be having midyear reviews in addition to end year reviews. I had my review almost a few weeks ago. Much to my annoyance and devastation, my review was pretty much a carbon copy of my last one. I honestly thought I was doing a lot better, but I guess not. My boss wants to now have regular one on ones with me to “help improve performance.” I had my first one earlier today, but it was awkward, and I spent most of the time repeating what I said from our team meeting earlier that morning but with more details. My boss has said if my performance doesn’t improve, the higher ups will force him to let me go.
I’m at a loss here. How is it that I’m getting in trouble for not doing anything when I have no idea what I’m supposed to be doing? How is it I’m getting in trouble for lack of knowledge and skills when no one seems interested in teaching me? Did I do something wrong? Did I make the wrong choice? I don’t want to give up this job because there are few opportunities where I live. If I hold on for just one more summer, I’ll be off probation and finally leave this god forsaken area. I’m trying to spend my time studying for an in-demand certification because I know with at least little bit of experience, a degree, and certification, I’ll be able to hopefully land a much better job. But at the same time, I’m miserable, bored, depressed, and not growing. I always under the impression that school can only teach you so much and bosses and coworkers are supposed to teach you the skills that you need to be successful or at least teach you the things you are supposed to be doing everyday instead of wasting your time.

160ble2,Past/Present Recruiters Please Advise!,"Recently I got word a position that is basically my dream job was posted by a company I love. I immediately got my resume in order, wrote up a cover letter and I saw there were two listings for the same position, One posted in Spain, another posted in London. The position is remote so I thought this was odd but both listings were on the employers website so I applied for both. Confident I would get an interview I received 2 confirmation emails that my applications were received (Screenshot attached). I woke up the next day around 8 hours later to a single email stating I wasn’t selected for the position. It’s been around a week now and I haven’t gotten a second email. Could the singular email mean I was denied or could it be another scenario where either there were two of my applications so one was rejected or they’re only accepting applications for the one posting since it’s a remote position? 

Assuming the rejection was correct, I immediately got to thinking how could I get into a position like this in the future. I thought I was more than qualified for this one so it’s possible if another comes up. I got the idea to find people with similar jobs or at that company in the same department on LinkedIn and try to message them for advice. I messaged about 20 people and got a response from someone at the same company who had recently vacated that exact position. I sent him my resume and asked what I could improve on and he said he couldn’t really give me a good opinion and referred me to someone currently at the company on that team. I sent them my resume and they said I had more experience than needed and the fact I had specialized experience and already knew multiple coding languages I would be a strong candidate. I told them about the email and asked them if they knew anything about the process. They said no, but they would forward it to their team lead. That was on Monday, I haven’t heard anything since. 

How and when should I follow up with this person? They’re not in charge of the hiring process but they will be involved with interviews. I want to be respectful as they’ve already done me huge favors but being as humble as possible I was made for this position and I will not stop until someone else has it officially. 


One other thing to note, originally if you went to the company website and clicked apply now it would take you to another website where you would enter your cover letter, resume, etc. Now when you click apply on their website it no longer redirects you but allows you to enter your information there. Should I apply again? Could that hurt?


Sorry for the text wall but I’m young and this really is a golden opportunity to me and I will do anything to get it. 

TLDR 

Applied for 2 listings on same position, got only 1 denied email. Contacted someone currently in the position and they sent my application to their team lead. Don’t know what to say to follow up and when to even follow up. (spoke monday). Application process slightly changed on employer website unsure if applying again will hurt.",Dazzling_Branch_2466,1,1.0,2,1692905239,2023-08-24 19:27:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/160ble2/pastpresent_recruiters_please_advise/,8,2023
160b6t1,I'm considering quitting my job soon b/c of safety concerns without another one lined up fully. Should I take the risk?,"I don't have real savings, lets start with that. I do have a spouse who makes just enough to allow both of us to scrape by for up to 9 months of me unemployed if need be. We have enough in our accounts that I am confident we can get through 2 months of me not working without having to scrape. I would lose access to healthcare that theoretically kicks in in a week.

I have been actively interviewing and I'm in the final stages for 2 jobs, plus more interviews probably on the horizon within a week. With everything work-related going on, it's been difficult for me to crank out top quality applications, or even do good searches, since I need to provide writing and stuff. 

Long story short, I took my current position 2 months ago not looking to stay long at all. I needed something to pay my bills with. Initially, I hoped to only stay for a month here and then bounce, but August is such a slammed month for people, all of my interviewing timelines were pushed back. That was long enough for me to realize that my job was actually a health hazard. To keep it brief, I work a clinical job that exposes me to formaldehyde fumes. I ended up getting pretty sick within this short timeline, which I then started to act upon by seeing a doc, filing a work comp claim, getting proper PPE with my own money, and filing an OSHA complaint.

So OSHA has already been through here for an initial investigation, but I'm waiting for them to come back (probably tomorrow) so they can attach a sensor to me and see if conditions are truly unlawful. I'm honestly out to see if I was right, and I also want to protect any poor soul that happens along this job in the future. At that point, I plan on seeing if I qualify to refuse to work while receiving pay. Knowing them though, they'll try to get every last bit out of me, I doubt they'll agree to pay me while I stay home. If they have another job, they'll redirect me there first.

I mean.... but I'm asking myself if this is truly worth it. I am considering leaving without notice after the investigation if OSHA finds them compliant. I feel better wearing my out-of-pocket PPE, but not truly safe. What keeps me thinking I should stay is I feel like I'll do better in interviews if I can say I'm currently employed.

160atsr,I'm considering quitting my job soon b/c of safety concerns without another one lined up fully. Should I take the risk?,"I don't have real savings, lets start with that. I do have a spouse who makes just enough to allow both of us to scrape by for up to 9 months of me unemployed if need be. We have enough in our accounts that I am confident we can get through 2 months of me not working without having to scrape. I would lose access to healthcare that theoretically kicks in in a week.

I have been actively interviewing and I'm in the final stages for 2 jobs, plus more interviews probably on the horizon within a week. With everything work-related going on, it's been difficult for me to crank out top quality applications, or even do good searches, since I need to provide writing and stuff. 

Long story short, I took my current position 2 months ago not looking to stay long at all. I needed something to pay my bills with. Initially, I hoped to only stay for a month here and then bounce, but August is such a slammed month for people, all of my interviewing timelines were pushed back. That was long enough for me to realize that my job was actually a health hazard. To keep it brief, I work a clinical job that exposes me to formaldehyde fumes. I ended up getting pretty sick within this short timeline, which I then started to act upon by seeing a doc, filing a work comp claim, getting proper PPE with my own money, and filing an OSHA complaint.

So OSHA has already been through here for an initial investigation, but I'm waiting for them to come back (probably tomorrow) so they can attach a sensor to me and see if conditions are truly unlawful. I'm honestly out to see if I was right, and I also want to protect any poor soul that happens along this job in the future. At that point, I plan on seeing if I qualify to refuse to work while receiving pay. Knowing them though, they'll try to get every last bit out of me, I doubt they'll agree to pay me while I stay home. If they have another job, they'll redirect me there first.

I mean.... but I'm asking myself if this is truly worth it. I am considering leaving without notice after the investigation if OSHA finds them compliant. I feel better wearing my out-of-pocket PPE, but not truly safe. What keeps me thinking I should stay is I feel like I'll do better in interviews if I can say I'm currently employed. But what if I tell an interviewer the truth and that I am unemployed because of safety concerns? I just want to find the right career for me at this point, this job is just a placeholder.

1609vtg,Fired for misuse of funds,"My employer fired me for misuse of funds. Hold on...I'm not a criminal My supervisor asked me if I paid out of my pocket for a bookcase in my office. I told her I had and put the amount in the month it was bought, (purchased by p-card) and went to the bank and took the money out of my account and add to accounting. Asked her why I had to pay for a bookcase for work when everyone else had bought one that the company paid for? She said we can talk about it. When I took the receipt back to my bosses office I heard the bosses assistant as well as a new employee running my name to the ground.

I've been at this company for 8 years with stellar reviews and increases. I'm feeling that it's retaliation for throwing the assistant and newbie under the bus, and that they are all BFF's with the boss and his wife. Now I'm out of a job with no benefits, no severance, nothing. And the reason is for misappropriation of funds. Yes it was paid back out of my pocket, it was $150. So I lost my job over $150.

1609r31,Try to do the same job elsewhere or retrain in something entirely different?,"Hello everyone
Two years ago I made the decision to move to the french capital in order to boost my freelance career, as jobs in my field are extremely centralized around it. While my career got a significant boost, it's still not stable enough, and work days are still few and far between, and my financial stability is withering away.

I've made the decision to leave the capital as it has an extremely adverse effect on my mental well-being, and I still hate the place just as much as when I moved in. However I don't know if it's worth it to try and build a new network elsewhere out of whatever will be left of the old one, or if I just give up on my present career and retrain in something else that will be more stable, stress-free, albeit potentially lower paying on average.

Retraining feels scary in a sunk-cost-fallacy sort of way (3-5 years of school and 2 of unemployment ti get where I am) and not being sure that it'll lead to happiness or whatever it is I need, and persevering in my current field in a location with even less work for me feels like maybe a waste of time, and fighting an even more uphill battle.

I left on really good terms, was told that there was always a place for me if I wanted to come back, and the president (who was my immediate manger for a long time before he got promoted) said on the day I said I was leaving that he was thinking of me for a role with them but it would be a year or so out.

Cut to today and I'm really only doing about 20%-30% of what they said I would be doing, and the rest is filled with admin stuff that I wasn't exposed to before in my previous role that I had to learn quickly, or just trying to manufacture things to keep myself busy and benefit the organization. The people are good and mean well and I've learned a ton in a short amount of time, but I'm pretty sure that they had an idea of what they wanted but I'm just not the person that they really need.

I've kept in touch with a couple people from the previous company (one is no longer there) and let them know that I would be interested in returning if there was a role that made sense and paid accordingly. I would like to reach back out to the president to let him know of my interest and ask about what he had in mind, if it was still applicable, but I don't want to come off as desperate.

I then asked very politely if it would be possible to start somewhere between steps 10 and 12, as this was inline with the mid range for the position, and I believe aligns with my experience.

1603wpd,Combining Data Engineering and Physics?,"Hi everyone,  
  
I hope you're doing well. I'm a 24-year-old data engineer currently based in Germany. I hold a bachelor's degree in informatics and have been working in the IT department of a manufacturing company for a while now. While my job pays well (more than double the average salary here), I can't shake the feeling that it lacks purpose. I'm looking for ways to combine my data engineering skills with my passion for astronomy, quantum physics, particle physics, and my fascination with nuclear fission and fusion.  
  
I believe that there must be a way to use data science and engineering in a field that aligns with my interests and contributes to something meaningful, where I can look beyond the borders of our world and work towards a greater purpose.  
  
Does anyone have any advice on how to bridge the gap between data engineering and physics or how to find a job that provides a sense of purpose and contributes positively to the world? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences.

1603n4a,Am I crazy to turn down a life changing opportunity?,"Hi all!

I’m a CDL driver by trade. Had to leave my last job in the spring due to schedule changes (went to evenings because construction is slowing down with interest rates).

Two weeks ago, I interviewed for a unionized CDL position (M-F 5:30am-2:30pm, can skip lunch and leave at 1:30). Unionized, pension, benefits paid 50/50, no OT, some upwards mobility, unlikely to have large salary jumps but consistent bumps. Starting salary is ~50k year 1.

Also interviewed for a driving position for a large plumbing/HVAC company and was pitched an apprenticeship instead because the boss liked my resume. Union apprenticeship, 5 years to journeyman/red seal with 6 months of school. Benefits paid for by company, full pension, schedule is 6-330, starting wage is ~41,800 but in 5 years will be 96k (plus whatever the new contract stipulates as it renews in ‘24 or ‘25). Raises are set in stone by % of journeyman salary (Y1 40%, Y2 50%, Y3 60%, Y4 70%, Y5 80%) so they go up reasonably fast.

CDL position is sending me their offer today. Apprenticeship position I am waiting for the union to call (2 weeks and counting, website says calls are made dependent on operational needs).

Am I crazy for taking the CDL position and turning down the apprenticeship if/when they call? It’s less money but that’s not a deal breaker, I just want to be home with my kids after school/daycare but terrified that passing up 100k career is a dumb idea in the long run.

1603kfs,Do I negotiate or call it quits?,"I am in the final round of an interview process with an extremely high chance I will have a job offer. The job is about $15K more than I make now and is a hybrid situation. The job itself is a significant step in advancing my career and will help enhance a skill set I am interested in pursuing. The area also offers me and my family more career and networking opportunities.  
  
However, the housing marketing is horrible, even in my ""country"" state. If we decide to move, I am looking at a $1K higher mortgage (on the low end) with a higher interest rate and more bills since we probably won't be able to find well and septic in that area. So, even with the pay increase, I would be making less than I do now.  
  
Moving right now is not on the table, but where I am stuck is if I should just let them know I am no longer interested for XYZ reasons or go through with the interview and negotiate afterward. They made it clear they value a hybrid schedule and do not like fully remote, so I am not sure how far that will get me. Also, I would hate to waste their time and mine if I know I cannot move forward under the current ""requirements.""  
  
Someone also suggested using the job offer to negotiate a higher salary with my current employer, but I am 75% sure that will get me nowhere. I am in higher education, and they would rather rehire than retain people.  
  
This is my first legitimate job offer after several months of searching. Everything else has been insultingly low in terms of salary. What would you do in my situation?

1603api,How to voice my dissatisfaction without making things awkward?,"How to voice my dissatisfaction without being confrontational?

I was put in a group to organise activities for the company with people from other departments (didn’t know any of them before). 

One of the people inside (B) is in charge of planning an event and I volunteered to help on the day because everyone else seemed reluctant.

B behaves quite unfriendly towards me but seems to be ok with everyone else. He acts appropriately in meetings but not when I bump into him elsewhere.

For instance, when I say hi in the hallway or goodbye after a meeting, he just looks down and ignores me. 

So anyways, it’s 1 day before the event but I still had not receive any instruction from him on when we should meet. I sent an email and he replied to ask me to lead the event-goers to the location (but that’s his job??) and to go to the location physically today to familiarise myself with the path to get there if I wasn’t already.

After reading his email, I got really upset because it’s very unreasonable to request something like this so last minute. I didn’t have time and even if I did why can’t he just do it himself wtf. He had more than a month to relay whatever he wanted me to do and chose to do it so late (which I would have if I was given an appropriate time to prepare).

How should I voice my dissatisfaction without making things awkward?

1603a0c,Still contemplating quitting my job to work on my rental properties and then trying my hand at a flip,"I am an engineer. There is a well renowned company that will probably make me an offer for 17-22k more than my current salary and benefits. Even if I get any offer for 10k more, I'm thinking of putting in my two weeks notice. Then if my company comes to me, I would try to negotiate working part-time and show them the offer from the other company... Does that sound like a good plan?

Because working part-time is what I really want. I'd still have steady W2 income when I want to take out mortgages. Yet I could get paid very well from flipping a property (after I fix up my rental properties and cash out refinance one I bought in cash). 

Outside of my day job, I make about 4k gross income/month from rental properties. After I refinance one property (at 7% interest rate), that income will go down to 3k. I'm also not accounting for taxes and insurance (because for the next year, that is already paid for). In other words, I'm not truly making 3-4k--on average rental income. 

I have about 30k in savings and my cost of living is about $2k/month (including a 15-year mortgage I should refinance to 30-year). I'm 29 and have around 55k in retirement accounts. The benefits at my current company is about $500/year they contribute to my 401k. Yes, it's pretty shitty. 

I have experience renovating and more experience being a handyman for my rentals. I've done just about everything (interior and exterior). I would budget the flip as if I were hiring labor. Although, I'll save tens of thousands by doing it myself.

160264h,I called an ottoman a pouf in the office and I think I’ve offended people. Thoughts?,"This is such a dumb post I know but I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Long story short I think people have taken offence to me calling ottomans around the offices poufs. 

The first instance was with my old team. I was being trained by one of the senior members who sits across from me. He asked me to come around to his computer. He has a pouf next to his desk. I replied with “ no worries I’ll just come sit on the pouf” which was followed up with some weird looks and awkward silence ( I hadn’t thought much of this  instance until now).

The second time was with a different team. The bloke that sits across from me also has a pouf next to him. I was curious to know if it was there because I wanted to come over and show him something and sit on it. I asked him. “Hi Dave is the pouf there next to you” he followed up with “geeeeez you can’t be saying that. It’s  not appropriate” 

The third time was just today. A senior member of the company came over to our pod to talk about a job. I had to get up to print some documents when I arrived he was sitting in my seat. He apologised and got up. I said “no worries. There’s a pouf across from me there you can sit on that” and proceeded to point in the direction of the pouf where Dave is also sitting. Then Ben (the senior member) “that’s inappropriate mate” I replied with. “ what do you mean it’s literally called that” I honestly thought he was joking at this point as I’ve heard him say some unhinged stuff before. He then says “first of all, you can start by calling it an ottoman. Secondly you can stop calling dave that. We are in an office you can’t say stuff like that mate”.

I honestly don’t know what to make of all this. These past instances just felt like banter before but it’s happened so many times now I’m thinking people are genuinely upset with me calling it that and now think I’m a homophobe or some shit. From now on I’m definitely going to be calling them ottomans but what are your thoughts. Do you think it’s all just banter or are people usually worried about this sort of thing to this level. Just as a side point I’ve never once intended for me calling them poufs as a joke. I genuinely call them that because that’s what they are. I’m not a homophobe and would never use gay humour to offend or upset anyone intentionally.

This whole post might seem strange but I honestly would like some feedback. I’m extremely bad a reading and understanding people at the best of times and office culture has been a very weird and long adjustment period for me. 

Should I apologise?
Also I’d love some advice on how some people in here with social anxiety and awkwardness have managed to navigate themselves around office culture. It’s been really difficult for me and struggle to fit in at best of times.

1601d1c,Need advice on how to improve my professional communication,"Hello everyone  


Bit of background, 4.5 years of experience of both solo and team based shipping in a fairly dysfunctional organisation.  And due to my drive to improve myself and workplace this has had some negative consequences and led to some conflict based on pent up frustration based in the desire to go above and beyond.   


Professionally i have a very high drive to work and get things done, as well as work towards improvements. Where i look at a problem and try to consider the more efficient long term solution to said problem. I try to involve higher ups into my thought processes and ideas, but either i face ""that's something you want"" or it falls to silence and is never spoken about again.  Oftentimes i get to hear i give to much information at once, which is a legit criticism, at those moments i lay forward the suggestion that we set up a time and go over what needs doing, alas nothing really ever comes from this. 

&#x200B;

The dilemma i'm facing here is, my communication skills professionally are somewhat okay but could be better, i have certain innate social problems that tend to make me more direct than others and i go straight to the point, this is something i am trying to work on. But due to my poor ability to understandably convey a suggestion for improvement, it feels like this is something that might hold me back for future job prospects.   


To be completely honest, i don't want to become a social butterfly who is friends with everyone and everything, neither do i want to become the recluse who only think about work which i tend to do nowadays.  


I want to be able to be seen as the kind of person with strong ideas grounded in evidence and reality, with a strong work ethic, but also one who promotes co-operation and long term sustainable solutions. Rather than the rebel or the monster of the warehouse.  


Any and all advice is welcome, as i'm very keen on improving my ability to communicate professionally without compromising my ability to do tasks effectively.

Im not sure what to do, my brain is still foggy.. Do i say no to that october job and stay in my home country for a few months to recuperate? Do i just go to that job and see what happens?

Hi everyone, 

my girlfriend(F23) has a bachelors in English and she is currently at a risk consulting company as a editorial and communications coordinator. She doesn’t like how much she is being paid and I don’t see her being treated equally with the other 7 employees.(she doesn’t have nice monitors like the others, no monitor arms, tiny cubicle, no visible window near her) just an overall depressing environment. She’s told me if she was paid more that would make things better though. 

After hearing enough I took it upon myself to come up with options for her so she can start to feel better. I made a shared note document in which where I put links to jobs I find that could fit her many qualifications as she’s very talented. I’ll put my thoughts on the job and she can do the same. 

Another issue is that with her current job she has to put in a 2 months notice which sounds illegal as hell and sounds like jail. Does anyone know a workaround for this? 

If it wasn’t a new job I think she could ask for a raise but I don’t really know how that process works or what to say overall. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for jobs to look for that pay well with a bachelors in English? We are located in the Dallas Fort Worth area. Fields to look into, or something she could easily make a career switch whilst still being able to utilize all her experience as a writer & editor?

She’s a beautiful soul, I love her so much, she doesn’t deserve any of this negativity, and just want the best for her. So if anyone has anything, please don’t be shy!

15zvh84,"I'm slightly above average at a very average number of things, what now?","Hi! Looking for general advice here because I'm honestly lost with what I want to do. Before I graduated, I changed my major multiple times because I couldn't settle on anything and always found that I was good at another thing that interested me. So now I'm graduated looking for work with a little bit of experience in engineering, astronomy, physics, education, computer science, psychology, philosophy, ethics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and data analytics with professional experience in robotics, childcare, project management, teaching, nonprofit work/community work, event planning, and data analysis.

I thought that being good at a lot of things would make it easier to find a job and pick a career but honestly it hasn't. I've just been applying to anything relating to any of my experiences and level hoping that luck/chance will strike and I'll take the first opportunity I get, but whenever I speak with prospective employers or professional mentors, I'm told that I don't fit in well enough to any single role/career because my goals are not clear. When someone asks me for a 5 or 10 year plan I have no idea what to say because my future almost never seems to turn out the way I expect. 

What I do know is that I have an incredible understanding of human behavior and team dynamics, coupled with excellent organizational skills, communication skills, and data management which makes me a highly effective team lead in every sector I've tried out. I love spreadsheets and they're probably the only thing I'd say I'm properly way above average with. I would love if my job was just like, ""spreadsheet wizard"" but I have no idea where to start with something like that. I would appreciate any advice on potential roles beyond what I've been looking for up until now (Project Management and Data Analyst) that might be a good fit.

15zuvpj,Question for hiring managers and HR personnel: Would you give someone like Undercover Boss's Ronnie a chance (10+ years after his episode)?,"Ronnie  was a Boston Market employee who was on Undercover Boss 10 or 11 years  ago and was fired on the spot for some badmouthing remarks: [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3ED3z7YAG-o&pp=ygUhdW5kZXJjb3ZlciBib3NzIHJvbm5pZSBnZXRzIGZpcmVk](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3ED3z7YAG-o&pp=ygUhdW5kZXJjb3ZlciBib3NzIHJvbm5pZSBnZXRzIGZpcmVk)

Over  the years, I’ve occasionally been concerned for Ronnie, and for myself.  As an aspie who is often uncomfortably frank, I have to admit I might  easily have a day where I went to work and acted EXACTLY like he did.

How  badly did he fuck up his career here in your opinions? Would you hire him now (10+ years after his mishap)? Is it likely that he worked in hospitality again? Could he be hired in ANY field - construction,  retail, anything? I'm oddly paranoid that he's lived on the streets ever  since, and is destined to do so through his entire forties and fifties,  etc. - is that a likely outcome?

Would talking smack about customers be considered “gross misconduct” in most states?

These questions probably sound pathetic but the answers are indeed helpful, even for my own career guidance… I might end up like him.

15zupuj,Was I pushed out?,"I realize this is a long post, but this situation is so bizarre that I request you read it. I worked at a company for 5 years. Let me say first that I considered myself an outstanding employee. I always tried to go the extra mile. This year, my manager offered me a new role they had created to generate more income for the company by requesting payment prior to services. They let me know that the plan was for me to become the manager of that area and I would get commission on the money I collected. I accepted the role and started in a new area that had not been done before. Everything was going well, but I got a few complaints from customers because they had not been notified they would be called prior to services. These customers also worked for the same company I worked for. Also, a professional that did not work for the company, but was an associate, complained about me using my name. This complaint was made to the CFO of the company I worked for.  The complaint was made by one of the customers, that also worked for the company, to this associate. This made me very upset because the complaint was not true, and it hurt my pride because I always feel that I go above and beyond. Later down the road, I got an email from the manager in revenue integrity asking why the pre payments for a certain week were not as much as previous weeks. I let them know the reasons, which just happened to be that the customers had met their insurance deductibles given the year is over half over, which would result in them not having to pay anything. Because of all this impacting my mental health, I then put in my 2 weeks notice to try to pursue another less stressful career. I got an exit interview with HR and I was very honest about what had happened. Now two weeks have passed since my last day. As I am looking for job postings, I have noticed there are none for the company I worked for in this same position I worked in. Was I pushed out?

15zsmlo,Co worker keeps bringing up my mistakes,"I (25f) started this new job ( first real job after uni  after being self employed) 6 months ago as a pricing analyst and due to our programmes getting pushed back, this is the 2nd bid I have done. 
Passed probation and everyone had good feedback from me including co worker X who said I have a hard working ethic etc. X is not a priced but due to the nature of business, we work close together, she does bid writing.

I made a mistake with the spreadsheet I sent back to the partners. My manager told me to delete the columns which included % when I shouldn’t have. I double checked the work before the partner meeting and called X to explain and apologise. Luckily I was presenting the meeting so I used the right spreadsheet.

Then on Monday I noticed an issue, so I emailed them and apologised, turns out it wasn’t one after all, after speaking to my manager. I emailed  X and the manager to hold off sending a question to the client because I have re read the docs and we can’t charge that cost.I apologised and said in future I will re read the docs again. I wanted to speak to them first before my manager as I was worried they would send it out the client and look silly.

These are the only two mistakes I’ve made and understand it doesn’t look good as they both happened 2 days apart. The first bid went well. I had a meeting with the director who said everyone said I did really well for the first bid and appreciated iextard how clear I was etc 

X has ignored me in office, they all gossip, instead of coming to my directly she would whisper to a subordinate to send me things when I am sitting opposite her. She brought up the mistake again as the partner responded to the old numbers and not the new ones we had sent them and said I wish we sent them the right ones in the first place, I guess it’s lessons learned aye. I already apologise for this. 

I am annoyed because the culture of the work place is over worked. Staff and especially X work on weekends and late nights. I started working late nights to get work done and weekends as the work load is unsustainable and pay not great.

I believe in my work and public service, and I also work 40 hrs per week almost 100 percent remote. I see my wife and two young boys throughout the day, at lunch and just passing through, and no commute is wonderful. The problem is, I do not have realistic opportunities to advance my career working for the state, and my compensation is likely to not even keep up with inflation due to my state’s controlling political decision makers.

If I entered the private sector, I would likely earn 175k plus. I would probably have to travel and give up remote work as well, work more hours, see my family less.

15zq9pm,Should I leave failing company?,"So... I work in finance.  Left a large company (big mistake) recently to move to a smaller company with a better work culture/life balance .  I accepted a pay cut for better culture.  While the new job is fine, the corp is NOT in good financial shape.  They did have a round of layoffs but leadership indicated that no more layoffs are planned.  I'm feeling very skittish and have started searching for something more stable. I received an offer and expect another one.  But, I will have to take a pay cut and poorer benefits.  My dilemma is:  Should I jump ship and accept reduced pay/benefits for something more stable (although, there is no guarantee anywhere) or ride it out and keep the better pay/benefits for as long as I can?  I have to at least get two more years to vest and I'd hate to stick it out and get laid off before vesting. Theoretically, we could probably run for a couple more years and maybe it will turn around.  But, I'm not built for such uncertainty -- lots of sleepless nights and I feel like I keep waiting for the next shoe to drop.  I literally get panic attacks thinking about getting laid off -- I've never NOT had a job.  It's affecting my work performance because I know I'm not fully engaged.  The decision to leave my prior role is really looking like a big mistake since a stable job trumps a poor work culture, IMO.  I really wasn't expecting to be so unsettled career wise at this stage in my life.  I'm also torn because I'd feel horrible about leaving the team in a bind and I don't want to burn bridges as it's a smaller community.  Job hopping is also a concern so my next move needs to be the RIGHT move.  I just need to make a decision and stick with it but I've lost confidence in my decisions.  Stay and fully commit or move on.  What would you do?

I'm getting close to COAST/FIRE -- Without any more contributions and conservative growth my investments should be at about $1.2M by retirement  + SS + very, very small widow pension.  No debt, fully paid off mortgage, LCOL area,  kids are grown.  Bare bones monthly expenses $1500.  Healthcare would not be a concern due to some widow benefits.  I'd like to work 10 more years (at most) but that could be pared down if needed.  Although, honestly I'd probably do some side hustle even after retirement to stay active and engaged.  I'm single so it's just me --- no one else to depend upon.

15zp3lv,"[IL] Good background, Bad people in background made it bad","
I'm so lost this has been going on since I filed for a divorce in 2021. I know their are good people out there with good hearts but god has only shown me 3 of them warning me what my former employers are defamation me, yet so many bad people in HR jump on board as a game a new player joins.

OK. Around 2021 I filed a divorce from my partner due to a long term affair that actually began through my partners first  and seeped through mine. I found out and I filed immediately. 
Here is the problem she is working HR with a well know company I worked for and is good friends with the head
 HR who contacted all my old employers to blacklist me with evil lies to hurt me during divorce so I can't afford the lawyer.
They are telling future employment that I have a protection order and I won't leave her alone and I have guns and crazy. Nothing job related and evil lies. 
So a few past employers fell for these lies and they are lying to my future employment saying I was terminated for misconduct.

I was never ever written up for misconduct or anything. There is even an HR company that I was the first to be promoted at lead tech and my former manager who is out of state is confused why would they do this to me as in writing he wrote you did nothing wrong with us as he is still there employed and informed me to contact Ethics but that went down the drain.

I even worked for a company that has my future ex family in management that is also heavy involved.  I was never written up by them either. They are saying misconduct which are lies but why doesn't HR ask do I have anything in my files? I DONT. it is lies.

I left all jobs respectfully too.

I got my cdl and I applied to multiple companies that I had every single one job until they called my former employers and was filled with lies of misconduct and I have a protection order and guns and omg so many bad things and my former employers informed them to tell me that they will presume a better qualified candidate.
only three hiring manages informed me on what they are saying and said they wouldn't want this to happen to their son or family for me to seek an attorney because I will not find employment and the ones that I did get employment treated me like crap to quit and found it to be funny. Oh their comments and  
I have  family, I have a home I need peace. 

Even my recent job I was recently let go due to being involved in a company car accident lied and told the state I was let go for misconduct when I have in emails stating the day I was terminated due to the accident. They were also in contact with my ex and her boss.

Now its a chain with everyone jumping on board with the lies.

I am seeking employment now. I am very respectful but like any human I won't let no one belittle me to the ground but I'm very easy going but the lies are ruining me.
People say it'll fade but its not over two years 


BTW I filed the divorce and I have multiple emails and texts of my ex stating please let's get back together and get councilng but I say no.
some actually told me to get back to stop this but I refuse.

I thought HR was only to discuss job performance? Why are so many falling for lies? and personal family matters too.
and BTW I never ever told my side of story to any company I act like I'm clueless because I just want to work respectfully.

15zoaxa,"Well - it took me 6 months almost to the day, more interviews that inexplicably went nowhere, one company even lying about me and saying I declined over $10k when they didn't even contact me. But I got a job today, and used an AI applier to do it. Best $50 I've spent maybe ever.","*(for some reason it wouldn't let me post this in* r/jobs*, but wanted to share my experience in hopes it'll help somebody else)* 

&#x200B;

As I've been posting on and off here, this year has been rough for me professionally. For the first time in my entire professional career (20 years), I got laid off without warning on Feb 23rd for reasons totally unrelated to the success of my team.  
  
During said 20 years, I've never NOT worked full-time, and have had at most like 3 weeks in-between Job A and Job B, with B's offer already signed and my role guaranteed. My professional resume (not the formatting, but the content) is impeccable, I have dozens of references, and have succeeded in every job I've ever had.  
  
Despite hearing some shit about the current market, I wasn't worried at all - I had some savings and had only ever had 1 interview in my life not lead to some kind of offer, so with the number of openings for my specific line of work, I figured I'd take a month off and then get to it.  
  
During that time, I saw someone on Reddit that was applying to jobs for you on your behalf at $10 per $50, and she's been great. Tracked all of the applications, was positive, and talked to me as I truly learned about the current hellscape that is the job market in 2023.  
  
Few things you need to know about, if you're fresh to it and especially if you're in tech/non-brick and mortar physical product-based roles.  
  
Ghost jobs are EVERYWHERE. What is a ghost job? Well - companies don't want the world to know that they're shrinking and maybe going under soon, so they leave open job posts for roles that they're not filling, and even interview for them. It's commonplace, and you can read about it here. At first I didn't want to believe that it was real, but I had no doubts after a local company told the recruiter (who they had been saying they were DESPARATE to talk to me, for weeks, and never called) that they offered me $140k and I declined because I wanted $150k. Asked for the # they called me from, and when, and shocker - it couldn't be provided.  
  
LinkedIn might as well just be throwing your resume into the void. Especially on apps where it's Easy Apply and it doesn't even really ask qualifying questions. You're one of hundreds or 1000s of applicants, and they're not going to look at any of your shit. Use Indeed, and ZipRecruiter, or Dice if you're coder/IT should you plan on actually applying manually yourself.  
  
Recruiters will not only ghost you, they'll say they're going to get back in touch within a few days and ghost you. Or ask YOU for interviews, then not even show up to the requested time. It's bad, unprofessional behavior, and IMHO the result of the social media culture we're in keeping confrontation or interpersonal skills from developing, but I'm not a psychologist. Since they can just digitally avoid you without consequence, many don't even have the balls to just say ""hey, we decided to go with somebody else"" or confirm that they passed when you follow up. Don't take it personally, as much as it sucks.  
  
  
  
Learning all of this as I went was discouraging as hell, and a good friend of mine told me that she lied when I asked her how bad it was (she went through an arc like mine that was also 6 months until somebody she knew hit her up), saying she didn't want to scare or discourage me when my spirits were down. This is somebody that has been VERY direct about stuff through the 22 years we've been friends.  
  
In the end, I saw an ad for something called MobiusEngine.AI, and it's just an AI-based thingy that applies for the best possible jobs given your resume and work history, and to say it worked infinitely better than my own efforts is an understatement. For any salaried role, it's almost impossibly inexpensive, and the $50 got me more results than months combined. Got some interviews immediately, had the final one this AM, shook hands on it, and the offer is coming tonight or tomorrow. Exactly what I was asking, stable company that's just totally of the same outlook/mindset as me, feels almost too good to be true.  
  
MY TL;DR is this - the job market is brutal even if you're amazing in your field, it's near impossible to stand out on job boards, so message the actual people if possible and pay Mobius $50 to just do the heavy lifting for you. ESPECIALLY if your spirits are down because you lost your job without warning and are just feeling overwhelmed.  
  
Hope this is helpful to someone, and keep your chin up. It might take time, but there's somebody out there who will value you, if you're a serious professional and willing to be direct and confident in what you want.

15znudu,[New Grad Civil Engineer] Should I leave my first job for a marketing job with better pay?,"I am an Argentinian civil engineer who graduated last May.  
  
I worked for the last three months in a small structural firm in which I have learned a lot. I must say that I enjoy this job, I am doing what I like to do, and it's flexible (I can work remotely whenever I want).  
  
The only disadvantage is that it is an unregistered job in which I have no benefits and get paid in cash every month.  
  
Given the inflationary context of my country, this job instability is a huge disadvantage and a risk that I shouldn't be taking.  
  
I've been doing a lot of job interviews and received just a few job offers that don't attract me.  
  
I've been recently offered a job in a multinational firm (Deloitte) for a Jr Consultant position, registered, hybrid scheme, with better pay (50% increase) and benefits.  
  
The only thing stopping me from accepting this offer is that I wouldn't be doing anything related to what I studied for, and I am not entirely sure if I would like it.  
  
Taking this job would be temporary until I find something civil engineering-related that I like more. My biggest concern is that I'm not sure if this job experience would affect my resume negatively and will make my job search more difficult later.

15zni1m,What jobs am I qualified for?,"Hello all!

I just joined this sub in hopes of receiving some solid advice from those with more experience than me!

Here’s a bit about my situation:

- I am a 19yr old female

- I am currently married, but my husband cannot work as he has a pending green card application with no work authorization (yet)

- We currently rent a “studio apartment” in my parents’ house (it’s only $200/month, has a bathroom, walk-in closet, and kitchenette)

- I am working on obtaining my high school diploma online, so I do not have any education to put on a resume

- I sustained severe injuries to my ankles a few months ago so standing for prolonged periods, lifting, squatting, etc. is difficult for me

I want to begin saving for my retirement as I am acutely aware of the impact inflation (as well as the shakiness of social security) will have on me in the future. I am planning on maxing out a Roth IRA along with putting extra money in a high-yield savings account when I can.

With that being said, I obviously need to get a job ASAP. 

I would like a job with 401k as a benefit and at least $40,000/year while I complete high school, pursue higher education, and focus on saving money.

Can anyone recommend jobs like this that require little to no education and/or experience?

15zl4qf,What Would You Do if You Were Me? Medicine Drop Out,"I am a 28 year old female. I like I have never even began living my life. I got a degree in a science subject in 2017 and started working in a MNC in medical devices straight away. The job paid like a euro above minimum wage and I hated it-I worked in QC/QA on the manufacturing floor, in labs, helping with projects etc. It was hell and I hated it. I eventually ended up in regulatory complaint management which was okay but niche and had no room for growth really. I had always wanted to do medicine but it was really expensive to do in Ireland as a grad student (where I lived) I got sick before COVID and had to leave work in 2020 and live off benefits. I got into a medical college in the UK where fees were 1/3 what they are in Ireland. I defered my first year as I was still ill and worked in a grocery store. 

I started medical school in Sept 2022 and despite continuing to work, I struggled hugely financially, as well as socially and academically, I felt like crap the entire year and I was not doing well at all. I ended up failing an exam and am required to start the year from scratch-I have to attend all my lectures again with full attendance, all workshops, redo all of the exams and projects I already passed as well as the exam I failed, and of course I will have to rent in my college town during this time, and pay full fees AGAIN. Medicine in the UK/Ireland is not like the USA where you can take out a loan that covers all of your expenses, you can take out a loan that only covers your college fees and you can only take it out for a maximum of 4 years-I am already out a year of a loan so somewhere along the way I have to magically find the money for an additional year of college. I am not entitled to any grants or scholarships. If I go back it's only going to be harder cause I now have 0 savings. My rent is more and to stop commuting the 6 hours a week I was I took a job closer to the college that paid less, and of course, rent has gone up this year. If I fail any exam at all in the future I will be kicked out-rather than be offered a resit exam or repeating the year, including failing any of the exams I already passed-so I could pay all these fees and fail my very last exam in final year and they could kick me out with nothing-and if they do this I can never enroll in any medical college in the UK ever again (if I leave on my accord I can still never enroll in medical college in the UK again, once youre in you either finish it then and there or just face the prospect of never being a medical doctor no matter what). 

If I manage to get through the rest of the years without a fail-when I graduate I will be 33. I will then have to do 2 years of foundation training where you can be swapped to absolutely anywhere in the UK every few months and you have little to no say where you end up. You work crazy hours for the grand total of 14 pounds an hour-I would be doing this till I am 35. I am a female. I have never really travelled, never really had a relationship-everyone I know my age is buying houses and getting married and having babies and travelling the world and if I stick in medicine I will probably do none of those things. But I am so torn. I have always wanted to do medicine, ever since I was kid, IDEK why I want to do it anymore, I just feel like I have to, and if I don't I will never be happy. But I feel like cause of my age if I stay in medicine I will also never be happy. 

I am dreading the repeat year, I was so looking forward to year 2, I had such great plans how it was going to be my year to shine and do all the stuff I wanted to do and be great at it. It utterly crushed me to see I had failed, I just laid in my bed crying-I didnt eat for days. I just feel like I am moving progressively backwards while everyone moves forwards and it kills me. I was already a geriatric in my course last year-I felt so out of place and uncomfortable, and now I will be another year older and the rest of my cohort will be fresh grads all another year younger. Yes life goes at different paces for everyone but I am so tired of being broke and stuck and just not living a live-I feel like I am drowning in a swamp of my own mess but I don't see any way out or escape. I have nothing worth living for atm, IDK what to do. If I drop out I have no job prospects really other than going back to minimum wage/low skill work. I hated the sort of work I did in the MNC which is the only work I am qualified for with my degree-but I can't even get a reference from there and because of my illness and college I gave a huge gap in my CV-but I would hate to go back to that sort of work-it sucked the soul out of me and felt evil, but as mentioned previously I can't even get a reference from there. My degree is also very old now too so I cannot go for graduate jobs. All I could do is go back to the grocery store if they would have me back. 

TLDR: I am super old and letting life pass me by-I have the choice to repeat med school from scratch or leave-I am unhappy with both of these options, like my life has ended and IDK what to do.",Key-Wealth7351,1,1.0,1,1692834611,2023-08-23 23:50:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15zl4qf/what_would_you_do_if_you_were_me_medicine_drop_out/,8,2023

Managing/direction is no better. Its vague generality, followed by vague generality. Ask for clarification? get another vague generality, and a chuckle; cuz you're the problem. While we know the general idea of the end goal, we genuinely think they don't actually know what they are in charge of.

Actual quote from today: ""we arent at the point we need to be; we need to get to the point where things really take off"" but cannot give specifics on what markers, checkpoints, etc on what that **point** is, or how to get there. ""**Things**"" is also equally undefined. 'Things' will get used several different times to mean several different things

15zjp5x,"Balancing Career Paths: Reflecting on Teaching and Transitioning to the Media Industry""","  
Hello everyone,  
  
I recently completed my teacher qualification from university. However, my second placement was quite challenging. I'm beginning to question whether teaching is the right fit for me, especially considering the reputation of the school I'm about to join, which is known for its difficulties.  
  
The reason I turned to teaching was because I had been unemployed for three years since graduating from university. I chose this path out of frustration from facing repeated rejections. My background includes a PGCE in teaching computer science and a degree in Digital Media. Despite this, my passion lies in software, and I aspire to work at Capgemini. I'm uncertain whether I'm being unrealistic and potentially caught in a cycle—lacking industry experience might hinder my job prospects, or conversely, my teaching experience combined with my PGCE could enhance my appeal.  
  
My plan is to give teaching a chance until December, evaluating if I find a connection with the school and the students. Nevertheless, I sense my decision might already be leaning towards moving on.  
  
Considering my situation, what career path would you recommend? Would you personally pursue teaching given my circumstances? When do you suggest I begin actively searching for positions within the media industry? Despite having attended numerous interviews, the feedback consistently cites my lack of experience as a setback.",Sweaty-Wealth-2554,1,1.0,1,1692831270,2023-08-23 22:54:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15zjp5x/balancing_career_paths_reflecting_on_teaching_and/,8,2023

Technical sales engineer 2022-current. (I make $86K, I don’t hate this job, but I find myself bored and not increasing any of my technical knowledge. I’m mostly a sales person and we’re only motivated by sales). 

I am interviewing for an application engineer role where it would be more of a workload than I currently do, more travel, and more field work (which I’m not opposed to), and  I would be making 115K USD.

My current work varies drastically from system procurement and implementation, company-wide process improvements and efficiency, to strategic projects impacting council/ government policy. Within all of this work I have significant influence and autonomy and do enjoy the majority of it. My main concern regarding this role is that it seems fairly unique to my current employer and less project management more internal consultant. There are similar roles at much larger organisations in different industries, however due to my lack of degree and the company being small these have always been out of reach.

I have been offered a fully-paid degree role as a Quantity Surveyor. The work is very different than my current role and would be much more engineering focussed. 

I am struggling to make a decision. Any advice would be appreciated. Further useful info below. 

Initial pay is identical.

Current role: no discussion of pay increase or promotion in the medium term. 

There is a risk that the company will lose a need for the role once all major transformation has been complete. 

New role: Guaranteed 30% pay increase within 3-5 years along with promotion and clear line for promotion post degree and beyond. 

The role will likely grow with the business.

There aren't any true Entry-Level or New Grad roles that I can apply for. The big companies are requiring their New Grads to graduate December 2022-June 2023. So I'm not qualifying for those anymore. I know that with all the tech layoffs the industry hasn't been very hot, but I haven't been able to get any traction. I'm open to relocation and very flexible on compensation. I just want to start getting experience!  
What am I not doing right? Obviously without hands-on experience it's hard. But there are so many things I can be learning outside of university curriculum. But it's obviously very dependent on the job, and I don't know which direction to go, since applying to jobs is also a time commitment.  
I'll attach my resume.

15zhzhw,"How do I answer the question ""What makes you want to change into this field?""","So I am a full time physical therapist who also does freelance tech support and website design and server/storage maintenance for some doctors I know. I've been freelancing regularly since 2018, and wanting to get full time into IT.

In interviews recruiters seem confused by this, so I'm trying to figure out what to say.

I have a number of reasons I want to change. Are any of these appropriate?

1. Within a couple years in IT I will make more than I do as a PT.
2. I don't have health insurance at my job. Or at my other pt job before that.
3. I would love the possibility to work hybrid to spend more time at home and less time commuting.
4. If I hurt my wrist or shoulder I will be out of a job. I want more security and a less physically strenuous job. I'm healthy but did have a recent scare.
5. I do have a genuine passion for IT and want to learn more and one day work with programming and AI.

I have skills, a portfolio, and an advanced degree but the majority of the time I'm not getting past the initial screening. So I think I'm saying something wrong here.

I do have my freelancer work on my taxes from 2018-2020 and some in 2022. But not enough to exclude my pt work from my resume. I'm stumbling over explaining why I have had 2 jobs (to pay the bills obv, and to do fun projects and help some colleagues)

So how do I make a narrative that's easier for them to follow and show that I'm serious?

15zhtgu,"Salary Negotiations, but through a Recruiter?","Hi All. 

I am entering final round interview stages and a few places I've found through a recruiter, others are just on my own. 

When negotiating on my own I feel quite comfortable... start high and work my way from there. 

But I've been placed by a recruiter before and at the time I got an offer, they asked me ""what is the amount you would accept right now, with no negotiation"" and previously I gave a number and the company matched it immediately... so I think I got shortchanged! 

Now I am entering a phase in interviewing where I feel I should have that number ready. One company, however, has a range that is literally 100k. I presume this is because the role level/seniority is flexible depending on experience. But it has me confused about where to place my ""I'd accept right away"" number. I do believe the high end of that range would be insane for me, but it's not unheard of and I would accept that number, but I don't know if that looks too high for my position in the market. 

I'm thinking of something like ""If I received an offer at X I would accept right away. However depending on the benefits available, I would consider offers starting at Y.""   


But are these numbers supposed to be bigger than I would \*actually\* start considering offers? Is there a downside to asking for a very high number and looking ""greedy?"" I am a woman in STEM and feel I've been coached to negotiate all the time for every offer but if somebody says ""no bullshit what do I need to pay you"" I want to be direct. 

All feedback/advice is welcome! Thanks in advance! ",not-my-usj-username,2,1.0,3,1692827235,2023-08-23 21:47:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15zhtgu/salary_negotiations_but_through_a_recruiter/,8,2023

I just graduated college this last May, and got a job at a big firm. I am beyond grateful, they are paying me to get licensed and I am making not bad money. That said, upon talking about how great a gig it is with my peers (I am with 4 others doing the same thing), they mentioned their hourly rate, and we discovered that all 4 of my peers are making 41 cents an hour more than me. I am not that upset over it- more just weirded out that I am the only one, especially since I actually have one more certification than 3 of my peers. Once we all get certified, we will get a pay increase. Is this a subject I should bring up to my training manager? Alternatives I have considered is potentially bringing it up when we all get our raise, or just not bringing it up at all.

15zgua5,Could I get a job in programming/ software dev/ data analytics with a unrelated degree?,"I’m currently in my junior year of college majoring in the Healthcare Technology field (Some call it BMET, HTM, Clinical Engineering). And I’ve come to a realization that I might not enjoy this field. The job market is incredibly low, and the pay isn’t that great for graduates either. My question is could I get a job in programming without a CS degree? 

What programming language should I start off with? (I’m thinking of python but not sure) 

Where would be the best place to start?

I’m not new to coding but I’m also not at a beginners level either. I’ve have experience with coding in VHDL as some of my classes require it and currently taking classes for Information Security Fundaments which I believe will involve a-bit of coding using Kali Linux. I’ve also take basic networking classes related to healthcare technology but I don’t think that matters much.

I don’t want to switch majors now because I’d have to retake a bunch of classes and I don’t have the time and money. I just want to graduate with my bachelors and be done.

Hi, I (36M) have been working for this European oil and gas company for over 6 years now and have a total of over 10 years experience in my field.

Absolutely like the work life balance, the non pressure environment, benefits and right to overtime. The salary professional bonus are ok but the other aspects seems to balance it out.

The thing is, it is a bit career slow paced and very much relationship oriented. To my last promotion, I had to add a bit of pressure to get promoted as I was doing a job and responsibilities that were above my title.

Now, I am trying to break into an international short-term assignment or a leadership position, but feel I am being held back.

To add context, I am now halfway through a strategic project with great feedback and exposure so far with great feedback and exposure so far.

I'm afraid that if I don't move now, I'll lose the window of opportunity and progress will be even slower once they don't need me in the front line.

Should I continue to pressure the organization to speed things up? Sign that I am looking for opportunities outside as a way to leverage? If so, any tips on subtle ways to do this? 

For context, I admit to being late to the game of office politics and networking, and am now trying to step up, especially with the leaders above my immediate supervisor. Sometimes I feel that the fact that he is as young as I am is working against me.

15zfymk,"Turned down a good job offer, should I start interviewing again?","I recently interviewed and received a job offer at a competing firm. The job itself was a lateral move at around the same total compensation (perhaps if I negotiated it would have resulted in a small bump in total pay) but was located in a higher cost of living city while I live in my hometown (medium cost of living).

The role sounded interesting and aligned with my goals and the people I interviewed seemed good. The company itself had some really good benefits as well (good dental/healthcare, allowances, retirement plan match, hybrid model, etc.) that are better than my current firm.

It was a good offer that I ended up turning down for a few of reasons:
1. I was happy at my current role and company and had only been here for 1 year, along with being just recently promoted
2. Staying closer to friends and family
3. Relative cost of living

Recently, my company announced some restructuring and laid off a good chunk of staff. I was not impacted and it was communicated to the remainder of the team that this would be the end of the layoffs. Regardless, this shook myself and the rest of the company, over the last few weeks some other people have found new jobs and resigned in light of this news.

In light of this, I'm beginning to regret turning down the job offer I had.

I apply, then the next day a recruiter gets back to me to schedule a phone screen which took place last week. Yesterday they reach out to schedule an in-person interview for Friday which I agree to. Today I wake up a little under the weather then receive a text saying they want to move the interview up to tomorrow as the hiring manager won't be there on Friday. I asked to reschedule for Monday to make sure that I don't have COVID and they agreed, but now I'm afraid that I've made a bad impression. I really want this job as I've had several long stretches of unemployment since college which is really hurting my self-esteem.

15zbhqq,I’m ruining a great opportunity for myself,"Long winded post warning, put I’ve been literally crying at my desk about this and seriously need some advice. 

TL;DR: got a golden opportunity but can’t make myself get any work done. What to do.

I’m a (very) recent college grad starting off at an organization with a lot of sway and very good reputation in my industry. My grades were good and I’m really grateful to be here. But. I was hired in a role that didn’t match my education (i’m now a software engineer when i graduated in aerospace) and that I had very little experience in. They were happy to teach me and I was happy to learn, at least until I found something at the same org in an area closer to my field of study. 

The problem? I feel like I’m barely managing to get anything done. I don’t want to go into too specific details but to me it’s Bad. I’m working slowly and feel like I’m wasting more time than I work. But I don’t know why I keep doing this. It’s completely in my control. Put the phone down and focus on the task at hand. I just. Can’t seem to get it to stick. (I have seriously thought about just leaving my phone at home and would have, if it weren’t for the fact that I carpool and my ride often has meetings right at the end of the day. Even if I did, I’m sure i’d find other ways to distract myself)

I used to be such an overachiever, I don’t know what happened. I was crazy active in high school and had no problem staying up super late to get everything done. I enjoyed learning and wasn’t usually distracted in class - maybe doodling on my notes but that was kinda it. I feel like somewhere along the way in university I picked up a much more apathetic attitude towards paying attention in class and working really hard. It didn’t matter, and I was able to get decent grades without trying super hard anyways. Partially I think this was my depression kicking into gear now that I didn’t have any after-school activities to keep me busy, and part of it was how easy it was to avoid actually learning during the covid era. I did my sophomore year entirely online, as well as half of my junior year. Plus a chunk of my freshman year (we never came back after spring break). 

I got some treatment for depression through the school and ended up on a pretty heavy dose that I no longer have access to as I’ve not found a new psychiatrist yet. It helped some- I wasn’t skipping homework because I didn’t feel like it anymore - but it wasn’t enough for me to get that drive back. I lost any sense of wanting to improve. 

I feel like I could be a much better employee than the one I am now. No one’s said anything yet, but it’s only a matter of time before my lack of any drive becomes noticeable. I feel like I’m playing with fire with this, and worse I hate myself for not even trying to be good at this. I’m worried that if I screw this up, I’m not going to be able to get hired here again. This would be Bad, as it’s a place most people stay at once they’re hired and it’s also the best group in my industry in the nearby area. I’d likely have to relocate for a job that’s not here, which I’m very hesitant to do because my partner (who also works where I do) and I just moved to this area anticipating staying here for a long time. 

I feel like I’m not applying myself at all and it sucks because this could be Big for me, and it sucks even more because I know I could do better. 

I’m also struggling not to compare myself to my partner because we both started off pretty similarly in university, but as my will to achieve plummeted he had no problem staying an overachiever. I love him for it, but it stings to view it as what I could be if i’d just get my shit together. 

Frankly, I don’t know if this is coherent or if this sub is the right place for this - please redirect me if not. But I know I can be better. I just can’t seem to make it happen. I also know I obviously need to at least find a therapist in my new area - I’m working on it. I don’t know what to do in the meantime. Please help, if you can. Do I talk to anyone? Keep trying? I don’t know. 

I’ve been keeping an eye out for new opportunities in my org to see if I can get something closer to my background, no luck so far.",dru1dic,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1692813743,2023-08-23 18:02:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15zbhqq/im_ruining_a_great_opportunity_for_myself/,8,2023

15zb8fw,Trying to explore what’s next for me,"Trying to explore what’s next for me (32 M). For most of my professional career so far, I’ve been working in an office or call center type of environment, and I don't feel like it's an environment that I fit in well with.

The last couple of months have been some of the most turbulent and stressful of my life both professionally and personally, and this all has caused me to do a lot of soul searching to try and figure out where I really want to take myself and try and find a career that I’m actually really excited about and want to grow in, and not have my life essentially be this SpongeBob clip of an unfulfilled man just going through the motions his whole life.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfgL9Y1O1ko

I feel like I've had this growing desire to want to change my career to something more outdoors and/or traveling, at least a large portion of it. I love exploring, being outdoors, and hiking, and I have an interest in cartography, physical and cultural geography, botany, horticulture, fermentation, nutrition, conservation, environmentalism. But they've just been more personal interests that I don’t really know how to grow or explore beyond that.

Looking back if I could do my college years over again, I would likely pursue something closer to Environmental Sciences or maybe even GIS, I have a minor in Geography with a couple courses of GIS, but that’s about it, and that was probably around 10 years ago now.

I feel like I’m having something between a quarter and mid life crisis, trying to figure where to take myself. Has anyone else made the transition in their early 30s from having a career focused primarily in an office environment to one primarily based outdoors?

I looked at the conservation corps, and it seems like a really intriguing idea, but the compensation is low, and I would definitely be on the upper end of their age limit, and I just don’t know if the end result would be worthwhile or not at this point.

I’ve been reexploring a bit of GIS, I even started taking a GIS course through Coursera to try and see how I like it before committing to something more, like maybe a GIS certificate program through a local community college. It seems intriguing, but I don’t have enough confidence if it’s something I should really dive into. The consensus online seems to be split between people who loved their transition into GIS and the other half that complain of low pay and lack of job opportunities.  
I’m not opposed to lower/ modest pay in the short term if I feel like I’m really working in an environment that I feel passionate about and living my most authentic life. 

I’m essentially just trying to get some ideas as I’m transitioning to a new chapter in my life while I'm still relatively young and want to see if others have felt the same or some potential career paths for me to explore.

  
Thanks a bunch!

15zb22m,I'm nervous about getting a job I want with my college major,"I majored in marine biology in undergrad and am about to be a senior. I realized pretty quickly at the beginning of college that I didn't like the major and wanted to switch but it was during COVID and I was struggling to pass classes and my parents advised me to just stick with it so I did. 

It's too late to switch now, I only have one class left to finish the major. I am minoring in Spanish. 

It matters to me a lot to be able to live in a major city after I graduate such as NYC or San Francisco. I also thought it would be cool to live in Spain (hence the Spanish minor; I'm fluent in Spanish speaking and can write fairly well).

 I do care about conservation and environmentalism but it matters a lot to me to be financially independent from my parents so I want to do something that pays well. I wish I could go to grad school but I have a 2.8 gpa currently. 

Marine biology majors take the same core classes as biology (physics, chem, calc, statistics) and I am very good at working with other people and do well in social science related classes.

Here are all my questions:
What jobs can you get with a degree like this? Are there grad schools in the cities mentioned or similar places that would accept my GPA?

15zamzf,Do I Follow My Heart or my Bank Account?,"Hi friends, I’m hoping someone might have some good advice because I’m stuck in an endless loop of trying to be practical vs what my heart wants.

Back in July my supervisor recommended me for a promotion on another team that will have an opening in September. (Someone is retiring.) She knows the hiring managers and has put in a good word for me. The job is… well, a job. I think I could do the work proficiently but I don’t have any particular passion for the role or what I would be doing. About the only thing going for this job is more money and a better job title. My supervisor vouching for me makes this an almost guaranteed promotion.

On the other hand, I’ve been making some amazing (like casual networking meetings with directors in that department amazing) strides to make a name for myself in my dream department. The director I spoke with a couple of weeks ago told me, and I quote, “Once the hiring freeze is over on this side I have roles that I need good people to fill. Please stay in touch with me.” And we have stayed in touch! I have another casual meeting with them set up for end of October. The only thing is that I’m not sure when those roles are going to open up… I’m not even sure he knows.

The problem is that the role my supervisor recommended me for has opened up. And my company has a rule that if you accept a position you have to be in that position for at least a year before you can transfer out. Now I’m stuck trying to decide if it is smarter for me to go with the known promotion with better pay and run the risk of missing the opening on my dream team… The thing I’m most worried about is accepting this new role and then in 2 or 3 months finding out that something on the dream team is opening up and I’m locked into a job that I don’t really care about.

About 2,000 come to me and about 10,000 come to a distribution list I'm part of and some of the emails I need to pay attention to. 

I've struggled to manage this mailbox for the past 4 months at my new job. It also didn't help that I wasn't sure which emails I was supposed to be paying attention to and which ones not, but it's become clearer now.

I'm struggling as I would like to filter emails sent only to me, other folder for where I'm in the To Field, and others where I'm in the CC field only.

I would also like to do this with the DL emails. Those sent only to the DL, those where the DL is in the To field, and those where it's in the CC field only.

I've kind of managed to take control of my personal inbox although there doesn't seem to be an easy way to filter by cc only and sometimes it takes emails from the DL as it's assuming since I'm in the DL it's like me being in the mail, and sometimes it doesn't. 

My main problem is managing these mails to the DL. I can't figure a way to filter by those the DL is only copied to which seems to be the bulk. 

It doesn't help that we're a team of about 20 people and any single email gets about 20 replies mentioning that they received the mail. 

If anybody went through anything similar, any advice is appreciated.

15z7qyc,Need Advice on a Major Career Decision and Company Red Flags. What should I do?,"About 6 months ago, I started a new job at Company X with a really decent income for my field. Before that, I was at a different company for a brief 8 months before being suddenly laid off.

After joining Company X, I was approached by Company Y, hinting at a position that would pay much more (35% more). However, due to internal changes, they couldn't offer the position at that time. Since then, I've settled into Company X, feeling like I’m making an impact and am genuinely enjoying the work and the team atmosphere.

Now, the recruiter from Company Y has circled back with another potential role. The added income is tempting given my personal circumstances and would help greatly. However, several factors make me hesitant:

1. Company Y recently had a round of layoffs.
2. The Glassdoor reviews for Company Y are mixed, with some concerning feedback.
3. There seems to be quite a bit more responsibility as this position would be a level up from my current position. Maybe I’m having imposter syndrome.


Moreover, with my prior short stint before Company X, I'm concerned with how my resume might look with another quick transition. I don't want to be looked at as a job hopper, but the financial benefits of Company Y are hard to ignore.

There are two main bosses. Over the last year, I've noticed that most of the work for one of my boss' projects has been delegated to me, despite the work plan stating otherwise. I'm essentially doing the work of three people including her with an extremely unreasonable deadline upcoming for the final deliverable, which has been completely delegated to me despite the work plan saying it would be led by my two bosses. I've felt so overwhelmed I gave up part of my holidays to make sure things were getting done. In addition, other work she asked me to do she makes seem so important, but she'll never even look at or will forget that I did. Hours wasted.

I'm a non-confrontational person and a people pleaser but I feel I need to stick up for myself, because who else will.

I want to get those FT paychecks otherwise I will be unemployed / at a job not related to my field at all.

How often should I go to not be regarded as a bad employee?","At least 90% of my team and the people that I work with are remote working in another city or just don't come in. My boss is on vacation and is only coming back in another month so I've been basically going in office by myself. I haven't met anyone or won't really get the chance to meet anyone that I work with realistically.

My current company opened a new office building during the pandemic which is why they want to push employees to go. I see most other people go 2-3 times a week but I don't interact with them as we all work on different client portfolios and projects so I honestly feel like it's been super draining for me to go in office and barely have any interaction or meet people that work on the same projects as I am. I also don't have much work to do as of now as I'm not fully onboarded.

My boss basically said ""just go whenever you can"" and there isn't a set amount or expectation. She said she goes in 4 times a week but that's honestly a lot for me and I don't expect to go in together with her and for our interactions to be like a co-worker. What would be a reasonable amount of time to go in office to not be labeled as a bad employee? And obviously to pass probation as well. I was thinking 2-3 times even when my boss is back.

15z4t8v,Getting frustrated by long hiring process - do I continue to sit and wait?,"I applied for a VP role at a university in April in which the application period closed on April 24th. I received an email on May 30 inviting me to interview. I had my interview with the search committee on June 24. I received a notification by email on July 7 that I had made it to the finalist stage. I had my finalist interview on July 24. During that interview, the president indicated that they were interviewing another person on July 31 and that they expected to make a decision that week. After not hearing a word back, I checked in on the status of the hiring process with HR on August 8. The associate HR director who said she was responsible for checking references and contacting the chosen candidates with offers seemed confused because she did not know that the president had even conducted finalist interviews. She did confirm that they had not offered anybody the job or checked references.

My boss (who is serving as one of my references) received a call on August 10th, and my previous boss received a call on August 14th. On both of those calls the president was the one calling for a reference check and indicated on the phone with both of them that they were checking references for myself and one other person. Neither of my other two references received a call. That was nine days ago, and we're approaching five months since the position was posted.

I'm getting anxious, as I will be out of a job in December (new president cleaning house at my current institution) and this job pays quite a bit more than I'm currently earning. Do I just continue to sit and wait on pins and needles or is there a point where it's appropriate to call HR again and see where things stand?

15z44m1,Has IT become too toxic or it's been like that since forever?,"Backstory. 

I've been looking for a decent job in various fields for the last 13 years. I've been working in IT for the last 6 of those 13. 

The last job was quite good, and I had pretty solid career growth until I realized that I stopped growing, no raises were approved,  bonuses were cut. On top I lived through two major layoffs and started feeling very anxious. 

The main downside was that no matter what team/position I worked at, there was always at least 1-2 people who were quite toxic, which influenced my satisfaction from the job. 

After 5 years I decided to make a move and started carefully picking a new job. Eventually I landed a higher paid and more technical position in a different company where two of my ex coworkers have been working for several years. They advertised the company as very reliable and overall cool. 

After onboarding and several months into the job I see completely oppostite. Departments don't have proper communication. People gossip eveywhere and tell smack about each other, sht on CEO and CEO literally tells on the meetings that our company hired to many people so we need to start making conclusions. Some of the trainees I came with, left after a month. I am doing my work pretty good and I constantly get positive feedback. Yet I feel like this might be an incomplete image and I am afraid to get even more surprises. 

Turned out, this job is somewhat worse than the place I left, except the pay is slightly better and overall there is less job to do here, fewer meetings and no ""family"" BS that I hated at the previous place.",Ron1ncat,2,1.0,4,1692797712,2023-08-23 13:35:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15z44m1/has_it_become_too_toxic_or_its_been_like_that/,8,2023

15z2n78,"Lateral move, debating if it’s worth it","So I applied for an internal position and got the offer yesterday.
Right now, I work as a customer service rep II. I like it but it is a bit overwhelming at times and I am getting burnt out. I make 48.5k

My organization posted a vendor relationship coordinator role in our finance dept. the role is posted at 45-48k. They will match my current salary, I tried to negotiate to 50k, but no luck. 

Hours, pay, benefits etc will all be the same.

The role would be working with vendors to find savings and ensure bills are received and paid in timely manner. There will be some project based tasks.

Right now, I am simply handling customer inquiries.

I believe there is more room to grow in this role and I’m hoping less burn out. I have been in my current role 2.5 years, and received a promotion from level 1 to 2.

I’m debating if it’s worth it to make a lateral move when I’m relatively happy with my role, especially if it is the same pay. However, I’m thinking since I have a finance degree, it may be better for myself to break into that role, as I feel almost at a dead end as a customer support rep. Also I am tired of speaking to customers lol. 

In the end, I also feel like this could look good on a resume that I was willing to take on a new role if I were to leave this org.

Are lateral moves worth it? The dept is expected to grow, so I would wonder since I am the first person in this role if I could try to be a lead in the future.

15z1m58,SEO Entrepreneur with 6+ Years of Experience Seeking Career Advice,"Hey there,  
As an SEO professional with over six years of experience, I found myself feeling a bit tired and burnt out from this field last year. While my experience is quite diverse and could still provide me with a decent income without too much hustle, the platform I used to work on (Upwork), has become super competitive and definitely limits job opportunities for Ukrainians like me. I can still find jobs on LinkedIn, but they tend to be full-time, which doesn't quite match my lifestyle goals. I really love spending time in the mountains, going biking, and just chilling for a few days whenever I feel like it.  
I'm not ready to completely switch careers right now because I'm not sure what I'd do next. Also, I have like 2-3 years of project management experience as well - in SEO sphere and volunteering in NGO. So, I decided to focus on generating passive income by creating courses on Udemy. I've already made one, but it still takes quite a bit of time and effort to promote it, and it'll be a while before it starts bringing in some money.  
I'm exploring options to change my work style and earn enough to live comfortably (I've got some savings that can cover me for about six months). I'm not really interested in titles or climbing the corporate ladder; I just want to enjoy life every day - that is my life goal.  
**Here are some ideas I'm considering:**  
1. **Keep Trying on Upwork**: Even though it's crowded and you have to pay to apply for jobs around 1-2 USD, I might stick with Upwork for a bit longer.  
2. **Look Beyond LinkedIn:** I might start looking for jobs on LinkedIn and other less popular websites, especially for the U.S. market. This could be something I do during the colder months, starting around November, when I have limited outdoor activities.  
3. **Focus on Building My Personal Brand:** This seems like the best option for me. I'll continue creating and updating courses, try different ways to promote them, and even build my own website to sell courses directly and keep more of the profits.  


4. **I enjoy coaching and mentoring in SEO**, so I'm thinking of shifting my focus to business consulting and teaching groups and individuals on an hourly basis. I'll definitely need to find customers on my own outside of Upwork, but I'm prepared for that. It also seems like a good option for me.  
**What do you think about these ideas? What would you do if you were me?**   


P.S. I thought about spending autumn'22 somewhere at Goa to completely reload myself, but the war in my country started and now I can't leave it due to restrictions.

15yxyfp,Pathways for freshly graduated engineer with ‘unreliable’ degree,"TL;DR - Having a Thai engineering degree, how can I start my career abroad?

I’ve just graduated (bachelors of) mechanical engineering from a Thai university a few months ago, and all I aim for is to get out this country (long, irrelevant story, for now). The company I’m working for is basically perfect apart from 1 thing - salary. The pay is so bad that I am basically forced to do another job on the side most days of the week to cover for petrol and living expenses with no savings. I’ve got around a 2+ hours commute everyday and I’m still living with my parents, all of the this has pushed me down to a very low point both physically and mentally. 


From my past (and failed) experience of trying to attend a university abroad, Thai education is laughed at and normally ignored anywhere, but I cannot realistically grow in this country and I do not have the funds to pack-up-and-go-see. 


Considering my best skill are interpersonal communication and presentation, I’m not even necessarily too invested in engineering either, if it comes to that. If my goal is to grow a career elsewhere—the very hopeful goal being UK/Australia/Germany— what could be my first steps? 


Some of my very flawed ideas:

- Save up enough to go work-and-travel, and try to get a job in the respective country in the time. (Very risky)

- Jump to a totally different career path that pays a little better in this country and save up enough to jump ship soon. (Risky and not so feasible)

- Try to find a niche field that I could get a scholarship for to get a masters degree in the field. (Low demand)

- Stay like this for 2+ years for a **chance** to quit with experience and look later. (I might not last that long)


So that’s where I am at the moment. Any advice, warnings or wake up calls are appreciated, I feel overwhelmed from the day-to-day and I’m paying with my health.

15yuj59,What happens when you don't want to 'climb the ladder'?,"Hello! I am new to my post-grad field but some conversations at work had me realising something: I do not want to climb the corporate ladder.

One coworker said, about another coworker who left to obtain their dream job, ""Can you imagine having your DREAM job?"" and I realised... I had it. What I was doing was exactly what I wanted to do; if in a limited aspect. 

I do NOT want to be a manager. Not now, not ever. Nearly all corporate climbs seem to involve management of some kind?  


I wanted to be an econometrician. I got the degree, am in my postgrad, and am(was, got fired, lmao) working as an econometrician. I -DO- want to be better at my job, I -DO- want to learn more statistical methods, mapping methods, analysis/report methods, etc. Like, I applied for one job to work in regulating monopolies and I love the idea of learning that. Another was for installing pipelines in indigenous communities for water. I love that too. A third was using MCMC (my post-grad topic) to do financial analysis. That's pretty neat too? I hate finance but love the idea of using MCMC on some truly large data and would learn a lot.

So, it occured to me... I want to get paid more. I want to get better at my job. But I don't want to 'progress' into management, just harder projects. Even then, my education pretty much puts me at the limit for Industry needs. Like, they're using Excel for a pie chart, not Python for an MCMC of a billion trades, you know?

Does this mean I am better suited to academia? Or should I refrain from going up the management ladder and try to aim for more precise skillsets that'll keep me doing what I love? Is there a way, with an economics degree and a stats/econ/health to just...stay an economist who keeps getting paid relative to the worth of my skills, instead of the worth of my management?

My current (postgrad) degree is Econ Hons, which is a Masters equivalent here, and the dissertation is in health/biological statistics and MCMC analysis.  So I am a statistical economist (aka econometrician) by definition. I prefer micro but can do macro. I prefer behavioural but clearly can also do health.

Where would my skills fit best to avoid becoming a manager and still getting consistent increases in pay?",splithoofiewoofies,1,1.0,3,1692769157,2023-08-23 05:39:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15yuj59/what_happens_when_you_dont_want_to_climb_the/,8,2023

Just the fact that jobs that are well within my field of expertise are not getting back to me I don't see why a tech company would even consider me.

15yt7xr,"Promoted, but colleague is challenging the decision.","A colleague and I were hired around the same time 10 years ago, in the same department but different roles. We used to work well together, became friends, and developed mutual friends over the years. Somewhere along the way things changed. He became withdrawn, no longer collaborated and our interactions became tense and he was passive aggressive. It was odd and awkward both at work and outside of work with friends.

Fast forward 5 or so years and I was just promoted to lead the department, becoming his boss. Our leadership delivered this news to him without me in the room, and he did not take it well. He has told those leaders he does not accept the new reporting structure, and has essentially challenged my promotion.

 I’ve had several meetings with my boss and HR to try and understand why he reacted this way. He’s given them a few reasons with little detail, but essentially he’s saying I said something bad about him to someone and that person told him what I had said. Because of that, he does not trust me or respect me and will not move forward with me in this role. He will not provide them with any details on what was said, when, or to whom. When pressed on whether he spoke to me about the situation, he said he did not because he doesn’t like confrontation. When asked if I’ve been supportive of him, championed his work and been an advocate for him, he acknowledges that I have.

While I believe him to be immature and unprofessional in this situation, I have to find a way forward. We are both extremely good at our jobs, I want him to stay, and there is zero chance he leaves. The promotion happened 3 weeks ago, but I have not yet assumed that role despite an organizational announcement and everything is on hold until HR and leadership can figure this thing out. It’s been a very tense few weeks and HR has instructed me not to speak to him about all this to avoid him perceiving the conversation as retaliation. 

I could use some advice on how to manage the situation. This has really sucked the joy out of the promotion for me, but however this is resolved we’re going to have to work together. How can I repair that relationship, regain some trust, and lead this team to make work fun again?",AdAntique6663,1,1.0,1,1692765093,2023-08-23 04:31:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15yt7xr/promoted_but_colleague_is_challenging_the_decision/,8,2023

Her position is only one “step” above mine and the only big difference between our roles is that she has supervisory duties, and I do not. She just notified everyone that she will be retiring in a few weeks. 

Here is some backstory for context: 
- I started the position about 1 year ago
- I graduated with my bachelors degree this month (yay!) 
- my only coworker is the admin assistant who is retiring and she has been working in the same office for over 30 years. 
- Since stating my position, there has been a blatant withholding of information and training from my coworker. Possibly as a job security tactic? 
- the previous dean in our office was aware that coworker was withholding information and was trying to interfere. He would make comments about how I will he “running the office soon”. The deans term ended last month.
- when coworker would go on holidays, she would like a giant mess for me to clean up but get mad at me if I was ever sticking my nose in her business. The most recent time she went away, I did lots of overtime trying to sort things out and she was saying how she could just “quit right now, [me] has everything under control”. 

My current situation:
My coworker is now retiring and it only makes sense that I would take her position. However, I have asked to meet with the business manager to ask some questions about what will happen going forward. She has been completely avoiding me. As for everyone else around the office, they are being weird and avoidant too. The whole situation feels extremely awkward and as if they are trying to quickly find someone else to fill her position before they meet with me? The whole situation is incredibly awkward and uncomfortable for me. It’s clear that I am not being considered for the position, and I have no idea why. 

Side note, I met with the previous dean and brought up my situation. He said they hired me with the intention of taking coworkers position when she retires because they wanted someone younger/with less seniority to bring in a fresh perspective to an office that has run the same way the past 50 years. He said he got push back from my coworker because she wanted someone with higher seniority to take over her position. He also confirmed that he absolutely thinks I would be capable of handling her position, if I wanted to apply. 

All in all, I am just feeling really awkward and uncomfortable about this whole thing. I dont know what is going on but I cant deny that this whole situation is hurtful since i think that i am fully capable and qualified, esp now that i have graduated. Any advice? I am looking for a new position but I don’t think it will happen soon enough to avoid this all together.

I am a student of biotechnology at my local university, but I am  passionate for geology. 

I always dreamed of studying geology but I feel stuck here in my parent´s house studying something I like but are not passionate about. From the careers my university offered, biotech was the one I liked the most (because I do like biotech). If there had just been available geology I would have ended studying it. MY PLAN A is to finish my biotech degree and move to Mexico City (I live in Mexico and due to economical and budget reasons getting into the best university in Mexico and the 102th best in the world is not a bad idea) and once there, study ""engineering geology"" which is the mexican version of ""BSc. Geology"", is the same, it is even certified internationally etc etc. MY PLAN B is to finish my biotech degree and head down to Mexico City and continue onto the best biotech masters in Mexico: Instituto Politécnico Nacional´s ""Applied Biotech"" MSc, or also ""Master of Science in Biomedicine and Molecular Biotechnology"". The advantage of IPN or UNAM is that a Masters is affordable and at the same time, is in the highest education standards of the country.  MY PLAN C is to finish my biotech degree, get some work in my city (Ciudad Juarez), save some money, and go backpacking to Europe or to Patagonia for 30-40 days, get a new experience of life and probably (highly), dedicate my life to something totally different like being a professional scuba diver or something like that and go from country to country living a life of adventure.

15yoj26,WLB or Money?,"WLB or Money?

Would you rather have a job with an ideal work-life balance or a job with a higher salary? 

I’m struggling to decide if I should stay in a field where my work-life balance is decent and I earn a good salary, or if I should be in a job where I get to WFH, mostly go at my own pace, but make ~1/2 my field-related salary. 

I really appreciate the ability to work from home, not worrying about commuting to work, prepping lunch or clothes to go to the gym, and less stress. 

However, the money for this remote job earns me much less than that of a job in my field of education study & credentials. These 2 factors are in my mind frequently because I feel like I’ve wasted my degree and could be contributing more to my household. My fiancé and I want to eventually get a home, upgrade his car, pay of loans, go on nice vacations, etc. 

The higher-salary, decent work-life balance job would be a standard work week in a healthcare setting. I would earn about the same as my partner and know that would take some financial stress off his mind. I would also feel better about this and my ability to contribute. 

We aren’t struggling by any means, but I don’t want him to feel the bulk of our financial burden.

15yof9b,My coworker told me he thinks the women in our office dont belong in our work.,"We work are both office engineers in the construction industry. My (M27) coworker (M mid-30’s) told me on a work trip that he doesnt understand the recent female hirings in our group. He went on to say that women “cant perform the tasks that men can” and “that they are not as efficient or intelligent as the men in our group.” 

This is a relatively progressive construction engineering firm, that have strongly promoted women in engineering. So Im confident that the ramifications for this sort of talk could be harsh. 

There’s a few things that have me nervous. 1.) while we are coworkers he is my senior by about 10 years. While he is not my manager, he does frequently review and make corrections to my work, and is a manager himself (no women work under him) 2.) Im new to the group. Ive only been with them for about a year. 3.) Im not saying this excuses it, but construction is a non-PC work environment. This means that if I report him and he is fired for it I dont know who else shares his feelings and if they will take it out on me. 4.) I have nothing recorded, and nothing concrete. He could just say I made the whole thing up.

I know that I can go to HR, and report him.

15ynj1i,Starting New Role - tips for making good impression?,"Hello,

I have been working professionally for 7 years, 4 of which were in a retail environment and the last 3 were in an office for a smallish (< 150 employees) company. 

I have recently accepted a new role in one of the largest companies in the world in my industry and it's essentially my ideal situation. I personally feel slightly under qualified for the role but maybe I am just intimidated by the jump from the kiddie pool to the deep end. 

Do you have any general tips for making a strong first impression in this larger corporate environment? My understanding that the work atmosphere is very collaborative and generally my industry is not particularly competitive/cutthroat so I am not worried about people trying to step on me. Rather, I am just looking for best practices that can be applied to most new hires entering into a top company (for example, going from working at an indie studio to Microsoft).

15ynelg,Overcoming Challenges: Navigating 3.5 Years of Unemployment in the Tech Industry,"**My Background:**

I've got a broad tech background that covers lots of different things. I have years of experience working with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap as well as using PHP and MySQL for backend development work. I’ve also have working experience with iOS development using Swift. I can build different categories of web applications from simple websites to more complex SaaS platforms. I know how to create and consume REST APIs and know how to integrate GraphQL. I'm comfortable with different programming languages like PHP, JavaScript, Typescript, and Swift. In web development, I'm experienced in HTML, CSS, and have used tools like ReactJS, NextJS, Gatsby, and more. I've also worked with databases like MySQL and others called MongoDB, Firestore, and Realm. I've done a bit of design and making prototypes using Adobe XD and Figma. For managing content on websites, I know how to use systems like WordPress and Contentful. Aside from the tech skills, I've also led teams before, making sure everyone works together smoothly.Prior to migrating to the US, I have 15 years of experience in the tech industry. When I moved to the US in 2017, I got a job in NYC working as a Sr. Software Engineer.  
  
**Last Job Position and Covid:**

Back in 2017 - 2019, I was working as a Sr. Software Engineer with a focus on iOS Development. Then came 2020, and we all know how Covid and lockdowns changed everything. During that period, I took the time to invest in my professional development and growth.  
**Challenges and Timeline:**

* **Early 2021**: I provided care for a family member, leading to a temporary hiatus in my career pursuits.
* **Mid 2021:** As I resumed job hunting, I faced a 1.5-year gap that recruiters were curious about. I was asked, ""Why the gap?"" I explained my circumstances, including the family care responsibilities. To demonstrate my skills, I created a personal website showcasing my work and kept learning about other technologies.
* **Entering 2022:** With a 2-year gap by this point, I was actively applying to various jobs, sending out 1-2 targeted resumes each day. I explored job boards like Indeed, Wellfound, Jobot, Robert Half, Redballoon, Ziprecruiter and LinkedIn just to name a few. To demonstrate my adaptability, I created a sample web application that aligns with the technology utilized by the company I am applying to. I continually invest in learning and refining my skill set to tailor my resume to the specific roles I pursue.
* **Late 2022:** I almost fell victim to a scam, which understandably made me cautious. This fear set me back for a couple of months in my job search.  
2023: Fast forward to 2023, I'm dealing with a 3-year gap on my resume. I've been relentless in my job search, updating my resume once again and even branching out to apply for non-IT roles. However, despite my efforts, I'm yet to receive any return calls, emails, or even the tiniest glimmer of opportunity.
* **Mid 2023:** With a 3.5-year gap looming large, I'm still determined to persevere in my quest for a job. I've taken the initiative to showcase my skills through portfolio designs and continuous skill refreshing.

**Seeking Advice:**

I'm reaching out to you, the Reddit community, for any advice, guidance you might have. Have any of you ever faced those extended periods of unemployment in the tech industry? I'm particularly keen to learn how you tackled the challenge of explaining gaps in your career journey. Are there companies out there that appreciate the skills and experience someone brings, regardless of a gap? I only apply to job posting where I meet 90% of the requirements. In my job search, I had employers / recruiters say ""I'm over qualified for the position"", some say ""I don't have enough work experience as a <job title>"" or ""We want someone who uses the <technology>, professionally"". They are not even looking at transferrable skills anymore.

I  believe that proficiency is not solely determined by professional experience. Side projects, personal projects, tutorials, and self-directed learning have all contributed to sharpening a skillset.   
Personally, I've encountered a frustrating trend where my qualifications seem to get overlooked due to these career gaps. It's disheartening because I know I have the drive and dedication to excel, but sometimes those gaps on paper can lead to unfair assumptions about my work ethic.  
**TL;DR:**

15ynbw0,Looking for career advice,"Throwaway.

A little background. Mid 30s male. Florida, greater Orlando region. Unfinished college degree (MBA), probably not going to finish.

I work in a very niche industry. Without getting into too many details or revealing my company, I essentially coordinate repair services within the state of FL and parts of Mississippi and Alabama.

I schedule 16 techs living from Miami to the FL panhandle. I field incoming requests for service, create work orders, and assign them to a tech for completion.

I make decisions based on location, skillets/experience, who is the bigger customer (priority) and priority based on business impact of our customers (business to business, not residential).

I keep the department running smoothly, although I'm not the manager. I make sure all of our guys are profitable. I oversee parts orders needed for repairs, monitor tracking/delivery and scheduling follow up visits.

Requests for service come via email, work cell, text, desk phone, and on typical day, it's almost non stop.

I'm an hourly employee at $27/hr with essentially mandatory overtime (50+ hour weeks) which I'm actually fine with.

I'm pulling in about 79k/yr, which is pretty good for Florida, however, I'm feeling trapped at this job and I'm looking for a change. Ideally, something that pays more, or roughly the same, with room to grow. I'm pretty sure I'm maxed out, or close to it, where I'm currently at.

I'm going to spend the weekend brushing up my resume and cover letter, but as far as what I could realistically apply for and have a shot at.. I'm at a loss.

Looking for thoughts on what someone in my position should do. I've been here for two years, I've received 7 raises, from $16 to $27. This job has brought me well out of poverty. My department has also grown about 125% since I've been here, in both revenue and staff.

15ylf0z,IT Specialist specializing at leaving tech - How to rework resume and GTFO?,"Hey everyone, hoping I can get some advice on how to proceed with switching careers or any general ideas of where I should go. Sorry for formatting, mobile.

At the moment: I was recently laid off from a Help Desk position, contract, replaced by an offshore team. 9 years IT Support, Network Support, and Help Desk experience. I have good working knowledge, certifications, the works - but I'm burnt out from the field. I've done exceptionally well in my career, have countless professional references, and I could potentially land something in IT that pays around the $70k/yr mark... but I just don't want to, not for something I hate.

Doesn't bother me so much that I was laid off. I've put in my work, I've kept up with tech, and I ultimately can't go through with an other interview of someone asking me if I know what DHCP, DNS, or VPN stands for. I 'walked out' of an interview immediately after they'd ask, because I've been doing this for years and I just checked out mentally when he brought it up because I instantly realized I want nothing to do with IT.

I want to switch to something I enjoy. 

Motorcycle mechanic, automotive industry, property management, leasing consultant, or something stupid like a pet store manager (you work with your communities or teams, build them up, help people, something hands on, challenges me to come up with ideas). 

I want to be able to use my body and mind a little more instead of rotting in bed dealing with tickets of ""my printer doesn't work, help.""

I have experience in team leading, supervision, sales, & mechanic work at a quick-lube place that I mostly worked weekends at until they closed for 5 years, restored many project cars with extensive documentation of said projects, I've written IT guidelines, procedures, etc. IT and any type of administrative softwares, certifications with two network companies, and have also dealt with many types of stressful high paced environments. I've also helped maintain, review, and deal with leasing situations, fair housing, etc. from when my grandfather would rent out his apartments above his computer shop for half a decade. A jack of all trades, and a master of absolutely none situation.

Anyone have any suggestions on how to break into a field without misrepresenting myself and still presenting myself as competent? Any suggestions on how to rework my IT dominated resume to reflect more on my other loosely marketable skills?

Thank you everyone in advance, and I'll try to reply to everyone's comments!

15yknqt,Got a full ride scholarship in a field I'm passionate about. But do I leave an objectively good job for it?,"I've been in the workforce for a few years now and finally landed a decent FT role at an F100 firm doing software development after bouncing around doing internships and contract work at relatively unknown employers. The pay is okay for my area (~65k USD), I have good benefits and, despite attempts to force staff back to the office, I can still work remotely for now. I have a CS degree and this job is a significant resume boost for me.

The job is pretty stressful and I live in a sea useless documents and meetings, where I simultaneously am overwhelmed with too much information, yet somehow never enough to do my work efficiently. While the job is good on some days, it's awful on others. I am pestered for updates on my work, yet also pulled away from work to do trivial tasks. While I fully admit that my performance has been mediocre due to drama in my personal life and some bad tasks at the start of my tenure, my other employers were also much better to work for.

Before I got this job, due to my lack of success in the job market, I had been applying to master's programs. I continued with these applications after I started the job, since the fees were already paid and I wasn't always happy. To my surprise, one of them offered me a full ride scholarship (with a housing stipend) to attend their business program (so not STEM related at all), which is a goal that I've had for a long time. The school is a major university but isn't well-established in the business world.

I'm tempted to leave this job, but as the start of the school year approaches, I'm getting cold feet. My boss has straight up told me that I can't do both school and the job, since I need to move to attend, despite the employer having an educational stipend. I feel like this job will continue to be a grind if I stay, and that I won't get a better opportunity to go back to do a master's, but it also sucks to leave a job after it took so long to finally land a decent position.

Just went through my final round of interviews. Everything went very well. I’m looking to ask for an increase in base pay (salary) before OTE. 

This is in Software sales as an outbound SDR. During the first casual conversation with the recruiter, she asked me what my target salary was, and I told her “I’m looking for something in the range of 60-75k”

She says “is that base salary or commission included?”

I said “It depends on the role and the expectations.”

She said “The base pay for this role is 50k, with OTE up to 25k, uncapped. Does that work?”

I said “that seems sufficient.” Without saying more (as I didn’t have as much information about the position). 

After doing research, the industry standard for my state is between 57k to 61k base pay. 

Am I screwed out of negotiating my base pay into this range because I mentioned it’s “sufficient” before?

Can I say “based on my further understanding of the role, I would like to ask for a base pay more in range of the industry average for this area.”

Or is it too late?

I would like to respectfully ask for a 7-11k base pay increase, basically.

End of the story right? Wrong. Apparently in order to terminate someone there is a long standing policy in the company of needing to have a “proof of actual or potential substantial harm” that would come to the company as a result.  
I explained to him that that employee clearly doesn’t know his place and has displayed incredible arrogance via his actions but he said that unless there’s a clear indication that he is someone who is likely to tarnish the company or its employees in some clear sense there is nothing he can legally do.  
Since common sense apparently isn’t a core value of our company how can I articulate with reason how what this person did is so intolerable?",Klutzy_Safety_4566,0,0.46000000834465027,42,1692738895,2023-08-22 21:14:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15yiuj3/justification_for_termination_of_arrogant_employee/,8,2023
15yiufl,Bioengineering or medicine? I'm based in the UK and I'm choosing between these 2 degrees,"
 I am interested in the brain (i.e mental disorders such as psychosis). Due to wanting to become an astronaut and later down the line a pilot, I grew quite interested in space and astrobiology - did not pursue physics for a levels - astrophysics is not an option. Lucid dreaming, remote viewing and out of body experiences interest me. Gene therapy is very interesting too. 
Imo, correct me if im wrong, both degrees will give me the opportunity to research about the brain/disorders and treatments for it (gene therapy/testing in terms of treatment is more interesting than medication), both degrees will give me the opportunity to branch of into space, med may give the edge. Med has the added bonus of branching of into a data science feild by pursuing a bioinformatics degree postgrad. 
Most important things for me: opportunity to branch of into space and/or research about the brain (all these different illnesses and phenomenons).
Med seems like a better option career wise as there is a guaranteed job, apparently bioengineering is not too good but surely the transferable skills will serve me well? *Apparently* it's hard to pursue research/get compensated well doing things without a med degree, correct me if I'm wrong.

15yioli,How to tailor resume from educator to office worker?,"Hey everyone!  
  
Tl;Dr  
  
Current Behavior Interventionist having trouble transferring to entry-level office position needs advice. Was told by staffing agency that my background in education will make it difficult to find these entry-level positions and that was discouraging so I feel lost.  
  
  
  
Current educator here, I was never a lead teacher but have worked as a Special Education Teaching Assistant, Substitute Teacher, Co-Teacher, and now Behavior Interventionist.  
  
I want to transfer to office positions since my current position as a BI will not be able to give me much hours for the week. I have been applying to Admin Assistant positions and Receptionists but have been having a hard time getting calls back.  
  
  
  
I know I am good at communicating and even convincing students to stay focused and sometimes calming students down. I actually really like talking to people, which is why I really like working as a tutor and class assistant instead of a lead teacher (felt more like babysitting).  
  
Does anyone have any tips to improve how I look for potential employers? I have not tried staffing agencies much since I was LA. (I was with Ultimate Staffing and told them I was looking for an entry-level position like Office Assistant or Receptionist and all they said was it's going to be difficult with my background in education and only gave me one potential lead).",tunaman1250,2,1.0,1,1692738536,2023-08-22 21:08:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15yioli/how_to_tailor_resume_from_educator_to_office/,8,2023
15yigoy,I hate my job after 5 months. Will taking a 6-month contract just to get out hurt me in the long run?,"I hate where I'm working, mostly because of my boss.

I have an opportunity to take a 6-month contract. The only net benefit over my current job is that it would get me out from under this terrible boss. It's a slight pay bump and slightly better benefits.

However, will taking the 6-month contract actually hurt me in the long run? By the end of this contract, I will have on my resume one job for 5 months and another for 6.

15yiazq,What shoul I do? My parents ask me to stop pursuing my dream job,"My dream job is to become a medical doctor.
I‘ve already tried the entry exam twice. It always was a close call but in the end i didn‘t pass the exam.
To this day my parents have helped me financially and in many other ways,which I am very grateful for.
But now because I failed the entry exam again my parents have asked me to pursue something different. 
In the time between the entry exams I‘ve already tried to study pharmaceutical science but I don‘t know if it is really the path I should take.
The thing is, I am sure the next time I will pass the entry exam for med school.
My parents insist that I take a different route because they don’t think that I am destined to become a doctor.(Because of the failed attempts)
It is a difficult decision because it could affect my health insurance status and my financial status too. That too is the reason  why they are so concerned about career decision…

I understand why my parents think I should change my mind about becoming a doctor.
But it is my dream job.
Aren’t I allowed to dream? And (hopefully) live it?
Or am I too stubborn to see that my parents know what they are talking about, and should accept the reality that I am not becoming a doctor?
Does anybody have some advice for me?
Am I possibly too concentrated on only one job option?

(It’s august and everyone is on vacation here) I like the department in company B more but I don’t really have a feeling how likely I’m gonna get an offer from them, I feel like it’s a 50-50. 

This is my first time applying for jobs/internships so I’m not sure what to do. I googled it and saw some pages suggest to write an email to company A and tell them I need some time. However, I’m not sure how many days they accept. 

So the question: do I write an email to company A and tell them I need some time? If so, how many days should I ask for? It’s still at least a week away for company B to give me an answer.

I have decided to major in Library Sciences, which would make sense for me because I’ve always been obsessed with books. However, I know that I’d much rather be a specific type of librarian. I would much rather work in a research centered library, one at a company, or even a college, rather than a public library. I’ve also heard of cop librarians, which sounds interesting. I’m not sure if it would be an accessible career option with a library sciences degree, though. 

So now I’m doing research about what the labor market is like, how many job openings there are. Would I have the privelage of being able to pick & choose what kind of libraries I’d want to work at, or is the job market small enough that I’d just have to take what I could get? I’m pretty shy, introverted, & asocial. So I’m hoping that if I’m able to get a job at a college/museum/research library, that it would be less…customer service centered?

2 years ago I was charged and convicted of 'sexual assault'.   
Story - I was on a plane, next to an elderly lady. I was partially asleep and was touching woman's hands and arms (I am being entirely honest). My ex-GF has told me about me doing such things (she didn't mind) and sometimes trying to talk in the partial asleep state (I remember these things when I am told). I tend to do this when I am too tired. Based on lawyer's recommendation, I admitted guilt. I was fined $1,000 with conviction record in Australia.   
Cut back to now - I am now interviewing for some government positions and worried how the department might react. How should I explain my position, that it wasn't truly intentional, when filling out character check documents. What's some of the wording I can use.   
Sentiment - I know there would be a lot of hatred from people and I deserve it. Trust me, there isn't a day that goes by when I don't regret it. I have thought about suicide, had left a job at the time, it took a massive toll on finances (lawyer fees and all), my relationships and most importantly the shame/stress it brought to my close ones.

15yejjj,"Graduated in a Masters degree, now I am so lost. Please help!","
Firstly I apologise if I don’t articulate my position well enough or I leave out any crucial details. I’ll try to keep it concise but also do my best at giving you enough to perhaps offer some advice :) thanks

I received my masters in Journalism at the end of 2022, and got a distinction. I was very happy with this, and was told this was a great achievement as it is very difficult to get a masters, and to get a distinction in one, the highest grade, even more so.

Prior to that in 2017, I graduated as an undergraduate in media. And got a 2:1. 

After my undergraduate in 2017 (and before my masters) I returned home and worked as a TA whilst living with my parents. This ticked me over and where I lived (rural) there was almost no opportunity to further my career. 

In 2019, I decided to move to Bristol. I picked up TA work to start working quickly before covid hit. After covid settled down I decided to do my masters in journalism to pick up steam and to get going in the city. I continued to do TA work part time during this to keep me going financially.

Now, over half way through 2023, and over 7 months since I graduated from my masters, I have absolutely no idea what to do. I have applied for endless amounts of different positions, some entry, some graduate schemes, in all sorts of different environments relating to my degree(s), and I don’t hear back from anyone. Around half of these I was super confident with my application, and never heard anything.

I suspect possibly that the lack of experience on my might have something to do with it. But then that’s the vicious circle! They want someone with experience for the job, but I can’t get a job to get any experience. I have a German friend (very smart, able, and with good experience) in the same position as me.

Is this just the job market now? Lower, entry level positions being filled by people wayyy overqualified so I don’t stand a chance? 

I feel like I have so much to offer. I have such a wide skill set and pick up skills in the field so quickly when I try them.

I am so sorry this so much information. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I am earning an absolute pittance at the moment, trying to get by, and I have a masters degree, at distinction level, and can’t use it to do anything.

I feel so lost, so uninspired, so helpless.

Please, please, if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Thank you so much.",JFM1994,3,0.7200000286102295,6,1692729623,2023-08-22 18:40:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15yejjj/graduated_in_a_masters_degree_now_i_am_so_lost/,8,2023

15ye3vl,"Seasonal worker, into botany/ecology/land/craft stuff, what to do in winter?","Hi folks. I work a seasonal job I love. It goes April-September usually. I have relatively very low income. Usually I transition from there and do WWOOFing or travel around, visit family, etc.  
I would like to eventually buy land and build a home. I'd still work my current job for several years before transitioning to staying on the land year-round. I would love to use it as a base for teaching classes/workshops on traditional crafts since that is my passion. Things like weaving, fiber crafts, basketry, woodworking, hide tanning, foraging. I have taught at folk schools here and there in the past and had teachers myself who made a small living from their land , just teaching in this way. This, along with growing food, an orchard, & caring for animals, is my dream. I grew up similarly and love it.  
I'd like to do something else in the meantime with my offseasons that will help me save more money, build skills I might need, or otherwise give me broader experience in case my path changes.  
Some leads:  
\-- I have a B.Sc in Biology and GIS , which I don't currently use. I sometimes wonder about going to graduate school to further study ethnobotany, which relates directly to my interest in traditional crafts. But I can't justify the costs. I'd love field ecology/biology work, but I know that tends to be in summer and not winter. I could try to build experience with snowshoeing & snowmobiling to open up more options in that regard.  
\--I worked in an herbarium before, with tens of thousands of plant specimens, and I enjoyed it. A lot of database management stuff, but some outdoor work too. This is very adjacent to museum work. I could see myself enjoying a natural history museum position. But I doubt any winter seasonals exist.  
\--Likewise I'd enjoy working at a historic site, especially one that was centered on prehistory, wherein I could craft or do reenactment of sorts.. I'm jealous of this and wish it were a job I could have: https://metro.co.uk/2021/06/07/woman-volunteers-to-live-in-the-stone-age-14709201/amp/  
\--I heard about land caretakers and world love to be one. I imagine it would be like the WWOOFing I do now, only much more independent, and paid. It would also help me build skills/experience for managing my own land someday. I have adjacent experience as part of my job now is maintaining a worksite that I live at alone, for months at a time. I don't know how rare these jobs are though, nor where to look!  
\--I have connections to continue to do teaching here and there at different traditional skills/folk schools. But the set ups are usually such that I'd be a guest instructor, the classes and money would be sporadic and not enough to really make a difference. So it's basically a side gig to me already and unlikely to become more than that. Without my own land, I can't go fully independent either.  
\--I can legally work in both Canada and the US, so opportunities in both countries are open to me.

15yddue,Why is the auto/diesel technician industry so secretive about pay?,"I’m currently studying to be a diesel technician at Universal Technical Institute. When I graduate in March, I might be going to the Fendt MSAT (Manufacturer Specific Advanced Training) program for 8 weeks, after which I’m supposed to sign an employment contract to work for Fendt for a year.

Up until recently, I’ve been pretty excited for this. I’m starting to notice that everyone in this industry seems to be *really* secretive about pay. Whenever I ask someone at a career fair, someone from the career services department at my school, etc, NO ONE will give me any actual numbers. They all tell a similar story of “this one guy at the shop did ____ and ____ and now he’s making six figures!”

This is supposed to be hard, back breaking work. I’m paying over $37k out of pocket for this school. The entire reason I avoided going to college and went to trade school instead in the first place was because of all the horror stories I’ve heard about people dropping over $100k on their education just to get a useless piece of paper that gets them nowhere.

In my experience, whenever a company is weirdly secretive about pay, it’s because it’s abysmally low and they know that will scare you away if they tell you up front. Well, I’m pretty scared right now, because it seems like the entire tech industry is like this. It’s difficult for me to find any concrete numbers online. The career services rep at my school has explained it away with “well I don’t want to give you a number just for you to get into the field and find out that’s not what you’ll be making. I don’t want you to think I lied to you.” So then give me the lower end of the salary range, or something?

I currently make about $20 an hour in *valet parking*. I don’t want to go through all this effort and waste all that money just to find out I’ll be making the same amount of money I could’ve made at a much easier job. Are there any current or former Fendt employees in here? Please be honest and tell me if I’m making the right decision.",Zorrostrian,1,1.0,0,1692727178,2023-08-22 17:59:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15yddue/why_is_the_autodiesel_technician_industry_so/,8,2023

Anyway, I think I am slightly under qualified for this new job according to the description but I know some of the stuff. I would really like the job, it would be a 30% raise from my current salary for the lowest salary they are offering, and it’s digital marketing which is what I’m interested in, rather than the sales role my current job is trying to force on me when I was hired for marketing.

The problem is I have anxiety. I get stressed when I have to talk to people and I have a hard time keeping a conversation flowing because I don’t know what to say. I also have trouble going into detail about things because I feel like I forget everything I’ve ever learned when I’m put on the spot.

15yc1tz,Should I take a base pay cut,"Currently working in tech sales. Base pay of 80K and an ""OTE"" of 160K. Here's the catch: no one hits quota.

Last year, only 2 people hit quota out of like 25 sellers. This year it looks like only a few more will hit. It's nearly impossible targets that only a few people with great territories manage to hit. I'm up there but not going to hit the 160 number.

My title currently is a senior level and I'm targeting key/enterprise accounts.

I'm considering an offer at a company for a sales role that targets SMB accounts. It is kinda a step back in title and the base is 70K, so a 10K base pay cut. However, OTE is 140 and 80% are hitting it. Numbers are even backed by RepVue.

* What even is a proper career transition?
* How many existential crises are too many?
* Is my dog judging my career choices?

15y86u4,Advice PLEASE: How To Narrow My Job Search?,"Advice Needed Please

I am currently a Full-time Employee as Gov Contractor with AT&T for IT/Telecommunications Project Management. The job mainly entails facilitating multiple million dollar MILCON and FSRM projects for a Military Installation and ensuring all construction/procurement projects are compliant with the Military Base as it pertains to Network Cabling/Infrastructure, Cybersecurity, Contract Drafting/Review, and tailoring Statements of Objectives/Work deliverables. 

I love this job! IT has been my passion! I've been a System Admin and IT Manager within my 10yrs of active military, so I have intermediate to Expert levels of experience in all fields related to these projects. Guiding each project from start to finish is absolutely rewarding when the end result is a brand new building ready to continue the mission. 

However, the Gov has yet to renew the contract so it could be ending this FY23. Thus, I am looking to continue supporting my family but the job market has not been helpful as I struggle to find something similar in capacity and scope. 

I am not afraid to switch industries as my current official title is: Sr. Specialist - Technical Project Manager. It sounds fluffy and fancy, but I honestly don't know what other Employers would even value in that title. I *think* my resume is pretty good as it was getting massive call backs earlier this year, but like I said, it's different now.

15y7us1,What would you do?,"Hello all, 

this is a new account I've made because this is too personal for me to post on my other. 

I am a 22F, I have my Associate's degree, and right now,  I am a project engineer for a construction company. 

I make 55k a year currently, but work 13hrs a day. :/ I have this job thanks to my dad, and I'm slowly learning to like it, but 13+hr work days should not be for anyone. My father would love for me to complete my general contracting course so I can be a licensed contractor and we have all the material and books, but I am unmotivated :( 

I have a few choices on what I can do and I'm not sure what the best route is. Also worth mentioning that my boyfriend and I are long-distance (Think south carolina to south dakota so pretty much across the country) and are trying to close the gap within a year or two, but he wants to live in my current state, and I love my state, I want to ultimately live here in the future, and all my friends are here.

So, I interviewed with boyfriend's insurance company and I got the job, it would start in november; we would work in two diff buildings and I would be taking about a 5k pay-cut. I would live with him and he lives in an apartment, he says I would not have to contribute to rent but I would still do it and pay for groceries etc, and we brought up the idea of me doing University there to pursue my next step.

In the long term this works for my boyfriend because if he stays with this company- he will be making 6 figures in 4 years. They have an office in my state next to where I currently live, where he would possibly be able to transfer if he stays there longer.

I like this option because I would be with boyfriend move out from my parents as well; but in the long term I do not think that insurance is for me.

My other option is to go back to school to be a teacher/ or a school psychologist, or a psychologist.

My major is psychology and I love the idea of being a psychologist/ school psychologist, or anything behavioral etc. I ALSO like the idea of real estate/business, as my parents have a lot of rental properties that my brother and I are going to inherit.  

However, if I go back to school, I can not work 13hr work days, and would likely need to quit project engineering, and get a temporary job like serving. I was a server for 3 years, I did two of those years while I was doing my associates degree,  and it was also quite draining. 

I know this post is everywhere but so is my brain and these are the thoughts that have been cycling in my head for a month and a half. 

So TL;DR

Do I

A) Take job at boyfriends company, move across the country, and work a job that pays well but is not really my passion, use the money from work to possibly go to University to get a degree in teaching/psychology and thennn pursue my more ""dream like"" career? 

B) Stay a project engineer working long hours and pursue a general contracting license? (this one is unlikely as I'm already project engineering and I am just not gravitating towards contracting) 

C) Stay in my state, quit being a project engineer, go to University in my state and get a part time job even though I'm undecided on teaching vs psychologist vs real estate

 Idk guy,s please help me my head hurts every day and the deadline for accepting the job is approaching in october :(

During the summer I usually took some restaurant gigs (which I hated), and in the latest I've been working for an handmade soap maker, I wrap the soaps, prepare orders etc (which I surprisingly didn't hate).

15y5yk0,Would you make an issue over a 0.5% reduction in comp?,"It's several hundred dollars which is a lot to anyone but also small enough that if I raise it I feel like I'll have a target on my back.

Basically the benefit brochure I was sent with my offer said a retirement contribution would start immediately but after starting I find out it starts over two months from now. I mentioned it to HR when they were presenting this and the HR guy just kind of shrugged his shoulders and explained they had a change in provider (but this was before the brochure was sent to me so it should have been corrected). I mentioned it's a bit of a let down but this HR person isn't a decision maker so I think it's just ended there.

Can I do anything without looking like an idiot? I feel like starting out and complaining about a few hundred bucks will make me look bad.

15y5ovl,"Working with narcissistic and awful boss, wanted to quit but not sure","My boss is a doctor who's quite (in)famous among celebrities of my country, said to be a very kind and generous doctor. Thought so, until I started working there as a graphic designer (in my sixth month now).

I'd say we're (team of 4, split to 2-2, to handle two social media accounts) understaffed, since we also got to make our own content planning, copywriting, production etc. Not to mention the boss is an extreme micromanager, that often comes in to say ""your plan is meh, make this instead, today"". Often. It really ruins our working pace, since they always consider our work to be easy and should be done in an hour or less, while throwing us some more works. 

The boss also often come up with an event, out of nowhere, where we would also be put in charge of all the planning, idea, decoration, documentation and design while ALSO making sure we still do our social media responsibilities. No rewards whatsoever other than ""Good job. But I think there's still so much more to improve, but eh."" 

I'd also say the boss really lack compassion toward every worker here. When someone's sick, they said ""Eh? I'm sick too, but I'm still here am I?"". When one of us was grieving, they said ""You can still work next week right? Life goes one, remember that"". 

They also said that we're lucky to be able to work here with them, since they consider themselves to be a highly prestigious doctor alive (believe me, like 80% of their social media post is just bragging how successful and kind and generous they are, the most narcissistic person I've ever seen). 

I have to take 2-hour commute to save money, where I would wake up at 6 am, and arrive back home at 8-9 pm, everyday. It drains me, and I can't put myself to work on my portfolio or taking freelance works. 

I'm really stressed now, since the boss just asked us to make 10 animated presentation slides in one day, only for them to scrap the whole slides and asked us to make another 15 the next day. 

I will admit, the pay is actually pretty good, compared to every other graphic design position here (considering I'm actually a fresh graduate, where each position would be minimum wage at best, even for mid level). But.. I don't know if I can handle working here more than 1 year. I also don't thimk I can improve my skills here (aside from time management?) since everything I do is required to be done as fast as possible, where I can see a big dip in quality. 

I also heard the boss consider me to be one of the best designer they've ever had and want to make sure I can work there as long as possible, which I think that would work as a leverage for me to increase my pay, idk. 

What do you guys think I should do? Thanks. 

P.S. The manager here works just as spokeswoman for the boss, since she's afraid of her.",Ajulius_,1,0.6600000262260437,0,1692710479,2023-08-22 13:21:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15y5ovl/working_with_narcissistic_and_awful_boss_wanted/,8,2023
15y5fu3,Am I in the right industry?,"I work as a Project Engineer for small manufacturing company where we design and produce ""turn-key"" facilities for cross-tie mills. My work specifically focuses on technical design and more complex pieces of equipment. I make very good money considering the benefits and specifics of the job:

Hourly employee, with 40 hr work weeks M-F paid weekly (though in my two years of employment around half of the total weeks I have worked have included some amount of overtime - ranging from 15 minutes to 10 hours).

I'm sitting at $40/hr now - when I started 2 years ago I was at $25, so there has been tremendous pay growth (bear in mind I only have 5 years total experience in manufacturing, but I do have a bachelor's in mechanical engineering from an ABET accredited university).

There's other benefits, but I'm pretty much getting out of the scope of my question at this point.

My wife has this idea of us going on the road for a year, buying an RV and finding remote work - essentially just traveling the US while we are still in our younger years. This seems fine and dandy to me, but I know at my particular job remote work has been thrown out the window, and I kind of feel like it would be an unwise, ""adult"" decision to throw that to the side. I know remote work exists out there, and have heard of others in the engineering field who have done it. I know that typically engineers are overworked salary employees, seeing 60 hr weeks regularly. I know that I definitely don't want that - but would it be unrealistic to be hopeful for a position where I could work 40s remotely? 

I purely went to school for engineering just because I liked to tinker with stuff. I didn't necessarily do phenomenal in school, and my current position really only consists of maybe 20-25% actual engineering, and the rest is just street smarts from the industry. I have always liked the idea of being at a company for 30 or 40 years - but in today's society that just seems to be going away.

At this point I'm just blabbering - but, do you have input on this? Am I naive? My wife and I aren't looking for a lavish lifestyle - we have been fortunate and blessed to buy a home that can be our forever home if we want it to be. We both have newer vehicles that have gadgets and gizmos that far exceed what we actually need.

15y5d9u,Junior Company or paid internship?,"I'm a 2nd year student of Industrial and Systems Engineering, with an interest to pursue a career in finance/administration.

Recently, I've been offered an internship position at the projects sector of a software development company. The salary's okay (but I'm not focusing on that right now), the position is going to teach me about data analysis and customer insights, they have the option of continuing to work there even when I decide to move abroad, and I have an opportunity to achieve high positions there. Basically, it's a good offer.

On the other hand, I have the option to participate in the Junior Company here at my university (100% volunteers). They are big in the country, offer courses in the area of project management and industrial engineering, and I feel like I could achieve presidency (which would be good for my CV).

If I have an interest in finance, investment banking, entrepreneurship, administration and related fields (I know it's a lot, I'm still figuring it out), which would be more beneficial for my career?

I was recently offered a job that would be roughly a 50% increase in pay compared to what I make now, however the commute would be about 2 hours each way, 3 days a week. It would likely be 3 consecutive days, with staggered hours to help with driving (7-6, 8-7, 9-8). 

I currently work anywhere from 5-6 days weekly, but my commute is only 20 minutes each way. I would technically have more time off in a row (4 days straight) if I took the new offer.

Has anyone does anything similar to this? If so, how did you manage the commute?

I have a choice between doing teacher training in the UK or an MSc in Instructional Design.

15xz89c,For ignorant people that discount UPS jobs," I use to worked at UPS in 2015-2017 in Queens, New York . Top pay was 35 dollars an hour for full time workers. Part time was minimum wage. Tuition assistance was a little over 5 grand a year for part time workers and 10 grand for managers. If you were a manager, you had to work there for at least 2 years after graduation or pay the money back. Pay calculation for full time workers = 35\*40\*4\*12 = 67200 before taxes. This is without overtime. Peak season we worked 12 hours a day for 3 months at-least. There's so much work, they hired a lot of people. So much, they sent some people home at the start of the shift. Ignorant people think you cant make a living working for UPS but as somebody that worked there, if you're not built like a cheerleader, you can make college grad money if you make full time. Making fulltime at UPS is hard though. Most people work two jobs till they make full time. I'm friends with a mechanic that work at UPS part time just for the benefits like health insurance. If you're not getting benefits at your full time job, working part time at UPS ain't a bad idea. Its a union job and the benefits aren't bad if you just want benefits. They offer three shifts, day sort, twi and night shift. Day sort is local delivery, twi and night are cross country.

15xwg0y,Contemplating re-education to pursue a second career - not sure how to go about it,"I am almost 40 years old, and work full time as a Sergeant at a Correctional Facility in Ontario. I am married, with 3 children and we recently moved to be closer to my wife's family. I am currently on a temporary assignment in the new city, which eventually should become a permanent position here. The problem is - I hate working here.

There are chronic issues with the new work location - including severely increased workload - including forced over-time after senior management harassed a colleague to the point he went off on sick leave. The building is outdated, over-crowded with inmates, and consistently under-staffed. There is very little senior management leadership here. I make approx. $95,000/year in this position but I absolutely despise being here because of the above-mentioned issues. I considered pursuing future advancement opportunities at my previous facility but wouldn't dream of it here. I have been hunting for new jobs with similar pay but my work experience over the last 15 yrs has consisted of working in Corrections and my education credential is a law-based college diploma. There simply aren't many opportunities that are job related. To further complicate things I am the breadwinner, with my wife being out of steady work for the last 10 years as she raised our children.

What I would like to do is re-educate to enter a work field I enjoy, while making similar or more money. I find myself recurrently contemplating becoming a pilot (float planes or smaller, private aircraft) or something in the geology or mining sector - field geologist, mining geologist, mining technician, etc. 

I'm not sure if this is the beginning of a mid-life crisis or what, but I know I need to do something soon - this place is sucking the soul out of me.

I don't think there's any non-compete language in the NDA - should I sign? Could that interfere with working for a competitor?

15xs2gb,27 Engineer Career Advice," Hello,From Middle East, currently in USA. I am mechanical engineer who is confused. I used to worked for 3 years in my country as mechanical engineer. Then came to USA for improve my language that is my 4th month here. In this month I will take an IELTS exam and apply for master programs. Actually my journey began with a desire to career change. I wanted to the change my career to IT jobs like data science, business analytics.

I have 3 ways to go but still I can not decide and this makes me very depressive. Sometimes I can not sleep very well.

1)Pursuing in master degree in USA like project management or technical field(If I go with project management I will probably not able to find a job in here and go back to my country with 40k $ debt, that is the risk)

2)Pursuing in master degree in Germany (I have found some good programs like Technology Management etc. I will probably get accepted. The thing about the program is 1,5 year but I am not sure about I can learn German Language in 1.5 year which will be enough to find me a good job in there)

3)Going back to my country and find a similar job and live the same life which is the decision give up. (The thing about that decision is like I have worked 3 years in my country in big companies but I could not make a good living in there, the plus of this decision is being close to my friends and my family)

The master degree programs will not be in the best school because my GPA is like 2.8.

It will be probably most important decision of my life. I do not what to do I am really confused about that. I do not want to live without working 2 years so the decision about Pursuing master in Germany is looking like the best option for me.

15xrhbp,Is it necessary to study and work in cybersecurity? And Is quitting an online masters program a mistake?,"Hi There and Thank you in advance for any advice,

&#x200B;

I (25M) work full time in Cybersecurity and somewhat enjoy what I do. Most of my coworkers on the same level as me have Masters degrees and more educational credentials than me. Recently I thought of doing an online masters on top of work and life to try and improve future career prospects and to show my Boss/team I'm still learning. 

&#x200B;

But it's so tiring, and I don't like it whatsoever. I feel spread thin, when I get off of work I just want to relax but I feel like I added a lot of unnecessary stress into my life. I kind of just want to quit already before I sink more time, money, and effort into this.

&#x200B;

In Cybersecurity - Specifically Application Security testing (i.e SAST, SCA, DAST) How important would a masters/certs be in terms of moving up? Is work experience alone enough to make it far? Should I just grit my teeth and try to follow through? Am I wasting my time?

15xqsbt,Commission being underpaid,"My boss was notified on Thursday that my commission was underpaid sizably (enough to pay both my mortgage and car payment so that’s a big deal) and I wanted to get the issue rectified. I was then informed that even though my commission plan does not state a cap on my commission that I was in fact capped and since I exceeded that cap oh well I wasn’t getting paid that extra.  I sent over a copy of my pay plan and said my pay plan states nothing about being capped and that I would like the money I rightfully earned. 

I followed up on Friday and got left on read.  No response, no nothing. Just crickets.  I asked again today and it launched WWIII with my calling my lawyer at lunch to set up a meeting with them. The response I got from my upper sales manager was that I was capped, I wouldn’t be seeing that money and that even though my pay plan doesn’t state I’m capped it doesn’t specify that I’m NOT capped so therefore I’m not getting paid.  It was also revealed that I have been underpaid commission for the past 3 months.  My pay plan states that my plan can be changed at any time but I must be notified in advance of any and all changes which has not occurred. I also found out that every other person in my role is paid on a straight salary and I’m the only one that is commission based. 

I had cancer last year and part of this year.  I came to work every day through chemo, I had to fight to get my FMLA approved for a double mastectomy and forced back to work before I was medically cleared to return to work.  Meanwhile I have a coworker that has been out for 7 months that has started another business because they are “too stressed to work”. I came back and was told I would be responsible for her role (which I was not prepared for or trained to do nor am I allowed to leave the office to meet the requirements of the position) along with my job.  My accounts were cut from over 1,700 down to less than 250. Even with that I have already exceeded my annual sales goal by 200% and consistently exceed my monthly sales goal by 300%, last month it was exceeded by 427% so my performance is outstanding. 

I truly feel like this is an attempt to make me to quit.  It feels like retaliation for being sick, for missing 12 weeks of work, for having ongoing complications from cancer treatment, now a broken right ankle that I am expected to still be in the office daily even though I am not supposed to be driving I’m still there every day.  I can’t access our break room currently because it’s upstairs so I’m incurring additional costs having to order out for lunch every day. I also have rheumatoid arthritis which complicates my healing, any joint injury causes a full fledged flare up.  I’m in excruciating pain daily and suffering from daily, debilitating headaches from all the pressure, which causes me to not sleep which creates a never ending cycle of pain and headaches. Throw in I have an anxiety disorder and depression and I’m a walking mess daily.  

I’m not sure what to do here.  I got a text from my boss that said we could certainly address moving me in a different direction but to be prepared for my sales goal to double and to be ready for a different set of expectations and standards at that level.  I don’t want that position it was offered to me when I was first hired and I declined it for the position I was in. I feel it’s really unfair to force me into that position without even discussing it with me, especially since I was only supposed to have been covering it for a month.  Then to find out for three months I have been significantly underpaid and other reps in my role are salaried I feel like I’m being discriminated against and being forced out.",iwishiwereonabeach,5,1.0,4,1692667558,2023-08-22 01:25:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15xqsbt/commission_being_underpaid/,8,2023
15xqm38,Should I just quit my job in fast food?,"I'm currently employed by a certain sandwich franchise, and I despise working there. I've only been an employee of this business for about 2 months, over the summer. I intended to continue working at this place through college, but I can't stand the job. 

This is my first ""official"" job, and I entered it having no formal work experience. This was part of my reason for applying. I thought getting experience in both the customer-service side of things as well as the backend operations side would be valuable to my skillset for future jobs. It was only after starting that I realized the pay is mediocre, and I'm stuck doing the work of 5 people because our store is run on a skeleton crew. I very quickly took on responsibilities I felt I was not ready for. The people I work with are nice, but they're all significantly older than me, and I have nobody to relate to. I find it very difficult to find any enjoyment in this job and struggle to find the motivation to work each time I'm scheduled for a shift. 

Two days ago, I looked at the manager's paperwork and found that we had a new hire. I checked the schedule for their first day, and I'm the only person scheduled to work. This means I'll be the one training them, and I have 2 months of experience. This has really made me want to leave my job. 

The only reason I struggle to leave is because I really like my manager. She is new to our store (she has experience from another store in the same franchise), but she is very understanding and polite to me. I can't help but feel I'd be screwing her over by leaving, though I know I don't technically owe her anything. I also worry that quitting after 2 months will be a red flag for other potential workplaces I may apply to. I'd rather not exclude this job from any future applications, as it's my only work experience.

15xpz12,Thinking about going back to my old position,"Hello,

About a year and a half ago I was encouraged by pretty much the boss of my department to apply for a position that had an opening it was higher pay, and they were in the works of having it pay even more. I’d never done the type of job but had some sort of relatable skills. I was flattered when the boss called me and told me they can’t think of anyone else that would do a good job in the role. I thought I’d be nuts not to go for it. 

This role was to be temporary until they they can up the pay. Once that was set and stone I could apply for it permanently if I wanted. With this said Im technically still permanent in my prior role and can go back if I wanted but a temp in this current role.

Well I’m almost 1 year and half in and nothings been done to make this role permanent. To top it off I’ve been doing someone’s else’s job for the last year as they can’t seem to hire someone good for it. At this point I don’t care as I’m finding I’m not enjoying the job anymore anyway. I’m stressed out everyday, feel overworked and just not happy. I want to go back to my prior role, I was so happy and absolutely loved it. My manager was so cool, my manager now sucks.

A few things that are really getting to me..

*Is it cowardly to want to demote myself? 

*They had hired someone to work my prior role until my “new” role got sorted. This person is in love with that position and have been doing it longer than I was (I had it 9 months, they’ve been in almost a year and a half) I’m sure they assume I’m not going back and think they will be the next person to hold that position if I did accept the new position permanently. Here’s the thing if I go back they lose their job at our department as they were a temporary hire. This makes me feel real shitty..

Any advice?",Bulky_Pirate_6255,1,1.0,0,1692665433,2023-08-22 00:50:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15xpz12/thinking_about_going_back_to_my_old_position/,8,2023
15xpr7p,"Can't make a decision, I feel I'm wasting a lot of time (and wasted)","Hi there, 

I'm 23M, a Computer science graduate (July 2022, Excellent with honors), It's been a year, I made a CV that I was convinced it was good, but it really wasn't. I've no idea why I didn't realize that faster but it is what it is. Well, I'd say that problem got solved now and I'm actually getting some interviews.

Getting to interviews made me realize that there is a technology/framework that I need to be familiar with more (ASP and Angular). I've been writing C# since I was 13 but I created only Servers, Systems, Network Systems, and many Desktop applications, Web apps? None, and the job market right now asks most for Full Stack Developers. 

To learn these, I've a decision to make:

- Self learn it online, like I pretty much learnt everything (I'll prob do that in less than a month)

- Join a popular tech institution for a 9 month training. (It's certificate facilitates landing a job, there is also a job fair at the end of training) 

Everybody recommends the latter for fresh graduates to get some experience, but I feel I already wasted a year of my life I'm very discouraged to waste another 9 months, specially that I already know most of the content (they start from the very very beginning), also the fact the Ill have to commute like 4 hours a day is really discouraging. 

I'm in a 3rd world country (I've B2 IELTS btw), my main goal is to travel and work abroad and hopefully live as well and there is 2 ways to achieve that: 

- Get enough work experience locally for a couple of years then get a Senior position visa sponsorship. 

- Pursue a Master's degree get a part time job, then a full time one and hopefully later permeant residency. 

When my CS degree started, I've been already freelancing and I actually managed to get a remote part time job out of that, I had to study and work and I was fine, finally though when I graduated and got some free time that business closed for business reasons. 
That made me depressed for a while; the fact that I was working while studying and finally graduating to be unemployed? After all the grind? 

I've no idea what I should do, right now I'm preparing myself for the acceptance exams of the institute (English, IQ-ughh-, Problem solving). I'm not sure if I'll pass and get accepted and even if, should I? 

Part of me is afraid that even If I solo learn what I'm missing it might be hard to land a job which yields in more time wasting, and the other part hates the fact that I'll have to waste 9 months to get a job after already wasting a whole year...

15xp1q6,Feeling Lost and Confused About Career Path – Anyone Been Through Something Similar?,"Hello everyone,

I find myself at a crossroads and would really appreciate hearing from anyone who has been in a similar situation or has advice to share. 

**Background**  
I graduated with a bachelor's degree in liberal arts because, honestly, I couldn't decide what I really wanted to do. I went from bio to nutrition and eventually settled on liberal arts just to finish school. I did find a job as a district sub and then became a Pre-K teacher, mostly due to a teacher shortage in the district.

**The Shift**  
After a while, teaching started to wear on me, so I taught myself to code and luckily landed an apprenticeship in software development. I really enjoy learning and growing in this field, but I'm starting to feel like it might not be my long-term path either.

**Current Situation**  
I'm in a bit of a crisis because I'm not sure what I want to pursue next. It's not that I don't want to work; I love staying busy and learning new things. But I'm struggling more than ever to figure out what really interests me career-wise. 

**Questions for the Community**  
1. Has anyone else felt this way about their career? How did you overcome it?
2. Are there any self-assessment tools or career counselors you'd recommend?
3. How did you decide on a career that genuinely interests you?

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I look forward to any insights or advice you can offer.",Lucky_girl333,1,1.0,1,1692663152,2023-08-22 00:12:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15xp1q6/feeling_lost_and_confused_about_career_path/,8,2023

I went through a 10 month apprenticeship for my current role, obtained the legal license to do the role without supervision, and have been doing that role for 3 years now.

  
Is it okay to combine these two together into a single role and just not include the apprenticeship? Start date would be start of the apprenticeship and end date would be today. It's the same role but the apprenticeship is just with supervision.

15xovtb,Should I continue taking college classes or start working towards a trade?,"I am a 28 year old guy who has been taking college classes on and off for 10 years now. I messed around the first few years and failed out, but decided after a couple years that I would start classes again after moving out of state. My degree at the moment is Coastal Environmental Science, and I chose this because I love the outdoors and hunting and fishing, and I wanted my career to be based around those passions.

 I thought I was close to graduating as my counselor told me I had 2 more semesters. After the next semester, a different advisor told me I have 5 more semesters… I have a lot of money invested in my school so far, but also don’t want to put more money into school when I’m not sure it’s the right path for me. 

 I am naturally a very hard worker, when it’s not school, and have no issue working blue collar jobs, as that is what I have done most in my life. I have never been jobless, never been fired, and can honestly say that when it comes to my worth ethic, not much can stop it. 

I have always been very interested in welding and have messed around with it as a hobby but now am wondering if going to welding school may be a better path for me. Im also looking into other trades as well such as an elevator technician.

I am also trying to figure out if there is a similar degree with less requirements just to help me feel better about the classes that I have already paid for. Would it be worth getting a General Education degree?

Just looking for some experiences that may help with my decision or any advice in general. Thanks y’all.",Stealingtoasters,1,1.0,2,1692662748,2023-08-22 00:05:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15xovtb/should_i_continue_taking_college_classes_or_start/,8,2023
15xonmr,Job hopping thoughts and experiences,"I just received a senior promotion with a roughly 8.5% raise as a software support engineer and I've only been with my current employer for just over a year and my previous job i was at for 5 years, with a 2 year gap in between to go back to school. I'm pretty happy with my job, but I'm in my mid 30s and this is the first time that I have received a ""respectible"" pay. I feel like I want to play catch up by job hopping to get to a bit better pay range as I want to purchase a house in the near future. I currently make about 77k and want to get to as close as 100k as i can get. I feel like I should stay at this current employer at least 6 months to a year before considering job hopping. Another reason I'm thinking of doing so would be because I would most likely need to break through into a Tier 2 postion to get another big pay bump, which those guys are pretty impressive with their technical abilities. I'm sure i can reach that point someday, but I also think job hopping may get me a better pay faster.

15xom1c,Am I going to get fired? Long post but advice greatly appreciated.,"Four months ago, I switched careers completely and I’m now working in IT project management and professional development. Lately, my boss and other staff (even higher ups) have complimented me on my work performance and I’ve been given more work, too. I’m killing it, to be honest.

This all changed last Thursday when I was doing one-on-one professional development with the president of our organization. This wasn’t scheduled to happen until September, but my boss (VP) told me to do it that day and cancel the meeting I had on my calendar since the president had an opening in her schedule.  I was training her in Microsoft Teams and was trying to show her how to find our organization files. She was on her desktop, I was across from her on my laptop. Suddenly, I see a box show up on my screen that a folder can no longer be viewed because it was moved/deleted (I don’t completely remember what it read). I thought I deleted it by accident when I was on my touchpad while looking at her screen, but I have no idea if I did it or not. The folder disappeared on her end, too, and we were super confused. I said I must have accidentally deleted something and that it will be fine and jokingly said to please not fire me. The president took the situation really well, and said to blame it on her and that I don’t need to apologize. 

I quickly messaged the team who manages that particular folder. After the training ended, I went to their section of the office and one of the guys and I tried on our computers to recover the folder in SharePoint, but one of the subfolders (which isn’t important but still another team’s work) wasn’t in the recycling bin (I didn’t particularly notice it during the training, just the other subfolders).

I spoke to two people on my team (one of which is senior but not my boss) and she said not to worry, it’ll be fine and that it happens to everyone, and that she would try to figure it out. She said if she couldn’t find it, she would let our boss (VP) know. 

Friday, two minutes before the workday was over, I got a call from my boss and senior team member. My boss is asking me what happened, why we were in the folders, if it’s possible the guy from the other department deleted it. He asked me if the president could have gotten any other impression than the explanation I was providing. I said no because I was telling him the truth. He is super smart but intimidating and at times, toxic because he uses mind games and intimidation on our whole team. Our department has high turnover because of this. I respect him a lot but he scares me. He ended the call with a game plan to go through the server actions with my team lead, told me things happen (this is the first time I've messed up), but scolded me for a) not going to my team first and b) having an oops moment in front of a “customer.” He told me my next steps for preventing this from happening again and we ended the call. Afterwards, my senior team member called me and asked if I was okay and that shit happens, everyone messes up (even our boss), and that I wouldn’t get fired. I called out of work today because I wasn’t feeling well and he thumbs-upped my message when I told him so. 

I completely understand that despite completely accidental, I fucked up in multiple ways. I get anxious when faced with things like this and I act impulsively to mitigate problems instead of taking a minute to think about it. These are things I need to work on. 

Do you think I’ll get fired? Is there anything I should do/know if this seems likely?",needtodumpfriend2020,5,0.7799999713897705,16,1692662108,2023-08-21 23:55:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15xom1c/am_i_going_to_get_fired_long_post_but_advice/,8,2023

15xmyep,Western Canada. Property Management or City Planning?,"I’m at a crossroads and these are what feel like the two best options: 

Property Management - I have a really good understanding of local tenancy laws (having been a tenant myself for a decade). I am a great communicator in person/on the phone/via email. I enjoy managing things and ensuring things are running smoothly. Im a natural extrovert. I like problem solving. The Sims was always my favourite video game lol. This route would require a year of online coursework which I could do at my own pace. I would be able to keep my current job.

City Planning - I studied interior design because I love planning. Making the best use of the space with the end user in mind. I love design and incorporating the environment into the final plans. I envision myself working for a small municipality that puts the community and the environment at the forefront. This route would require four years of schooling at a major university. Note: university is free for me, it’s the time sink that is the factor here. 

Factors to consider: I’m almost 30 and my priority is saving for the purchase of a home in the next 7-10 years. I don’t want to live in the big city within the next 7-10 years which is why I like these two options: I could work anywhere in my province as a property manager or planner.

15xmh96,Bad first job experience,"I recently graduated from college last May and have been working full time as a Legal Assistant at a medium-sized law firm. 

The experience was nothing like I expected, after working at the company for only three months, I had successfully outlasted the previous 8 employees in my position. The reason for the almost comical employee retention rate is that the attorney I worked under is known for his incredibly short temper, irrational anger, and overall abusive behavior towards his subordinates. I kept quiet in my position and did my best to continue along but after three months of being treated badly I could no longer take it.

I reported the attorneys behavior to upper level management, who promptly apologized to me on his behalf and had a conversation with him regarding his behavior. That was a month ago and his behavior only grew worse. Long story short, the people at the company are very well aware of this behavior and are complacent to let it continue so long as they don’t have to deal with it themselves.

If it was the behavior alone maybe I could have taken it, but I was dealing with this whilst handling the workload of multiple other assistants. When I first joined the company, there were 5 full time assistants, starting next week there will be 1 remaining.

This experience has left me feeling really depressed and beaten down. I know that it was the correct decision for me to get out of that place but I’m struggling to stay confident and be happy with my decision. I have had multiple interviews over the past month but still no job offers. I have also talked with the career department of my university that has good connections within the city and has advised me they have another legal assistant position open for me. 


Is there anything else I should be doing in the mean time while I wait to hear back from these jobs?

15xmea3,Food Service Careers,"Long time lurker, first time poster

I’m currently a Director of Dining Services in the SF Bay Area for a large food service company. I started with the company 2 years ago, was making $75k, since then they’ve promoted me twice and I’m at $125k currently. I’ve been the Director for 6 months and it’s been great, I’ve learned a lot and my trajectory at the company looks bright.

The only issue is the job is mind numbingly boring. Most of my day is consumed with litigating petty squabbles between staff (I’m over 60 people), checking to see if staff actually did their job, and wasting away in email thread hell.

My questions is, does anyone have advice on 1) potential careers to consider with my background? (Bachelor’s in nutrition/biology, Master’s in Public Health Nutrition, and a Registered Dietitian)

15xmdc6,How do I redeem myself from this? (long post but added a TLDR). Any advice is appreciated.,"TDLR - I called a Director sounding irritated that one of their their employee emails me and then follows up with several pings on teams (not the first time), but the question was valid from the employee and my real issue was the style of how the employee contacts me. I feel dumb for calling the Director and feel I've ruined my reputation. 

_____

So today was one of those days when there was tons of things going on and I was feeling very overwhelmed. 

I received an email from an employee asking for direction on how to handle a specific task that was assigned to them. This employee has a bad habit of sending an email, and then following up via Teams and asking if you saw their email and if you can get on a call. This on top of everything else going on was sort of the tipping point and where I made the mistake I think. 

I wound up calling the Director of the team and asking them if this employee has direction and if they are indeed contacting their manager (which they were) since they keep asking me questions regarding X issue. The director stated, yes they did go to their manager, but they should be coming to me with these types of questions (which is valid). I told the Director I felt ""annoyed"" by the way this employee contacts me since that was the real issue rather than the question the employee had. I expressed it very poorly and I think it just made me look stupid. The employee was correct for contacting me, so in reality I was just so annoyed by the follow up pings on teams with everything else going on. 

After being on the call with the Director, I realized they were right, and my real issue was just annoyance by this employee who has a bad habit of pining several times after they send an email. I apologized to the director on the call and just felt so stupid and like I made the biggest mistake. I definitely did not come off as hostile or anything in the slightest but just dumb the way I expressed myself by feeling annoyed. I feel like now this has ruined my reputation because that makes me seem like I don't wanna do my job, which is not the case at all! In fact, any other employee and I would have been glad they come to me with the issue.
 
I feel like this there is no going back from this because I've never done this before, and I just felt stupid on the call. The Director's point was valid that I should be contacted in these situations but I feel like it makes me seem like I don't want to do my job, or that I get annoyed when people ask me questions, but that's not the case. Ive never been in a situation before where I made myself feel so stupid. 

Ive pinged the Director after the call and just explained that I was just feeling overwhelmed with everything going on today and to please disregard the call I made to them today, and explained to them that I set up a call with the employee to go over the issue, which we solved together. 

He said it was fine and not to worry about it and thanked me for helping out the employee. 

Maybe I'm overthinking this but just not sure. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

The company is private right now, its considered a unicorn with a 4 billion dollar valuation and will most likely be going public in mid 2024, general counsel has already told me they are watching the market for a good IPO. Ive been here almost a year and taking a company from private to public is an excellent resume point, one of the best IMO. If i stay for 4 years i would be fully vested and theyd hook me up with alot more stock. On top of all that, its the best job ive had, very managable stress, great environment, great small team, insane benefits and i genuinely enjoy the work. 

Company B reached out and made an offer to me with an offer of 200k base salary to act as their CISO's (executive level for my field) right hand man. Team of 2, CISO and a junior analyst. Its at a top performing hedge fund, definitely lucrative experience.

 I dont really have exposure to the finance sector as well so again great for the resume. But this is almost exactly the type of role i wanted to transition into for the next step of my career, honestly it kinda skips a level. 200k base salary also opens up alot of opportunity, like becoming an accredited investor.

With company A i just got exposed to the tech startup sector and i love it so far, it pays great, best quality of life etc. Super comfortable world. 

Im really struggling to weigh the two. I love my current job, theres serious potential and im already here. But im not going to love it for more then a year or two, things always change.

TLDR; My work is draining me, I worry I don’t have any opportunity for advancement and if I leave this job I’m worried I will be seen by hiring managers as a job hopper because I’ve switched jobs twice in the span of a year. 

My previous job was purely sales and I hated it. Not only was it poorly managed and consistently losing employees but it was also paying people false wages based on the amount of sales they made. Since working there I picked up a new job that’s more in my field of advertising, at least I thought so originally. This small company and I shared very similar values and in the interview she made it sound like I would be working to make the world better and that I would have a team to help work with me through things that I couldn’t readily solve. I started this job at the beginning of may and now you can fast forward to august. I wanted to be hired to do strictly advertising work and create campaigns because that’s what I went to school to learn how to do. 

In terms of compensation this job has given me a fair wage of 60k and pays me on time and like I should be paid unlike my previous job. The problem comes with how much they are asking me to do that is completely out my wheelhouse. To start with I thought I would be managing the social medias for 2 company accounts and updating the website regularly to match the advertising. But what started as 2 company’s slowly grew into 5 so now I am managing 5 websites, 5 Instagram pages, 5 Facebook pages,  5 separate mobile apps and because my boss doesn’t trust our front end designers she wants me to launch a full legal investigation against the team and thinks I would be best to do so just because I’m going after a law degree. The whole team she promised me that I would be working with turned out to be nothing. So I am individually running all of these different devices and prior to 3 weeks ago I didn’t even know how to make an app. 

I am for learning new things, I want to be as skilled as I possibly can in a workforce. That being said I am only one person. My commute is already an hour and a half, I just walk in and get yelled at for whatever isn’t done when I only have 8 hours a day to make things work. It has resulted in me skipping my lunch for the previous 2 weeks just to feel like I can catch up. My friends are noticing the toll that working this job has done to me and have similar degrees and aren’t asked to do nearly as much in their entry level job. Now she is asking me to work on additional things at home but that’s taking away from my studying time and the commute is already crazy. I just need time to recharge and feel respected for the amount of work I’m doing. 

Maybe it just sounds like I’m complaining but the biggest thing I’m worried about is the fact that everything falls on me and nobody in my office knows the first thing about advertising. I want to be somewhere where I can improve and become better at this. I can’t do that at my current job because there is no one who works in my field in the office so it’s like there’s nobody to tell me where I need to improve. I know I could get this experience at an Agency and that’s what I’m starting to lean towards. I’m just worried if I leave 2 jobs in the span of a year then I will be unhireable but at the same time I don’t know if this job will help me get where I need to be professionally.

15xkhq7,VC internship vs full time role,"Hello everyone,  
I'm seeking feedback on a decision I'm considering. I am employed full-time in the tech ( SDE) sector outside of venture capital. However, I've recently received an offer for a one-year internship at a VC firm based in Chicago. It's important to note that this internship is not guaranteed to lead to a full-time position.  
Taking up this internship would require a 10-20% reduction in salary compared to my current role, and I would need to transition from my full-time position to this internship. Despite the salary cut and change in role status, I'm passionate about this space. During my free time, I've been actively involved in this space, collaborating with angel funds and startups.  
My query is directed towards those experienced in VC folks: Can this one-year internship significantly enhance my prospects of securing future analyst or associate roles? Are VC firms likely to value the experience gained from a one-year internship, even if it's at a different reputable firm? Conversely, could taking on an internship after several full-time roles negatively impact my overall career trajectory?  
Your insights would be greatly appreciated.",civicastor11,1,1.0,0,1692652760,2023-08-21 21:19:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15xkhq7/vc_internship_vs_full_time_role/,8,2023
15xkavh,"Assigned a project 3 hours before I go on vacation for 2 weeks abroad, what should I do?","A senior member of staff/ our current project manager assigned me a new client a few hours before I’m going on my vacation.

I'm not getting skilled at anything but pay is very high and I realize it will be hard to even get a job with that pay without requiring same or more responsibility.

15xivm6,"Stay the course? (MD/DO, RN, Something Else)?","Stay the course? (MD/DO, RN, something else?)

I (31F) had spent most of my adult life working in retail leadership. In 2021, I left my role as a Store Manager making a comfortable salary (70k/yr) to pursue a more meaningful career in healthcare. It was an enjoyable role, but felt like it wasn't ""it"" for me, I felt a deep yearning to do more with my time. If I am going to spend 40+ hrs/wk away from my family, I want it to feel like it's time well spent. I left with plans to ""get my foot in the door"" and to get clinical experience for my medical school application. I desperately wanted to be a physician, did an excessive amount of research, knew what the process would entail, and saved up for over a year in order to be financially prepared to make the transition to a lower paying job. 

I took a 6-week CNA course and got hired at my local hospital as a PCT (eventually being promoted to MST - making around $20/hr). I  worked within this role for 1 year, before ending up in a place where I was very uncomfortable with the amount of I was making. I could still pay my bills, but wasn't saving much and wasn't contributing to my retirement acct. I was also on a difficult unit for a tech (Neuro - high acuity, high need patients). 

I had been working on completing a bachelors degree in Healthcare Administration (first degree that I'd been working on part-time while working full-time) and decided that I'd find a management role within healthcare where I could my utilize both my leadership experience from retail and my experience in healthcare. It took a few months but I found a role that fit, and worked as a regional office manager for a multi-specialty practice where I was responsible for 2 offices. This brought me back to a 70k/yr salary. I had high hope that I'd like it enough to be able to talk myself out of pursuing medical school. Instead, I found that the politics of the business side of healthcare (at least within this organization) made me sure that I did not want to work in administration. I hated going to work and sitting at a desk all day. I hated only talking to patients when they had complaints. One thing I have always enjoyed about leadership is fiercely supporting my teams. This was fulfilling in its own way. I reported to the COO who had encouraged me to spend some time shadowing our docs in clinic and surgery to build relationships with them and understand their workflows so that I could better support them in clinic. As soon as I did this, I felt a yearning to get back to the clinical side of healthcare. In total, I worked within this role for about 6 mos before leaving to go back to the hospital.

This time, I returned to the hospital as a MST on the Mother-Baby unit (at $22/hr). I enjoy the patient population, I relate to the team better than I have anywhere else. Many days I leave work thinking ""Wow, I love my job, this is so great."" Instead of lifting elderly patients onto bedside commodes and endlessly taking vitals and Accucheks all day, I'm giving newborns their first baths, conducting their hearing screenings, doing 24-hr labs (TcBs, cardiac screenings, and met screens), and generally supporting the RNs with the moms/babies. It was here on MBU that I realized that nurses *can* actually enjoy their jobs, which turned me onto considering pursuing the less daunting path of nursing, but also knowing that I could always pursue midwifery or even medical school still if I so choose. 

I've worked within this role for about 9 mos now and have come to a point again where the financial drawback is causing me to worry that I should be working to find something that pays more. As soon as it dawned on me that I don't *need* anymore clinical experience just for the sake of having a strong application (you need strong clinical experience for a medical school app nut not for nursing), I thought it is unwise of me to stay where I am at and unfair to my family as it limits us financially. 

With that said, I've applied to a nursing program that begins in January, which is 3 days/wk. 2 days of class and 1 day of clinical. There are both evening/weekend options and daytime options. Within my current role, I work 3 12 hr shifts/wk, and I think this role would likely be the best fit to allow me to continue working FT through nursing school. As I near completion of my HSA degree, and near the start of the RN program, I find that I feel like I'm sort of getting cold feet as I consider the financial sacrifice of remaining in this low paying job for 2+ more years. I think to myself that perhaps I should consider LCSW too (I could get a regular paying job and complete this degree online), or maybe even consider retail leadership again which wasn't very fulfilling, but was enjoyable. I don't want to be a ""job-hopper"" - I just want to settle into something that feels right. I probably could make it work financially where I am at, staying somewhere that I am generally happy, but when I think about the uncertainty of being spread so thin financially, I reconsider everything. My earning potential as an RN puts me right back at square 1, making enough but not enough to get excited about it. 

Thoughts? 

Is there anything I should be considering here that I have not yet?

TLDR; Is financial sacrifice (and stress) in the short term worth it in the long term when you're not 100% sure you're going to love the long term option? Especially when you know for certain that the financial sacrifice is something to the tune of 30k/yr(+ interest)?",ambloui,4,1.0,0,1692649310,2023-08-21 20:21:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15xivm6/stay_the_course_mddo_rn_something_else/,8,2023

I'm off to college next year and I've got this question. I know it's kinda late, but I'm curious about what others think.  
  
Here's the deal: I'm already into programming and have created some projects. A computer science degree seems like the key to unlocking my ideas. I've got all these cool concepts, and with that degree, I can bring them to life. Plus, I'm looking forward to team up with fellow computer science majors in college to work on some killer projects.  
  
Then there's the business side. A business degree isn't just a tool, it's a potential career path. It feels like with that, I'd be more of a team player, more in tune with how stuff works, and more involved in planning, compared to being a software engineer. I'm also curious about things like finances and marketing. They're the backbone of any successful business. But here's the kicker: I think you can pick up business smarts through experience, no degree is required.  
  
I'm torn. On one hand, business is all about interacting and chatting with people, and that's totally my scene. But then, computer science has this crazy power – it's like the tool that can make my ideas take off.

15xfr80,Is five months too short of a stint at new job?,"I made the pivot from an IT-adjacent position to banking because I’ve always been really interested in personal finance and budgeting. The thing is I’ve been here 5 months and have realized that I hate customer service. I have no natural inclination for it, it takes a ton of energy for me to engage in small talk and I can’t take being open for anyone to come in and disrupt the peace at any moment. I don’t regret the career change but I am wondering if anyone has any insight as to a job that might be similar but not include the customer-facing aspect of working in a bank.

15xfoe5,Questionable employer,"A coworker of mine was laid off last week but it doesn't make much sense as to why. The official line to the coworker is they don't have the money to pay them. However, employer has already advertised and been interviewing for replacements, as the coworkers main role was delivery driver. My coworker has been made redundant but his position is still available. It turns out that my employer has been doing this repeatedly. They claim they can't afford to keep a member of staff on and make them redundant but then a few weeks later are hiring someone new. The employer turnaround is really high. I didn't realise this had been happening - that the workers had been made redundant. I thought they'd just been let go for other reasons.

I got this college degree not necessarily because i wanted a career in communications, (whatever that means) But because i was holding myself accountable for starting college when I graduated highschool, and going back to finish was something i wanted to do. I knew that once i graduated I would need to find a more niched career path to take. Here the issue: I have no interest in marketing, or communications or anything my degree is showing career wise. (which is not a lot) i now need to niche and narrow my field to something more specific. The only thing i have ever had interest in my entire life is travel, any ideas of travel jobs or a certificate i can get that would help me land one?

15xfmjs,How should I handle this; recruiter not answering my calls,"Brief recap of the process so far..

* 10 minute call with recruiter. At the time she said she didn't know salary range. Many here said she does and it's low. I may be naïve, but it felt genuine to me. Acted like she'd get the info for me. She also asked me to set up a video interview a couple days later. I gave her my availability and she said she would send a meeting invite and to ""accept"" it so she knew I got it.

* I never received an email and thought maybe she'd changed her mind. Turned out she sent an invite that went to my spam. She called 15 mins into my interview time to ask if I was coming. I jumped on and apologized for the mix up.

* Had hour long interview with future manager. Went well. I got a good vibe about the job, and felt like he liked me as well.

* Recruiter e-mailed me LATE on Friday that they want me to come in for a 2nd interview and a 'test' that's relevant to my field on Tuesday. 

* I don't want to take off work and jump through hoops for another round of interviews without knowing the pay scale first so I emailed back and asked her to have a quick 10 minute call with me today (monday) before committing to coming in on Tuesday. I did not get a response today. I left her a voicemail this morning and tried once again and did not get an answer.

After the issue with the first interview I don't want these guys interviewing me to think I'm just not showing up. I am interested in the job if the pay is within my range. 

I don't want to throw the recruiter under the bus either though.

Do I e-mail everyone on the meeting invite (2 managers included) and tell them that I wanted to speak with the recruiter prior to our 2nd interview but she isn't answering? Do I just flat-out tell them I'd like to know the salary scale or leave it vague?",steelbydesign,1,1.0,0,1692642184,2023-08-21 18:23:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15xfmjs/how_should_i_handle_this_recruiter_not_answering/,8,2023
15xfj57,What industries could I move/expand to with current experience,"So I need help trying to decide where to go from here. I’ll start with my background. I have completed some college, around 3 years worth but have earned neither a bachelors or an associate’s. I have 17 years work experience, 8 as a restaurant manager, 5 total in water fire mold and bio restoration and 3 out of those 5 in a supervisory role as a Crew Chief. This is my most recent job. I left as of this week. I currently have another offer to be a crew chief at a company I used to work for as a technician, with similar pay and benefits. Call this my fallback option. 


Here’s the thing- I want to move towards a management position in restoration. Production manager, mitigation manager, project manager, that sort of thing. I think I would do a very good job. My wife works for the company that is my fallback as a manager in a different department and when we talk about her work issues some of my suggestions that were implemented have worked and solved problems. I seriously think I can do well in that kind of role. I also love helping people restore their homes back to normal. 

I don’t want to take the fallback and get stuck in a position I don’t want to work in. Problem is there isn’t a lot of restoration companies and few of any are hiring restoration manager positions. 

My question is what are similar roles I could apply for? Similar industries or jobs. Any suggestions, I don’t mind switching industries but I’d rather not start out new somewhere as a technician.

TLDR; what industries/positions can I apply for with 8 years service manager, 5 years restoration/construction with 3 years as a supervisor in restoration experience?",HodgeGodglin,0,0.5,0,1692641991,2023-08-21 18:19:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15xfj57/what_industries_could_i_moveexpand_to_with/,8,2023
15xfh56,Turned down a job offer a few months ago. Reached out to the company again to see if the role is available - and they’re interested,"Ok so here’s the background. Back in May I had two job offers given to me (let’s call them job 1 and job 2). At the time, after much deliberation, I decided to go with job 1. The money was a little bit better and I had more vacation time, and it’s a bigger company as well with potentially more career movement. I spoke to the HR of job 2 and told them that I would be accepting another offer. 

However, 3 months on, I’m really disliking job 1. I’m not a fan of the company culture and how my boss runs the team/provides feedback.

So on a whim, I reached out to the HR for job 2 a couple of weeks ago and asked if the role is still open. I wasn’t even expecting a response tbh. Or at most, them emailing to say that it’s been filled. 

HR however, reached out to me, and mentioned that one of the roles is still open as they haven’t been able to fill it (there were multiple of the same role of the team and I was offered one of them). Furthermore, he said that the manager is actually interested in reconsidering me for the role, and from an HR standpoint, there’s no issues: they would likely be able to offer me the same salary, time-off, benefits etc.

So I have another “interview” coming up on Wednesday, with the manager with whom I had interviewed with before, as well as a couple of the new members of the team. HR mentioned that they want to get a feel of how I would fit in on the new team and there would be mostly some behavioural-based questions (since they already know that I have the skills and experience for the role). They’ve also asked me to put together a presentation based on the work I would be doing while I’m there. 

So I’m just wondering - has anyone experienced anything like this before? And how do you think my chances are? If they’re going out of their way to interview me again for the whole team, surely they have to be at least somewhat interested in having me join? 

Thoughts? Obviously I’m still planning on knocking it out of the park with the interview and slide deck but just curious to see if it’s something anyone else had come across before.",I_hate_humanity_69,2,1.0,3,1692641867,2023-08-21 18:17:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15xfh56/turned_down_a_job_offer_a_few_months_ago_reached/,8,2023

15xew5b,I’ve been feeling stupid and hopeless at my first corporate job?,"I’ve been feeling stupid and hopeless at my new job ( first corporate job since graduating)?

Hello all, 

I got an engineering degree and graduated in spring of 2021. I then got my first corporate entry level engineering job in spring 2022 ( I worked a contract job in between). 

Coming to work, I often feel incapable. I ask questions and try to write notes, but I have felt like no matter how many notes I try to write down, or the effort I make to understand. It is still not clear to me. I see my other colleagues and how things have made sense to them, it discourages me sometimes as I feel like I’m not good enough or smart enough to truly understand this information. 

When I started the position, I was not in the best place mentally. I had serious struggles with anxiety and depression and was trying to get some help to treat it at that time ( and prior to starting the job). But I noticed that it negatively influenced my experience at my job. 

I did try asking my manager at the time twice if I could attend some trainings to learn about the systems I would be using. But she declined each time I asked. She stated the trainings were not very helpful and that I would be best learning by shadowing since that is the way others on the team have learned. One thing to note is that the others on the team had some sort of prior experience with the field, but I did not. I wanted to do the training just to give me a solid foundation and then I could apply what I learned to the times I would shadow my colleagues. I’ve felt like shadowing has only giving me sporadic information to do my job well. 

I also thought initially that I wasn’t understanding the information because I was still new into the position. I decided to give myself around a year to see if it would make more sense. I have learned a bit, but I’m still struggling a lot. I talked to my mentor and a family member that are both in engineering about this, and they said it’s normal and just to give it time. But I’ve just felt so tired of Not understanding things. I’ve noticed myself loosing motivation to try, because I don’t feel like I will ever understand this information. 

Through my interactions with my colleagues, I could tell that don’t really see me as competent to complete this position. I have been assigned to lead a project and have been trying to do my best.but I’ve been heavily burnt out and overwhelmed.  

I’ve came to the realization that I’m not good and not interested in the current field of engineering I’m in. I’m not sure if I still want to stick with engineering. I’m not even sure of my strengths. I just feel really lost on where to go from here.

I have been interested in maybe looking into jobs that are less technical and more design based? I enjoyed CAD design, and maybe UX design and more creative pursuits in general. But I wasn’t sure about the job opportunities out there for fields. I heard UX maybe over saturated?  If anyone does have any suggestions, please let me know. I’m open to learning. 

Sincerely, 

a 24 year old trying to figure things out.",Extension_Summer3013,1,1.0,2,1692640596,2023-08-21 17:56:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15xew5b/ive_been_feeling_stupid_and_hopeless_at_my_first/,8,2023
15xesoo,"Got laid off on Friday, incredible opportunity lands in my lap this morning. Please help!","Quick backstory - I was 1 of 60 sales people laid off from my Software Sales job on Friday and I was sulking around all weekend pondering my life and career. I don't have the necessary skills or education to move to a different field without going back to school or taking an entry level position (and a massive paycut), so I'm back on the job boards hammering out cover letters and resumes for sales positions. The truth is, after much reflection, I've realized I'm completely burnt out on sales and not the least bit excited about these interviews I'm spending so much time preparing for. It's all the same shit wrapped in a different shiny wrapper. But, I do love working with people and always imagined myself still being involved in sales but in more of a leader/development/operational role - heavily involved in revenue growth but not out there grinding it cold-calling and door-swinging.

Over the weekend I talked to one of my (now former) clients to let him know what had happened and he was impressed enough with me to bring me in for an opportunity. He owns a construction company that is growing quicker than he can keep up with and even though they are using a CRM to track their leads and jobs, tons of money is being flushed down the drain because of slow or no follow-ups from the sales team. There is no one overseeing anything from a sales perspective other than the owner himself and he's too busy to keep up with it. 

So that's where I come in - he wants me to use my sales and analytics background to help keep the sales force organized and efficient, improve the close rate, keep leads from going stale, and make sure that current clients are happy. On top of that, I'd be tasked with general business growth activities such as networking/promotion, evaluating our marketing efforts, social media posting, etc. I'm pretty ecstatic about this opportunity - it's exactly what I've been looking for and I know I would be great at it. So that brings me to why I'm here - looking with help with any/all of the following-

\#1 - he doesn't even have a name for this role yet. What is it called?

\#2 - with it not being a formal role, there is no set pay yet. Should I be asking for a more commission focused pay structure or shoot for a high base with small growth bonuses? What %s should I ask for?

\#3 - if anyone else has experience moving from sales into a role like this, did you have success? What made you successful?

\#4 - my biggest disadvantage is not having a construction background (he doesn't seem to mind) so i'll need all the help I can get learning the ins-and-outs of this industry and best ways to grow revenue. Any books, podcasts, or youtube videos that you recommend?

\#5 - anything else I need to know?

Thanks, y'all!

I've graduated from a prestigious college in my country. After lost of trials and tribulations during my bachelors, associates and finally my masters all from top institutions. I had finally got a top 5% paying job right out of college i was ecstatic. I was working in performance marketing for a fintech startup with a very ambitious goal. A startup run by an ruthless billionaire and i was 1 degree of separation working under him. I worked there for 11 months ( was rotated between 3 teams) then fired one of my peers in that firm hired me in the next company she joined (luckily i got a pay rise) after 4 months shit went south and I was fired. 

Then i interviewed everywhere for 6 months no job insight. Finally took a paycut of 50% got a job at the most toxic workplace ever ( I'm finding myself in more and more toxic workplaces and trust me the best workplace in my country is 5x more toxic than any european workplace or 2x more toxic than an american workplace). After slogging there for 4 months I got a pay hike of 35% and joined a new company ( I am still making less than my first job).



I am one of the youngest people there, I can't get up early enough to reach office on time all time. I'm the only one taking smoke breaks but I'm also the last to leave the office 90% of the times (that too with an margin of 1-3 hours.) But that clearly doesn't matter I guess. 


I'm disabled and not very well off so I am going to need a job how should I evaluate my career?


Here's the options I have:

1) Apply to DEI workplaces ( there's very few companies in my country that have those programs in cadre of jobs I've done before and am qualified to do)

2) Take another paycut and join some terrible company again.

3) liquidate some of my investments and prepare for a government job ( low pay but high job security and affirmative action benefits fmso easier entry)

4) Liquidate all my investments take a chance on something creative or startup something. Or just stay unemployed and get my health in check (I've gained 60 kg/132 lbs in past 5 years)


5) evaluate other career options ( possibly take a paycut)

Here's the career options generally open with my degree.

1) product management: can't do it because bad at stakeholder management

2) Finance: would like to do it but I'll have to start from scratch I'm not well versed in it.

3) Brand Marketing: I'll have to do sales first, generally performance marketing hires are not considered for brand marketing and people with sales exp are hired

4) Consulting: the industry is under pressure right now.

5) Sales: I have low self esteem and I'm not that persuasive


Either way how should i evaluate my career. I've good command of English and my local languages, I'm awkward enough to be not bothered by things making me socially unsuccessful and successful at the same time. I'm okay at math, excel and powerpoint. I'm not too good at stats ( hence I'm not considering analytics or operations jobs). I thrive under pressure and short deadlines. I'm incredibly lazy but sometimes intelligent generally to fuel my lazyness and yes I've very severe ADHD.

15xe576,Leaving defense contracting?,"
Hi everyone - 

Im not in a terrible position but I’m currently in a bit of a confused place with my career and I would really appreciate some outside perspective. I’ve been working for the government as a defense contractor since roughly 2016, I was military prior to that. 

I’m a Systems Engineer and I’m currently in the space industry of the federal government. I feel like positions really only want to hire me for my clearance and not necessarily the skills I’ve accumulated throughout the years. I’ve found this to be quite frustrating and I’m desperately trying to leave government work to go to a remote position at a commercial company as a Systems Engineer. I’ve applied to at least 300 positions these past few months, have scored a few interviews with startups and one interview with a large company but there really isn’t anything out there matching what I’m looking for (remote, uncleared) 

I no longer want to work in a SCIF, I want nothing to do with cleared work anymore. It’s slow work, painful. I question how people do this for 20+ years. 

1)Are System Engineers even in demand in the commercial/private sector? 
2)Is scoring a remote position like this even possible?
3) What would you do? Am I approaching this the wrong way? Is there something I’m missing? 

I’m not currently a developer, I’d prefer not to become one but I’m not ruling it out. I have a masters degree and a pretty solid resume. Regardless, I’m getting countless rejection letters and it’s a terrible feeling, also motivating. I’m contemplating on doing a full career change for what it’s worth.

15xe1pz,Should I pursue a masters in social work?,"Hi Reddit, so I’m at a crossroads. There’s a week left to apply for classes and financial aid and I’m planning on going to school later today to speak with someone at the department. I got accepted into grad school at a state university but I’m still not sure if I want to do it. I’m 29, about to be 30, and I drive a school bus making 30/hr with raised every year due to it being a union job. I obviously don’t want to do that all my life, and I was able to fully pay off my undergrad, but a part of me feels like I wasted my money getting a degree in psy. I can also wait another year and still keep my spot if it ends up not working out this year. 

 Some pros tho before people say social work isn’t a good gig. The plan is to be a school social worker here in Connecticut and depending on the city, after 11/12 years I can make close to 6 figures. It’s based off the teachers contract and Connecticut does pay well.

 Cons: it would take 3 years to complete the program and I’m still not sure if I would have to quit my job in order to do my internship at the third year. I can’t quit my job for a year, just can’t. I’m also weary of getting student debt cause of grad school. I’m not sure how loan forgiveness works exactly so perhaps it can help me, perhaps not. 
 
I’m also living at home and it’s starting to get to me at my age. I know I have accomplish alot but I still feel like a failure.

15xe057,Accounting/Finance to Tech - Worth the switch?,"I studied accounting instead of data science because I thought I couldn't do it. I was broke and felt like I couldn't risk studying something that I might flunk out on. I wasn't aware of the growing demand for tech workers so I studied what I knew would secure me a decent post grad job. However, seeing the opportunity and growth in data science as a field is giving me FOMO. I gave up something that I was genuinely interested in for something that was arguably easier in a risk-aversion tragedy. Not to mention that salaries I see online are *outrageously* high and it seems that dudes that took a coding bootcamp come out making 6-figure salaries immediately after graduating.

For context: I've been out of college 2 years and just signed a job offer that nets me \~100k in salary + bonuses. Accounting/finance isn't my passion but I'm still very interested in it it's been treating me pretty well. Experienced accountants are in demand right now but salaries are still minor figures compared to some of the first-year salaries that tech workers are getting. My career trajectory is currently pretty promising and I probably have a shot at some pretty lucrative opportunities if I keep at it for another few years. I'm just trying to figure out if its still worth pursuing as a career or should I keep it as a hobby?

Also, how sensationalized are tech salaries? Everyone online seems to insist that it's very doable to earn well over 100k without much formal education but I'm obviously skeptical of that assertion. At the end of the day, I'm just trying to maximize my paycheck since I don't mind working in either field. I have to go back to school to earn 30 more credits regardless (CPA requirements).

15xd6wt,Boss is accepting applications for my job and expects me to keep working until he fires me.,"There's a couple pieces to this issue so I'll try to be as succinct and clear as I can....

1. My boss has always disliked me after he absorbed my department from a mass layoff. Bad attitude, rude, tanked my performance review, etc. He even bad mouthed me to another dept so they wouldn't accept my transfer request. 

2. I reported a coworker to HR a few weeks ago for some racist behavior. HR investigated, closed the case saying it was defamation on coworkers part. HR of course copied my boss on the report. 
Coworker and boss are close friends, naturally.

3. THE SAME DAY I filed the report, my boss posted my job as available. I spoke to him today and he stated it's because of my poor performance.

I already spoke to a few work lawyers and they say I have a case for retaliation, but I need to suffer punitive damages (get fired) before I can sue. My issue is, I would not like to hurt my case and lose out on unemployment if I quit today, but I can't fathom how my boss expects me to keep working knowing he's going to fire me soon, maybe thats his angle. Locale is US... Can share state if it provides more insight into unemployment laws here.

15xab6n,New Job Guilt,"So, I’ve worked for a company for the past five years as an office-based employee. It was a new start-up company in construction, and I was employee number one. Over that time, I’ve done my best to impact the business in a positive way, but it always seems to be on the brink of falling to pieces.   


The owner always says things like “we just need to get over this project and we’ll be fine” Or “once I can get this account setup, we’ll be smooth sailing” but nothing ever changes, and we just lurch from one disaster to the next, barely making money (often losing it). After flirting with a nervous breakdown for a good year, and with a rather large kick from my girlfriend. I finally decided that enough is enough and started job hunting. I almost immediately started an application within the rail network and after weeks of aptitude tests, a medical, interviews and I’ve been offered the role (Woohoo!)  


I’ve had my contract and decided to go for it as it’s an unbelievable opportunity, with an extremely generous pay package (150% of my already generous wage), better hours, better benefits and the most important part - stability, it’s effectively a job for life and would allow me to know me and my families’ futures are secure which is the biggest contributing factor to taking the job.   


However, the business looks like it’s a real possibility of going under at the moment. Like people ringing me four times a day chasing money, insane overheads, a huge row of fuck ups for an upcoming job that’s worth 500k and my boss asking me to chase money for work that we’ve not even started yet.   


In light of this I’m feeling incredible guilty about handing in my notice in and leaving the business. I’m the only office worker and I’m confident, me leaving is going to be the straw that broke the camels back as I’m the only one who’s really IT literate and I’ve built up a multitude of skills over the past 5 years (invoicing, quoting and estimating, autocad drawing).   


How can I stop feeling like this? I know my boss is severely invested in this and I feel like I’m contributing to putting his family at a detriment but then I can’t sacrifice my families future when I’m being offered such a stable job.  


Any advice would be really appreciated.

15x9oa3,I'm a fresher with expertise in Cloud and DevOps looking for suggestions and advice for my two problems.,"I’m a recent B.Tech CSE graduate doing a full time remote work as a Cloud Engineer. I’m mainly experienced in AWS and DevOps practices. I'm a quick learner and I have been working full time since 4th year of my college. 6 months into my work, I started fully managing the entire project I was put into, which is developing, handling, debugging infrastructure for 4 teams.  
  
I've got lot of appreciations from my colleagues and clients but the problem is that it's hard to put the expertise into resume, mainly because of the lack of numbers in experience and every cloud hirers wants big numbers in experience.  
  
I'm working remotely from India and get paid as per Indian standards (12Lakhs per year) but the company is in Canada. I recently got offered to move to Canada with full visa and ticket sponsorship for a new project, with pay as per Canadian standards. But I enjoy working remotely and time with my family and girlfriend, and would like to stay in India for atleast 2 more years, until she graduates.  
  
I also write articles as a freelancer, which pays me $500 per article. But this guy hired me after seeing my projects and articles.  
  
The first issue I have is that I finish my work tasks very easily most of the sprints, and will be doing some extra Proof of Concepts or articles to pass my time. My company asks me to do less work because I finish my tasks soon and as it is a contract with clients, we need to drag tasks 🙂. So I'm wondering if this is good for someone starting off in his career.  
  
Secondly, companies aren't short listing my resume, even though I think I've showcased what I can, when I'm trying for a job change. My LinkedIn is good, with recommendation from clients, projects, articles and stuff.

I'm a 30M in Ontario Canada with 2 kids and another on the way. My partner is staying home to take care of us. 

Before this relationship I was working security at a mine and making a decent pay. I had left that job to be closer to my partner. And have made some poor life decision since that time.. but now I have tons of experience and training/certificates.

I have the following licenses/certificates. 

Security license 
First Aid
Smart Serve
Cannsell 
Fork lift
Boom lift
Working at Heights
Crane operator
Safe food handling

I'm not sure if I'm missing anything but I also have great customer skills and am just good with people and money. 

Anyways I'm wondering where would be a good entry level job where I could move my way up. Or if there's any other suggestions that I could take that would help me. There's not many jobs in my town and there's alot of unemployed people looking for work. Before I didnt care if I wasn't rich or had tons of money because I didn't expect to have wonderful children one day and now I have a third on the way! Anyways security doesn't pay much here and I have a bit of a shit history working due to mental health/addiction but I've beat the life ruining addictions lol and now have my kids to love and take care of. I'm a hard worker and quick learner as well I just don't know where to start. 

I have thought about going to school again or even taking online courses. I just don't want to waste a few years in school to not be able to have a decent paycheck for another 5 years or something. I have no problem working my ass off or moving for abit to find a better life for my family.

I just got offered a promotion at my job (yay 🙂) which actually came w/ a little over 8k raise and bonus incentive.

The only thing I was seeing was that, within my current work title/salary grade. The max for just within my specialist role still outnumbers the new salary offer that my company presented to me. 

Is this something I should address or no? I know new hire vs promotion incentives/ asks are vastly different and internal Promotions barely give much wiggle room. But I’m just wondering since this proposed new role is a step up from my current, should I ask for the max of my current role, which I’d assume would be base for the new one or no?

15x81ce,"I was offered a job, I accepted, now they are ignoring me","I'm a 19 year old looking for my first job. Due to issues with ID, I was only able to start job searching 2 months ago. Thankfully, my search has been relatively short as, recently, I was offered a job at a pizza hut in the biggest shopping centre (mall) in my city. For most people this isnt much but for me, this is rather prestigious and a great place to start my career.

On the 11th august, I had a glitch with my email which said I had invalid credentials which stopped me receiving emails. On the 19th august, I fixed the problem. That's when I saw that on the 14th august, I was offered a job at this pizza hut. 

The email said that they would like to offer me the job. To accept, I need to respond with proof of my right to work in my country and my uniform size. However, it also said that they would like to run some provisional working dates starting 18th august. Of course, thanks to my email not working, I could only respond to this email on the 19th. The email also said that If I had any questions or issues, feel free to call them.

I responded to the email with what they required me to send. I also apologized for any inconvenience and that I would love to work for them and if there are any updates/issues the to call me on my phone. 

It has been 2 days and I have heard nothing back from them. I called them as the email said if i had any questions. When I started explaining, I was cut off by the person on the phone and was told that they had seen my email and that the general manager (who sent me the job offer) was not in as he is only at the store in the mornings (it was 11:30am when I called). He said he had seen the email and would make sure that the general manager sees.

No where in the email did it say that I had a time limit to accept the job offer. The only thing close to this states as follows: ""please note, I will need your confirmation and all the details sent back by Tuesday 15th in order to make the provisional date work.""

That statement was only in regards to the provisional working date and was not stated as a deadline to accept the offer. I feel that the provisional working date can be changed if necessary and in this situation, it definitely is. 

As a side note, there a feel things which I feel were unjust and handled unprofessionally by them. For example, I was told that I'd be receiving a phone call rather than an email but this was not the case. Also, I was told I'd be interviewed by the general manager but instead it was done by a regular employee (who did a good job to be fair). Also, I feel like not responding to me is completely unprofessional and it should be a matter of urgency to let me know if I can't have the job or if it is fine and they can just start me at a later date. 

I'm not sure what to do, was I at fault? Should I or should I not be given this job, considering I responded only 5 days after I was offered? What is the legal response to this situation?

TLDR: A glitch with my email caused me to respond to a job offer 5 days after they offered the job and 1 day after they wanted me to start. I have responded, accepting the job but they are completely ignoring my email.",MidgetAlex123,26,0.7300000190734863,48,1692625296,2023-08-21 13:41:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15x81ce/i_was_offered_a_job_i_accepted_now_they_are/,8,2023
15x7xqy,Should I move away right after graduation or should I stay in my country for a while?,"Hi everyone,  


  
So I'm about to graduate and, as many other people, I'm scared of what's gonna happen next. I'm finishing the Master's degree in Physics Engineering and I have many doubts and insecurities about my future. When I enrolled in this course, I thought I'd be sorta ""set for life"" meaning that I wouldn't have to worry about having to find a job because my course has pretty much 100% employability. I wouldn't have a problem with finding a job, I'm sure of it. However, the problem is that I don't want to stay in the country where I am now.  


  
I'm 24, I am from Portugal and I'm graduating from one of the top universities for engineering in the country (I know it's no MIT or Caltech, but it's decent) and since a couple of years back, I've decided that I want to move to another country, especially in Northern Europe like Iceland or Scandinavia (part of the reason I've been learning Norwegian for 2 years). I've also done one semester abroad in Poland to get a taste of what it'd be like living abroad and it really resonated nicely with me.  


  
The problem now is that I have no professional experience. During my studies, I only did some volunteering for a couple of student associations and I couldn't even get a summer internship because I had to go back home and work to pay for my studies. I only have one published article but it's because of a management class I had, not even related to engineering.  


  
Over the past couple of months, I've also been looking at some job offers on LinkedIn and they are, to say the least, very overwhelming - not only because of the amount of skills they require for a ""entry level"" job, but also because of the huge amount of people that applied for each job (most of the time +100 applicants).  


  
With this said comes my question: how unrealistic is it to find a job in another country in my situation (master's degree in engineering + no work experience) and, if it's possible, is LinkedIn really the best place to keep searching for it?

15x7s9n,lonely and unmotivated at work,"Hello everyone , I (f28) started a couple of months ago a new job, in the field of my studies - more or less -, with a good contract (fixed for the moment but the prospect in theory is to move to permanent), smallish company, 40h in the office, pretty standard stuff. 

Context: in the company they never had this department, at the moment I'm the first and only person in the team (and that won’t change anytime soon). it's a department that tends to work in teams, and I had always been used to collective work, exchanges of ideas and meetings, here I find myself left to my own devices

After about 3 weeks in the open space they moved me to a private office, the only contact I have with colleagues is during lunch break but at the table with 4-6-10 people it is difficult to have a minimum of personal bonding. Also I think my private office is seen as an unearned benefit by people who have been working here longer and share an office  with 4/5 people (not completely wrong, even though we are divided by work units) 

I also have a workload that I estimate currently takes up 2h2-30h a day, I think it will increase, but I have no certainty.

it's easy then to feel like a placeholder, it's a bit demotivating, and the personal situation with coworkers (at best nonexistent, at worst a mild hostility towards me--some instances I didn't specify) is pretty lonely and brings me down even more.

15x7ooq,Needing Advice On Constant Job Rejections,"Hello all. I’ve been interviewing for three months now and have finally been presented with two job offers. “Problem is”  both offers are for Recruiter positions.  I really want to work as a Recruiting Coordinator or something on the back end of Talent Operations but, I continue to get rejected for these type of positions and I can’t figure out why. Either I get the auto rejection email after sending my app or I get an auto rejection after doing the phone screen. 

I’d like to think I’m preparing for the interviews well enough as I make sure to do my research about the company beforehand, explain how the job duties are literally the same things I’ve done in both of my previous RC positions and I ask questions at the end of the interviews. I know that 3 years of RC experience (5 years of work experience total) and a Bachelor’s is far from impressive and in some cases it’s still considered entry level but it’s not like I’ve been applying to RC positions that require more experience. All of them are basically entry level RC roles. I’ve only entertained fully remote RC jobs so, maybe it’s a high competition thing but, it’s super frustrating. 

I’ve more or less resigned to the fact that, I’ll just accept one of the jobs and hope I can move elsewhere in the company in the future.

I feel silly for complaining about this especially since I know that there’s tons of people in the Recruiting/HR industry out of work right now. Does anyone have any advice?

*I’m new to the sub so, feel free to let me know if this post belongs elsewhere. Thanks for reading.

TL:DR - I’ve been presented with two job offers. Both of which aren’t really positions I want and applied to mostly out of frustration. I continue to get rejected for the type of positions I really want and I can’t figure out why.",KJKE_mycah,2,1.0,4,1692624463,2023-08-21 13:27:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15x7ooq/needing_advice_on_constant_job_rejections/,8,2023

15x4qnp,Career advice,"I’m a recruiter (31F) for a small employment agency with no growth. I have been looking the past 3 years for a new job in the same field for a bigger company. Or change in careers cause honestly this job has burned me out. I’ve had gone through many interviews with some where it looked positive with no success. I barely make commission and my salary is sub par compared to others and there’s no benefits. 

I have tried mostly using LinkedIn as that’s the most networking I’ve done. 

I have tried taking courses in other fields to find interest. I took a data analysis boot camp that seemed cool but I couldn’t really see myself in it. I do like and can use the skills. 

I really have been trying to get into Human Resources, that’s why I took the recruiting gig as a stepping stone. But unfortunately without certain qualifications I could never get past the 2nd interview stages. I don’t even mind taking a salary cut if it helps but no one looks for entry level anymore. 

I need help. What should I do?? I make ok in salary but I can’t see myself here another year knowing the company is small and not getting anywhere. 

I thought about spending more money on another degree in HR but I feel it would be a waste. I already have a masters. ( which I know degrees don’t matter anymore, it’s who you know )

15x43iy,Desperately in need of guidance,"Hello 👋 . I'm desperately  in NEED of guidance  . 
Im 21 years old . I hold  English literature degree. I dropped out of my masters and currently pursuing french B1 . 
I don't know which path to choose. I'm still trying to figure out myself , I actually don't have an ambition yet . I wanted to do UG English back then because i had a force driving me towards it  but I'm no longer interested in teaching profession.I only have a year's time left to place myself in a job because ik my parents will start looking for an alliance that I'm actually not ready for and interested in . 

Now I have two options in my mind ,
-> One is to enter IT/ MNC using my french  &  pursue courses like  data science/ digi marketing  simultaneously and finding a high paying job in some other country. 

-> secondly, I'm thinking about doing MBA diploma in Canada - that will help me in  two ways  , 1) escape from my marriage preparations because of the 5 years  time frame that I get including the stay back period .2)with further studies  hopefully a good paying job . 
But this again entirely  depends on what course that I choose . 

I have no one to guide me ,I'm completely lost , tbh I'm actually afraid of being useless , I wanna do something for myself, but I just don't know which course to choose , have no idea about  post study work opportunity,how and what to pursue .

I regret so many choices that I had made in the past ,I'm know this realisation is too late 

But I also believe ""it's never too late to start anything"" 

The MAIN reason is I have only one year in my hand , now I'm very serious about my future . A friend of mine showed me that there's more to life . I realised that I have been living in a shell and I want to break from it . but I just don't know where to go from here . Day by day I'm losing my confidence and crying to sleep , thinking alot about  future, what's it  holding for me . 
 Finally here iam reaching out to you all . 

I  really  wish and hope that I get  advice / opinions/ ideas from y'all 🙏

All I have in my mind is to get out of my country and seek a job  . If I stay here  I will be manipulated to marry . 


Please do suggest me what can I go for .",TechnologyLucky337,1,1.0,0,1692614792,2023-08-21 10:46:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15x43iy/desperately_in_need_of_guidance/,8,2023

Our senior designer has resigned and will be leaving in 2 months and our company is looking for new senior designer to replace him. However, my manager wants me to do the first interview. I honestly don't want to do that because of several reasons:

  
I never conducted an interview before and I feel like I won't be fair to the candidate if I agree. 

I don't find it reasonable for me to interview someone who is applying for a higher position than mine. 

I am already involved in reviewing the applicant's portfolios and CVs, and that is already time consuming. I also have so much work to finish anyway.

Taking parts of the interviews was never mentioned as part of my job, and honestly I don't know if such things are usually written on contracts.

15x2a86,Ranting about decisions at 4 am,"I am an eastern europian highschool graduate from a family that is barely escaping poverty. I have an opportunity to study in the USA. When people ask me about my future plans, I find it difficult to answer.
One one hand, I spent a good portion of highschool preparing myself for studying engineering or computer science. Looking at the trends, I will probably pursue engineering and then specialize in something that catches my interest. In highschool I chose the hardest subjects of physics and math. Even though i gave it my all, I got the lowest grades in those subjects. I found myself enjoying physics. It made me think about finding answers to things that didn't look as important before. But my grades dissapointed me a lot and I have a looming feeling that scientific stuff aren't compatible with me.
I got suprisingly high grades on literature even though i spent barely no time studying it compared to the others.
My plan B is something related to psychology. I have loved the idea of studying psychology for years. I don't want to become a therapist but researching and studying the reasons of behaviour  sounds like a lot of fun. But I have heard that psychology as a degree is very broad and you need specializations and whatnot. I need to be independent and start working in a profession as fast as possible tho, in order to support my family which includes my grandma and my mother, who is finding it harder and harder to work like she did before. I have an older sister which I love a lot. She tries her hardest to support all of us but she can't help by herself forever. I need a college degree that has a higher percentage of making me succesful. And I feel like engineering is that answer.
Even though my natural likes push me more to psychology, it's just not right for me to follow something that doesn't give me a secure base in the future. I can't afford to be selfish and run away from my problems. I can't just optimistically follow my desires and hope for the best.
This is more of a rant than anything. I have already given up on any passions. I loved writing stories before but I haven't made anything in a long time. I stopped painting and reading. I hope that the next generation of my family will be finally free to choose whatever they want for their future.
Honestly, it's not even my responsibilities that are pushing me towards this decision. It's my fear of poverty. The further i go from poverty, the more I realise the depth of the hole me and my family were stuck in. I don't want to go back into poverty, and even worse, to drag others with me. 
 I am gonna do some more research on stuff like neuroscience but until then I think I have decided on engineering.

As some side questions, what are some atlternatives or career pathways to psychology? What is your experience with psychology? Do you recommend it?

My industry is way too small (think along the lines of power transmission but not exactly. Can't reveal my real industry)

Won't get promoted as long as managers above me don't quit.

Although, I have no interest in being a manager.
I am no longer interested in this industry itself.

Due to the nature of my industry, can't easily switch jobs  due to less opportunities.

Thinking of switching to a different technical industry which seems more interesting. But hey, I don't have relevant experience. 

What if I feel the same after joining the new industry.

This is the reason I also avoid getting into a relationship or marrying as my situation has made me depressed.

Has anyone felt the same and what did you do about it ?

I am very confused about my career. I passed my 12th-grade board exams this year with PCMB (60%), but I didn't perform well in the NEET exam.

If I don't achieve anything next year, it will be of no use for me. All I want is to earn money.

15wxwq2,I feel like all of my current and former peers are passing me by at 100mph and I’m stuck spinning my tires in situations I hate with no way of changing them,"
Tl;dr I need to escape a dead end job and subpar educational background and actually become something but I feel like even though I have the drive to change it, I don’t know where to start, don’t know if I have the resources to do so at all. 

Kind of a rant. Idk. 

I graduated from college a year and two months ago with a degree in history and English. Since then I have held two jobs: I managed a coffee shop, which was fun but unsustainable, and I worked at a hotel which is my current job. Well paying, but not enjoyable tbh. 

My grades weren’t amazing when I graduated because I had been struggling with pretty substantial major depression and suicidal ideation for the second half of college that happened during Covid. Still, “c’s get degrees” and all that so I powered through. History and English are really my main two interests aside from more niche subtopics like anthropology, studies of myth & religion, archaeology, etc. but I just knew that I didn’t want to do something that wouldn’t play to a passion of mine. I want to love my work even if it means sacrificing financial stability now. 

I now have neither. 

I regret my degrees and wish, as someone who didn’t aim for the focus of being a teacher or some shit that I had specialized my focus to anthropology or archaeology more closely but I’m insanely broke and can’t even fathom going back to school to pick up the pieces and get another degree, even fast-tracked or online (I also just don’t think it would look good). I also told myself I wasn’t interested in grad school in the past and that I would worry about it in the future if I wanted but I needed a break. That was a mistake. The opportunity for some sort of internship came and went forever. I never corresponded closely enough with professors to get a leg up in that regard. And again, I got so-so grades for useless degrees and I have not been proven to have had any more worth than someone who just straight up didn’t go to college. I wasted four years for a lifetime of shame and regret and crippling debt. My current partner also says that I can’t go to grad school unless I can get funding because it would leave us too deep in debt so it’s seemingly off the table, but tot doesn’t even look like people in my field are making decent splashes with their careers anyways unless they have doctorates which like, as if. 

Meanwhile, my two close friends got degrees in business and communications and are working comfortable high-paying jobs. They’re both 23 and just bought their first house. My older sister just moved to Chicago for grad school after an absolutely incredible i story of internships, opportunities, and points of excellence as a student and my younger sister had an internship with a law firm as an undergrad with law school aspirations. Even my friend who dropped out of college and is a full-blown alcoholic is working an extremely successful career as a mechanic. And I’m here, working in hospitality for barely enough money to scrape by with a partner who isn’t doing much better in a role that I probably only needed a GED to get in a city I didn’t really want to live in. I feel like a failure. 

Everyone says I’m smart. Everyone has said I’m smart my whole life. I don’t feel smart. I feel inept at everything I do. I struggled through high school. I struggled in college. I like the things that I mentioned. I live for books and literature and sagas of history and the world of man, and want to spend a lifetime studying humanity and sharing my findings with humanity. I wanted to be a professor but I can wave that goodbye without good grades, grad school, or any real achievements to stand on. I’m even writing a book, as author is another big achievement that I would love to reach, but I’m 30,000 words/100 pages deep into writing it and just feel defeated. I doubt myself at every turn and I feel like finishing a story that people will care about as much as I do and actually conquering the task of traditional publication is such a Herculean task that it feels impossible. I write regardless, but it doesn’t hold the same luster. I can’t even get a job working the door of a museum with how bad the job market is rn, and neither can people I know that DO have master’s degrees. 

I even decided at one point that I would be content with working in a coffee shop my whole life. Why not? It was fun. I was good at it. I made people happy and worked in an environment that didn’t make me wish I was dead. Making flat whites doesn’t keep food on the table though. I even got a job offer from a coffee shop that I would consider dream job territory and when I asked if their wage of $11/hr was negotiable as I couldn’t survive off of that, they cut contact with me. 

I moved to a different city because I thought that that would change things. Cities are where opportunities are, right? It’s no different. 

I’m 22 years old. 23 in a month. I feel like every action I’ve taken in my life thus far has been failure after failure leading me to the failure that I am now, and I’m just stuck job hopping in industries that I hate forever until I get my big break too late for me to be able to smother out the regret of lost opportunities with money or I die.

I don’t sleep anymore. I eat enough to stay mostly alive. I stopped going to the gym, which was my one great non-intellectual hobby that brought me joy. I just want to succeed. I just want to be given the chance that will let me live a life that makes me happy in the moment and satisfied with my work and what I achieved when I get to the end. What am I working towards? What the fuck do I even want to achieve? 

I need to know that I’m not the only one here…more importantly I need to know that others have been here and broken free. I need to know that someone can make all of this worth it and BE something. To achieve or contribute to something. To be great in small ways that can, if no one else, make me proud. Make me feel less small. Make me feel like I’m not the floundering black sheep of a family that has always been able to just “make it work” so fucking effortlessly.

We own a 2013 Lexus ES350 with 170k on it, a 2000 Ford Ranger with 250k on it (in decent shape, needs new tie rods and side view mirrors which I will do myself). We own our home valued at $300k and pay about $2k in property taxes a year. We eventually want to buy a second home and remodel then rent this one out.

15wxocu,Study 2 different degrees or 1 but try to get industry experience.,"Hello everybody.  


I am currently entering my second year of my bachelor's degree in Computing & IT with The Open University studying online. However I also got accepted to study an Integrated Masters in Industrial Design & Production Engineering (5 year degree) in a brick university near my house. The university is 100% free so tution fees and transportation are not an issue.   


One of the reasons I joined the Open University was that I could study and gain industry experience at the same time but since I got accepted to a good engineering program I am starting to reconsider.  


Would you suggest I stick with the Open University while trying to find a job as an entry level software engineer or study 2 degrees together which would limit my free time and my chance of getting industry experience before graduation?  


Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",NorwegianCoder78,1,1.0,0,1692593909,2023-08-21 04:58:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15wxocu/study_2_different_degrees_or_1_but_try_to_get/,8,2023
15wxlix,Okay to combine apprenticeship and full time role into a single role or would that yield issues during a background check when applying for other jobs?,"Hi guys,

  
I went through a 10 month apprenticeship for my current role, obtained the legal license to do the role without supervision, and have been doing that role for 3 years now.

  
Is it okay to combine these two together into a single role and just not include the apprenticeship? Start date would be start of the apprenticeship and end date would be today. It's the same role but the apprenticeship is just with supervision.

  
Would this yield issues/questions during a background check when applying for other jobs or is it okay to do so? Its a very niche role in healthcare btw.

15wrvha,Struggling young artist in need of advice,"Hey everyone, I'm a recent graduate where I studied design and am now trying to get into the animation industry. I would like some advice because I feel confused and lost at the moment. During university I did an internship 9-5, Mon - Fri and felt so drained by the end of it, like I had no time for myself or what I want to create. I honestly don’t think I can survive a full time job… My friend told me that it’s something I just need to get used to, and the thing is most animation jobs at studios are full time. I seriously can’t imagine myself doing full time again though, if it means I have no time to work on my own projects. My own projects mean alot for me and I think I would feel really burdened if I’m not working on them. Even despite being a junior artist, I have high standards and only want to work at studios that I really like, otherwise I feel like im just wasting my time. Am I being too fussy, and just need to suck it up and work full time?

  
Another thing to note is, I currently live with my parents so I don’t actually need the amount of money full time gives. Ideally I’d want to work part time (20-30 hours) to give me a sense of schedule during the week, and spend the rest of the week working on my own projects.

  
My dream has always been to make my own animations and films, and also cover videos for artists (so making animations or live action film to songs). It feels though like such an isolated journey, and it’s hard for me to bring myself at times to have motivation to work on my own projects (I know, ironic right?) I wish I had more mentors or art friends in my life. Ideally in the future I see myself freelancing with alot of different artists and studios working on cool projects, but I know in order to get there I just need to keep churning out more and more work.

  
Since graduating I have done some freelance animation work for a studio and work sometimes as an events staff whenever they need me. I’ve cold emailed around 30 studios regarding if they had any freelancing opportunities, no replies yet. Most job postings I see offer full time roles only. So I’m not really too sure what to do. Am I being too picky? (After all, beggars can’t be choosers).  
I think alot of studios wouldn’t accept me as a freelancer anyway since im just starting out. Should I just accept any job I can find? Or should I just spend the next few months or so really grinding on my portfolio only? Or perhaps I should just go and work part time in retail or something?

  
Any advice would be much appreciated! Thank you!",i_miss_wonderland,0,0.5,0,1692577568,2023-08-21 00:26:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15wrvha/struggling_young_artist_in_need_of_advice/,8,2023

15wlsv2,Just graduated college and decided to change career focus during my senior year so I have no internship experience in the field. How should I go about my next steps?,"Just graduated college and decided to change career focus during my senior year so I have no internship experience in the field. How should I go about my next steps?  
  
I just graduated with a degree that was basically half finance or business and half data analysis or data science. For the majority of my time in college I wanted to pursue finance and had an internship the previous summer doing finance. During my senior year I decided I wanted to pursue more data science/data analysis roles.  
  
Now because of this I don't have any working experience in the field and have been applying for entry level roles but it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. I would argue I have a decent skillset and a few small projects I have on my resume. I wouldn't be opposed to graduate school as well but I don't have many references I can use.  
  
Should I change up my application strategy or maybe do more personal projects to help my resume? Any advice would help!

15wj768,Regretting Putting in my Two Weeks. Need Advice,"I work for a big 4 accounting firm. Love my job. Wasn’t really looking to leave but there’s been a lot of layoffs in public accounting lately so I was open to it. 

A recruiter reached out to me and I ended up being offered the job which I wasn’t really expecting. This job pays a good amount more and also offers OT. At my current position, I just work a lot during busy season but don’t get paid more which is obviously the norm for PA. I accepted the offer and put in my two weeks. This company is really small like 25-50 people so it’ll be a big change. 

I’ve reached out to some former employees who were all there less than 9 months and hated it. I now have a lot of regrets and wish I wouldn’t have even interviewed let alone accept the offer. 

Question for people on here: 

1) my resignation has already been accepted so I’m guessing I wouldn’t even be able to get my job back at this point. We use Workday. Is that dumb of me to even ask? 

2) I hate change. Am I being stupid and just wanting to take the “easy” way out and not change even though I’ll make a good amount more $. Money isn’t everything but man I didn’t expect to feel like this. It all kind of happened quickly and now I’m paranoid about leaving a big company for a small one and hating it.

15whjgd,Is It Worth Staying? All Day 'Doing Nothing' at Work – Looking for Advice!,"Hello everyone,

I'm seeking advice and curious to know your perspective on a situation. My salary is above the minimum wage at £22,000. While I don't live in London, where I reside, this is considered a decent income considering the nature of my work.

I am employed by an organisation contracted to another. Despite my job title being Warehouse Operative, the setup is quite unique. There's a spacious main room and two smaller rooms: one for storing packed items, and the other for myself and a colleague to pack in.

My role involves packing ONT dongles for a Landline Fibre Migration project provided to the customers. The process is straightforward: I place an ONT dongle and an instruction manual in a small envelope – that's the entirety of my job.

Unfortunately, I had a car accident on my second day of work, but I'm now fine. When I returned after a week's recovery from a minor ankle sprain, I learned that my colleagues had completed three weeks' worth of work in just five days, with the help of the drivers who had fewer deliveries while I was away.

My colleague, the other packer, calculated that we need to pack 300 dongles daily to secure our job until our contract ends on July 17, 2024. This contract started on July 17 of this year.

Most of my workday is spent waiting in the main packing room for our London-based line manager to provide the drivers with delivery lists, routes, and estimated return times. As advised by my colleague, we sometimes start packing as late as 1 PM to meet our target. After completing our daily limit, I mainly occupy myself on my phone while waiting for the drivers.

I’ve completed all of the mandatory training on my company-provided laptop as well as some optional training, so there’s literally nothing to do, just waiting on the drivers to go out with their list and for an appropriate time for me and my colleague, the other packer, to shoot off.

Though my line manager keeps in touch through messages, there's minimal supervision or additional tasks due to the distance. The drivers receive more recognition as they bear more responsibility.

I have travel anxiety and don't drive. Despite the organisation's interest in keeping us, I won't be comfortable with commuting or taking trains outside my city. Even work-from-home options would require a monthly trip to the London office.

With six months remaining on my contract in January, should I begin applying for other jobs? I've expanded my CV to include coordination with drivers, online courses, and adherence to procedures. Will this hinder my chances of securing an actual warehouse operative role, given the atypical setup despite my job title?

I value your insights and advice. Thank you!",Ethan-B24,1,1.0,0,1692552916,2023-08-20 17:35:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15whjgd/is_it_worth_staying_all_day_doing_nothing_at_work/,8,2023

15wgcvs,Should I quit my job?,"Hi everyone,

  
I'm in my early 20s and recently got out of college.

  
I'm currently working in the construction industry as a Junior engineer/designer for a company. I've been in this position for a year now and it has been nothing but having to constantly deal with the same problems and BS day in day out. The company has 4 branches in different parts of the country. The company also has an in-house engineering team of which I am a part of. However, I am the only person in the Engineering team that is physically present at the branch I work at. The people at this branch have, for some reason that I am still not entirely sure of (I suspect it is due to some negative experiences and possible personal/professional conflicts in the past between the team here and the in-house engineering team), stopped working with the in-house engineering team and have opted to outsource their engineering to a 3rd party. They've been outsourcing their Engineering for about a decade now since I arrived. I was not explicitly told this before accepting this job and within my first month I was suddenly ""competing"" so-to-speak with a 3rd party engineer to obtain work for myself so I wouldn't be sitting around doing nothing all day.

  
In addition to that, the team here sees their in-house engineers as less effective and efficient than the 3rd party they have been dealing with and our in-house engineering team sees the team in my branch as incompetent and ineffective (Personally I believe the team here is incompetent and our engineering team is fantastic). Fast forward 1 year... after a lot of butting heads and old people leaving with new people joining, I've started very very very very slowly gaining some credibility in my role from the team here. However, I am just so sick of dealing with the same problems and the team looking for every possible excuse to work with their 3rd party engineer instead of myself and our in-house team.  
I feel like I've been put in a position where I never had as much support as I needed as a young Junior engineer and had to learn everything on my own with minimal guidance from our in-house engineering team. It feels like I've basically single-handedly been doing most of the work to get these people to accept our engineering team and services. Now I'm seriously considering quitting on the spot and going somewhere else. I have a good relationship with my boss and she's said I'm doing well in my role (I'm not sure I entirely believe that she's being honest about this) and they've told me they don't want me to leave and assured me that things will change with time. However, it's already been a year and I have barely seen any changes whatsoever. I know that upper management is now involved and taking some steps but I feel it's too little too late because I have a very bitter taste in my mouth about this whole career path, industry, and company. I'm even regretting getting my degree in engineering because of this.

15wfq7k,Opinions on Career Change,"Hi - I am posting for my husband because he’s not the social media type, and I’m just hoping to get him some advice/opinions. My husband is 49 years old, going on 50, but he’s young for his age and most people wouldn’t necessarily guess that. His highest level of education is an Associates Degree in Business. For the majority of his life he has been in mostly or fully commissioned sales of one kind or another. He has sold high-end audio-video/home automation equipment, mortgages, office furniture, insurance (auto/home/life), and for the last 7 years he has sold recreational vehicles. He has had a few breaks in his commissioned sales history. At one point he was a manager of a mortgage sales office just before the big bust in 2008 (the office and the entire mortgage company wound up folding), a project manager for an AV/home automation company, and he was a sales team trainer for an insurance company. But by and large, it’s been all commissioned sales for years and years. He has always been really successful at sales and made pretty good money, but as anyone who is a commissioned salesperson knows, a lot depends on the economy, and this year the economy really sucks. The RV sales business has been hit particularly hard this year because of increased interest rates, and there’s no sign it’s going to get any better any time soon. He went from an absolutely banner year last year to absolute sh#t this year. To top it off, selling RVs means that he works every single weekend and many holidays. I have a regular M-F 8-5 type job, so we have almost no time together. That is a little easier to stomach when the money is rolling in, but it’s become a lot harder to put up with when money has become an issue. He’s pretty fed up, I certainly have just about had it, and neither of us is getting any younger. 

He has decided he’d really like to try and finally get himself out of commissioned sales and into something that just has a steady paycheck. He can’t just go get some job that is going to pay him $40K a year, however. He doesn’t need to make six figures for us to survive, as I make a really good living, but a good $65K would make us comfortable enough to not worry. I would love to hear any ideas, opinions, advice on what lines of work/businesses it would be good for him to look into being that 98% of his life experience is commissioned sales when he absolutely does not want to move from one commissioned sales job to another?

The company is located in Japan, marking my first time here. Despite its difficulty due to its reputation and competitiveness, I accepted the offer despite the wage being around $1500 lower or slightly higher based on the month and tax reductions.   
Regrettably, I lack experience and enthusiasm for the work assigned to me, which is mentally draining. The responsibilities were unclear when I accepted the offer, leaving me feeling in the dark. I'm now bombarded with information and must interpret it on my own, with minimal help. Although my teammates are friendly, they often only step in after I make mistakes. The team's emphasis on professionalism leads to a lack of open communication, contributing to a growing workload that feels overwhelming.   
I'm encountering unwelcoming situations and feel like a burden to the team. Struggling with unfamiliar tasks and rapid skill acquisition, my life has become increasingly stressful. I'm subjected to mistreatment in group meetings and interactions with colleagues or supervisors. The stress has taken a toll on my physical health, causing weight loss, night sweats, insomnia, and hormonal imbalances, among other issues. My anxiety and depression have worsened, and negative thoughts plague me.   
I'm overwhelmed and lonely, unsure of what steps to take. Despite my difficulty, discussing my situation with teammates seems challenging as they view my job as easy. Feeling trapped, leaving is tough due to family support obligations.   
Is it too late to pursue my dream career? What actions can I take? Your guidance is appreciated.

15wbewz,Advice on transitioning out of Accounting to a new field,"I've got to get out of accounting. I've been working as an accountant/bookkeeper for the past 6.5 years or so. I've never been that into it honestly, I just wanted a new path after leaving HR and so my Dad hired me at his CPA firm. Then I moved on to a remote position (Thanks COVID) at a software company for 3 years.

I ended up being fired from the second company, because I was just phoning it in the last six months or so. I knew I should have left, but I really liked my manager and she was so understanding during my time there. Particularly with my diagnosis of a neurological disorder that came about 1 year into my time there. This disorder and the medication I must take for it deplete me of energy, I can have extreme light sensitivity, migraines, dizziness/vertigo, nausea, etc.

  
It was kind of a relief to be let go from that company. I had a few months break before starting my recent job. It was so nice to have some energy again and not be worried about work all the time and have to work 12 hour days. I started to physically and mentally feel better again. This lasted about 3 months while we sold our house to move to a new city for my husband's new job. 

Cut to my new accounting job as a property accountant. I was told there would be great work/life balance and a lot of hands on training. I started out strong the first week or so, but the new software is very confusing and the training has been all over the place. I'm a little over a month in and know I should initiate more questions to earn better, but I just feel like I do not care. I've never been like this when I have started a new job. I can tell they are concerned about me being unable to get things done, and rightfully so.   


I'm just over accounting. I don't know what else I want to do though. I don't want to go back to school really, but I'd like to transition into a different role with less stress. Even I have to take a bit of a pay cut. Life is too short to be miserable all the time. In the meantime, I am going to try and work it out at my job.   


TL/DR I'm tired of working in accounting and want to transition to a new field that will be less stressful and I can leave work at work, even if I have to take a pay cut.

15w8u0g,"CEO of group of companies, but company owner not focused","(Burner account for confidentiality)  


I am a CPA who has built and sold two small companies. My last company was sold to a much bigger group of companies. 

I came on as Group CFO as part of the deal, but then was appointed CEO by the group owner (let's call him Bob) due to my entrepreneurial background and cross-functional skillset (I can do sales/marketing/finance/very tech focused etc etc) as Bob didn't want to operate in CEO role any more and wanted to focus on sales (his core skillset)

One of my best skills is taking ideas and operationalising them and building a full execution plan which covers all functional areas. 

This makes it a very good match with me and Bob - he has the visonary ideas, I operationalise them, then start hiring the team and executing the ideas.

Bob is a SUPER nice person, extremely supportive and is the classic ""visionary"" type who has lots of amazing ideas etc etc.

I am happy with my **current** salary/bonus/options and have complete flexibility in my schedule and decision making, the group has a great core management team etc. 

***So you may ask - what's not to like? Here comes the problem.***

I am very ambitious and have a personal target to earn $1mm over the next 3 years.

Bob's ideas are great and I know for a fact I can execute them for the group and make everyone a lot of money, but Bob keeps coming up with new ideas and altering the plan instead of focusing and building a solid base first, then expanding from there.

Bob also gets emotionally involved in legal stuff, which leads to constant Pyrrhic victories and distraction from executing on his ideas. He also tries to figure out legal stuff himself and will only appoint a lawyer if constantly pressed to do so.

In my past as a CPA I know for a fact there are two things you never make assumptions on - legal and taxation. I've seen plenty of companies get absolutely burned because the founders didn't take proper legal advice or make assumptions.

I've spoken to Bob about both of these things MULTIPLE times (30-40+ separate occasions (both via e-mail and multiple Zoom calls)) and even asked the other board members for advice and if they could speak to Bob, but I think it's an in-built psychology thing with Bob (he is close to retirement) and just the way he operates.

If things keep going the way they are, I'm 90%+ confident the group won't scale to $100mm+ within 3 years due to lack of solid base and focus, which reduces my overall chances of making $1mm for myself.

I really do love Bob and the team, culture etc but I'm thinking I can make $1mm quicker if I just start another company myself, or join an early stage tech startup.

What would you do in my position?  
TIA etc

15w8p0a,Have been applying for jobs through LinkedIn but no luck so far!,"Heya,
I have been looking for jobs for a good month and a half but no luck so far. I have given a couple of interviews but I think being an international student seeking employment is creating a barrier. I have been applying to both SMEs and Multinational companies but SMEs don't want me because they can't provide sponsorship post 2 years (I can work for a good 27 months without needing sponsorship) and getting a job in MNC is another level headache.
Back to the question, I have been applying through LinkedIn and trying to connect with people there but the connections don't even want to talk let alone help me out.

I have been tailoring my CV and cover letter for jobs I have to apply for outside of LinkedIn, but like I said it's getting hard when you don't know where you are going wrong.

Graduate roles have a 97% rejection rate, so I don't want to apply there. I do have work experience in marketing and applying for the same (brand management, digital marketing, etc.) but I am looking for more of a data analyst role as I did my degree in information systems management. 

Any advice is much appreciated.

15w8byx,I regret being offered a PPO via campus placement,"I (22 F) have just passed out from a prestigious girls college. Computer engineering branch. I didn’t feel confident in my coding skills & hence applied for any & every company that came on campus during the third year. Got selected for an internship with 25k stipend. I was then offered a PPO which I had to accept as per college policy. I was okay with that as 10 LPA did sound good to me.

But then I came to know that the CTC is actually 8 LPA & 2 lakhs is the joining bonus. Plus I noticed that the placements here are more about luck than hard work or intelligence. 100+ companies come on campus due to DIVERSITY HIRING. 

I am hating myself for letting numerous opportunities go just because I was scared & under-confident. I don’t even like to code. I was just there because of parental pressure & ofcourse they wanted me to “earn well”. I feel like a disappointment. 

MBA prep has been on my mind. I know I’ll be able to crack CAT. Academics is my strength. I was able to maintain a 9+ CGPA even though I was demotivated & disinterested in CS all this while. Any advice for me ?

15w5t6h,Managers are lonely. Am i thinking right?,"

Hi. 28F.
I am curious. People always say that Managers are cunning, people pleasers, manipulative blah blah blah.
Why does no one talks about the fact that how lonely managers are in most of the workplaces. They can't mingle with people like the whole team and they cant always be their authentic selves. They always have to maintain a certain stature. They even cant get away with little things. People are always watching.

Believe you me, if you do the above things, the results are bad. So it's only logical to just avoid involving with the team socially.

But it's bad and it's sad. And sometimes i feel life would have been different if i was just a normal team member. I would have alot of friends, indulge in gossip :D I'll be able to take a leave without prior approval. I would not miss out on stuff. Something feels off.

15w0z3q,Help. What should I do here?,"I am entering sophomore year in about a week and I’m searching for some direction. I have switched majors many times and have been generally trying to find out if passion or pay is more important.

I’ll discuss some considerations I’ve had and am curious on some opinions, whether you’ve been involved in it yourself or just have knowledge of it. I would love to hear some advice.

#1: Physical Therapy

If one thing is for sure, I know that I am extremely passionate about human movement and physical therapy. I truly enjoy the study of it and find myself to be pretty skilled in it.

The one thing throwing me off about it is the actual career itself. Upon one glance at the PT subreddit, you will find hundreds complaining about the absolute horror that comes with the career. Primarily regarding poor debt to income ratio, overly long schooling, and the annoyance with bad patients. 

I have known a few PTs and have never heard anything of the sort firsthand. They all seem to enjoy their job, and where I live the pay really isn’t that bad. I am passionate about it but I don’t know enough about the ins and outs of the work.

#2: Ultrasonographer.

I am really interested in this career. The schooling is pretty minimal, and it would work pretty well in my favor with my current coursework. The job itself doesn’t seem too demanding at all, and I’ve actually read a lot about it online. Am I the most passionate about it? Not necessarily, but I’m aware that all you really need is to tolerate your career. I could definitely tolerate this.

So, what’s the catch? I don’t feel the pay is quite optimal either. I might be sounding insatiable but I just care about paying off debt and making a solid living without hating my career. There aren’t too many jobs of this in my area, but some strings can defiantly be pulled to get there shortly after graduation.

Overall I’m liking this one. The scheduling looks to be variable, it can be done as a travel job, and just seems pretty solid. I would love to give this a try.

#3: Cybersecurity.

This is one that has me really divided. This one has very secure pay. A lot of cybersecurity careers seem to offer really good salaries and the work seems somewhat interesting. I’m probably least passionate about this one compared to the others, but I also know the least about this one.

It seems like a good career, but there are a few things that put me off with it. The first is staring at a screen constantly. I’m just not sure if I could handle that with already poor eyesight at a college age. Secondly is coding. I’ve read that cybersecurity workers don’t need much coding, but it doesn’t seem like something I would be great at or be too fond of. It is a secure (pun intended) living though and I respect people who can succeed in it.

To summarize, I really just need some outside perspective. I’ve been caught on this topic for too long and it’s hard to really make a choice without much real insight on these careers. Absolutely any comment would be appreciated. Thank you for reading, and let me know what you think.",Agitated_Try7031,1,1.0,1,1692504486,2023-08-20 04:08:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15w0z3q/help_what_should_i_do_here/,8,2023
15w0yco,Clearance Form,"My last working day in my school was on 18th August and my clearance form is still pending. The cordinator and mentor have still not signed yet. Even though they had called me on 19th August yesterday so that they can cross verify and give their signature. But the cordinator was absent and the mentor made me wait for 2 hours and when I was informed by the other teacher that cordinator was absent and the mentor told her that she is going to make me wait for another 2 hours and will tell me to go.

I was hurt cuz of this. Then too some how I managed let me see and try at least cross verification part was over. So on multiple requests the mentor did the cross verification and told me to take out all the things and then rearrange mean while she was finding where she could write me up for some thing that is missing and I am suppose to pay for the item. Upon that they are not providing me with the list of things that had given to me. I have stayed there for whole 5 hours (because yesterday was half day).

Now they again called me on Monday and now I am feeling anxious what will happen on Monday whether they will give me the signature or not.

15vz00b,Exit Interview Advice,"Hello everyone,
Appreciate your advice for an exit interview scheduled with the CEO tomorrow.

I’m finishing up in a role that I have been in for the past 15 months. During this time I have been working under a ‘team coordinator’ who over the past 6 months has demonstrated fairly unprofessional and insidious behaviour, such as slandering numerous former employees repeatably and repeated two-faced commentary about current employees. He has also often made sly remarks to me and other covert behaviour.

Over the past 4 weeks his behaviour became very hostile and he went from sly to more toxic behaviour such as the silent treatment but openly (and purposely) communicating with other team members. Since my resignation he has refused to acknowledge or communicate, or respond to my emails. My main question is, how much if any should I share with the CEO in my exit interview? Personally, I find his behaviour unnerving and don’t want to further set him off, but on the other hand he has been so awful that I’d maybe regret not sharing feedback. 

If I do provide feedback, how should I go about this by remaining professional?",iammisshayley1,1,1.0,1,1692498570,2023-08-20 02:29:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15vz00b/exit_interview_advice/,8,2023

15vxxvu,Colleagues turned against me,"How to deal with colleagues putting me down? They pretend to be friendly and than they pick on every little thing I do and turn against me.

I tried to help others as well so I was nice but I had also this aura of being their person who helped them.

 After some time these colleagues started kinda bullying me. Everything ive done is wrong and they enjoy bellittling me and picking everything I do, pointing to every mistake. Even stuff unrelated to work, writing me shit when we chat on insta. 

I really tried to be friends with them, even as I said i thought it would be cool and friendly. They dont invite me to stuff they do. Now they created chat without me where they message all the time. I confronted them and what they say is that they dont use it, even though I see it everyday cause I sit next to them everyday. I hear stupid jokes about me and my actions, belittling me. 

The one coworker I got the closest when I helped with family thing makes it the worst. Coworker is nice one moment and horrible the other moment. Making drama of little things I do.

15vxhjh,MBA’s field of specialisation?,"I am joining my father’s toffee manufacturing firm in now and I have next to no knowledge about how businesses are run.

15vx6k0,Having a hard time being successful in my new job,"3 months ago I started a job selling ad space for my local paper. This is my first full time job and I’ve learned a lot so far. However, I’m having a difficult time meeting expectations.

I’ve connected with almost all my accounts. For most of them, we don’t fulfill their marketing goals as our readership doesn’t contain their targeted demographic. I wish I was able to offer the correct services to fulfill their needs, but that factor is out of my hands.

The only way to succeed in this position is to build new clients, but that’s tricky since almost every business in town is taken care of by other sales reps in my office. Pretty much my only chance of finding new clients is going to neighboring towns where our readership is little to none.

Any advice on how to deal with this?",YeahEMinor,1,1.0,0,1692493311,2023-08-20 01:01:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15vx6k0/having_a_hard_time_being_successful_in_my_new_job/,8,2023
15vx6cn,Regional Center Collapse,"So I work in a regional center for my industry and other cities in my area are down a bit. My area in particular is down from 130 jobs to like 46 job openings for my particular skill. However a larger center (second tier city) has 200 or so openings. Even though it is 4X the size of the third tier turned 4th tier city, the ratios of jobs per person is a lot better in the second tier city and the second tier city has a better ratio than even the first tier cities. Also the second tier city is taking the third tier city's spot of the second largest office for one of the market leaders in the industry. Also the third tier city seems more operations oriented whereas the second tier city has more action.

15vwj44,Is it time to quit a job that’s taking advantage of me?,"After getting laid off from a cushy remote job around Christmas last year, I took a job at a small local company, where I’ve now been for 8 months. 

I am supremely unhappy there. My experience outpaces my higher ups, to the point that I am doing work above my pay grade. 

There is also one person I work with who I believe to be an imposter. Because I have experience working at bigger companies, I have an idea of what his strategy should look like. It’s been clear to me from working with him & from looking at his past experience that he has no idea what he’s doing. He has not been able to fix the company’s problems with cash flow for that reasons. I’ve also had to call him out on more than one occasion in order to get proper recognition for my contributions, for which he is more than willing to take credit.

I recently had my quarterly review. I got nothing but positive feedback, & my reviewers even apologized for the behavior of some of my superiors. But they did not offer me a raise or promotion. Instead, my direct manager has been heavily implying it’s on the way, & possibly that I’d take over this imposter’s position. 

The problem is that I don’t want to be promoted into a role with more responsibility. I think they need to fire an imposter who has given them a bad strategy & hire someone with proper experience. I don’t want to inherit the problems that existed before I started & have my job performance tied to them. I want to be given the tools I need to succeed in my current role. 

In July, I was recruited to start contracting for another cushy remote job. This new company is amazing, is cash-flow positive, & has a strategy that makes sense. Recently I asked if they’d be willing to take me on full-time. I got a soft yes, but that they’d need some time to figure it out with the agency that recruited me. Nothing is in writing yet, but they don’t have a full-time employee in my role. I have excellent relationships with everyone I work with & from everything I can tell, the company is experiencing tremendous growth. The work makes me happy. It is an excellent use of my skills, but still challenging enough that I feel I’m growing. 

Financially, I have a year’s salary in cash savings, plus a good stock portfolio. I would prefer not to use this money, as it’s meant to be an investment in my future, but it’s there in case of emergency. 

My questions are this:

1) Given that I’m anticipating a job offer soon, should I start using up my remaining PTO at my first job? I’d been banking a few days for a vacation later this year, but unused PTO won’t be paid out if I leave. I haven’t had a day offer in 6 weeks & could use one (or two or three).

2) Should I quit my full-time job even if I don’t get a full-time offer from the new company? It seems incredibly toxic & dysfunctional. At the same time, these experiences have given me confidence in my skills & my ability to continue to be employable. I’m questioning why I would remain in a position that’s taking advantage of me when I have a financial safety net. But a lot of my friends say I should be cautious & wait until I have a new offer in writing. 

Thank you in advance.",AthenaSleepsIn,1,0.6700000166893005,5,1692491519,2023-08-20 00:31:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15vwj44/is_it_time_to_quit_a_job_thats_taking_advantage/,8,2023

Applied for a “Staff Associate” role in July 2023 but didn’t hear back for 2 weeks so I connected with the company’s Talent Acquisition Consultant (TAC) on LinkedIn around the first week of August and told her that I’m a new grad with 2 years of relevant experience, I am interested in the role I applied for and want to grow in that field, etc. She surprisingly got back to me within 5 days and said she forwarded my message to the Lead Recruiter (couldn’t find company recruiters on LinkedIn to connect with.) 

I thanked her and she said I didn’t need to send another copy of my resume cause they’re able to view it on their end. A week goes by and I don’t hear anything — but the job postings for the role closed/no longer accepting applications closed on 8/15, so I sent another message to the TAC on 8/16 to reaffirm my interest and enthusiasm in the role, etc. since I didn’t hear anything back.  

I haven’t heard back. 

Now, the company posted new opportunity for the same role but as a “Senior” for those with 1-2 years of relevant experience (not much different from the other role) 

My question is— should I apply to this role too to up my chances of working there? Or do I come off REALLY desperate and unflattering to the company? I would send an updated, nicer-looking resume and cover letter.

The reason I'm considering is, I don't face enough struggle in Marine Navigation, though salary would be spectacular(I'm Georgian, they pay in dollars, so it puts me into top earners) I'm afraid, I wouldnt get enough life experience from that career and I'll be left with anything but money. 

Law, on the other hand, is a lot stressful and hard and requires me to be the best all times, I believe that's-the struggle is what is gonna make me stronger and tougher in life, though pay here isn't as much as Marine Navigator. 

I feel quite much fear going into Law, as it's hard(Plus consider, its one of the most flooded careers here and employing-wise I gotta be amazing to get employed at a nice place) and I'm not very self-assured, but I do realize and believe that facing the type of fears is the way to defeat them, otherwise theyll stay there forever until I'll be accountable enough to face them.

15vrrp5,Teaching vs accounting (UK),"

Would I be earning and saving more in the long term in the UK by accepting a career in big4 audit instead of working as a teacher?

As a teacher I would be making £28,000 and I have minimal travel and living costs because I live close by to my school and love with my parents. I would expect to be making £38,819 in 5 years. Also, I would have a good pension. 

If I worked in the private sector I would need to be earning about £60,000 to take account for rent, living costs, savings, and pension to to get an equivalent that I would be earning as a teacher in my local city - because I would be moving out of my house to live in a new city which will be no where near my home town. However, I would be starting at a considerably lower salary and only start seeing that benefit 5 years into this field. 

Working hours seem to be similarly grim for both professions. I think what attracts me to audit, and at a big4, are the exit opportunities and potential of earning £60,000+ (in mid career) whereas I would cap out earlier as a teacher. And considering my situation it does seem to workout out that I would be better off staying in the teaching profession?

So, what would I be better off doing if I wanted to live a middle class lifestyle. Perhaps I missed something?",GDZK,1,1.0,0,1692479399,2023-08-19 21:09:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15vrrp5/teaching_vs_accounting_uk/,8,2023
15vriy9,I am pondering a job offer in a different industry - Is money everything?,"This is my first post in the sub. I usually just lurk or occasionally comment on reddit, but this is my main and only account. If my current or possible future employer sees this, I would be shocked but weirdly ok with it. 

I am part way through typing this up and now realize this is going to be very long - sorry! I will put ""\*\*\*"" where I boil it down to the basics. I marked my concerns with ""**(!)**"".

I am an IT Department manager in Michigan, USA at an automotive manufacturing company with 4 locations - 3 are in my state no more than an hour away (2 are \~30 mins, 1 is 60), and the 4th is in Mexico. I have been to Mexico for work twice in my 12+ years here and we have a pretty good sub-contractor to take care of most IT in Mexico.

Overall, I like my current job. I am maxed out on vacation/sick time at 4 Weeks PTO and 3 ""personal"" days, so basically a month worth of time off. I have never been denied a vacation request, I can work from home as needed, and I report directly to the President/CEO/Owner - so I don't have any of the multi-boss horror stories I read a lot about on reddit. 

My job can get busy or stressful at times - just like any job, projects and the unexpected can happen but usually my days are 8-5 with an hour lunch and weekends are rare when things are running smoothly. For this I get $65K/year, a matching 401K, company cell phone, and gas milage for travelling to the ""far"" location or between plants. The insurance offered is expensive and not great, but my wife is a state employee with much better insurance that cost less than half. Another little bonus/perk; for NOT using insurance at my work, I get $100 every month - a nice little $1200 ""bonus"".

I have ""shopped around"" the job market in the past, but for the last couple years I have been mostly happy. I know the pay I am getting currently is below market value for my title and experience, but things are really humming along right now nicely. I do plan on asking for a raise a little later this year, so I will likely see a $5-10K raise for 2024. My bonus has steadily increased over the years and in 2022 I got $4200. 

This is all to say, I have not been ""looking"" for a new job, and hadn't even updated my resume in a long time. I am comfortable with the job, know what needs improving in the long and short-term, and have become a key element in the company's success. I am trusted and know where some ""bodies are buried"". I know how ownership measures an employees worth, and have been able to ride the line well - keeping a good work/life balance.

Last week, a buddy of mine reached out to let me know that he wanted to recommend me for a job at the place he works. Apparently, they want an experienced ""IT Leader"" to reset the IT department **(!)** and fix the relationship between IT and the other departments **(!)**. They are looking to fill it fast **(!)** and I had an interview set for Monday after talking to their HR on Friday. I had nothing to lose so I told them I would expect $85-95K to jump, with similar benefits - but would still need to think about it. They must have liked me because they called with an offer on Thursday of $80K **(!)**, with a *possible* 5% annual bonus **(!)**. Details and the official job offer won't come to Monday due to their HR director being on vacation **(!)**.  My buddy as well as the interviewers told me, ""It isn't your typical 9-5"" **(!)** and the company was started and continues to be owned/run by a single family and a couple close friends **(!)**. The only perk described to me by my buddy that I don't currently have is a vague ""profit sharing"" in a bulleted list. I will be replying to the job offer with questions about anything not covered in the offer, and probably countering on the salary - IF I do decide to move forward.

Loyalty isn't the right word to use with my current boss and our relationship - respect is probably better as I know he has a company to run, but he hasn't made any overt decisions that I disagreed with on a moral-level. I would feel a little bit bad leaving with 2 weeks or less notice because I know there would be some issues for everyone, but it isn't what is stopping me from jumping immediately. I know I wouldn't get a 2-week notice if they wanted to replace me or go with an IT service. 

The company I interviewed with is growing pretty quickly and is more of a multi-faceted company that is NOT a automotive manufacturing operation. Sorry to be vague here, but they have major nation-wide distribution of a product made on-site and at other locations out of state, with on-site retail, several restaurants, and family-friendly events in the warmer months. They get really busy in the fall with events and are ""dead"" in the winter months. They have 4 locations in the state - each between 45-90 minute commutes, the longer ones could turn into 2+ hours with any construction or accidents. 

\*\*\*To try and stop this from becoming too much longer, I will try to sum up a little bit starting here\*\*\*

 I was a little put off by the offer being lower than my stated range since they ""loved our interview"" and ""need someone quick"". Even though the offer is currently $15K more than my current pay, it just feels a little icky. I have been getting more stressed about driving lately, so I am not looking forward to more drive time. The hours will almost certainly be much higher; especially the first 6+ months since I am ""resetting the department"", which will include doing a full review and audit of everything IT at all locations, AND dealing with their Fall busy season real soon. I will be very involved in hiring a team and will have to likely ""sell"" my new employers on any major changes I will want to make. My free-time will change dramatically and really don't know if at 46 y/o I want to try to become a ""work is life"" guy, I am more of a ""I work because I like to eat with a roof over my head"" guy, and would prefer to not have to work at all.

I have talked to other friends and family, and most think I should take the job. They say a change like this could be really good for me, and I get that - it COULD be great. When thinking about the possibility of changing jobs, anxiety and a little bit of ""imposter syndrome"" hits. All I can think about is, ""If I fail I will not only be jobless, I will also disappoint my family, and my friend that recommended me will never talk to me again."" The money would certainly be nice, but is it worth the extra workload that will be required? If I don't take it, will people see me as a wimp - not willing to take a chance to better my career or my family's situation? 

This is already too long but there are a few more details. 

I currently manage a department of 2 (me +1 tech) for our 4 locations, but did have 2 techs for a short time. My ""Lead tech"" has grown with me and the department, coming to us straight out of university, and could handle my job. I might be able to poach him in a few months if I took the new job and I know he is looking for a change (mainly more money). This might ease some of my concerns being at a new company if he was to join me, but it also adds to the pressure as we have become friends over the years. 

I talked to another friend whose wife works at this place. He said that his wife loves most of her job, but... 

\- The place is an unorganized mess, but seems to be slowly getting better as ownership is defining roles better. I get a, ""too many chiefs"" kind of vibe.

\- No one received a bonus last year, they believe it was because they spent too much on expansion.

\- Vacations aren't technically frowned upon, but vacations are kind of frowned upon if they aren't during the dead season.

I really don't know what the point of this post is - maybe venting or part of my process. I will value any legit opinions and will try to answer any additional questions. Has anyone had a similar story - either taking or not taking the risk when ""comfortable"" at a current job?

15vrg6w,Is it worth it to apply for a position I'm severely under-qualified for?,"I'm probably over-thinking the situation, and could use some grounding/a reality check.

I'll try to keep this short, but I'm terrible at summarizing. 

I have 2 direct supervisors because my position is a hybrid of 2 roles. One of my supervisors has put in her notice. Her position typically requires a bachelor's in accounting, and I have zero formal education or training in that area. I used to be a tax-preparer, and I do some specific mid-level accounting in my current role (which I had to kind of learn on the fly). I don't have a college degree of any kind. 

Multiple people have suggested that I throw my hat in the ring for her position. I am 100% sure that I'm not at all qualified to do that, but no one else seems to agree with me. 

I'm torn on whether to apply, suggest an alternative, or just stick to my current role. 

Additional context/factors:

1. I was actually already planning to talk to my bosses and the owner about my schedule, because I've been thinking about getting a second job. My current schedule doesn't allow for that. 

2. I was given a $1.50/hr raise less than 3 months ago

3. There's no real risk of losing my job. My supervisor who is not leaving has already made it clear to the owner that she cannot afford to lose me, and honestly, they can't afford to lose *her*. She does the work of at least 3 people and brought about 3/4 of her staff over from her previous job. If she left, half the building would follow her. She's already upset that my other boss is leaving, especially as she and her predecessor each made it less than a year (not typical at our company).

I feel like it's a bad look to say ""I could do that"" knowing very well that I do not have any of the qualifications necessary. 

Would love some outside perspectives.",emalyne88,7,0.8999999761581421,30,1692478668,2023-08-19 20:57:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15vrg6w/is_it_worth_it_to_apply_for_a_position_im/,8,2023
15vr0pn,Need advice on job perk dilemma,"Hi! After months I've finally got a stable job! (yay). I've signed a contract and start in 2 weeks :) one of the company's perks is that they buy you a laptop when you're hired, I work remotely and customs in my country are complicated so they prefer for me to buy the laptop, and they'll refund me which is completely fine. The thing is I just bought the same exact laptop for my past job and personal use (with my own money) and I really don't want to have 2, seems unecessary and excessive.   
I still want the perk though... would it be wise to ask if maybe they could give me that perk as a monetary hiring bonus or something along the lines of refund for the depreciation of my personal laptop for work?   
I definitely don't want to sound as if I want to take advantage or anything! Just trying to find something that works so that I don't lose the bonus and don't have to have 2 laptops.

15vqxxo,Supervisor threatened me with false accusations,"You read that right. My supervisor threatened  me with false accusations for using the restroom  during ""restricted hours"". They close off the bathrooms because people use them to hang out. I have no idea what that has to do with me but here we are. 

I waited my turn to go.  It's closed off by the barricades but I'm about to literally pee myself because the person who went before me took a long time. I go through the barricades. No one is in the restroom  cleaning it. As I get out my stall to wash my hands, my supervisor confronts me. Which I expected.  He tells me that I shouldn't  be in the bathroom.  I tell him I'm about to pee myself. He says that's no excuse.  I ask him what am I supposed to do then? He says talk to the custodians because they have a radio and they'll contact me. I say ""Okay well now I know what to do."" For some outlandish reason he thought it was okay to say ""These are women who work with the restroom. They can easily file a sexual harrasment charge. Easy! It's really easy."" Like he was excited. I hold my composure and say ""Alright.""
Really, inside I was seething. I've rarely felt so angry in my life. 

Unfortunately this was not documented. I have no doubt in my mind that this was illegal but it was vocal with no witnesses.

I called out on Thursday as this was the first day I was beginning the meds and I felt even worse on that day and knew i couldn’t work. However, that is the only day that I have called out from this job and I’ve been with them for about two months now and they seem to like me as i try to always stay longer and help cover. i’m on 6-7 day work weeks. I just am wondering what you guys think i should do, here’s my dilemma: i’m in a lot of pain today again and could use another day realistically to rest while these antibiotics start to work, but i’m clearly very reluctant to call out and am the kind of person who will always go into work no matter what i’m feeling. I just feel stuck as I don’t want my reliability to be questioned, but what I’m going through is genuine and not an excuse in any way. it’s just a very painful experience, especially with my tooth being abscessed. definitely one of the top ten worst pains i’ve felt. let me know what you guys think. should i suck it up and keep pushing through, or just leave work early today after i arrive in a bit here and let them know i need one more day if possible? this kind of stuff isn’t my strong suit, as i tend to push myself too much or i don’t know when to push myself enough. thanks for anyone willing to read and help me out.",paradiseimagined,1,1.0,2,1692475063,2023-08-19 19:57:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15vpxd9/advice_please/,8,2023

15voq7u,How to improve relationship with manager?,"I am not sure how to continue with my current company…

Context: I was hired for a contract position by a sub-company owned by one of the giant tech companies last July. The position was supposed to be on-site, so I told them I’ll move down after I remote for three months. At the 3 months mark, we found out that the family member I was taking care of actually has cancer and he might only have 6 months to live.  So I asked my manager if I could stay through end of 2022, which obviously she was not happy about. I tried to make it up by putting extra effort into work and even paid a whole business trip down to Silicon Valley just so I can meet the team in person.

Early 2023, my manager decided to turn me into a remote part-time contract due to the layoffs within the company. While I was grateful to still have a job, my manager didn’t forget to tell me that once she has the resources to hire a full time permanent senior person, “it will be unfortunate I will still be here”…

Fast forward couple months, she asked me to pay myself down for a second business trip. This time I asked if the company could pay for part of the expense as I was a part time. She said no and told me how other FT people are paying themselves to come into the office. I politely declined her request. To this day, she’s still saying I should come visit the office(on my own dime).

Today she decided to give me feedback on how she thinks I am being apprehensive on showing underdeveloped ideas to her and receiving feedback in general. I told her 1) I don’t want to waste her time with immatured ideas 2) I need some autonomy while working (3. You never know what’s the reaction is so usually it’s better to show when the idea is more baked), and then she went on telling me the company culture is all about being collaborative and that I need to be more open to other people ideas. But then we immediately went into a brainstorming session where she shot down all the ideas I suggested and put forward ideas she thought of. 

I am really not sure how to continue with this team. I feel like because we had a bad start, she has always found me untrustworthy, even though I have been producing consistent good work for over a year now. I generally like her as a person, and found a lot of good things about her as a manager(eg. she is clear on what she wants). But I never feel safe enough to even gently suggest feedback for her. I have 10 years of experience in my field, and sometimes I feel like I am diminished as a junior. 

Not sure how I can improve our relationship? Is it beyond repair just because we had bad start? Should I just look for other job(despite this horrible job market)?",Taai_ee,1,1.0,0,1692472215,2023-08-19 19:10:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15voq7u/how_to_improve_relationship_with_manager/,8,2023

15vo70y,Big tech/regular tech companies apprenticeships,"hey guys, i want to apply to apprenticeships but i'm confused on the timing of everything... I have some questions that I'd appreciate so much if anyone can answer any of these!

1. do apprenticeship applications open at a certain time like maybe fall or spring? and do they last a year typically? or can they go shorter than that?

2. if i wanted to apply to an apprenticeship, as of now (august 19th, 2023) is it too late to apply for most companies? or are there still some apps that will open up in the fall?

3. i'm interested in breaking into the ui/ux/product design fields as someone with a graphic design background; what qualifications/skills do these companies prefer applicants have? because i know the ""open to all"" attitude these companies advertise isn't exactly true. 

4. do buzz words from the description of the listing/position help your resume pass the initial screening for these kinds of big apprenticeships? what do you think helped you pass the initial resume screening from your own experience?

5. if you pass the initial resume screening, do regular/big tech companies require an assessment or test of some sort to figure out if you have any prerequisite skills for the program you're applying for? bc i feel like i'm a huge beginner in the ui/ux field...

6. last question: what are the interviews like for these kinds of apprenticeships? is it one-on-one or with multiple interviewers at once? and what do they typically ask you in these interviews? i'd really love to know!!!

i'd seriously appreciate any information or answers to my questions about these apprenticeships!! thank you so much :)",jayzhooves,1,1.0,0,1692471008,2023-08-19 18:50:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15vo70y/big_techregular_tech_companies_apprenticeships/,8,2023
15vnjeo,Age 29 Having severe anxiety after 3 jobs in the past year did not pan out.,"I'll do my best to keep this short, i'm 29, i have a very unstable work history of mostly part time work and school in the last 5 years. But i feel unable to list my past 3 jobs as experience on a resume due to issues in the workplace with both myself and the companies (mostly the companies) that led to these not working out. I was going to school for the Arts and I'm now thinking of going back for either Graphic design or a healthcare related job such as Xray tech or 

The first job fired me for a completely BS reason, i answered a phone call while in the bathroom hoping to find employment elsewhere, someone overheard and told management i was looking for a new job and i was out the door the next day, the next job i got into a verbal altercation with another coworker who was personally insulting me and i cussed him out and resigned. This most recent job, has been a completely hostile work environment in which I've had to go to HR for various reasons to create a paper trail of incidents that happened to try and prove unfair retaliation against me and a hostile work environment. I even reported my boss for inappropriate sexual comments against women and customers. I felt almost guilty and wrong for doing it but if he's going to hold me accountable for my mistakes, i believe he should be too. He also showed my a violent video of being shot and killed while on the clock.

 I have been punished for things other coworkers do all the time. They're trying to push me out the door despite doing my job to the best of my ability every single day. So i documented and kept evidence of all my work and everything inappropriate things my boss and coworkers did and sent it all in to HR. They're going to conduct an investigation, and i think if i can prove hostile work environment i will have more protection as an employee. The problem is i'm not sure i conducted myself 100% perfect the entire time i was there either. I was trying to fit into the culture and i did have a verbal argument with coworkers once before too because i was being harassed. All of this has lead to my development of an anxiety disorder of which I just got diagnosed with. I have been having panic attacks daily feeling unable to cope with the stress of re entering the workforce. I have been working outside in 100 degree heatwave for 8 hours a day and the thought of going back there makes my skin crawl. I have so many regrets about work and how things have been going, i need things to turn around.

I'm ready for a change, i'm ready to turn my life around, I want to stop working these dead end jobs with tyrants running things. I learned a lot from these last 3 jobs though, about how every single thing you do on the clock has to be squeaky clean and that you should document everything you do for evidence of good behavior and document all red flags immediately. Not until you've been punished because then they might try to claim retaliation as well.

 just got a new apartment (which luckily i got for very cheap) and i'm desperate to keep it. I also recently got married and i'm terrified of failing, i'm supporting my wife while she gets her master's degree by the end of next year so all of this pressure is on me to find a job. I only need to make like 19-20 an hour, but i'm feeling tired and burnt out. Physical labor combined with work stress has worn me down. 

My counselor recommended I look into patient access jobs, like healthcare administration.. It would be a desk job and the hours are flexible and maybe allow me to go back to school, But i'm not sure i have a good enough employment background to get it. I have some customer service experience but that was years ago. and the last 3 jobs i did this year i cannot list on a resume. I had a few more jobs in the past that didn't pan out, my long term jobs were, one warehouse job, and one retail job. I spent a lot of time in school collecting grant money.. I want to go back but even that i'm unsure about what to choose. What if i hate healthcare as well? I can handle mean customers but when my team and coworkers are hostile it's very difficult to succeed. I just wanna be good at something and feel accepted and apart of a team. Should i even tell future employers about this hostile work environment experience or should i try to hide it?",Slow_Froyo9760,5,0.7300000190734863,6,1692469469,2023-08-19 18:24:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15vnjeo/age_29_having_severe_anxiety_after_3_jobs_in_the/,8,2023

TIA","Hi I just wanted to ask some advice as it was bugging me for months now. I’ve been doing what i’m doing for about 10+ years. I started on my current company 2.5 years ago and about 1.5 years ago I was asked by my superior (manager) if i can handle a managerial task on my department . I agreed. So for the past 12 months, i was working on everything I can to improve on my department; setting standards, organizing task, making sure that everything is in order, checking alternatives so our company can save money etc. basically I’m doing a manager/lead job. So one year past, I improve some if not a lot on our department. My colleague/superior even told me that there’s much more direction on our team since I oversee it. 

5 months ago, we have our performance review. our director had a meeting with me and give my review on my performance. It was great, i have good feedback from my superior and peers. no problem. she told me she appreciate all my effort. They gave me a decent raise (within the inflation) and bonus. However, when I asked what my current position is, (not sure what it is. since they didn’t give me a formal promotion when it was first discussed) she told me she can’t give me a promotion because although i’m doing a lot of managerial stuff, I’m still doing same task as my peers (same as my previous position). She just told me she appreciate that I step up for the task.

TBH, i’m demotivated for the past few months and I wanted to start looking for a new job but i’m still hesitant. In fairness to my current company I’m well compensated and there’s not much toxicity in the office. However, I don’t want to stay in a company that i feel unappreciated.

15vkody,Negotiating a MIN/MID/MAX Step City Gov Salary Range,"I'm deep down the rabbit hole on government pay, benefits, and offer negotiations :) This particular thread was super helpful and informative: [https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/138xawd/new\_job\_for\_80k\_and\_government\_benefits\_vs/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/138xawd/new_job_for_80k_and_government_benefits_vs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

  
I'm in the midst of negotiating for a role with a non-traditional step range. There are three steps: a MIN, a MID, and a MAX.  
MIN: $85k  
MID: $95k  
MAX: $105k  
Before receiving an offer, my HR contact informed me that the ""policy is to offer the minimum range, but you can negotiate based on qualifications.""  
Lo and behold, I received an offer at the MIN step. I tentatively accepted the position but countered with a proposal at the MAX step. I provided a detailed explanation showcasing how my qualifications exceed those expected for the role (which they indeed do).  
The hiring manager came back with an offer of $92k. While it's a decent increase, it's still below the MID step. I hadn't expected my proposal to be accepted outright, but I genuinely believe their offer is too low, especially when evaluating the job's requirements against my qualifications and experience. I don't want to accept less than I believe I'm worth, as I've seen how employees can get stuck in the ""step"" system, with future pay increases tied to those steps. You'll never reach the MAX step unless you start very close to it, as the MAX continuously becomes more elusive (as the steps increase each year).  
I'm contemplating my next move. They didn't mention their counteroffer is final, so I'm inclined to counter again. But I'm curious if anyone can offer insight into how much flexibility there might be.  
Can they provide the MAX if I remain insistent, the position is hard to fill, or my current role offers comparable pay? I assume the hiring manager's goals might include minimizing salaries during negotiations, but could there be budgetary constraints for this role, even if the union-contracted MAX amount is $105k? Should I come back with a counter in the middle at $98.5k? Or $100k?  
Additionally, in my counter, I requested extra PTO, referring to a clause in the union bargaining agreement. However, their response denied that request, offering only the baseline minimum PTO.

15vknya,Should I Just Leave?,"I work at a consulting company that is an at-will employer. I told my manager on Wed, August 9th that I was resigning. He wanted to discuss again on Friday when he had more time to talk because he said I told him unexpectedly. On Friday, I reiterated my reasoning and said I am still resigning. He said he understands and would contact HR and let me know. On Monday, he told me there is a company form I need to fill out to resign properly and requested I fill it out on Friday, August 18th so that my two weeks end on the last day of the month. He said if I can't, i can fill it out that day but told me if I resign earlier than Friday, the account will lose billing and other financials with the client. The thing is, I have another job lined up that starts next week the 21st. I told him I can try to help as much as I can but I have other obligations next week.

Hes been out of office all week but called me after I sent an email where I mention the dates of our communications, where according to him it makes him sound like hes stalling me from leaving 😏. He said it's policy to do two weeks and it's in my contract. I said No, the handbook says the company would appreciate two weeks notice but it's not mandatory. It's also at-will. No reason needed.

15vkf2d,Career for company culture change?,"I have worked for two companies where they have done things to reinvent the culture of the company. For example, at the first company we did focus groups on coming up with the brand mission and values statement and also to talk about ways we could improve and problems and we were encountering. I was chosen as an ambassador for the culture. I found the whole thing very inspiring, interesting, worthwhile, and productive.

At my current company, I don’t think they have a very good culture. The CEO and most management leads through fear. They send out a quarterly email about all the people who got fired that quarter and why (no names just titles). They fired my coworker and a couple hours later held a meeting telling us why and threatening us basically that if we don’t respond to customers or enter their orders within a certain timeframe we’re fired.

The director of my department I feel is very sweet and a great leader. She had us last week read a book in groups on our lunch about providing great customer service. She came up to my desk yesterday to ask me how I was and chat a bit. She seems very caring. A lot of my coworkers seem to be annoyed at the trainings and reading the book, but I’m loving it. I don’t like that it’s taking away from work time, as we’ve all gotten behind our already unreasonable workload, but I think it’s worthwhile. The director talks about changing the culture. 

Other managers aren’t so great. My one supervisor regularly humiliates and reprimands others in front of everyone and is very condescending. I was already looking for another job, but I appreciate my director, and her effort to improve the department makes me feel better. 

TLDR: Anyways, I’m wondering what kind of jobs would work with creating company culture change, maybe consulting?",RealAd1811,1,1.0,1,1692461857,2023-08-19 16:17:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15vkf2d/career_for_company_culture_change/,8,2023
15vjnpx,Regret Declining job - Company Ghosting Me,"I got contacted on LinkedIn for a job and within a couple weeks I had an offer. I was saying the whole time that I was happy with my current job, but I’m always open to hearing about new opportunities. 

They offered, I declined. The recruiter seemed angry and said I wasted their time. I didn’t know what to say. I tried to be polite and explain that it was a difficult decision that I really needed all the info to make, and I didn’t know until that moment that I would decline, but my wife who was standing next to me said I sounded arrogant. 

A week later my company put me on a project that requires me to be on-site a lot. I live three hours away from the office. Additionally, the tasking of the other job sounded more interesting, it was just a matter of pay. It was equal, but why would I leave a job i’m happy at for equal pay?

I emailed saying things have changed and I’m interested in the job now, if they’d still have me. No answer after a couple days, so I called. The recruiter answered and said the position was filled but they’d call if another became available. 

I got the sense that this recruiter was being spiteful and not relaying the message to the hiring managers, so I emailed one of the hiring managers that interviewed me (we used to work at the same a company). He didn’t know I was interested again. He said the position was still open and I was their favorite to fill it. Not only that, but they’re looking for multiple people to fill it. He said he’d look into why it’s being held up. 

Am I I really going to be held from a job because of one interaction? I realize my tone might have been rude but I didn’t go as far as saying anything as rude as what the recruiter said to me.

Hello everyone,

I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out for some advice as I'm considering a career change after working in a call center for 7 years. I'm interested in moving into the field of cybersecurity and could really use some insights.

15vhm7y,Law/finance/psychology? Help!,"Hi all! 

So I’m 34 years old, with 3 children. My youngest is 9 months old. I’m ready to return to the workforce but I’m unsure of what move to make.

I have a 2:1 law degree from London I gained back in 2010. I also completed the legal practice course (postgraduate diploma) from BPP law school in London in 2011. However, that was as far as I went with my legal career pursuit. I didn’t secure a training contract with a law firm but instead ended up working in finance for PwC doing legal compliance and risk management.

I then worked for Merrill Lynch doing more financial support type work , none of which has been fulfilling for me.

Back in law school I volunteered with a family and employment law firm which I absolutely loved. I enjoyed helping people and I loved the rush and fast paced nature of it all.

All in all, I really just want to feel like I’m helping people (preferably the underdogs) 

I’ve considered doing:

- a  masters in psychology to become a counselor
- a masters in social work 
- a paralegal certification  
- going to law school to get my Juris Doctor

I will add that all of those options besides paralegal certification are too expensive for me now considering I have 3 children. Unless somehow I could get a scholarship which may be unlikely since my husband makes close to $100k. However, I haven’t looked into it.

Any advice?

I’m really looking for something that will give me purpose, but won’t cost too much to pursue and isn’t with a glass ceiling. Also, the more mom friendly the better i suppose … opportunities to work remotely if the littles are sick?

I have asked similar questions in the past so I really apologize for the repetition of my posts but I'm really panicking right now and don't know who else to ask.

I chose UIUC CompE over UofWaterloo and UofToronto ECE and now I'm gonna end paying an extra 100k in tution and would also have to forfeit my residency status in Canada after a few years for being out of country for too long.

At first, it seemed like UIUC Engineering was worth the extra hassle coz of how well reputed it was in CS related programs. However, now I'm not sure if I made the right move and that's been giving me immense anxiety ever since. Idk what to do....

My main thought process behind making this decision was that my long-term goal has always been to work and settle in the USA and I thought the best way to do that would be by graduating from a top-tier US university. If I had gone to a Canadian school, it'd be harder and also would take longer for me to make a move to the States. Besides, people say that UIUC is one of the best engineering schools in the US so I thought it'd be unwise to turn down such an offer (most people regard UIUC CS/Engineering close to the level of the ivy league).

Also, If I had gone for a Canadian University, I would probably have to attend Grad School in the States to increase my chances and close the gap.

My parents said that they don't really mind the financial part of it as they can afford the tuition without any loans or debt but it'd still be a slight stretch for them. Also, they're not too sure about me losing my Canadian residency as we are unsure of how long we're gonna end up staying in Canada. So we don't know what impact would losing my residency status have in the future. I think it'd really come in handy if things don't work out with H1B but besides that idk what its really worth...


I still can attend the Canadian universities if I want to. Should I just rescind my UIUC offer or is it actually worth the extra effort? Please can anyone advise me?

The corrections job would be my backup plan in case I didn't get the police job. The problem is that I've already accepted a conditional offer from the corrections job and am almost through with the process. If I get an actual offer, the academy would start before I would be finished with the application process for police officer. The academy would last for five weeks, and I wouldn't be able to get any time off to do the rest of the testing for the police department, unless I could do everything on the weekends, which would probably fall within those five weeks. I would just decline the corrections position, but then I would have no job if I didn't make it into the police academy.

15vdt74,"I got a job at my dream company, but now I have NO work life balance.","I began working at what I thought was my dream company about six months ago. Prior to this, I was working in the government sector doing related work in the industry. I love what I did prior to this job, but I left because I kept getting more work on my plate and when I asked for a raise and reclassification, they essentially strung me along for a year and never followed through, so I sought work elsewhere. Additionally, I was paid lower than my team’s lowest performer. Unfortunately, this is pretty typical of government work. 

I felt that I really lucked out when a recruiter contacted me for this company, the catch was that this was a contract to hire job. So there was no guarantee I would be converted to FTE, but I took the chance because it was a lot more money and I believe in my abilities. 

Fast forward; there’s an opportunity within my company that I’m willing to relocate for, so I get converted to FTE. At the same time, the project I’m managing ramps up and the software team that built the project leaves me on my own. I provide support for the software, but I’m left with something very buggy and in some ways not complete. 

So now, my workload is insane. I’m working on site 5 days per week, minimum 50 hours. I struggle to get support on issues that I cannot fix on my own (engineering fixes, bug fixes), and I’m training users and ingesting foot traffic while trying to put out fires. Even on weekends I still need to sign in remotely to not be drowning in my work.

Yesterday, I had requested 3 hours of PTO for an appointment, which I was granted. During this time, I began getting paged for incidents. My support is for emergency services, so urgent support tickets cannot typically wait over the weekend. At this point it dawns on me that without overtly telling me I’ll be supporting the department 24/7, this appears to be the expectation. Despite being out of office, all of my notifications saying so, no one steps in to help without me telling them hours later that I’m incapacitated and received an angry email regarding the support request. 

My body has taken such a toll in this brief time from all of the stress. I’m struggling to see if I have made the right choice and I’m really scared to relocate if this was not a good move for me. Part of my wants to stick it out and see, but the longer I do this, the closer we get to a deadline of having to pack and move states, this should happen early next year. 

I worry about talking to my boss about work life balance as someone new at this company, also knowing that she is a workaholic type. Faults and all, my precious job, I clicked my 40 hours, I worked 4x 10’s and my time off was always respected. Now, I don’t know what personal time is anymore. Is this what the private sector is like? I’m not sure what I should do. I hate the idea of quitting and not even having a whole year under my belt, I hate the idea of my dream company not being my dream company, I hate the idea of telling another company why I’m considering leaving a job I’ve only spent 6 months at in interviews. But I also feel physically and emotionally depleted.

15v8rtx,Help! How do I choose between 2 job offers?,"Help! How do I choose between 2 job offers?

Hi! I received two job offers today and I'm in a dilemma. 

I an burntout in my current line of work and its showing in my inability of keeping up with the job fully. Im a seasoned employee but I feel like over the last 2 years I've felt so much stress and its been weighing down on me. I started to apply to jobs over the contact fear of losing my job. This job is high workload, stress and wfh/office and out and about for meetings. 

Here's the good news, I've received 2 job offers but I am struggling picking the best one for my current situation. I am currently not struggling financially but I do want to earn more ultimately. 

Job A is something in a totally different field that would be very fulfilling and it feels exciting! Downside, It's a commute ( 1 hr each way due to traffic) and pay is slightly more than I make now. Raises happen yearly on this position and it is 4-7% based on performance. 

Job 2 is a wfh position doing similarly to what I was doing before for another organization. It's still going to be fulfilling and  it's  a significant pay increase ($4- $7 more per hour than im making now)  but my worry is that my burntout will continue as it is still working in the similar field. I feel like I'm so burntout mentally that the thought of being correlated or crossing paths with my old job is going to make me anxious. (Its likely this will happen). 

Do I go for a fresh new start or go for more pay? Both job offers have been offered today. 

Please provide input and things I should consider. 

Thank you!",ThrowRA7713,1,1.0,1,1692427939,2023-08-19 06:52:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15v8rtx/help_how_do_i_choose_between_2_job_offers/,8,2023
15v85x2,"Did a ~10 month apprenticeship to obtain current role. After apprenticeship, been doing role for past few years. Okay to combine these two roles into a single role or would that yield issues when verifying job during background check, etc?","Hi guys,

  
I currently have a very niche healthcare related role. This role requires a license to legally do the job and is usually obtained by having an on the job apprenticeship.

  
I currently have a very niche healthcare related role right now. This role requires a license to legally do the job and is usually obtained through an apprenticeship (where you shadow a mentor and he/she trains you for the role under their supervision).

  
I was in the apprenticeship for around 10 months until I was able to get the license (pretty much being able to do the job without mentors supervision). Been doing the role now for a few years.

  
When putting this experience on a resume, would it be okay to combine the apprenticeship (\~10 months) along with my experience doing the role w/ the license (\~few years) into a single position? The titles are the same but one would just have apprentice at the end and the other one wouldn't.

  
If I combined the two roles (start of apprenticeship to today) into a single role (would not include apprentice in title), would that yield issues when doing things like a background check when verifying job titles and start/end dates when job hunting?

15v7sq2,Wait for Navy or Take Job in Hawaii,"I hate my current job, so I started the process of joining the Navy reserves back in May (then use the security clearance to get a much better paying job, in addition to the other benefits that you get with the navy reserves). They've taken 3.5 months to do the initial part of just checking my medical background with no end in sight though, and I have no idea when they'll be finished with that. Could be next week, could be another few months or more, or who knows, maybe they'll see something they don't like and turn me down. And that's just the medical background part. (I was prior service before, and the process was super quick when I joined in 2005. From researching, it looks like they have a new process now that's made the whole thing a shitshow).


Meanwhile last week, my manager randomly offered me a job opening in Hawaii and a bit of a pay bump. Not sure how much it would be exactly, probably just a few extra hundred per month. Not huge but not nothing either, plus it's Hawaii which sounds fun and exciting, and I really have no other real prospects or job opportunities besides that and the Navy.


I said 'no' to the Hawaii job initially since I thought it would further complicate and delay things even more with the Navy reserves. Plus it'd also be really stupid and expensive to go through all the hassle of moving there just to potentially move back a few weeks or months later if/when things did move forward with the Navy.


Was re-thinking about it over the week though and how it seems like I have a ""sure thing now"" vs a ""not so sure thing later"". I'm wondering if maybe I should just do it anyway since god-only-knows how long it's going to take MEPS* to finish and what the outcome will be. At this point I feel like I'm just putting my life on hold indefinitely for these bozos.


I don't really know if I can or should tell my manager about this and see what they think. And I don't know how helpful the Navy recruiter would be on that front either since they'd probably be biased to me staying put until we hear back from MEPS, whenever that will be. After typing all this out, I'm thinking I could/should get the recruiter's take on it and see what they think since that's free. Maybe take the job and start the application process over with the reserves in Hawaii?

Any thoughts on what I should do?

15v6yoy,"I Want to Make a Career Change, Am I Crazy For Considering A Job in the Same Field?","Just a bit of backstory: I graduated from college a little over a decade ago with a history degree in hand and no idea of what I was going to do with my life. I spent a little over a year working for a subprime lender while I considered my next move, and eventually decided that I wanted a job that would allow me to sleep at night. I've always held education in high esteem--I had originally planned on teaching high school--but recognized that my talents weren't necessarily in the classroom. I decided that I wanted to go into student affairs, and enrolled in a master's program with the intention to become an academic advisor. I'm good at making plans and solving problems, and I was genuinely excited by the prospect of helping to guide young minds along their academic journey. 

As is oft the case, things didn't go according to plan. I finished my master's degree right around the time my state legislature was taking a machete to education funding, and I found myself on the job market with hundreds of experienced student affairs professionals (literally--my alma mater eliminated approximately 400 positions, including a couple hundred professional positions). At the time I was in a pretty serious relationship with a girl who did not want to leave our region, so I ended up taking whatever job I could get. After all, as my dad has always said: ""when your pockets are empty, it's a good place to put your pride."" I ended up stumbling into a role in financial aid, which I found relatively easy, but never really liked. 

Eventually the relationship ended, and I needed a change of pace. I had been working in an administrative role for a college system in my state, and wanted to get back onto a campus. I ended up moving to a new state and taking a financial aid advisor role, where I was able to grow a ton, and eventually moved to yet another state to take an assistant director position. Ultimately, in late 2021, I ended up moving back to my home town due to some illness in the family, and stepped back into a financial aid advisor role. During this time, I've grown a bit more cynical and have generally become a bit burned out. I find that I have less and less patience for my students, and the fact that so many of our students view us in an adversarial capacity has really eaten away at me over the years. That, coupled with the notoriously poor pay in this line of work (I have a master's degree and seven years of experience, and I don't even make $50k/year) have led me to the point that I'm considering a career change--possibly trying to move into human resources. At this point in my life I'm happy to trade whatever idealism I have left for a bit of financial security. 

That brings me to the point of this post. We're currently in the throes of back to school season, and I'm at my wits end. I spent my Friday evening doing some additional processing to keep us on track, and afterward decided to mindlessly browse Indeed to see if there was anything that caught my eye. For some reason I decided to take a look at that system office where I started my financial aid career, and I see that they've got a management level position open. I'm very familiar with the role, and I know that I am an excellent candidate for it. More importantly, it would allow me to work remotely three days per week, and the bottom of the salary range for that position is just shy of $10k more per year than I'm currently making. Based on what I know others in those roles are making, I'm fairly confident I could negotiate at least a $15k pay increase from what I'm currently making. So I went ahead and put in an application. 

This role would certainly alleviate some of the stress that I'm currently experiencing related to the student-facing nature of my current job. I used to joke when I worked there before that it was ""Educorp,"" because it felt more like a corporate office job than it did a student affairs role. Still, I've become thoroughly disillusioned with higher education and student affairs, and I can't help but think that this job would be a step in the wrong direction. Although there's a lot that I don't like about my current role, I do find the work incredibly easy, I get to work from home two days per week, and our office has the budget to send me to 3-4 conferences per year, which I've very much enjoyed. My current institution also has the budget to provide annual pay increases (about 5% the past two years), which isn't necessarily a given in the world of higher education. All things considered, my current institution is a pretty good place to work--I just don't enjoy the work that I'm doing. 

So I suppose the crux of my question is this: Am I crazy for even considering another job in financial aid? If I'm so frustrated with this career, is it right to take another job in it--despite the pay increase? Am I moving in the wrong direction, or should I just shut up and take the money, if offered the position? I appreciate anyone who's made it to the end of this wall of text, and appreciate any kind of thoughts or opinions you may be able to share. I'm just feeling a bit conflicted at the moment.

15uzqal,Project failed after I left the team. Will this be a reflection on me?,"I’ve been at my company for a little over 2 years now. During my second year, I led an initiative to transition from a problematic and costly platform A to a custom built and budget friendly platform B. I won’t dive into all the reasons why we decided to transition platforms, but leadership and others were very excited for it and gave their approvals to execute the plan. We were in the final year of Platform A’s contract and we timed platform B to be ready a little before the end of A’s contract.

After a year of development, I got an opportunity to work on a different product on another team within the organization. I moved to this other team about a month before platform B was set to release. When I left, everything seemed to be going according to plan and it should have been an easy hand-off to my backfill. 

However, delays and issues arose after I left, leading to upset users, business impacts, and a disgruntled leadership. (I’m still not quite sure what went wrong after I left that caused such a stir). After two months of delays and a lack of confidence from the team on when the issues will settle, the migration was abandoned and leadership ending up signing another contract with platform A. It was a desperate attempt to mitigate the impact the business was facing.  Now leadership is unsure if they want to pursue moving off platform A in the future and requested a full investigation from day 1  to understand how this happened. 

While I wasn't directly involved in the recent challenges, I can’t help but feel concerned about how something this big might impact my reputation since I was the one who initially led the project. When we began this project, leadership was thrilled and praised us at the cost we were planning to save, but in the end essentially the opposite happened and we wasted a year of work.

15uzelz,What do I do? Should I allow company to counter offer?,"I have been working at my current company for just shy of two years and it’s the best and most fulfilling position I have had. I am in a Sr. Level engineer (IT) position at a Fortune 500 company. I love my team, management and the work I do. There is one issue though… I am severely underpaid for what I do compared to the market. When I learned this January of this year (after doing some market research) I found that I am 15-20% below the market average. I gathered market info from 5 of the largest resources for payroll and brought them to my boss in my performance review (where I was rated as a top performer, highest bracket). I requested that they raise my salary 10-15% to bring me in line with the market. He agreed that I was worth that and it should be corrected and said he would speak with upper management. I then got a 2.6% annual raise in march and they said they needed to get me the rest of my raise in a market adjustment which was in June. Fast forward to June and the process has been moved to July. Fast forward to July and it’s been moved to August. Now, 2 weeks ago I was told it was submitted and I should have it the end of this month, but I haven’t received any confirmation that it has been approved. I have a job offer at another large (but much smaller than where I am now) company and it’s a 20% base salary increase with a 5% annual bonus, so much better comp. Is it worth bringing this to my management and asking if they will match the offer? Or will divulging that I have interviewed elsewhere hurt the relationship or my chances of advancement at the company? To reiterate, I am only looking elsewhere because of pay, I love every other aspect of where I am at now. 

TLDR: I really like my current company but am underpaid and have been strung along since January in talks of a raise. I received a job offer at a new company for 20%+ more, but would absolutely stay where I am now if comp was matched. Is it worth giving my company the chance to match?",jakemasta,1,1.0,1,1692400063,2023-08-18 23:07:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15uzelz/what_do_i_do_should_i_allow_company_to_counter/,8,2023
15uz73k,"Company laid me off suddenly, now wants me back for less pay","I was very suddenly laid from my job 2 days ago. Effective immediately. I worked as a data analyst/applications manager/the-only-person-knowledgeable-about-anything-computer-related for a small healthcare group. The company has relied on COVID funding since it's inception, so naturally the funding has dried up and they're downsizing. They (the CEO) took a look at my salary and decided to cut my position, immediately. I had no time to stop what I knew would inevitably happen. Backend processes and automations started crashing, and they will soon be out of compliance with local, state, and federal regulations (they don't realize this yet, and they won't until they get the notice that they're in breach of contract- which could take a few weeks). The contract they're operating under ends in a few months, so I was expecting to be laid off in a few months anyways, but not like this. 

  
I've been getting panicked texts and emails ever since saying they want to bring be back on part-time, at a substantially lower rate than I was making. No one, not even my boss, knows how to maintain a spreadsheet, let alone the other applications I implemented to keep their business running smoothly. 

From a business perspective, I don't want to take the part-time, less pay offer. It's insulting. From my personal, guilt-ridden perspective, the company provides healthcare to a vulnerable population, and my co-workers, through no fault of their own, will soon lose the ability to care for these patients.

Any advice how to navigate this? 

To note: I don't need the job right now, and was actually relieved to be laid off after working in a COVID-response capacity the past 3 and a half years. Financially, I'll be ok if I don't work for a couple months, so while the paycheck would be nice, I don't *need* it. \*acknowledging my privilege to be in such a position\*

TLDR: I was laid off 2  days ago with no notice. Things started falling apart. No one knows how to fix it, so they want me back - for less pay.

15uwkur,Not sure if I wanna take a full time job,"I (31F) just experienced getting fired from 2 corporate jobs (admin/assistant) within a span of 6 months. I didn’t do anything malicious on both jobs, but the explanation was that I just wasn’t a good fit and my skills weren’t up to their standards. That being said, my confidence was crushed. I was doing well for 8 years and then come these 2 jobs that didn’t pan out. I felt so incompetent.

Now, I know it happens. I’m someone who tries my best to move forward from the situation and grow. I found a part-time job at a premium retail brand and been doing well. I never got any negative feedback and I picked up on the job pretty quick. I get along with others pretty ok.

But of course, I need to pay the bills. My husband doesn’t have a salary high enough to sustain both of us, so I need to pitch in. My part time work isn’t on a consistent schedule so the pay varies from pay cheque to pay cheque. I started to look for full time jobs again and got lucky to get interviewed. I didn’t tell them I got fired, but I think the interviewer had a hunch. Which is why I got surprised to have been offered the position….

Now, I’m supposed to be happy. But I’m not, because I legit feel anxious and the trauma of getting let go is something I can’t shake off. Like, what if I get fired again? I don’t know how to take that. And I don’t want to let this part time job go especially that I’m doing OK…

15uwkqb,Going back to college/retraining at 40+,"Hi all,

Due to circumstances, I find myself on the lookout for a change of career.

I have spent most of my life in the advice field (citizens advice in legal matters etc) in UK.

During my time I have underwent numerous courses and worked in situ with solicitors, police and social services etc and I have a good grasp of law in both criminal and employment. My weaknesses was always with business law and but we always had someone else that could assist in this department and it rarely came up in my time.

I am considering applying to be a solicitor here in UK, and have just heard of the SQE exam route for non law degree candidates. If you pass these exams you then have to do  ' 2 yeard work experience' in a legal practice, which I presume is unpaid.

I am married with 2 young children and my partner works in a small business earning minimum wage. We have a mortgage and the usual bills associated with a young family.

My question is, has anyone taken the plunge to study and go back to college or taken an internship with similar circumstances and if so, how did you manage financially?

My goal in life is to show my children that you can do anything you put your mind to, and with that I want to leave behind something for them (as in financial security). I'm worried that as I feel I'm getting older and have such responsibilities we may not be able to manage if I decide to take the plunge.",lennyhendrix153,2,1.0,1,1692393291,2023-08-18 21:14:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15uwkqb/going_back_to_collegeretraining_at_40/,8,2023

It is not a scam, but I am starting to feel a bit freaked out about it. Its an amazing position, a contract for a well known company, well suited to my skills and career trajectory, and the interview with the hiring manager, and other teammates, went well. The recruiters had helped me prepare for the interviews and have been connected with me the whole time. They've sent me the benefits package, talked with me thoroughly on how the contract works, etc. They started asking about other interviews that I had, so I was honest and told them I had another one. When I got the offer, the recruiters were very pushy on getting me to accept, wanted an answer by the next day, and continued to confirm that I cancelled the interview with the other job. They sent me an offer ""outline"" on my request and I was supposed to get an offer letter by the end of today but now it won't come until Monday. The recruiter has mentioned multiple times another developer that contracts, that she could connect me with and I've followed up with her about it but she keeps putting it off. I've read the reviews on Glassdoor, and it seems that after the agency merged with another company, the management isn't very good and contracts got ended early.

I still have my interview with the other company on Tuesday. If that goes well and it seems that I have the job, I'm thinking about just going with that job. I know this will burn bridges, but do you think it is worth it, considering the other job is sounding strange? Also, I haven't officially signed an offer letter yet, so is it still plausible that technically I haven't accepted the offer yet?

I am a PR Manager for a small company. The customer service department is under me and the customer service supervisor is my only direct report.

I was baffled. 
Lee has an attitude pretty commonly when they don’t get their way but I never expected something like that be said. 
I spoke to and advised Lee that what she said was disrespectful and I expect her to apologize. I did this at the guidance of my manager. 
Lee explained that they didn’t think they should apologize since she meant what she said. I asked if she would speak to any of the other executives or managers that way, Lee said no. 
I reiterated that an apology is necessary. 
Lee apologized later that afternoon. 
Lee has not spoken to me since without me initiating conversation. I am in a separate part of the office, however prior to this conversation, she would come to my office multiple times a day to talk or get guidance on issues. She has slacked me but it is short and will not interact with me.

""Potential for growth in the future."" Don't know if there's actually benefits, I didn't ask, though I don't need them. Starts in 3 weeks. 

Previously I was a logistics manager, making $52k with full benefits but I've not had a real job since 2018. So while the money isn't critical (my husband makes enough for both), I feel like I'm settling. 

Plus my husband and I travel a lot, so I know this will eat into his plans. He works remote at home and likes to get away often. So far they are flexible with the 2.5 weeks I'll be out in January and some other short getaways beforehand. 

I think the only reason I accepted was because I want to get out of the house and have something of my own, even if it's simple. And it doesn't seem like I'm gonna be able to find anything remote.

I work for a large company and I've been there a little over a year. Most of my experience has been in nonprofits so the corporate world was a bit overwhelming at first, and it still is. I've struggled to find my confidence in the role and people have noticed and pointed it out to me. One colleague in particular has really seized on it though. This colleague is constantly putting me down as a ""joke."" It didn't bother me at first and I thought it was just some playful joking. But it's gotten to the point where she belittles me and my job as unimportant, brags constantly, doesn't respect my time, and implies that I'm incompetent. Then she acts like we're buddies and it's just a joke. I can be self-deprecating at times, and in retrospect, that hasn't been helpful.

A few days ago, I found out that she and another colleague joke about me whenever I'm looped in on something or in charge of a project--as if I can't handle the task. And others are aware of this.  It's not like I get bad performance reviews and my manager has been pleased with my work for the most part. Again, I struggle with confidence.

I'm a non-confrontational person for the most part. I usually just try to keep my head down, do my work, and go with the flow. I'm not as career-driven as some of the people I work with who are competitive and very much trying to climb the corporate ladder. I feel like they see that as a weakness. I know a lot of this sounds pathetic but I just don't have the energy some days to do anything about it.

I just feel really down and embarrassed about the whole thing. I'd like to find something new, and I'm trying.

I started when I was 21 and got sucked in by the very tempting salaries. At 26 I realized I was basically losing my time working with no clear objective, for stake holders I couldn't care less about and all I was getting in return for my loyalty and hard work was punishment in the form of even more work and nagging if I didn't do it right. I was slowly spiraling into depression because of this lifestyle and I decided to quit.   


2 years later after I worked my bottom on for 16 hours a day on my own business, my partners decided to claim everything and leave me in the dust and that is all I can disclose.   


Since I ended up broke, being 28 having my parents to pay my rent I HAD to turn back to corporate and I got the best possible stipulations I could, and ever since I started a new with this job I realized how mizerable I was before and happy life could be away from it.   


I want to make something of my life before I'm 30 and I am 100% sure I can make it on my own but I need finances. This corporate thing isn't for me and dealing with overcomplicated tools, pointless processes and polite dialoge is only in my way.   


I figured I should turn up here for advice. If I want to save myself from this maddness... what are the best alternatives which I can take, living in the European Union, that can make me 1.2k USD or EU a month without having to be tied to an office, a place or a corporate entity?

I have twenty plus years of management experience in fast food, retail and customer service, and I'm trying to figure out how to use that to do something else. Preferably not with the general public. I am unsure of how to present myself into other fields, and looking for advice.

15uof1y,I don’t know how to say NO to my boss.,"I don't know how to say NO when he gives me lot of work and I go into auto mode of submitting all of the documents before deadline even if I feel overloaded. 

I don't know how to say NO when urgent deliverables come and he assigns me for it and I end up feeling so much entitled as if its the most important thing to do even more than my health or my personal life. I even end up working during lunch break. 


I don't know how to say NO when I want to/plan to/ need to take leaves for personal work/mental de-stress/serious family issue on a certain week/days  AND there I am asked to  deliver some important workdone which is important from project perspective. I end up sacrifice my needs and feel guilty of asking for leave. 


Hi, I  am someone who has gotten into the corporate world  about 9 months ago and I can see myself how everyday I am getting to be thrown into this rat race and blackhole the more I am trying to withdraw myself....

I know I am  stupid  because where everybody around me  seems to be able to balance their work- life and set boundaries where needed, I am here simply feeling trapped. I can switch to some other company, but I feel that's not gonna help me unless I don't fix the root cause whereevere I will go I will end up like this. 


I don't really want to lead my life like this and I have other wishes and goals to accomplish outside of office, BUT I don't know how to say NO to  my  black and white office life and embrace the colors of my canvas.  



I know this is going to  take time not a one day process, but I really want to come out of this  otherwise I feel like I will soon die.

15uoau1,Lost dentist,"Good afternoon guys.  
  
First of all, I'm sorry because this post is going to be long, vague, but I believe that a lot of people will find themselves in a situation similar to mine.  
  
I have been a dentist for 4 years. I never had a great passion for the area and in the ignorance and innocence of my 17 years I ended up choosing this path. Over time, the lack of passion turned into despair and disgust for the profession, from nightmares to anxiety attacks in the office.  
  
A few months ago I left my job and went to Germany, where my girlfriend is from  (I’m from Portugal), because I had that chance and I wanted to try to rediscover myself. After months of a lot of mental struggle, rejected applications and poorly paid jobs, I've decided it's time to change my path and try another area.  
  
The problem? I never knew and never had the mental/emotional space to really find out what I wanted to do in life. So, at this point, what seems most sensible to me is one of two paths:  
  
1. Study something that can be useful in conjunction with dentistry, but that takes away the pressure and monotony of chair work. Basically, something that allows me to use my brain more.  
  
2. Study something far from dentistry that will allow me to soon reenter the job market (I'm putting aside master's degrees, because at this stage of my life I no longer see myself capable of studying 2 years intensively).  
  
So, what I'm asking you is if you have any knowledge of people who have made a successful career change and what areas could be interesting to explore through a postgraduate degree or even a bootcamp. Some that seem interesting to me are programming (or another area of IT), machine learning, data science or data analysis. Additionally, if you know places to study online (but not necessarily) that are reliable and of quality.  
  
At this point I'm totally focused on researching but any opinion and suggestions would be very welcome. Thanks a lot to anyone who can help!  
  
TLDR: dentist trying to change career. Postgraduate courses/ bootcamps in an area that would allow me to reenter the job market soon.",Afraid-Preference-66,1,1.0,0,1692373973,2023-08-18 15:52:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15uoau1/lost_dentist/,8,2023

I just started a new job on Monday. The weird thing is, my department put me in an office with people from a different department. They’re about two years out of college. It’s just me and these two girls. The problem is, they gossip all day long, don’t talk to me, and are giving me a very negative vibe. They talk bad about co workers and prospective hires.

15un06h,Should I Follow up with potential employer?,"Have had two great interviews for a job that I really want. At the end of the second interview (Thursday), the VP said that they would contact me for next steps which would be to come interview for a third time, but in person and added that I could also physically see where I would be working. 

A day later (Friday), I got an email from the recruiter of the company saying the VP hadn’t made any decisions yet and that she would be on vacation all next week  but her counterpart would be reaching out to me “later in the week”. The VP did mention that he had 2 to 3 other interviews for this position, but It is now Friday, one week later and I haven’t heard from them yet. 

1. Does it sound unlikely that I will be moving forward? 

2. Should I send them a follow up email inquiring about the job and the status of the next interview? 

3. If so, should I send that email today or wait till Monday as we are still technically in the “later in the week” category since it’s only Friday morning?",rakedaymon,1,1.0,3,1692371020,2023-08-18 15:03:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15un06h/should_i_follow_up_with_potential_employer/,8,2023
15umx7d,Can't pick between two job offers,"Hi everyone, I'm having trouble deciding between two different job offers and am looking for advice.

Both Roles are doing similar things, but one is in a manufacturing environment and the other is in a sales environment. My background is in manufacturing and what I do is generally rooted in that environment (although it's applicable to most things)

For reference I just turned 30 and am currently making 120k (but my current company is downsizing and tbh pretty toxic). I want to be at my next company for at least 3-5 years

Job #1(manufacturing company)

Total comp would start at 110k + 10k sign on

4 weeks of PTO + another week after 2 years

The department has a clear path for growth (everyone Ive interviewed with has grown through multiple jobs at this company and this department is used to cultivate managers and Leaders)

I'd be learning a lot in this role, but it'd be harder (my words, not theirs) 

Job #2 (sales company)

Total comp of 120k

3 weeks of PTO (wouldn't get another week for a long time)

It would require travel like 25% of the time, but otherwise It's much more flexible in terms of remote work.

Less obvious opportunities to grow.

I don't think I'd be learning nearly as much, but the job would probably be less intense.


They both seem like really interesting opportunities, and I'm probably overthinking it.
I can't decide between the PTO and the salary, or between the work environments.

Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks",KrazyKockle,1,1.0,1,1692370843,2023-08-18 15:00:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15umx7d/cant_pick_between_two_job_offers/,8,2023
15umons,Been Bullied. What to say at the meeting?,"I have been bullied by my manager since his first day as a manager; almost two years now. Finally, I had enough and snapped back at him last week. He acted shocked that I would talk back to him because he is a manager. He threatened to go to H.R. and our Director, and then he left. 

I previously tried to talk to this guy myself several times about the way he treats me. He completely dismisses it, pretends it never happened or tells me he talks to me like that because I am more senior, and he expects more from me. He won't even let me talk, he interrupts me and talks over me and tells me to stop talking because he doesn't want to hear it. 

A week before this incident we were in a big meeting with Senior Executives and Directors and one of them unloaded on my manager because he started treating this Senior Exec the same way he treated me. My manager actually comes to me, of all people, and asks if I thought he deserved that. It's like he doesn't see or care about the way he talks to others.

Anyway, after my manager stormed off, I texted my director and told him what happened. He seemed genuinely concerned and called me. I vented for about thirty minutes about everything this guy did. He told me he would reach out to H.R. on my behalf, and they would contact me. 

My director is the one who hired him as a manager. When he called me and told me this guy was going to be my Manager, I said my reviews were about to flip from awesome to bad. I sat next to this guy in the cube farm, and I heard how he treated others. My director said the guy had been getting complaints in the past about his conduct and they talked to him, and he should be fine. 

Someone from ""Employee Relations"" called me two days after the incident, and I repeated everything to her. Both she and my director asked me what I wanted to happen. I told them I would like to be moved to another Manager. They asked me what I wanted if they couldn't move me. If they couldn't do that, then the second choice was to tell my current Manager to ""knock it off. ""

So of course, they chose option two, and I am meeting with my Manager and my Director next week to ""talk it out."" My director said I didn't have to do this if I wasn't comfortable with it. I told him I didn't want to do it and that ""I thought nothing good would come of it since me and my manager are never going to be comfortable around each other again; and this guy isn't going to own his behavior.""  Then I agreed to it because my director said I should keep an open mind.  

Note that my performance at my job has been exemplary for the last eight years. And my director has watched all of it. He is the one who gave me three raises and a promotion in the same year. But he also said he knew that me and my nanager would ""butt heads."" So, I am not sure if I can count on him; it appears he is protecting his manager and not me. 

My point is, my manager isn't going to admit to any of it and I would like advice on a good strategy for this meeting. I do not want to leave the company. Except for this horrible human being, I love my job.",Balanced_burst,212,0.9300000071525574,162,1692370284,2023-08-18 14:51:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15umons/been_bullied_what_to_say_at_the_meeting/,8,2023
15ummt7,Career Change from Creative Roles?,"Hey there. I’m a 29M, currently working as a Graphic Designer. I have a Bachelor of Science with a degree in animation and a minor in graphic design who’s been doing a range of creative jobs over the past 8 years (contract motion design/animation roles, freelance animation, Jr Designer, and now mid-level designer). Throughout all of it, I’ve tried to “keep giving it a shot,” but I’m at the point where I just don’t think I’m a good fit for the job and what it entails.

I don’t have a poor work ethic, and I’m always complimented by my colleagues and peers on the work I do, but I’m just not meshing with these job roles. I think a part of it is that I’m seeking a career that is a bit more objective and overall less subjective.

Anything I google or read about pivoting a career out of graphic design/animation tends to still fall in the realm of the creative industry (ux design, producer, proj manager, etc.). 

I’m curious if anyone out there has made a career change out of graphic design/animation and it wasn’t into another creative role, but something else? Any tips/recommendations? Any career/job suggestions where some of these skills could actually be or be framed as translating to a new career?

I’m open to picking up new skills, but don’t have the means to afford an entirely new higher ed degree.

Thanks in advance!",CrspyNuggs,1,1.0,0,1692370173,2023-08-18 14:49:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15ummt7/career_change_from_creative_roles/,8,2023
15umbk9,Where to go from here?,"I guess I am just at an absolute loss of where to go with my career.

I (33m) truly have no idea what to do with my life. 
For context, bachelors degree in exercise and movement science and MS in administration. Sorry this is long but just for background info. 

I'm graduate school I ran the universities intramural program essentially alone. Annually we reached close to 5000 unique participants and at any given point I would manage 60+ staff.

Upon graduation I took a job with a city running their recreation program. The money wasn't good (33800/year) but was basically told we know we are a small city and most directors move on after 2 or 3 years. This would have been great for padding my resume and a parks director in our area can make decent money, in the 65 ish range.

6 years later I was still there in the same position. Seemingly parks and recreation must not look great to other industries. I was great at what I did and grew our program exponentially. 
I was desperate for a change though. Constantly working nights and weekends didn't settle well with my wife or myself, and I was essentially on call all the time even though I wasn't being paid for it 

I took a job with an insurance company at the the start of 2020, was moved to a supervisor after a couple months. It wasn't exactly what I thought and initially hated it but wanted to make it work. I had multiple months in the top 10 in production at my level out of 2000 ish other supervisors.

September 2020 our agency got new owners, Things got better but was still very tough. I then found out that the old agency owners who stayed on as independent agents were placed on the team of the other supervisor who came in with the new owner. I had been wondering how he had been doing so much better financially than me, only to find out it was because he was making money off of those two. When confronted new owner basically said he thought it would be weird for them to work for me after I had worked for them. This is essentially after he and multiple other corporate trainers had praised me for keeping the office together as the owner couple had been out a ton each for covid that year and I was performing multiple roles. In the end that year I made 36k without a cent of taxes taken out. My sheer volume of expenses allowed me to still get a 4k refund.

I left in December. June 2021 my wife and I decided it was time for a change. We needed a break. We moved out west to a very nice area and took menial  seasonal jobs. We got to live in the mountains, make barely enough money to live and travel a little in our off seasons.. I started as a dishwasher there, finished by being asked to be the restaurant manager, guide for multiple things and started a new fishing program.  then comes an unplanned pregnancy we didn't think could happen. 

She got a job teaching again in that very expensive town and I went back to working for the county in the parks and rec department as the fitness supervisor. Combined we were going to make close to 140k. This would be nearly twice we had ever made, the town was expensive but we were finally going to be set.

Baby comes last November a month early, spends a month in the NICU. Wife has to take a ton of unplanned time off. When her maternity leave was over we hadn't been able to find any infant childcare that we could afford (one offer of 3k a month) so I left my job after six months to stay home with a bab (she made quite a bit more than I did). I worked and served a few nights a week. Over 12 k in car repairs and some other unforseen expenses basically burned any bit of extra money we had.

A few circumstances all somehow come true and in June of this year we end up moving back ""home"" to the Midwest. She got her first choice teaching and is back at work. 

I had an zoom interview for what was pretty much my dream job. It seemed to go well but after 3 weeks of no contact I got a generic email stating that was not selected. I emailed the interviewer and recruiter saying thank you for your time, I know it's very valuable and please don't hesitate to ask if you have a role come up that you think would better fit my skills. Zero response.

I have put in well over a hundred job applications for nearly all kind of roles but the only thing recruiters will contact me for is essentially the same sales job I had back in 2020. 

I guess I just don't get it. I'm not hunting for a crazy paying career, I'm just looking to start in the 55 range, but can't even get an interview in anywhere. Going back to school to learn a trade doesn't feel like an option. I am worried that if I take another job like helping with manual labor or retail, or serving it will essentially spell the end of my hopes for a job with growth, potential, and ability to make more money in the future.

At 33 years old I have no idea where to go from here.",dnlib1,1,1.0,2,1692369444,2023-08-18 14:37:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15umbk9/where_to_go_from_here/,8,2023
15um72f,Going from store to office confusion with hours,"So my previous job was with a retail company as a Store Manager. The position was exempt, however, we tracked all our hours and I made a schedule for myself which I would have been in trouble for not keeping (i.e. leaving early, going outside of the store to run an errand etc.) 

Now I'm in the final round of interviews for an HRBP position. It'll be exempt, but I don't know if hours will be tracked... are hours generally tracked for exempt employees? I told her I have after school thinks going on with my kids at 430 two days a week, and I've got a commute over 30 minutes so I had wanted to clarify with her that this would be something I could do. Her response was sort of a, ""oh we'll figure something out, Jill comes in early everyday, maybe that could be an option"" etc. 

It sounds like she's going to be lenient, and I don't want to push it further as the risk of sounding like an ""hourly employee who doesn't understand corporate office environment"", ya know what I mean? I don't want to be judged for needing to know exact details about my hours worked.

More info: she has already stated that the job will require 25% travel to other units, and I'm aware that she does NOT want someone remote.

So would it come off wrong to ask about potentially working half days in office and the other half from my computer after dropping kids off at sports (this would only be two days a week)?

15ukti9,Is a month of employment gap bad on résumé and LinkedIn?,"Hi all,  
I was let go by my previous employer in the last week of July.   
I have got a job offer and the new employer has conveyed a joining of 5th September, but I counter-requested asking for joining in August itself. The HR said she will consider my joining on 30th August and that she was considering 5th September coz by then onboarding will be done smoothly.   
The reason for doing so is that there should be no employment gap in my CV (résumé) or LinkedIn profile.  
Are my fears reasonable? If I join on 5th September, my LinkedIn and my résumé will show a month gap in which I was not working in August.   
As it is, I need a day off on 31st August. If I join on 30th August, I will be losing a day of my granted leaves.  
I am based out of Canada and will be working in the U.S. soon.

While i lived with my parents it was so depressing for me i dont want to get into details they never hurt/hit me though, me and my mum dont talk since i was 15 i have no clue why she just started giving me small talk when i asked her something and she never starts a conversation with me unless she needs something but i talk with my dad i also have an older brother he is 14 years older then me ( my only sibling ) has a nephew but my parents still ask me to do everything like order there medications for them, they ask me to call certain people for i dont know what reason and much more it was always me for everything. Middle school was my escape i loved school i have these 2 friends that mean so much to me and i use to finish at 4pm/1pm/3pm/ depending on the day of the week and after school i just wanted to sleep but no i have chores no one told me about and then they need help with something or this or that i just want yell and say “ you also have a son why dont you go to him for help he also lives 5 mins away from you i DONT” its like they always have something for me to do. The only escape i thought i had was when my dad went to work but nope my mum doesn’t work anymore due to health conditions she tells my dad that im lazy because i went to sleep after he left for work this is why i moved out its hard for me to always be the only one keeping up so thats why i moved and there still bothering me. Part of me just wants to change my name, block them and get a new phone but part of me also tells me not to because i have a nephew that i love so much he is my world if i block my parents my brother is going to block me also and i understand that there old but i have my own life now. Ive told them to move back to there country ( Portugal ) because then you wont need help from anyone and because they also have a house and its bought and the one there currently living in is rented but they refuse. My nephew is 4 years old every time I visit he jumps up at me and kisses me he tells me that im the only one he trusts i cant see my life without him. What should i do?

The reason they love my brother so much is mostly because he is a boy they think having a boy is a blessing and when he lived with us he didnt do ANYTHING because he was a boy but i always got called to clean and tidy. They say he was an angel when he was younger and all of that but when i ask them how my childhood was like they just said that i was always crying and said a bunch of storys that i apparently did something wrong in i ask them if i have any nice story and they just say no. My dad only has my face tattooed on him and my mum has me and my brothers name tattooed with the day we where born i dont think it means anything they still treat me like the third option. My nephew then its my brother then its me since there both boys.

15ujt0o,"23 years old, soon-to-be graduate, and I just made my first career mistake","Hi there,  
  
I would love for this to be a space where you can share with me your earliest career misses and how you overcame regret and self-doubt. It would help young graduates like me, so much.  
  
As mentioned, I am graduating soon with an industrial engineering degree and I am completing my last internship before graduation in the automotive industry, before that, I received a generous offer for a mid-sized consulting firm but refused because I judged that I wanted to know more about industry before ""consulting"".  
  
\*drumroll\*  
  
Now, I'm feeling regret, I hate the automotive industry, i mainly work with seniors and the pay is very low where I live, and I think that I burned bridges with the consulting company that gave me that offer, I didn't know any better.  
  
I have a hard time just takin a leap of faith right now.  
  
I am always worried that I might not be good enough for a certain career path, and whether me choosing to spend these 6 months in an automotive manufacturer will sabotage by chances to transition to another industry. And I'm scared of making a choice only for me to regret it in the end (which I kind of experienced during college, and now, again).",Lilpup7272,2,1.0,3,1692363255,2023-08-18 12:54:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15ujt0o/23_years_old_soontobe_graduate_and_i_just_made_my/,8,2023

15u92zb,Should I take the job?,"I feel like I’m in such a dilemma and I have no clue what to do.

I have been at my current company 5 years in October. My salary is a little over $46,000. Benefits are all right (high ded plan, employer match 3% 401k, long term/short term disability, etc). The work field is  healthcare and our doctors take care of us. I’ll get 3 weeks PTO once I officially hit 5 years. I love my boss (literally we get along SO well and I look up to her so much) and my official title is supervisor. The only other management position for our department is an office manager who I also get along with great. I manage a small team, and some of my team make up some of the longest standing employees  (can be a challenging thing considering I’m 25+ years younger than them). 

A friends husband reached out to me asking if I would possibly be interested in being his assistant. He is a CMO at a drug and rehab facility company and has worked there the past 7 years. He is a very passionate work a holic, similar to myself, and we have always enjoyed talking buisness practices to one another. He has a growing family with my friend and is looking for someone he can trust and train to be his right hand in the company. Starting out would be an executive assistant and he talked of possibilities of project management, assistant CMO even, etc. The company is across multiple states and the position is entirely remote, given we live in the same city so we would probably meet a couple times a week to regroup and organize. Salary would be 50k with possibilities of discussions of bonuses, etc. I would have 2 weeks PTO and he is getting me the details on benefit information. The only thing is, he also mentioned his company/field of work not being the most stable. The company looks great on the outside I’ve always thought so I was very surprised to hear thjs. He has a generous salary (my friend has told me) and expenses really nice things on his company card. They live a very comfortable lifestyle. He said he has never missed a paycheck but the company has faced possible bankruptcy a few times but since so many millionaire investors have put into the company, it’s stayed afloat but he couldn’t onboard me without being transparent since I’m really good friends with his wife. 

I’m at a loss. I have no clue if this would be the best move for me. My job currently is stable and reliable. I do work 10-12 hour days though and come home drained. I’m also trying to go to school full time. I don’t know though if 4K ish is enough to leave what I have although some days I feel really burnt out.

15u8yhi,Career crossroads (emotion vs pay),"I helped start an agency about 7 years ago and joined as the VP of operations with 10% profit share and a written agreement if we sell I would get 10% of the sale. A self funded start up doesn’t pay, but I played a critical role in helping the agency grow from 500k annually to 4m annually. I’ve obviously gotten raises along the way but I’m about 50k under paid based on averages.

For the first few years my 10% was paying off. But as we grow I’ve had some major disagreements with my president/founder about commissions structures. So much so that I haven’t received a bonus for over 1.5 years because all our money is given to sales people. I’ve worked my ass off to make the company profitable again and will start receiving bonuses (again) this quarter.  But there are still some things that bother me about our pay structure. (I know there will always be tension between vp and president) 

Don’t get me wrong our founder has invested a lot in me. Given me mentors that were executives from fortune 100 companies and owe a lot of my growth as an executive to him.

Here is where the crossroads comes to play. I’m being actively recruited by another start up with a very large public backing. It’s over double in pay (before negotiations),  no equity or profit share, would be a major step down in title and would be board out of my mind which I view as a major opportunity to grow quickly within the new company. 

On the other hand, my current company I have a lot of emotion invested. But after having a baby and the cost of her and living etc  we recent had 75k reduction in income (daycare to dual income? It evens out). Ouch, back to living month to month. (Yes I had saving but we had to do fertility interventions that cost over 6 figures) 

So do I stick with the emotion and hope for a big payout down the line?  or take the pay now and secure a good life for my family?",mikeymo1010101,1,1.0,0,1692329464,2023-08-18 03:31:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15u8yhi/career_crossroads_emotion_vs_pay/,8,2023
15u8seh,Do you report your peer’s odd behavior to your boss?,"Looking for feedback on if I should bring up some of my observations about a peer to my manager. 

My peer and I are in leadership roles. We lead different but similar teams. I work really hard to do a good job, and over time I’ve noticed my peer seems to get away with doing the absolute bare minimum, questionably not even the minimum, for this role. 

On top of that, there are several things that stick out to me that suggest they are not attending to their job during the day, possibly even working multiple jobs. (Overemployed, we’re fully remote) This person takes a lot of PTO (unlimited), but also is OOO last minute very often (lots of sick days, WiFi isn’t working, there was a storm, etc), regularly skips meetings for unknown reasons, or will join large meetings and be off camera and not seem to actually pay attention. (Ex: ping them on a side about something that was said and they say oh I missed it I was getting coffee) They also block off their calendar with private events a lot and have multiple hours a day blocked off for lunch and childcare pick up. They also appear offline a lot, don’t seem very engaged in meetings, and take a long time to respond. 

On top of that, my peer used to be on LinkedIn but deleted their account, and when I recently witnessed an introduction between them and another person, they introduced themselves with an IC title (which they used to have, supposedly years ago, but at a different company). They quickly fixed their slip up and said oh I used to do that. 

Anyway, it bothers me so much that there’s all this odd stuff going on with my peer and I’m not sure my manager notices any of this. I’m fairly certain this person makes more money than me and puts in barely any effort.

15u4mfi,Anyone who was able to go back to a company after earlier withdrawing on their signed offer?,"SW engineer in SF tech here who was laid off very early this year. 

After a tiring grueling long search that includes tons of rejections, I received a job offer from a startup company S1 (300-500 people, around series-E). I told them I need about 10 days more as I'm waiting to hear from another company C2 (much better company).

The recruiter said offer will be pulled/withdrawn/expires in 3 days. Recruiter has sent numbers in email and said she can send Docusign if I want, but to try to stall acceptance (to avoid having to renege later) I didn't insist on Docusign yet.


It looks like it's very hard (and emotionally exhausting) to try to squeeze waiting for getting offer from C2 without signing S1. (Don't want to take risk of expiring S1 offer and not getting offer from C2 after such a long wait).

I'm fortunate receiving offer from S1 after such a long search, but it's possible C2 may offer later. Want to avoid reneging as much as possible but looks like I don't have an option. 

People have said reneging doesn't have to burn bridge, but does that mean they were able to go back to that company later, or does it only mean that the company didn't seem to too upset with them reneging.

- Anyone here who reneged on ""Signed"" offer from a startup and still was able to go back there later without any issues?

15u4lwa,Struggling to make a decision,"I feel like I am probably in the midst of a mid life crisis right now, and am having some major decision paralysis. I don’t feel confident that I know what the best choice for me is anymore. Buckle up, this is long!

Here’s some background. I had a job I really enjoyed from 2020-2022. We’ll call it Job 1. I enjoyed the job itself, but my manager was a micromanager and took credit for all of my work. I never felt like he had my back. On top of that, due to budget, they had to move me out of my office into what was basically a warehouse. Not fun. Both of these things ended up with me being pretty unhappy and I left. I switched industries and joined a tech company (Job 2) and basically immediately hated it and regretted my decision. I reached out to Job 1 and expressed interest in coming back, if they’d have me. I got the whole “we’ll keep you in mind” BS response from my former manager. I sucked it up and dealt with the tech company job. Fast forward to April and my former manager at Job 1 was fired. Another manager there, who I had worked closely with, reached out and said she’d love for me to come back! My old manager was gone, and she said I could have my office back too. Awesome! The only problem was, she didn’t have HR approval to fill the position yet. She tried to get it and HR ended up saying “not right now”. So, I persisted with Job 2 and started interviewing other places. I interviewed for months and finally this month I landed a job (Job 3) with a great title with comparable pay. It felt like it was a job I SHOULD want. Plus, it would get me out of the tech job I hated. I accepted the offer, quit Job 2 and gave myself a few weeks off in between. I’m scheduled to start Job 3 at the end of this month. 

However, I had a nagging feeling about Job 1. I really loved that job. So, I reached back out to the manager I had talked to in April to give it one final try. Well, it was good timing because she said they had just been talking about me the day prior and that they had preliminary approval to fill the role! Hooray! The problem? It will take 1-2 months to go through the HR hoops. But once they get through that, the job is mine if I want it back. 

I am now unemployed. I’m scheduled to start Job 3 that I’m not super excited about… But it’s a good job on the surface. Will I like it? I don’t know. Is it aligned with my career goals? Sort of. Meanwhile, the job I really want, and have been missing since I left (Job 1), is NOT a guarantee and is possibly 1-2 months away.

Do I start Job 3? Even though I’d potentially always regret not waiting for Job 1? If I wait for Job 1, and it doesn’t pan out, then I’m screwed and have to start my search over. Is it worth the risk? I just don’t know what to do.",cuteasduck1,2,1.0,0,1692317833,2023-08-18 00:17:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15u4lwa/struggling_to_make_a_decision/,8,2023

15u44x1,Worth leaving stable job for better pay / career growth with twins on the way?,"Having twins in 3 months! And job opportunity popping up prior.

Option 1) Stay with current job (Software Engineer with large company, 10 years experience)

Currently making around 180k all in with bonus at a stable company (with 3 months paternity). Current outlook is stagnant for career growth. Company leadership has gone downhill, but job is stable for next year or so.

Option 2) New Job (AWS solutions architect with smaller company)

I was offered a position to make around 220k + bonus. This would require initial travel to a nearby town (1 hour flight) since most of the team is located there. Quarterly travel after that. This position would require a lot of learning / push career to better place (AWS solutions architect), however the responsibility and learning curve will both be much higher.

With twins on the way, which would you chose? Thanks in advance for the replies.

15u3hwh,should i stay at a great job -but with risk of layoff- or apply for another job with uncertainty?,"Backstory: we just got done doing annual reviews about a week ago. i asked for a raise or title change since i am severely underpaid for my position and have taken on a boatload of responsibilities outside of my job description. I make 40k and work in entry level marketing. he rated me with exceeding expectations. when i mentioned the raise, he told me that he'd love to give me the raise but because the company isn't doing too well, a significant raise won't be possible and he says his hands are tied. we also had lay offs a few months ago and luckily didn't get let go, but there is another round of layoffs going on right now and he said that he was barely able to save our team from someone getting fired. that made me very uneasy to hear. we have a strong relationship, so he told me that he'd understand if i wanted to find a job elsewhere due to the pay, and that he'd even give a glowing recommendation. at one point, he even said that he could talk to friends at other companies to see if they'd need someone like me.

my fiance thinks i need to take him up on the offer to have my boss talk to his friends about job positions and that I need to start applying elsewhere. my fiance thinks that if i stay, i run the risk of getting laid off and he thinks that my boss did me a favor by unofficially warning me... i'm conflicted because i love literally everything about my job. I'm only one year into the work force (besides 3 years of prior internships) so I don't have much experience, yet I feel lucky to hav such a great work environment, boss, benefits, etc.. sad but l'm thinking I have no choice but to look for another job.

15u3bfo,How to ask for a raise while switching positions for the same company?,"Hello everyone 👋 I currently work at a hospital for an organization that oversees many different practices, with a few separate hospital buildings in the “main campus” area. Because of this, I can easily make lateral moves between the entities, which I chose to do at the beginning of the year from the adult hospital to the pediatric one. Although I do find that this position has benefited me since the one I left is sort of in shambles, which I know was impacted by me leaving my role. I don’t want to toot my own horn too much, but I was trained in the most specialty areas and had taken on a lot of responsibility. It took training six people to cover what I was doing, and if you haven’t guessed it, a lack of appreciation and poor quality of work-life ultimately lead to my departure. Long story short, I was very frustrated with supervisors and upper management, but some things have changed and a leadership position (not supervisor, nor managerial) has opened up that I’ve decided to apply to. It’s very likely I’ll be offered the position, they are very very excited to see my application (definitely a red flag regarding the condition of the department, i know), and I do believe it’s a role where I could make a positive impact on some of the more immediate issues in the team. I’m not delusional enough to think I can make a significant difference or have any influence on policy, but training other employees and changing up the dynamics of some roles could make the area I’d cover have a better experience with daily SOP. It’s essentially what I was already doing, I’d just finally get the title and pay, which honestly isn’t enough incentive for me to return. However, the right price (and different shift, I’m currently thirds and would go to first) could certainly convince me. 

Because I already am well acquainted with the supervisors interviewing me, I’m afraid they might try keeping it casual and skirting over anything regarding wages in the interview. Since it’s usually a standard/set raise just added onto one’s current wage (this position is typically only hired internally), it makes sense they might assume it will go down that way no questions asked. I figured it’s better to bring that up at the interview instead of waiting for an offer, so how could I go about that in the case that they don’t bring it up? Any specific phrases you would use would be SUPER helpful.

15u1x3f,Can’t find a job? Stop looking and start asking.,"You won’t find the career you want on Indeed. 

Indeed is an absolute farce. I tried it out a few years ago when I was a recent college grad and trying to navigate  my way through the marketplace. In fact, I did get my first out of college job on indeed, but it was nothing glorious and years removed I don’t think I’d do it again, but that is also part of your early career, learning what you wouldn’t do again. 

That’s why when I knew that I needed to take my career more seriously I wanted to do my second round of job searching different. Instead of filling out hundreds of applications that usually received crickets, I went straight to the source. 

My career focus is in legal (but not an attorney) so I researched firms around town that I would be proud each and every day to represent. I found attorneys who I wanted to work with and emailed them that I would be an asset to their team. Before I knew it, I was emailing back and forth with actual lawyers in need of paralegals. I’m now fully settled in to this position and have proven to these attorneys and admin the value I add to the firm. They also don’t advertise positions, people come to them. Their reputation speaks for itself so there’s no need to recruit when plenty of applicants seek them out instead. 

And let me tell you, I can see why. When you’re in a good situation, you’re surrounded by people who have been there for decades, they don’t beg applicants to accept positions, the psychological salary is life changing. 

So stop looking for open positions and start looking for who you want to work for and find a way to make it happen.

15u0gqh,Internship Dilemma: Coding Skills vs. High CGPA - What's More Important?,"Hey fellow Redditors,  
  
I recently found myself in a perplexing situation and could really use some advice from the experienced folks in the tech industry. A close friend and I both applied for the same internship, which comes with an impressive rs75,000 stipend. We both underwent an online coding test as part of the selection process and completed the same number of questions. However, to my astonishment, my friend was selected over me. The reason? Despite having no real inclination towards coding, he boasts a remarkable CGPA of 9.8, while I, a passionate full-stack web developer with an 8.13 CGPA, didn't make the cut.  
  
This situation has left me contemplating my approach to both academics and coding. Should I focus on boosting my CGPA to match his impressive score, even if it means diverting my time and attention away from coding, which I genuinely love and excel at? Or should I continue honing my coding skills and stick to my passion, hoping that it will eventually outweigh the CGPA factor?  
  
I'm at a crossroads here, torn between the conventional wisdom of high academic performance and the practicality of real-world coding skills. Have any of you encountered a similar scenario or have advice to share? What do tech companies value more - a stellar CGPA or demonstrable coding expertise? Your insights could be invaluable in helping me make an informed decision for my future.

I’m interested in opening a local doggie daycare that would offer training services as well as a little beer/wine bar so people can watch their dogs play. I looked through past posts and have a general idea of some market research solutions, but am wondering how these options change for a local brick-and-mortar business for pets, esp when options like Rover exist. 

Here are the ideas I’ve come up with so far, but I’d love to get some feedback on 1) if any of the below is unnecessary or not useful and 2) blind spots/things I’m missing that could better inform me. 

- map out locations of current daycares & record services offered and pricing
- census data on avg age, marital status, and median income of people in respective cities
- walkability scores and/or locations of dog-friendly high rise apartments(?)
- number of Rover dog-walking and daycare providers(?) 

Additional info: I live in Northern VA/DC metro area so specifically what I am trying to determine is what location/city would make sense. To my knowledge, there is only one other business that has the hybrid dog park/bar thing (in MD) and they don’t offer daycare so I’d be unique in my services. 

- options discussed in prior posts include surveys and questionnaires etc but I’m not sure how to go about that with a local shop & without being able to clearly determine who has a dog.

While I have loved my time here and get to do AWESOME things (constantly in vehicles and getting to drive them home, development trips all over the country, getting to now mentor other engineers, etc) I find that while about 70% of my job has me riding the highest highs......the lowest lows have become too much for me to take.

15tyimf,Best Approach Salary Ask,"I currently work in the finance department for a mid-sized nonprofit. My manager is moving to a different state to a higher position with a sister organization, and leadership has made it clear that they plan to hire to fill my manager’s position. I am the next most senior member of the team and my current manager, has expressed that he wants me to apply and that I would be the best fit rather than bringing in someone externally. He also shared that the President of the organization shared that she hopes I apply for the role. It’s also maybe important to note, that my current manager will have no part in the hiring process for this role.  

I’m not allowing myself to feel entitled to the role, but it feels like it’s as much of a lock as it can be. My only hang up is what to ask for salary-wise. 

Working in finance, I know what my manager makes (~$57k), but he has been with the organization for 5 years (I’ve been here for 2 and make $49k) so his pay is also factoring in our annual bumps. 

Everyone I have talked to has said to ask for $60k, but I’m worried about a) asking for more than my current manager makes (I assume that they don’t know that I know what he makes) and b) asking for too much and then getting undercut by an external candidate and losing the position. I also don’t want to get into any kind of negotiation situation where anyone walks away with a bad taste in their mouth. 

Another important note: indeed has the range for my position as anywhere between $49k to 66k a year.

There were a lot of stuff to do and I'm getting super excited when I get to code a lot, to learn how things function and to read and learn other people's code.

İt's all lacking in my current company. Recently got an offer from another company, it checked all my marks during interviews. On paper sounds like a company İ would like to work in. And I was looking specifically for smaller companies as my previous company was 140+ people and I feel it's a better environment for my skills to grow.

New company offered salary is the same I make here but I currently have a substantial addition to my salary in the form of on-calls which adds 700-1000 euros monthly to my net salary which is really nice addition since I get called really rarely and still getting paid. Nobody really cares what I do here, meaning İ have free time to experiment and to play around with tech and stuff. But that's also the reason why I'm miserable here as it's hard to stay motivated and to grow when you don't have anyone you can discuss your decisions, to learn from. And as I mentioned before, all my work seems redundant, nobody really uses what I do.

I'm ready to cut my net income to work in more productive and engaging environment, to learn new stuff but one part of me still has double thoughts. What if my previous company experience was an outlier and this new company would be the same as the current one? I think I asked questions thoroughly during interviews to understand whether company would be a match. But still one can miss so many things. Also what bugs me is that I'm the only earner in my family and Berlin is really expensive city in terms of rent prices. İf İ lose 700-1000 net income a month, it would have been not big deal for me as a single person since being able to learn new stuff and to work on challenging tasks is #1 thing I look in a job. But being in a marriage adds certain pressure to it as I don't want to degrade our lifestyle. My wife seems to agree but still thinks I'm crazy. New company evaluated me to the higher end of their mid level meaning İ would have a room for career growth hence salary increasement.

Does this sounds bizarre to change job in this situation? Am I delusional that other company would be better? I just want to do interesting stuff as we spend majority of our life in a work environment and it's better to be something worthwhile, something you find meaning in. İ know that I lose in a short run as I would lose money but, let's say, 5 years from now, İ would be the same I am today making the same or sightly above amount of money in my current company but if I switch the company İ can expand my skill set and to earn more potentially. İt was the case for me with my previous company where my career really took of.",HornyPillow,0,0.5,0,1692300912,2023-08-17 19:35:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15txahu/software_engineer_job_change_from_well_paying/,8,2023
15twt9g,Former landlord that tried to sue me is being invited to my company's Christmas party,"My former landlord/ roommate was also my former coworker. Long story short, he left my company and shortly after we had a colossal falling out due to how my animals were being treated in my absence, as well as retaliatory actions he was taking against me after this confrontation. I terminated my lease, left, and afterwards there were threats of litigations coming from both sides due to what occurred during the terms of our lease, and statements that were made afterwards. 

The issue is, at this company, it is customary for former employees that left the company in good terms to be invited to our annual Christmas party.  I am responsible for the organization of this party, and am also responsible for attending to set up and make sure everything is running well with the caterers, vendors, etc. Not going is simply not an option. Today, at a staff meeting wherein we discussed details and did some early planning for the party, my boss mentioned that this man specifically would be invited. Only two people in the office know of our falling out, and only vaguely, not including that the end of our personal relationship involved heavy threats of lawsuits, cease and desists, etc. 

How do I go about having a conversation with my boss about this person being invited? How heavy into details should I go into why I think it would be highly inappropriate on either of our ends to be in the same room? Would I be hurting myself or making a fool of myself if I asked for this person to not be invited? Should I just grin and bear it? There is the chance that this person will not accept the invitation, but they are so spiteful and retaliatory I do not doubt they would accept the invitation and show up just to mess with me.

15twn75,Music degree and lost,"After I complete my student teaching internship in December, I will have graduated with a Bachelors degree in Music Education from a T10 university. I struggled a lot during school, had to drop some classes and failed some. It was harder on me during and after the pandemic, I tried to complete a dual degree in Computer Science along with my music degree but it was too much for me to handle on a quarter system. I only chose to major in music because it was the only thing I was ever good at. I have no doubts that I'd be an amazing music teacher, but I don't think I'd make enough of a living to sustain a lifestyle I'd like to live. There are various methods of budgeting or frugality that may make this lifestyle some what possible, but I'd like the breathing room that comes with a decent financial cushion.

With that being said, I'm completely lost as to what alternate careers I could pursue given my education. I've heard about teachers leaving their profession but I haven't started mine and don't intend to. Are there related careers I could qualify for or am I going to have to obtain skills and education on top of my bachelors to even consider applying?

15twh6m,Debating between becoming a lawyer and a surgeon ?,"

I am an upcoming sophomore in high school. I have always been interested in the medical and law fields and my whole life I’ve seen myself in one of the 2. I take great interest in law, especially diplomatic relations and criminal cases. Freshmen year of high school I was a member of the law elective at my high school. It is a very good and profesional elective and my high school offers amazing clubs and programs for law-based fields such as Mock trial, Moot Court, and upcoming Model UN, which I hope to join. I have always loved debating and serving what I believe is right. Especially helping people in need. On the other hand, I’ve always had a passion for medicine as well, I’ve been interested in becoming a Cardiothoracic surgeon for a couple of years now and before anyone starts mentioning school - I am up to go to school for 14+ years for both careers if I need to. Med school and Law School had never been a deterring factor for me as I already am a pretty good student in my high school and am up to bear the responsibility of both scarier schools. My high school also has a Medical program which I am thinking of joining rather than law, however many of my friends who are in the medical program have said that it isn’t as good or professional as the law program. Additionally, my school doesn’t offer many medical related clubs or after school programs that I know of. I want to know by the end of sophomore year which career im pursuing because I want to have enough time to start studying and gaining experience/volunteer hours for college. My main jobs in both careers that I’m eyeing is Cardiothoracic Surgeon (medical) or Diplomat or Civil Justice Lawyer (Criminal Prosecution, Law). Last but not least, I would like to say that salary is also a big part of my choices however it isn’t fueled by it. I have done a lot of research on the salaries of both careers and the medical career especially surgeon seems more financially worth it. However I am also seeing a lot of first hand lawyers and attorneys bringing in over $250K after taxes which is very good according to my current standards (especially since I live in NYC).

However, I'm no longer happy with it. The work is boring and repetitive, and the policies are constantly changing. I also don't like having to be fake nice to people.

I've always dreamed about what my life could've been if I truly gave it my 100% all and applied myself. School always came easy to me growing up, which led me to not trying/not caring and being bored. I'm much older/more mature now and want more out of life. I value education and learning - I am always taking courses on Coursera and Udemy to supplement current knowledge and gain new knowledge.

I am currently 28 and dream of becoming a lawyer. I've always had the idea in my head, but always found a way to shut it down. (Not enough money for school, too much school to get to where I wanna get, not getting accepted to school, etc.) I know a lot of these reasons are anxieties/excuses that are holding me back.

I kind of know the answer but want some outside opinions. Is it too late to pursue this dream? Is it unwise to pursue this dream when I'm not financially free and it may impact my day to day?

I am questioning myself if I'm being realistic or just too hard on myself like I've historically been.

15tv794,How to Manage Business Travel Expectations Near Wife's Pregnancy and Shortly After?,"My wife and I are expecting our second child in early October. I travel about once a month for my work in a sales role. I have told my manager a few times that I would like to avoid overnight business travel and travel by plane in the 5 weeks leading up to the due date and for 4-6 weeks after I return with 2 weeks of vacation time to support the pregnancy. We are just under 50 employees so FMLA doesn't apply.

I have proposed that I can do Teams meetings, local travel, customer outreach and webinars during this time period. My manager wants me to travel overnight pretty much up to the pregnancy and start again almost immediately after. I have said that his expectations unacceptable and my request is consistent with industry expectations for myself and people in similar roles. This morning he threatened my job and said that legally we can terminate your role since FMLA doesn't apply. So far I have had nothing but positive results in my role so termination would be just due to my wife's pregnancy.

I am already planning a job search as soon as my new child is born since it is an overall very toxic culture but want to try to manage things until I have new role.

I have a few zoom interviews set up. They obviously won't see my pregnant belly through zoom and I haven't said anything yet because I didn't want to hinder my chances on getting a job. When should I disclose it? I'm unsure of the starting dates - I should ask during the zoom interview.

This job is technically my first official job that wasn't selling fruit cups and lemonade with my mom or bussing at a Mexican restaurant getting pain under the table. I am a 24F

 I work as a line server in the cafeteria of a university so we serve hundreds of students everyday. Our policy is that for every 6 hours or more that you work you get a 30min break with a free meal included. 

Yesterday when I asked my supervisor what time I could take my break he went on to list the coworkers that haven't taken a break in days ""you know X hasn't taken a break in two days and Y hasn't taken a break in more than that"" I was left speechless because Im used to this type of behavior from the under the table job because you can't really say anything or your job is gone 

When I finally said something it was ""well maybe they want to make more hours so that's on them"" because I was not about to be intimidated into not taking a break 

Then he said ""have you even broke a sweat?"" .. maybe not but that doesn't mean my feet didn't hurt. And on top of that I could feel my period started with a heavy flow. 

Btw my schedule is 3pm-11pm but I leave my house at 11:30am to arrive on time because I take the bus but my husband picks me up when I get off. And when I get home I go to bed pretty soon since I have to be up at 10am to start getting ready.

These are ordered in advancement stage:
1) Kaseya - MSP company based in Miami
+ 115k with bonus comp (before negotiations)
+ Larger company than I’ve been working which I hope it shows that I can also perform in this space besides start-ups
+ Uses SalesForce and Power Bi (I like these technologies and would like to dive further)

- in-office job. I could do this but hybrid is my best option
- V President said “the managers complain a lot”. It’s a battle ground, data is messy, lots of information but no use of it because it’s not understood (immature operations due to rapid growth and relocation to Miami. From 50 employees to 600 in 2 years). In other words bad data hygiene, apparently very very bad (see GlassDoor)
- Excel heavy (I love excel) but a company of this size should be in SQL, not excel



2) RevPartners - Top HubSpot consulting firm. One of the most reputable HubSpot consulting firms out there.
+ Remote
+ looks like a great culture, peer review and feedback to become a better professional
+ Exposure to learning and implementing Go to Market motions at various companies 

- Salary 100k (it’s good, but lower than other)
- I wouldn’t like focusing just on HubSpot, I’d want exposure to SFDC which captures +80% of the market, specially at established companies. 



3) Transifex - Language Localization SaaS start-up based in Greece but expanding to US. 
+ possibly highest salary TBD
+ Uses SFDC
+ Remote
+ working with key management (CMO, VP of Sales)

- Immature operations, really bad data hygiene
- CEO of 9 yrs sold the company and new management in place…  this tends to be a risk
- Possible budget limitations


Note: personally I am going through someone being ill in my family so even though I am a self driven individual that has worked till late, unsolicited, frequently, I’d like not to work beyond regular work hours to visit this family member.

I have to mention I have gave a lot of time in developing my skills as a rapper but no so much on my musical instruments and beat making, yes I can play bass pretty tight at gigs but I’m not advanced I don’t know music theory and can’t add random bass fills or know my way around the fretboard all the way when I have to play a random song yes I can make beats but I dont know the advance techniques t like famous producers. I am from a place where you can’t make it big in this field cus first off people don’t understand what I’m saying cus i rap in English. Cant make a living out of playing bass cus the pay is too low.

Don’t have money to invest in music videos or to promote myself. Don’t like the idea of not being able to play guitar like my guitar idols. Networking is hard and I need to give it time to get good at it practically. People know me and like my songs but they know me from gigs I don’t have audience on YouTube.

15ttvnm,At 43 yo after long career break is it realistic to go into UX design?,"I am coming off of a long career break due to a disability (similar to recovering from a stroke) and am ready to re-enter the work force. I have the opportunity for educational funding through a public university and after doing a skills inventory, UX Design came up as a possible career choice.

I have a bachelor degree in Business Admin and a background in media and design. Over the past couple of years, I've serve on a couple of non-profit boards and am currently starting a year long consulting position but am looking towards the future to decide where to go when that ends. I thrive on analyzing data and problem solving so UX Design seems to check a lot of boxes, although I do not have a programming background. I also understand the demand for this area may be shifting with AI but depending on the source I read, this demand could grow, decrease or just shift.

15tt5er,Negotiate a raise,"Hello everyone. 

I(25) work as a DevOps Engineer with a software engineer degree. I am responsible with a team of 5 of maintaining the websites infrastructure on the AWS cloud, along with pipelines management and such stuff ( used to be more but some left for better offers and barely got replaced ).

The company is located in Munich, Germany. The offer I got was 57k ( around 3k net salary is left after taxes ) and being single, the salary is actually pretty good... I worked and lived in the city for around a year now. I wonder when I should negotiate for an increase, given that my work is actually appreciated and I'm doing good so far and handling the pressure when it comes ( considering that the team's capacity is low ). 

I know that there is the option of switching companies or at least getting an offer and use it to negotiate my own.. but I don't want to go down that road because my work permit is linked to my employer ( Type D VISA ) and actually switching companies at this stage will make me go through a nightmare bureaucracy and most likely my employer knows it.. 

I joined the company with 1 year of experience after graduation and now it's 2 + 1 year of part time experience as a developer. During the interview, I said I wanted between 60k and 65k.

I live in Europe and I would like to start my professional career here, just in different country.  
While researching options I came across CIPD as well respected European HR community, that offers plenty CIPD accredited courses.  

I would appreciate any kind of feedback on this topic  
- Does it makes sense to obtain certificate in People Practice through CIPD to kickstart a career?  
- If yes, which one holds most weight?  
- Do you recommend any other form of getting enough qualifications to potentially get employed as an HR?

15tpxzk,Promotion hasn't been processed for months. Do I start documenting things?,"Hello, looking for some advice as I'm relatively early in my career and don't know if this is normal or not. Thank you all for any advice given!

So I work for a government agency and after about a year I was given a small promotion. Paperwork was filled out and sent to HR. There wasn't really a change in my responsibilities due to this promotion. It was really just a way for the management team to say you've been doing well here's a little more money and keep it up. I think my management team is generally good, trustworthy people and I've been feeling looked out for in my time there. 

But, our HR is a separate entity and it's ultimately them who process all these kinds of things. It's now been more than 3 months and nothing has been processed. I'm still being paid like my previous position and I'm still officially listed under my previous seniority level/title. There are others at my agency in a similar position (including manager level people) and the management team that deals with HR has said they've pushed for back pay when everything does finally get processed. I'm not sure what to do here about this. 

Do I have any course of action I can take to try to get HR to process the paperwork? I've thought about starting to document everything, like the paperwork getting sent to HR, an email to my HR representative asking if I can do anything to help the processing, and just generally trying to track agreement from my agency on the promotion and non-action and non-communication from the HR side. Is this normal in general or for government agencies?

Their parents recently both died and they’ve essentially retired and moved to Florida with the inheritance, leaving myself and the office manager as the only regular employees. The company has basically been coasting on the few clients it has left for several years now and the production side (my job) hasn’t really been profitable as long as I’ve worked here. They would essentially give me the production side if I wanted, but I have no business experience and am a terrible salesman. I’m a nerdy editor/ behind-the-camera guy. The in-laws are in full retirement mode and have no interest in teaching me sales or how to run a business or how to buy air-time. (The part that actually made them money.) However, they are basically giving me a year or two to figure out what to do next before they fully shut down. I could just continue in video production, but I honestly think it was a poor path for me and I’m genuinely not that talented in it. I’ve thought about commercial drone work, but it seems like the drone license is the easy part and you really need experience in whatever field you’re using the drone (construction, surveying, farming etc.) Part of the problem is that I have no commercially viable passions and too many options.

Since then I’ve held mostly non tech roles and have not coded one bit. To justify my education, I tried to get roles like Tech PM, Developer relationship, etc but I still didn’t code. However I did excel in them.

Until last year, I somehow survived being an imposter but now shit has hit the fan and I’m having a realisation that I fucked up big time by being away from tech. I got fired recently and have jobs at hand right now.
Now non tech jobs pay very low and semi tech jobs require more technical expertise than before.

15tlkgc,Advice on how to word a firm no thanks.,"Hello Reddit,

I've been in my current position for almost a year now and just got a new manager (different from the one who hired me).  This new manager is new to being a manager I think and essentially wants me to work for free in staying late or work a shift different from the one I signed up for and explicitly stated in my interviewing process.  I'm salaried, so any extra time is just working for free in mind.  I understand deadlines need to be met...blah...blah…blah, but this is a tech support role where we have shifts of people. I'm a senior role as I've been doing this for somewhere near 20 years, and  I've only recently switched my mode of thinking to be that of me first, company second.  What I'm really looking for is a professional but firm way to say no thanks, I'll stick to the agreed upon shift when I got hired.  This isn't something I'm really willing to bend on, and the whole working more to get ahead is what burnt me out at my last job of 15 years, and the benefits did not outweigh the negatives.  I was promised things and let down, so I found a new job.  


I appreciate any and all help you all can provide.  Likewise, I don't dislike this manager, but they have a tendency to be a micromanager and come down on you when it's not done the way they would have done it.  I'm willing to look for new work if this doesn't play out in my favor but figured I'd give professionalism a try here before having to look elsewhere.

Hey guys. I work as a waiter. I’m a carrier waiter and a Sommelier level one working on two. I’m an incredibly knowledgeable in many things. I speak 4 languages, have adequate knowledge on wine and treat every guest like king and queen regardless of whoever or whatever they are. I’m will paid by the guests plus I work really really hard bcs this is hard work physically and mentally. I’ve been making too many servers upset I can tell. They r jealous of me bcs I have sooo many ppl asking for me and they love me. I’m also making all of my managers jealous bcs I double what they make probably more. I can make 130k plus or minus bcs I know what I’m doing. Of course this amount of money is by working 5 nights and be left alone to close the restaurant. I respect my managers and coworkers but I can’t stop not working hard. I don’t know how to be not good in something. I’m 43 . Well Now, the managers have figured out a way to stop me by cutting me early for no reason and not letting me do what I do. It’s not my fault that they chose to be managers. I feel like they r abusing their power and I can’t do anything about it bcs they will just come up with a new rule and it’s 5 of them vs me plus another 6 servers that I have consistently beaten in sales since my highest sale was 1.2 million in one year. I think I’ve probably beaten every waiter on the planet. I’m very disappointed and powerless. They know I’m good but dislike me for it. It really has been affecting my performance now bcs I’m unhappy and constantly treated like dirt. I’m certainly not going to able to kill it from now on I feel it bcs I’m basically handcuffed. I don’t know what to do since I’ve been only doing this Restaurant jobs since 1999. It’s not like I need the money, I’m doing great but I’m hard worker and I want to be in charge of my own decisions to work less or more. I’ve been working for this particular restaurant for 7 years I don’t want to say the name. Why would I want to advertise if they r not appreciating me. I’m trying to figure out what other day job should I do bcs I work at night . I have two daughters and have to take them to school but I should be done by 8am since they use the bus. I’m trying to do something else but I can’t figure it out. Any ideas would be appreciated. I thought about calling the ppl above these managers, but it will be useless bcs one of my friend was treated the same and he called they didn’t do anything. The restaurant run by a few terrible, unprofessional and un knowledgeable human beings I have ever witnessed and trust me I’ve been doing this very well I know what I’m talking about. So now I’m extremely unhappy and they r trying to make me quit. What really bothers me that I haven’t done anything to them.

15tlauk,What should I do?,"So. I’ve just finished taking 2 A-levels. History and Economics which I have achieved a D in (both). Im taking a 3rd year to complete my 3rd A-level (business) which I will finish in the summer of 2024.

My plan is to either go to university and do a foundation year, as my grades aren’t that great, or do a level 3 Apprenticeship then go for a level 6 apprenticeship.

My question is would it be better to join as a trainee in a company and work for 4 years instead of getting a degree, as my experience would be of more value to a company.",LeupMeisterGenral,1,1.0,0,1692273323,2023-08-17 11:55:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15tlauk/what_should_i_do/,8,2023
15tkzdv,How to make more money?,"So I have a full-time job which is technically 40hrs a week, but I work from home and have a lot of free time where I’ve either completed everything I need to do for the day, or am just twiddling my thumbs waiting on someone to get back to me. I can’t leave the house during these hours as I am essentially “on call” even if I have completed my work for the day. I would like to get a second job or side gig to help bring in some extra money with all that extra time I have. However, it needs to be very flexible so that I can do it in between my original job, essentially I need to be able to set my own hours with it every day. I love organizing things and information, but I’m autistic, so communicating with people is exhausting and I’m not always very good at it.

15tk7ot,"The more I work on my YouTube channel, the more I hate my full time job.","So this year I started heavily investing more of my time and money into my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@Banished_Builds) in hopes to make building functional props a full time job. I saw immense channel growth after my most popular video (500,000+ views); however, I feel that the stress of my full time job plus working at home is starting to get to me. I feel like the more potential I see in my channel and projects, the less I want to go to my full time job.

I can't sleep if I have to work at my actual job the next day because I just want to stay up and work on my projects. I'm frustrated all day at my full time job because if I were home I'd have time for my projects and get more videos out faster, but if I didn't go to work I wouldn't have money for them. The entire time at my full time job I can't stop thinking of things I could be doing for my videos. Then some days by the time I get home I'm too exhausted to work on my projects so nothing gets done.

I feel like I'm so close yet so far to getting somewhere with YouTube as another video as large as my popular one would make more than I make in a month at my full time job, now that I'm monetized. I had told myself that this year I either get my YouTube channel going or I give up on it to prioritize other things in life. My hopes had been to go part time at work by the end of this year, with YouTube covering the difference in pay, and then hopefully move into full time YouTube later on. One of my friends does similar content full time and has been giving me a lot of advice on the topic which has been very helpful. It looks very doable if I keep up the amount of work I've been doing this year, but I don't know how much longer I can keep that up.

Any advice would be helpful as I know YouTube careers are not for everyone. Should I just try to keep up the work until next year or work a bit less and just see what happens?",StorakTheVast,1,0.6700000166893005,9,1692270249,2023-08-17 11:04:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15tk7ot/the_more_i_work_on_my_youtube_channel_the_more_i/,8,2023

15tjkcz,Bullies at work. Advice regarding what to do?,"I’ve worked with my current employer for almost a year and a half now.  

I’m in a pretty easy role with minimal stress (ex nurse, now in Project Admin). I can work at my own pace and I have a nice range of tasks within my role.  

It’s the most I’ve been paid and I’m happy with the salary for now.  

The place is incredibly flexible. I have set hours but there’s no issues if I arrive / leave earlier, or later as long as I make my hours up. If I’m sick, my boss doesn’t make me feel guilty or request medical certificate and I can work from home with no questions asked if I prefer to save my personal leave.  

It’s less than a 10 minute drive my home with minimal traffic.  

Theres only a few negatives:  
Firstly, and not significantly negative IMO: they don’t offer paid parental leave (PPL). My partner and I are considering trying for a baby next year or the year after. I would have loved an employer who offers PPL however I can justify saving $ to get through the remainder of the unpaid year if I’m coming back to a workplace that I know is flexible and will be easy to work around my life with a toddler in daycare / school / leaving for an unwell toddler etc, (and I believe this employer is).  

The biggest negative that’s pushed me to start looking elsewhere is the culture. There are minimal women and I don’t feel like I have any “friends”. When I started I felt like I was treated as the “token female”. Sometimes I am asked to do tasks that are not within my role and I can’t help but believe this is because I am the only female (e.g. organising lunches/parties restocking the kitchen / ordering coffee etc). There is a particular group of guys who have worked there longer than management and have a tight friendship circle. I think they are bullies as their jokes are insulting, mean and sexist. I have a good sense of humour but I think the jokes border on not being funny anymore and simply being mean (about my appearance, intelligence, ability to do my job etc). It’s also the consistency in which I have to hear them. I will be silently minding my own business and they will approach me and initiate these “jokes”. One guy in particular has mood swings and snaps at me so aggressively when he’s in bad moods and no one bats an eyelid. I have started wearing headphones and listening to podcasts and music all day and for the most part this avoids any issues with them but I have also had situations where they have then bullied me for wearing my headphones and not laughing at their jokes or entertaining them. I haven’t spoken to anyone about it as I feel like my boss (who has very poor social skills - he is often unknowingly a topic of jokes for these guys) has sometimes included himself in making jokes about me (in front of me) to get a laugh from these guys. I feel like if I discussed it with him he would respect how I’m feeling and try to change things as he probably doesn’t even know how I’m feeling. I am often labeled as the cranky female (“who must be on her period”) based on how I react to the constant provoking and even my boss has implied this before (but again, I think he has poor social skills and thinks he was being funny).  

I have a job interview for a similar role with less range of tasks - more specialty (so probably less chances of expanding into different roles or progressing later in life) similar pay, 30-40 minutes from my house but it has 18 weeks paid parental leave, higher percentage of women in the company and is a very big well known company with lots of employee benefits.  

Part of me feels like I am being consistently broken and believes that I can’t remain in a place where I feel this way. Another part of me believes that the workplace has so many positives and I shouldn’t let a few people push me to leave, in fear that my next place might have more negatives than positives. We have recently had an office reshuffle so I am no longer sitting in the same pod with one of the bullies and I’m wondering if I should hang in there to see if gets any better. Part of me also thinks it’s worth hanging in there until I have a baby as it’ll be flexible to come back to and it’ll be even easier working there part time.  

If you made it this far, thank you.  

Edit: I should note that I know these guys are not upsetting me purposely (except for the mood swings when one lashes out) and for the most part they are trying to make me laugh when they make their jokes. But they also know when I am not enjoying the jokes as I feel like I make this clear that I want them to leave me alone but they do not.",books-tea-and-dogs,5,0.8600000143051147,5,1692268298,2023-08-17 10:31:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15tjkcz/bullies_at_work_advice_regarding_what_to_do/,8,2023

15tfi2v,Accountant/finance professional looking to pivot to Ai/machine learning or data science role.,"Hi all,

I started my career in big 4 and spent some time as a senior accountant in FAANG. I’m currently a senior financial analyst at a great company but tbh I don’t love the work. It just doesn’t excite me as much as I thought it would and I dread month end close every month.

I’ve recently read a syllabus from a prestigious school that offers a boot camp for Ai & machine learning, with career opportunities as a machine learning engineer or data scientist. I’m really tempted to make the move. 

I always wanted to be an engineer, but a school counselor told me I wouldn’t be cut out for it because I started community college at a low math level and would essentially take me 6 years to complete my engineering degree. + I was not in the financial position to take so long to get my degree, as I needed to get in and out to start helping provide for my family. Boy do I dread not doing it.

I want to create. And the whole Ai wave is completely fascinating to me and way more exciting than my current work. Has anyone made the pivot before and have any tips?

15teesq,Higher paying more stressful job vs lower paying in house role,"
I am currently working in-house for the legal department at a tech company (making 67k) and I just moved to NYC.  I’ve been working in intellectual property for 4 years and I’m 26, I started looking for a new job when I moved and got 2 offers yesterday. One is a medium sized law firm and the other is a nonprofit org. The big law offer was 95k and would definitely be a lot of responsibility and pressure. Moreover, the pto and benefits were a little lacking (only 10 days pto per year which accrue over time) however I have always been wanting more responsibility and engaging work to do and this would definitely keep me preoccupied even if I have to sacrifice the  work life balance in-house offers. 

I am more interested in the work with the nonprofit role and their team, and wanted that position more. It’s more of a research/investigative position with admin responsibilities for enforcing legal compliance throughout the nonprofit org.  They offered me 82k and when I tried to negotiate for more they said the highest they could do was 85k. I did not get info about their PTO or benefits but am considering negotiating for more pto if I am going to take a lower paying role. 

What would you do in my situation? Has anyone had any experience with non-profits? Would love any advice or help.

I had to dropout of college due to mental health issues. I worked in restaurants for years and then finally got a remote job doing customer support for an app. I only lasted at that job for 6 months because it was terrible and made me feel worthless.

After quitting that job I mostly did side hustles and started teaching myself how to code. I moved back in with my parents to save money and now I’m thinking of doing a bootcamp, but I’m discouraged by all the awful reviews about coding bootcamps and how terrible the job market is currently. I haven’t been able to find a decent job, and I really don’t want to go back to the restaurant industry. I eventually want to finish my degree, but it will probably take me 2 years to complete, so I’m trying to figure something out in the meantime while I finish it part time. 

Also, when it comes to applying to new jobs I feel like a failure because my last actual job was only for 6 months and then I’ve had a year gap of just doing gigs like doordash and other side hustles. So I’m not too sure what to do there.

15tclz9,Online Footprint,"Hi all,  
I started working in my general STEM area as a teenager with humble origins, and within a year or two of finishing college started climbing the leadership ladder. Everything's changed in the last few 2 years. I get to travel the world, and now speak several languages. I also dabble in political networking, and keep a toehold on the party scene for my general field. People seem to get excited when I talk about my general life, like when I am cleared to talk about my day job people have started shouting and line up after I talk. In and outside of work, I end up getting really high level connections and people seem react to my general life/career path with handshaking and shock. It's become freakishly normal for people, especially ambitious college kids, to shower me with compliments and stuff. I'm in touch with a lot of execs.  
In general I honestly don't know how to capitalize on the popularity part, or why people like me that much compared to my day job colleagues. But I do wonder if putting myself out there on the internet and maybe traditional media could accelerate my growth. The only thing that comes up when people google my name is a polished LinkedIn that I use for DMs & a well written bio. I don't post much, since things get squirrelly if I talk about my job too much.

15tcjb8,Turning my IG Public,"Hi all,

I started working in my general STEM area as a teenager with humble origins, and within a year or two of finishing college started climbing the leadership ladder. Everything's changed in the last few 2 years. I get to travel the world, and now speak several languages. I also dabble in political networking, and keep a toehold on the party scene for my general field. People seem to get excited when I talk about my general life, like when I am cleared to talk about my day job people have started shouting and line up after I talk. In and outside of work, I end up getting really high level connections and people seem react to my general life/career path with handshaking and shock. It's become freakishly normal for people, especially ambitious college kids, to shower me with compliments and stuff. I'm in touch with a lot of execs.

&#x200B;

In general I honestly don't know how to capitalize on the popularity part, or why people like me that much compared to my day job colleagues. But I do wonder if putting myself out there on the internet and maybe traditional media could accelerate my growth. The only thing that comes up when people google my name is a polished LinkedIn that I use for DMs & a well written bio. I don't post much, since things get squirrelly if I talk about my job too much.

15tcank,Plant shutdown: Navigating incentive package,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Industrial Engineer, BS, ~6 YOE. 

I work for a manufacturing company based out of the US. It was just announced that the certain manufacturing division I work for is being outsourced overseas. We’re expected to scale back our US operations starting in Q1 with full shutdown slated for end of 2024. The “intent” of the company is to retain all employees and reposition us in other US manufacturing divisions. In the meantime, we continue our regular work and help transition things to their new foreign home.

As an incentive to stay and help with the transition, I’ve been presented with a performance based cash/RSU bonus package. The bonus hits Q1 2025 and the RSUs all vest late 2024. Performance relates to how effectively the division is transferred.


Wondering what’s the best way to proceed. My initial thoughts are that the incentives all cash AFTER our US division is scheduled to shut down. Feels like I’m opening myself up to help with this transition for 16 months and then get cut before I get any payout. The company intends to keep us all, but a lot can change in a year.

On the other hand, I’ve done good work here and I saw a lot of career opportunity before this shakeup. I generally have a hard time being self oriented in these situations, so my gut feeling is to continue forward.

15tc1zr,Job Transition,"I have worked for a small to medium-sized company for 5 years as an IT Manager, working directly with ownership on all technical aspects of the business. We have a small group that run the big picture. My relationship with the owner used to be great, but it has grown progressively more hostile over time due to differences in opinion. He has an old-school mentality towards both remote work and retention plans for employees. The ""we are a family"" and ""we are a team making decisions together"" mentality until he is in the mood to be the dictator. And the dictator perspective has been the new norm. Due to these reasons and many more, I decided to apply to another company within a niche market based on what I have learned here.

I landed an offer letter after my first interview with this company. The offer is incredible since I think I would love the job requirements, the pay is significantly higher than my current position, and the benefits are magnificent. It seems unreal, but I am running into a few issues and want to see if I can receive any advice from good ol' Reddit.

&#x200B;

1. They need to reach out to my current employer as a courtesy since they are a customer, and it is a policy to do a reach out before sending an offer letter. Is this abnormal? I told them I would need an offer letter before I discuss anything with ownership, and they agreed to send me it. But the conversation has to be held prior to accepting it. I won't be joining them for a few months either way since I need time to train someone new, and that was agreed upon. I do not plan to have this conversation for a few weeks, when a few other higher ups are back from vacation to prevent stress clouds from gathering while they are supposed to be enjoying themselves. This would be an in-person conversation, and I will be offering to stay for a few months to work out any active projects and train other staff. I already know that my departure is going to be extremely difficult for them and I do not want to rush the conversation. But I do want to accept this offer.
2. I am new to the negotiation concept. If I negotiated anything with my current employer, it would lead to nothing but headaches. Sure, I do it with vendors and people outside the company all the time. But I don't know the state of the market. If anyone here does hire for senior positions on a frequent basis, how often will you withdraw an offer letter because the person counter offered? I requested a relocation stipend and sign-on bonus. Will they look into other candidates to avoid the additional cost of me? The hiring manager from within their company said my ask is higher than anything they can approve, and they would need to receive permission from someone up the chain. I have not received any update within 24 hours, and they released an almost identical advertisement to the role I am being offered on LinkedIn. I am a bit nervous about the offer being withdrawn. What would you say are the odds that I am making a mistake?

Several other thoughts come to mind, but I think I will end this here and edit in further questions if needed. I am a bit stressed over the situation and unexperienced with this specific scenario.",R-Cryptic,1,1.0,0,1692244535,2023-08-17 03:55:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15tc1zr/job_transition/,8,2023

15tbk42,Good or bad advice?,"I’m currently in amazing standing at my job. I’m an individual contributor that recently got an opportunity to apply for a new management position over a team very similar to my own.

My peers all think I should apply and that I’d be perfect. I’ve got dozens of folks on various teams all cheering me on. Even my old director who is now in another org wants me to apply.

Only one issue. The new director hiring for the role knows of me based on my reputation but I get a strong sense that he is seeking to fill the role externally by someone with extensive experience. The req opened as a senior manager role requiring 5+ years of management. Historically, the role has often been filled by promoted ICs with no management experience.

My old director suggested that I reach out to peers and flood the new directors inbox with recommendations that I should fill the role. This feels odd. Would this be effective? Would it be annoying? Imagine my director waking up to 60 emails of peers saying he should heavily consider me. I can’t tell if this would be cool or a disaster.

TLDR; I’ve been encouraged to flood the inbox of the director in charge of hiring for a position I want with referrals from peers. Good idea? Bad idea?",slaughterj11,1,1.0,1,1692243147,2023-08-17 03:32:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15tbk42/good_or_bad_advice/,8,2023

15tao0l,"I'm so deep, I'm not sure there's a way back","I just would like to ask that there be little to no backlash please if possible, I want to explain my story and get some advice.

So I for the past 7 years have been working in contact centre(call centre) environment, I started way back on a fairly straightforward campaign, there was many of options in being able to help customers and dealt with your average unhappy caller.

I started on a full-time basis doing 40hrs a week, sometimes like 45-50 with ot hours(optional at my employer) I generally enjoyed making amends and liking the sense of appreciation and respect from customers when being able to resolve their issues. I mean don't get me wrong it wasn't always possible to resolve but there was at least options.

However about 2 years into the job the funding for said campaign was pulled and the client went elsewhere, I was lucky enough to have my contract rescued as their was a new client coming in to replace them.

At first it was very much a basic campaign of general enquiries and transfering sales opportunities for the business(no commission for this) this was like this for a few months, then the world stop for COVID it felt like, and the first few ""Clinks in the armour"" started to appear, We where told that all store and depots would be closing and no orders where taken what so ever... But low and behold my department was still going to be operating which was good as it was still a job through a uncertain time.

Anyway so eventually we started opening back up and then we started to get more things to do like actually view orders book in deliveries etc. But where told, only offer Mon-Fri only. Which I thought was a little strange. 4 weeks later we all got pulled into a meeting saying that all of the teams from each individual store and depots where being disbanded and our contact centre was taking on the work but where told could still call if needed.

So this went in and things really started to breakdown and I for the first time starting questioning things, as where told we could no longer make calls to store and depots unless it was the day of delivery and instead where told to pass it off as there will instead be a ""Call back arranged within 24-72hrs"" omg did the gates open up it seemed over other deliveries had problems and issues that we couldn't fix and the best we got from the client was irregardless of issue you can only offer 25% of the del fee which was some like 25-35 pounds.

As you can imagine this infuriated customers and we where left to deal with it as very quickly absolutely no one wanted to answer the phone because they knew it was C's calling this was even with in day issues etc.

So I had enough and raised with management... nothing happened to absolutely no one's surprise...

Then Xmas 21 rolled around and oh my the sh**storm that came was unbearable and extremely tiresome, it absolutely crippled my health and wellbeing do much so I had to beg to slash my hours in half as I could no longer take it.

As like march 22 rolled around everything started to ease a little and then there was opportunities to expand.

I had tried to apply for a few things and got an interview for another position higher up within the contact centre had the interview, then the hiring manager ignored my update requests for more or less 2 weeks and heard through word of mouth that the position was already hired for. This was extremely frustrating but let it go.

Into the present time.

My mental health is still very much on the downward spiral, I can't face getting up in the morning to log in to work, I can hardly breathe sometimes either with all the stress and anxiety that precedes the working day, we're very still not able to really help customers and are now at a point where we've pretty much to quote"" Tuff it out"", then I thought the perfect opportunity had came at last it was a position that I want to do more or less socials and live chat agent... I had applied for this but was told the other week I didn't get is because of a ""Disagreement with a colleague and also absence(down to a loved one passing) that I was told I would not get it, my empathy is gone the will power is no longer there and I cannot see and or feel like it's worth sticking around anymore, I'm sick and tired of the everyday ear bashing because our processes do absolutely nothing to help you as a customer.

My manager thinks I should stick around as there will likely be more colleagues needed for the social and live chat agent role after a 3 month period...I honestly don't think let alone know if I even want to or will be around in the company in the next 3 months. My performance is starting to take a hit too and I likely only to be a matter of time before I start getting into bother for this.

I suppose some will say well why not quit.

I don't feel like I can, My Stepfather is being made redundant in a few weeks time and my mother is house bound and cannot live on a 4 person household with benefits alone, my other brother works Part-time too but has been told there will likely never be an opportunity to go full-time.

15t8ube,Seeking Advice on Proposed Collaboration Terms with Family Construction Business,"I come to you today seeking your wisdom on a situation that's just happenedtoday. The story is this: my dad, a seasoned general contractor with three decades of experience, has extended to me the incredible opportunity to learn and eventually take the reins of our family construction business. This is exciting, but the details of our proposed collaboration has taken me back.

Here's a breakdown of what's on the table for me:

Chief Operating Officer (COO) Compensation: The proposed compensation structure includes a 22% profit share from each job. This share encompasses tasks like contract drafting, supply list management, invoicing, and nurturing customer relationships — all essential cogs in the wheel of operational excellence and client contentment.

Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Compensation: I'd be at the helm of projects like website and logo development, plus initiating a Google and Facebook business page. The initial fee for these ventures ranges from $500 to $1,000. Furthermore, ongoing contributions would secure me a 3% slice of profits for self-generated leads and projects stemming from CMO services.

However, a concern I'm grappling with revolves around the profit distribution aspect. My dad has indicated that even if I single-handedly manage everything from lead generation to signing contracts, overseeing labor and supplies, and meticulously supervising the entire project lifecycle, my maximum share of the total profit would cap at 25%. This arrangement leaves my dad with a commanding 75%, despite his lack of direct involvement in the project.

What's more, envision a scenario where I eventually bring on board 10 other project managers. If each of them contributes $1,000 in profit, their take-home pay would only amount to $10 each. Consequently, I would need to allocate a portion of my share to accommodate their earnings. This would effectively leave me with approximately $2,400 from my cut of the overall profit, while my dad garners $7,500 without actively participating in the projects. This situation could result in me receiving a pay cut even as I significantly bolster his revenue.

Considering my limited experience in this field, I'm left wondering whether this setup is common within the industry. It's challenging for me to assess whether these terms are equitable, given the substantial gap in experience between my dad and me. It's also worth noting that his business largely relies on word-of-mouth, boasting minimal online presence. With a single Facebook page holding a mighty two likes and two followers.

Should I agree to these terms and learn under his tutelage for an estimated three-year period, with hopes of gaining invaluable knowledge? Or should I seize the initiative to establish my own enterprise immediately, capitalizing on my marketing prowess and learning online?

Your insights, anecdotes, or advice would be immensely appreciated. I eagerly await your perspectives!

Many thanks in advance.

TL;DR: Dad wants me to lead our construction business. Proposal includes fees and profit shares. Worried 25% cap on total profit is unfair, especially if I bring in project managers who I must pay out of pocket. Unsure if I should learn from him or start my own business.

I (21m) have been working at a fairly sized food manufacturing plant for the past 2 years making 20 an hour or so, around 42k a year before taxes. i started as a machine operator got some experience in other areas and eventually just became a floater. I know a little of everything and like to think of myself as pretty useful and dependable if need be.

the only problem is that i feel stuck, stagnated earlier this year a position for a production lead had opened up and i applied and demonstrated that i was more than capable of being able to fulfill the role, and i didn’t get it to me it felt like all the extra work i had put in was for nothing considering i was not even considered during the application process 

so what can i do to potentially find a better job or maybe even jump start a potential career? despite me being relatively young im not exactly as tech-savvy as others due to not having any access to the latest technology up until a few years ago and i feel like going to school is not an option either as i literally graduated high school because of covid i graduated with a flat 2.0 due to me not being particularly good at school ( entirely my fault but there was nothing i could do if i just couldn’t focus at all) 

i wouldn’t mind anything that’s physically challenging i would actually prefer it as long as it can pay more and put me on the road to a better future. any advice?",Middle-Incident4083,2,1.0,2,1692235538,2023-08-17 01:25:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15t8n8u/any_recommendations_on_what_to_at_this_current/,8,2023
15t8mpw,Is this a normal amount of scope for customer service?,"

I just started a corporate customer service job 3 months ago. It is different than my past CSR role. In my other job, we would process/clean up orders that came through in our company portal (buyers would enter them in our system), respond to emails and calls, among other various tasks. The workload was manageable and there were times of “downtime” where I felt I could do more organization and project related tasks. I almost always had enough time and everyone left at 5. Overtime had to be approved and was very rare.

In my new role, all order entry is manual. The buyers email in PDFs and we enter from there, having to go to about 10 applications to enter one order. There can be mannnyyy hiccups along the way. On order entry, we enter the requested date of the customer, but also check supply and demand of material, item availability, check for quality holds, lots of stuff, message planners about realistic dates, go down many rabbit holes it feels like on every order. If the account is cash in advance, we also print and make pro forms invoices and send to the customer for payment. We also enter customer orders for drop ship items to affiliates and manage two different orders at once manually for all that. It’s a lot to keep track of.

We also have to check about 4 reports a day, the open orders reports, production report about all delays (seems every order is delayed), and backordered items. Each order on the report usually requires a customer communication and order change. At my past company the management took care of things like this.

Then we also get so many emails every day from the customer and others. Many of it seems to stem from the fact that they don’t have access to a portal to our order system so they ask us to send lots of info about things they get automatically emailed, but we have to check and update their account contacts with each new PO.

Everyone works really hard and we all stay late everyday, but only are allowed 2 hours OT. Management tracks so many things on us and seems to not understand the volume of work and many complex and urgent issues  that come up in a day. This week we’re having trainings on how to provide better customer service, I feel we’re always blamed for problems and for poor KPIs like how fast you enter orders or respond to emails when it really feels like we just don’t have enough people doing this job. We are the biggest market share of our product that goes into almost every grocery item on the shelves and yet our customer service team only has about 12 people. People regularly stay very late and are very behind in work and complain about how much work there is. There is also very high turnover, about 80% of workers have been there 0-2 years. I hear management walking around all the time talking about how to track our productivity more and more and having analysts hired to track us, and then management threatens to fire us if we don’t enter an order or respond to an email with 2 days. It all sounds reasonable until you factor in you get about 100 emails a day you need to take action on plus you have 20 things from yesterday you’re still trying to get resolution on plus 15 new orders that need manual entry plus 4 daily reports plus phone calls and interruptions from people at your desk.

Customer service is expected to be the facilitator between all other departments and always takes the hit when something goes wrong too.

While I could go on and on about the red flags that are apparent, I am absolutely bothered by this one issue I'm having. 

Upset customers. A luxury dealership that definitely doesn't give you a luxury experience. Whenever a customer is upset, the appropriate department that is suppose to deal with the customer always says ""tell them I'm busy with deals."" Leaving me to deal with them as they linger around the receptionist desk upset. 

My general manager is a useless asshole. A few of the managers there are useless assholes. They ignore their customers and leave them for someone else to deal with. I walked to my general managers office and asked him to deal with an issue the finance manager should be handling. The customer was cursing the finance manager calling him a retard. Upon walking to his office and asking for his assistance so I can get this customer away from my desk and away from me in general as he's not my issue to deal with, my general manager says in a very mean voice ""No..."" 

I was so annoyed. I told him this is the finance managers fucking customer and the finance manager should be handling this but all he said to tell me was that he was ""busy."" My general manager ended up dealing with the situation after I had to fucking beg. 

I don't plan to make reception a career, it's just something to pay the bills. That being said, I don't have a choice to quit. I can search for another job and then quit. But boy oh boy, I rather work anywhere else than here. The other departments make my job so difficult. I have enough to deal with at the front checking customers out, going over repair orders, etc. 

What do you think I should do? Should I immediately get out of this situation? What would you do in my shoes?",HealthyCoconut743,0,0.5,3,1692234995,2023-08-17 01:16:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15t8fsj/what_would_you_do/,8,2023

I’ve worked in hospitality Management for 10 years and I’m ready for a change of career. I’m kinda discouraged though seeing I’m looking at going back to school but it’s so expensive and the wages posted on indeed for entry level positions are round $19. Who can survive on that?! I understand it’s the world we live in right now. Now I’m really regretting not going to school in my younger years seeing I would be quite established and probably paid decently well by now. 

The main reason for the post is, does anyone have any decent paying jobs that they have attained without needing a degree or spending 50K? I’ve only ever known one industry. I’ve done very well in it and would like to transfer those skills to another career/job. I spend hours a day trying to figure out what’s worth pursuing these days?? Don’t get me wrong,  I don’t live a lavish life and demand 100k a year. Just a modest, LIVEABLE income. Ideally, I want to help people.

Unfortunately, my job has changed quite a bit and it's pretty isolating. I regret pursuing accounting as I truly do not enjoy it at all. I have a BS in accounting, and an MS in business and leadership and I would like to pivot into something where I could work with young people (middle school and older).

15t6t6l,Stay in corporate or do 5 years of school to switch into the medical field?,"
I worked my way up in corporate up to a director level role at 30. After minor clashes with a new boss who micromanaged my time, texted me for non-emergencies on weekends, wouldn’t listen that we needed more people enough that benchmarking data showed it, I was laid off. 

I’m devastated but relieved. I have never been treated so poorly in my career, including when I was in retail and as a coordinator. I had people at this company lie to my face. I couldn’t take time off without being called or texted for non-emergency items. I couldn’t take sick time when I got covid. 

As you imagine, I’ve completely burned myself out. I don’t think I can handle corporate politics. I can’t lie to further myself and what I think is right. I rely on data and what’s best for the company versus what’s best for me, and I don’t think I can change that about myself. If someone has, please give advice how. 

I have this pipe dream now of going into pharmacy school. I’d have to do a year a prereqs and then get in. I was a good student, but I’d be pausing my income for 5 years.

15t6ft3,Agency hire x direct hire,"Sorry if this is a stupid question, please be nice! It’s my first official job in the US and I’m not quite sure if this is possible.

So I was hired through an agency to be an admin assistant at a local family business for $30/hr. The company pays the agency $48/hr for me (I know this bc I was filing their invoices and saw my name on one). I have zero benefits which is fine because this is a very good learning opportunity and the pay isn’t bad for my experience; however after a trial period of 4-6 months (in reality it took 8 months for the person before me) the company would hire me permanently with benefits, unclear about my hourly rate but most likely the same or a very small increase.

My question is if it’s possible to negotiate and get to a higher rate (let’s say $40/hr as an example) asking to be hired directly (so no money goes to the agency) and with no benefits? This way I’d make more at the end of the day and they’d pay less than what they currently do.

15t6egi,Should I quit my job?,"Hi. I (19 F), work at a doggy daycare. I love dogs and animals in general, and my daycare is highly rated with many customers. I have issues with the way it is run, and I want to know whether I should quit or not. 

My first issue is that we regularly exceed capacity. Most doggy daycares from what I know have groups of 15-30, however, I have managed up to 70 in my group at once. Our facility is medium sized, but at some point it is just too many dogs. When dogs get in each others space, they get snappy and behave badly, leading to minor fights (no injuries). 

The dogs have little to no engagement, as toys may be dangerous if a dog has resource guarding issues, etc. Right now, in the yard outside, we have barely any shade and only a small baby pool. The dogs could easily overheat, not to mention the employees.

My biggest issue is that I feel like the dogs aren’t being treated well at all. We have no treats provided, no training tools, and extremely large groups. We have cow paddles that rattle to break up fights or stop a behavior, but these are our only means of regulating behavior. They have to be used constantly, and some of my coworkers hit the dogs with them. I’ve seen them genuinely hit or kick dogs after the bad behaviors have stopped, well beyond a slap on the butt or a swat. This makes me extremely uncomfortable but I haven’t spoken up because I am relatively new and I fear that my coworkers will retaliate. I have some other coworkers who feel similarly to me but we are all lower level staff and management doesn’t listen to us.

My final straw that makes me want to quit is what happened today. One of my favorite dogs was put into my group with an injury on her foot. It wasn’t super bad, but I didn’t think she should have been in group with the other 40 dogs in the room. She was shaking and clearly in pain. I was alone and couldn’t leave the dogs unsupervised, so I asked a coworker to let management know and my manager and assistant managers all said she was fine. 

When I went to take my break, I found a dog locked outside alone in the hot sun. I asked if he could come in, was told no, so I went outside to check on him. I knew he didn’t have water or a way to cool down, so I moved the water bowls into the little shade that was there and filled them with cool water. I was about to fill the baby pool when I was told I needed to come inside, despite someone covering for me in my group. It was about 90 degrees today and the yard gets hotter. Regardless of the liability issues, I didn’t want that dog suffering in the heat.

I have no power or ability to do anything about this. I feel like I should quit but I don’t have another job lined up and my parents would kill me if I was jobless for this reason. They told me that every workplace will have things I dislike, but this is on another level I feel. What should I do?",vyvanseat4am,3,0.6700000166893005,4,1692229909,2023-08-16 23:51:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15t6egi/should_i_quit_my_job/,8,2023

I was told by my manager that when annuals come around, they would get me to where I wanted to be which was 5 months from then. Raises come and I didn't get what I wanted. The higher ups in the company said no he was just given a raise even though it was for a promotion. I said OK I understand, my manager didn't have a say in it at that point as it was his bosses' bosses' boss basically. He then says I will get you an out of cycle to get you what you deserve. I said OK. Fast forward I have seen a couple people get out of cycle raises who don't get me wrong absolutely deserve it. I also saw someone who got fired about a month after receiving an award get a big raise despite having extreme attendance issues. Fast forward some more we hire someone on my team to be only 2k under me.

On the interviews I’ve been to so far, my short tenure at the last job keeps coming up, and I’m unsure what to say about it.

15t0ydd,Completely Lost,"Hello Everyone; I am about to finish my master's degree in kinesiology in December, and I feel like I made the wrong career choice. I am 24 years old and still trying to figure out if physical therapy school is the correct choice for me. I have been looking at how much it will cost to become a physical therapist. Currently, I have no debt and want to avoid it at cost. I am now trying to join the national guard to help pay for school. However, it will take a while to get in due to some medical issues, but it will take at least six months to get an idea if I can get waivers. This waiting period is going to result in my classes needing to be updated, and I would have to retake them to keep them current for PT school. I would use the GI bill to pay for my PT degree once I finish BMT and AIT. I am getting pressured by my spouse, parents, and in-laws on what my next steps are. I can understand their viewpoint because I already have Bachelor's and soon a master's degree. I love Kinesiology, but not going to PT school will make me unable to support myself and my future family. I thought about making a career change to nursing since I have taken biology, anatomy and physiology, and chemistry. Still, if I made this switch, I would feel like I wasted my parent's money and time. Any advice? PT school is going to cost 150K, and the starting salary for PT is 70-75K.

I have an overall team lead who is a manager and also a workstream lead that is a level above me. I read that for this extracurricular, you would typically ask the manager to do the review. However, the manager hasn’t been as involved in the day to day as the workstream lead. They have seen some of my work though. 


I am thinking I should reach out to the manager to confirm. I am a little nervous because I’ve heard you should set up meetings before requesting a review and I haven’t. The deadline to request the review is Friday, so I don’t really have enough time to ask for a meeting now.

15swc4r,How the heck did you figure out what career you wanted to pursue?,"Hello everyone. I’m genuinely asking this because I feel so lost. I’m a 27F and I’ve had a variety of jobs in the last few years. I’ve always left jobs of my own accord minus one in fall of 2022 where I got let go due to layoffs. 

To give some background, I have my Bachelor of Arts in Kinesiology. I thought I wanted to be around athletics, but knew I didn’t want to be an athletic trainer or physical therapist (I interned with both) just because they weren’t for me. 

I’ve had a variety of jobs including coaching girls’ soccer, personal training, strength coaching, caregiving, briefly a business development rep, TA at a middle school, briefly at a financial firm before I got laid off due to cutbacks, and now I’m currently in AP in a corporate office. (Yes, I know I’ve been all over the place. COVID really made me rethink everything.)

I took the current job I have out of necessity after getting laid off. It’s stable and I’ve got health insurance. In no way am I ungrateful for this job. It’s been a relatively positive environment and it’s predictable task-wise.

However, I do see myself doing something else. I don’t know what to pursue yet, but I know I won’t be doing this current job in the long run. I know I do like some variety in tasks throughout my day and I’m very social and good at connecting with people. 

I guess my question is, how do you figure out what type of career interests you? I feel pretty lost right now. Not sure I want to go back into athletics due there not being much money in it career-wise unless you’re coaching at a very high level.

Feel free to send me a DM if you are looking for someone if you are at all interested or struggling in your career. In your message include a little bit about yourself, what problems you’re facing, and what type of help you want.  


  
**What’s the catch?** It’s completely free. There is no cost to you besides your time. I enjoy teaching/mentoring. I have a lot of free time now so I’d like to use that time to help anyone who might be struggling at the moment.  


  
**Why should I trust you?** When I first started my journey I made $9/hr at Bed Bath & Beyond. I managed to switch careers to become a software engineer. It was not easy. I had to go back to school. 10 years later It has been the best decision I’ve made in my life. It took me about 4 years to make the switch. I am most proud of my brother though. With my guidance, my brother became a software engineer able to do it in 7 months! His first salary was $115k.  


  
I started my career as a software engineer working on the product side then specialized in distributed systems (SRE/DevOps). Most recently, I worked at Twitter on a team managing 500k servers. I’ve worked for startups in the past  to build customer facing products. When I signed at Twitter, I managed to negotiate a compensation package >$250k. Therefore I can help guide you to get the salary you want.  


  
I am a person of color which brings its own unique challenges in the industry. If anyone is having those types of obstacles at work or when trying to enter the industry.  


  
**Who would be a good fit?** If you are struggling in the industry, if you feel aimless, if you just need to vent, shoot me a DM!  


  
**Who would NOT be a good fit?** Anyone with immigration or H1B issues. All my advice is about the USA job market.

15svef4,Aerospace: Technician to Software Engineer,"My work history: 

Began 4 years of service in the Navy as an aviation machinist’s mate in 2017. Essentially a power plants technician/mechanic on F/A-18’s. Contract ended in May of 2021.

Hired on as a Test Operations Technician for a major aerospace company in August of 2021. I work in a research & development program where we test rocket engines daily. I’m primarily tasked with performing all hardware work on certain engines we want to test for data, sometimes even building engines from the ground up. 

Today is my two year mark at this company. While I am passionate about my work and reap many different benefits from this job, I’ve had lingering thoughts that I do not want to be stuck working a VERY physically demanding job for the rest of my life. I am the youngest member of our team by far - I’m in my early 20’s, while the others are in their mid 30’s/early 40’s. After asking many of my team members about their work history, I’ve found that they’ve done similar work their whole life. While I do respect them very much and admire their passion, I cannot get over the fact that after all that time and experience, they ended up in the same position as me. And they will be working in these conditions for the foreseeable future. (At least 50 hrs/week, working outside all day, etc.)

I’ve decided I want to stay in aerospace but move to a software engineering position, or something of the sort. I believe my experience working directly with aircraft/spacecraft directly will be looked upon highly and be useful for this decision.

I do not have any college education, but I’m ready to make a move. I’m freshly 25 years old and I want to begin this transition sooner than later. I’m making this post today in search of advice, to spark conversation and gather thoughts from anyone who has similar experience of any kind.

15suwac,Debating quitting now or finishing out two weeks notice,"
I recently accepted a job offer and have an official start date on the calendar. Everything is finalized except waiting for the background check to come back (which will come back clean). I put in my two weeks with my current employer and all that’s left is an exit interview with HR. My leaving doesn’t initiate another hire since they hire groups of people all at once for training so they’re not using the two weeks notice to look for a replacement. If I follow through with the two weeks I will leave in good standing and be eligible for rehire down the road. I really don’t see that happening. I’m leaving because of the schedule and pain it’s been giving my back so I don’t intend to go back and start all over. 

Should I follow through with the two weeks notice and leave in good standing, or quit now and have the next 10 days off to myself before starting the next job? As it is now, my first day with the new company will start immediately after my last day with the company I’m leaving so I’m tempted to use this break as I don’t see myself taking days off with the new job for a while.

Hi all,

I'm in a lost situation. After obtaining my degree in Information systems, I started my role as a technical support analyst which I didn't want to do but I just couldnt find a job for long time. But it was a really good experience for two years, as it was a hybrid role, was involed in other aspects as well.

I then decided to move on to a much bigger global company, like Delloite, Cognizant and etc, as a Junior Software Engineer. I dont really come from a development background but I thought it would be good experience in that kind of field. But I didnt really like development work, it's just not for me. I attempted many times to like it but never worked out. I am more of a client facing and analysis person, with less technical stuff (no coding basically). 

I've in that role for over 1.5 years, until i was laid off because of the current crisis. This was an opportunity for me to find a role that I am more inclined to. I've been applying to Business Analyst and Product management roles. I am really interested in those roles and I believe I've what it take to do the job. But i've had ZERO luck to find roles in that field. Theyre all junior roles too. My CV is quite good in my opinion, as I have currently 4 years experience, and 2 certfications, well formated with the correct key words. I always tailor my CV according to the job I apply to. 

I've been doing online training (youtube) too, but i cant really put that in my CV. And I was looking into getting certifications but I just cannot afford to do them, they're very expensive. If I had a job then i would have been brave enough to comit to them. 

At the moment I just dont know what to do. I dont want to go back to technical support, just didnt enjoy it.

Honestly I have no clear direction for where I want to take my career next. Would love to hear any ideas especially from others who have worked BDR/ADR/SDR jobs in the past and moved on to another career path from there!

15srmvf,Should I switch my job out within a year after joining,"Hi,
I've recently graduated from college and my bachelor's degree in in computer science. All throughout college I've honed my coding and software engineering skills even leading some coding societies for a year.

Recently I started a job at a really big company but I've been feeling like I wanna switch jobs as early as 3 days into the onboarding.

This company came to my college for campus placements for the role of ""Associate IT engineer"" and my interview was completely software development related too.

I got hired only to be told when I got here that I'd be working in ""quality assurance and testing"" instead of any actual software development. I doubt there's any serious coding work here either from what my managers have told me.

I've been told that I can switch roles to software engineering within a year but given that this company's main product isn't software itself and they give it little priority I wish to not only switch roles but also companies. 

The earliest I can make a switch is one year.
Should I make the switch or am I thinking too deep into it?",Citizen_fore,1,1.0,1,1692196571,2023-08-16 14:36:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15srmvf/should_i_switch_my_job_out_within_a_year_after/,8,2023

15sr3oj,Taking a job at a questionable company,"Hey, so I would really love some advice about this and I'll try to keep it short. First a little context: I've been working as a writer for a couple of years (I graduated college about four years ago so still relatively early in my career). Anyway, I took a job at a click-baity, not very respectable company in 2021 because I needed a job and didn't really have any career direction just a couple of editorial internships that helped me get my foot in the door. A year later, and after a lot of thought, I enrolled in a certificate course to change industries. The course is finally wrapping up next week. The company I currently work for offered me a promotion to a position that is more in line with what I've been training for. My original thinking was that I'd take this job and use the title as a stepping stone while immediately beginning to look for something better. However, after reading some glass door reviews calling it embarrassing to have on a resume, I'm having second thoughts. d  
My question is this: how bad does it look to work for a company that is not very respected within its industry if you want to change industries? My experience at this place has been fine. Everyone I've worked with has been nice enough and my only real complaints would be the pay isn't great and the work isn't particularly interesting. I've never really been proud to tell people I work here, but at this point I'm worried its actually damaging and that I should just quit before I move deeper into the company for fear it will blacklist me to future employers.",No_Zone944,1,1.0,1,1692195261,2023-08-16 14:14:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15sr3oj/taking_a_job_at_a_questionable_company/,8,2023
15spvif,Are these normal or red flags?,"I'm(22F) an intern hired for a project (let's call it Project A) under a one-year contract. This is my first office job after graduating so I'm not sure how things usually are in office setting, but I can't help but wonder if some things are supposed to be like this, since they don't sit right with me... but please let me know what you guys think, cuz I might be not used to them or overthinking them!

1) Line manager (who is also the project manager) asked to start looking for roles on the second or third month I started working. And everytime I ask him about my progression after this internship, whether there's any permanent role for me after this (or possibility my contract being renewed for another year), he always says the same thing ""You can check the career portal and apply to roles you want (in which there is no suitable roles for me). Or ask around if they have any empty spot.""

2) Big responsibility, lack guidance and support.
I'm being tasked to lead a (priority) parent item, which is fine if there's enough support. But everytime I ask something I don't know about, team lead tells me to ""ask around"". And when I asked him to mention a name to get started, he asked me who I know. ""Use your contacts, then!""
I was stunned. I think it's reasonable to ask for someone who can help me with my work if he is too busy with his work. And he's a 10 years senior so he might get some idea who is best to go to, right? And if that someone can't help I can ask for more contacts and be directed to more people. It's not like I will stay still!

3) Criticised for not looking enthusiastic enough without given any examples.
Manager mentioned this during our 1:1. It's true that I've been burnt out and downcasted due to personal reasons, but I am still delivering the work I'm being asked to do. I never leave my reaponsibilities behind. And I thought I hid my face well turns out I was just that easy to read. I should have asked for examples of when I seem unenthusiastic, but I was again, too stunned by his comment. Thought as long as I deliver my work, everything else shouldn't matter at all, especially about how I am presenting myself and all.

These are the things I can think of for now. So, what do you think? And how should I react or deal with the bad feelings I have in my gut?",doffyote,2,1.0,2,1692192327,2023-08-16 13:25:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15spvif/are_these_normal_or_red_flags/,8,2023

15sp7zi,Is it a good idea to switch jobs and positions? IT Project Manager to IT BA,"Hello, I'm 23 years old and I have been working as an  IT project manager for around 3 years. 

Currently, I am employed in a local processing company that mainly works with banks. I am very underpaid but considering my age and experience, I was eager to close my eyes on this fact for the sake of getting a job and position in a field that I am passionate about.

However, for the last 3-4 months, I feel like I deserve a financial raise. I have talked to my employer about it and he said the following:

""You work great, there's no doubt about that. I would've given you a raise long before you started this conversation but currently, we don't earn from our operations. We are waiting for investors that are supposed to join us in July. After that, we can talk about this"". It is mid-August now and there's still nothing. I haven't raised this question again because I did not want to put any pressure on them, considering the fact that it is hell to find a job in my country. 

However, recently I've applied to a BA position in a better place that is about to send me an offer. 

I plan to approach my employer with this offer and say that if there is no raise then I will have to leave for a better financial opportunity since I am in a very big need of money at the moment. I live with my parent and I am the only one working. So, everything is on me along with my Master's education. 

So, the main question is whether I should switch from IT PM to IT BA just for the sake of a better paycheck and future career growth or should I endure my current situation and hope to eventually get a raise in my current workplace?

15solzv,Is it ok to mention other employee's word when asking about vacation eligibility or something?,"Because this  my first full time employed company, I hardly know about how long it would usually be to be qualified for a paid vacation in the United States, but recently I heard from someone in different department who started working here few months earlier than I did last year that he got notified that he could now use the vacation after he's worked about 6 months at this company. But I have never heard anything from the HR dept or from my manager about it yet even if I have been working here very close to one year(I started working here since September, last year.).

&#x200B;

It's pretty much frustrating that nobody but only someone in non HR department told me about that in a thought that it seems this company distinguishes me from someone like him regarding the department, actually not only me but my coworker as well for the same web developer team. I strongly feel like this company only considers highly valuable for the lab workers and doctors because it's a total lab company.

&#x200B;

So, I would like to ask about if I'm now eligible to use a paid vacation week now or how longer I should wait for it if not. I can't take a non paid vacation or something right now because I'm the only one who can make money to live both for myself and my mother who is unable to work until she gets disk surgery and restores from it for 3-6 months.

&#x200B;

Should I just ask about myself for the vacation eligibility or is it ok to mention the man who already got qualified for paid vacation if the HR department says I'm not yet eligible? I'm not going to say who said that, his name or something, I'm just going to say like ""That's what I heard."", or ""That's the way I know it usually works here."" if I can and need to.

&#x200B;

It would not hurt me in any way or result just to ask things about this, would it?

15smetz,I (19M) am in my 3rd year of college and my life is going nowhere. I am confused so can anyone help me ?,"I am currently studying computer science in a very good college in my country. Its my 3rd year here. My academic life is horrible here. For the first 2 years of my college I could not do anything good. I did not join any club. Did not participate anywhere. Just stayed in my room and wasted time. My CGPA is also very low (6.54) which scares me a lot. I am thinking that I won’t get any kind of placement which is really scaring me.

  
My coding and projects are none and I am kind of a dumb person. I am obese and have very few friends. I have been trying to code but it's been a massive failure. I have been trying to code since last September but I have gotten nowhere. I have started sometimes but it mostly ends up being a failure. Neither my academics are good. I have been a lacklustre student my whole life. The only achievement I have is scoring 99 in my 10th grade math exam. But again 7 people scored a 100 in my school so it’s not that big of a deal. From that point onwards I have been nowhere and have done nothing good. Covid came when I started my 12th grade and it basically destroyed me. Yes many people did well despite of covid but covid for me was a disaster. I take full responsibility for being mediocre.  
Coming to now. I have been trying to do competitive programming to try to somehow redeem myself but I have just given 1 or 2 coding tests in which I could just solve 1 or 2 easy problems. It's hell for me elsewhere. If my academics were good and coding were not I could have at least done something but neither of them are good. A lot of people in my college have done much better than me. Since the start of the year I have been trying to make one web development project but have failed miserably. The best I could do is learn HTML. I have been told to do leetcode but I have just solved 3 questions compared to the 100s of questions my friends/fellow college mates have done. I don’t know what to do or what path to take.

  
I had set targets like by this point I would have done that and what not but have not been able to do anything. Sometimes I feel like I should not have taken up coding and done something in the finance field. My math was good till 11th and then covid came and I lost everything that I had academically.  
The internship session has started at my college but I have not been able to apply to most of them since they ask for 7 CGPA+ . I never thought this would ever happen but not that surprised about this too given how mediocre I have been in studies my whole life. I really wish I was smart enough to study and succeed on my own like many of my friends have been but I have been nowhere. There are some companies which ask for 6 CGPA+ but since I have not done anything I am too scared to register + I think they would immediately reject me and would never get shortlisted seeing my CGPA. My vivas have gone horrible and I am really bad at communicating with people.

  
After all this my idiotic brain still has some hope and has set some impossible targets. I feel like its over but then I realize where I am and think maybe not. I want to get to Candidate Master (1900) on Codeforces and reach very high on leetcode before the placement session. Although I think I have no way of getting there, my stupid mind keeps on believing in these kinds of stuff. I want to create 2 good projects that I can show to the interviewers and I want to use some modern framework and put a unique feature in them. And of course I want to improve my CGPA.

  
I am almost certain I won’t be able to achieve any of these promises but still my hopeful mind has seen dreams and I feel like I cannot give up on those dreams. I have been using reddit a lot recently and really hope something good can come out of this. Can anyone tell me what I should do with life ?

15sina1,I am offered an in-person job in the Bay Area. My partner refuses to live near there at all.,"I am about to graduate with my master’s this fall and have a fellowship offer with an organization I’ve interned with before. 

I have been asked if I’m open to a position in Northern California, specifically the Bay Area/Silicon Valley. I am originally from the East Coast and said I’d prefer the Central Valley part of the state as that’s where I interned before and am more familiar with (~70 miles east of SF). However, if the fit/opportunities were right I’d be willing to consider Bay Area. 

My partner said “Absolutely not. I don’t want to live there.” when she heard that. My partner and I have been together for 2 years and was there at the beginning of grad school. Her reasons for avoiding the Bay Area are: crime/homelessness, traffic almost all the time, exorbitant cost of living, lack of affordable housing, and crowds. I agree with all of them, those are all valid points. However, I’d be willing to put up with it for a year if it was a better opportunity before trying to find a full-time position within the organization in Central Valley. The Central Valley may or may not have something available for me at this time. 

I’m struggling to balance my own career ambitions with my partners’ wants. If I were to accept, I’d be leaving our current state and she’d be uprooting herself and her pets and moving with me across the country. She’s not married to the East Coast and is ok with Central Valley in CA, but wants to avoid populous areas like LA/Bay Area for the reasons mentioned above. I assured her we’ll make sure to have a job and housing for the both of us lined up in California before we actually move, but I’m so conflicted. The only positive thing to the Bay Area in her eyes is that it’s very LGBTQ+ friendly (we are both females). 

In a perfect world, my ideal choice would be in Central Valley and include a great mentor, coworkers, early career/growth opportunities, and best fit. I want to at least explore and consider what the Bay Area position has to offer, but don’t want to seem like I’m disregarding my partner’s wishes by doing so. 

Any advice? This is the first time I’ve had this with any relationship.",Material-Hippo4,4,0.75,18,1692170495,2023-08-16 07:21:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15sina1/i_am_offered_an_inperson_job_in_the_bay_area_my/,8,2023

Up until class 9th i used to get at least 60+ out of 80 in physics and bio. I score 70+ when it comes to eng litrature and history
I do like physics and maths and bio but i dont perform well in maths.
I used to get like 30–40 in maths


I always thought i ll be able to pull myself back up if i ll study properly
After coming to class 10th i put in a lot of effort. Our school has an icse curriculum. Our school is a bit different. For class 10th and 12th they take half yearly exams in june. They dont give us holidays. They call us on sundays. So naturally since it was half yearly the course was huge for us to cover in 3 months. 

I studied and practiced maths still i got like 49/80 . Same with physics. My grades dropped further. I managed to get 60+ in bio though. I got 70+ both in eng lit history hindi and geography

I have to earn quickly that's why i want to opt for pcm. My older brother is already an aspirant. I cant afford to be a burden for my parents.i come from a middle class family . I want to support my mother. If i take pcb then it will take forever for me to start earning plus considering the cutt off this year  i am even more scared.



With these grades can i still go for jee exams? considering how much competiton is there?

The people who qualify jee exam are brilliant. With me being just an average student can i still go for pcm? Are there average people like me who cleared jee exams?",penguinyx,0,0.5,0,1692169821,2023-08-16 07:10:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15sifre/can_i_still_give_jee_exams/,8,2023
15siaan,Is this a sign of toxic management?,"Managers behaviour seeking support.

Hi,

Just hoping someone could provide me some advice really about a couple of issues I am having at work. I have been in my job since last December. In between this time, we have been given a new manager who previously was the same grade as me but in a different department and now has been given a team leader role in my department.

This individual started in post and at first appeared very friendly. Now however, I feel some cracks are starting to show.  This person has set staff targets which is completely understandable but each staff members target is different. I have a higher target to reach than my peers and I am struggling to reach this target. Half of my other peers do not half targets, some do, some don't each a different number mine being the highest out of my peers and my number keeps increasing I'm starting to feel drowned in work. I have spoke about this and he feels its realistic. 

Next - he has decided that my colleague that I am friendly with is a bad influence on me and has informed me we cannot collaborate at work. He has told me I have to do different office days to this colleague ( I work a hybrid job) and if occasion we are in on the same day I have to sit next to my manager only. This has become quite awkward as my colleauge doesn't understand why I'm suddenly avoiding them and changing my office days.

The other day, after reflecting on my managers comments I decided to go into the office on a quiet day find an isolated bank of desks put in my head phones and get on with my work. I recieved some excellent feedback from management higher up and felt proud of myself. Only to later on that day for my current manager to contact me and advise that due to my actions of that day I was creating a icy atmosphere in the office by isolating myself. 

The following day, I chose to sit next to a different colleauge ( colleauge2) in which he is now also saying that this different colleague is also a bad influence on me and I need to stop associating with this colleauge alongside my other colleague I mentioned earlier. Again this is difficult for me as people don't understand why I'm not mixing at work. 

This manager keeps saying that I have a bad judge of character and that the people I'm associating with are deceiving. He has now changed all his office days to the days I am in and demands I sit next to him each day I am in. I feel like im a school child and finding it very suffocating. 

Please can someone advise me, how to approach this situation.",pixie37890,2,1.0,1,1692169332,2023-08-16 07:02:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15siaan/is_this_a_sign_of_toxic_management/,8,2023
15si816,Think I chose the wrong internship. Can I salvage it?,"I’m an aerospace engineering student (got the bachelors degree, halfway through the masters degree) in a popular European uni. I have a lot of hands on experience and a lot of skills apart from what I learned in uni and courses, so I’d say I have a decent CV. However, I’m not an EU citizen (I’m also a girl).

I was struggling to find an internship in the space industry so I’ve taken up one at an aircraft engine manufacturing and repair company but I’m in a department that does systems engineering and a little bit of software development. I’m not really getting nearly as much technical work as promised in the description. However, they say it’s because I chose a very short period (over the summer of a couple months). 

I’m a bit worried that I won’t stand out anymore as many of my European peers are getting valuable experience in the space industry. Should I just use my free time to do more courses and develop my skills (like my own CFD projects) I have a very niche interest in the space field and my internship is not related to it at all. Would I have a decent chance at getting a job in that field still or should I work on getting more valuable internship experiences where I’d apply and learn skills closer to my field of interest?",tkilla00,3,1.0,0,1692169154,2023-08-16 06:59:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15si816/think_i_chose_the_wrong_internship_can_i_salvage/,8,2023

Honestly, I feel like I am a slave to money & life. That I am working for money rather than making money work for me.

I want to do something that makes me obsessed & in return my hard efforts are rewarded.  I want to be my families first generation of 'wealthy'.

15sgzz8,How would you go about this?,"My boss and I had a discussion a few months ago where I thought I was bringing a solution to a problem I identified. My guess is that, being a new manager, the fact that we (8 teammates across three territories) weren't hitting our goal made her accuse me of not having business acumen for waiting 6 weeks into the quarter to identify a problem. Nevermind that she approved our quarterly business plan three weeks prior to this. We had a 2.5 hour discussion that was fairly heated about my work ethic. No bad language and we were at a coffee shop so it was like whisper arguing with me defending her accusations. Anyway, from that day forward she's had it out for me. My partner and I compare notes and follow up with each other's calls so we basically have all the same metrics. We'd also been reassured that due to how challenging COVID made our positions there weren't any standard metrics to hit anymore and to focus on quality calls. Well now apparently I'm not hitting metrics and kpi's. When I ask what my targets are I'm asked back what I think they should be. Same with participation in team meetings even though I'm the second most vocal in the group always willing to volunteer to role play or add insights. My mid year review came and I got grilled. She manipulated and contorted facts to fit her narrative that I'm a terrible employee and she and her boss tasked me with writing a ""detailed"" document about how I was going to improve my performance. I don't even know what my performance targets are. I have no idea how I'm supposed to write this document beyond highlighting all the things I've done which would be seen as another one of her ""examples"" of how I'm insubordinate.  She cc'd the VP and hr director in her recap of our mid year and had the nerve to say she's committed to assisting me with my performance, even though she doesn't answer any of my questions. She says continued sustained performance is the expectation. Nothing more though. Reddit how would you respond with this task?

TLDR: What angle do you take in writing your own performance improvement plan?

In stick/gas welding class, I have issue seeing the puddle, I’m left handed, and I know to tilt my electrode about 45 degrees but I sometime even sit too far to see it or I just can’t be consistent in how I should position my stick or torch, t joints are the hardest for me, flat I can do that no problem, oxyacetylene welding it’s similar, I’m not sure how far or whether I push or pull either. 

The instructor in our class doesn’t go over the work angle or travel angle in detail or he just does it one time before we go into the shop, but for my mind that’s not enough I want to a better way to approach it, cause my basic welding class was fast paced, it was 4 weeks of stick and 4 weeks of oxyacetylene, I felt like I had to redo a couple welding assignments and fell behind, cause of arc sticking or sometimes going to high or low or welding a beam spaced to far and it really screws with my negative feed back system and wether I’m capable of welding or doing any trade in general.",Xboxrrod,1,1.0,2,1692164443,2023-08-16 05:40:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15sgs9u/i_have_adhd_and_trying_to_get_into_trades_but_im/,8,2023
15sgfem,Help with salary negotiation.,"I received a verbal offer from the hiring manager and am preparing to negotiate higher.

I previously said my expectations were 118k base and they responded with ""that's a little high"".  Even though their posted salary range is 90k-137k.

They verbally offered 100k + 20 days PTO.  

My masters degree and years of experience exceed the ""preferred requirements"" and I have worked with this group in the past as well, so I have direct experience with this role.

I was promised a salary range with a low estimate of double what I’m currently taking home.

 We are a new branch and the owner has barely helped us or trained us in sales. I’m currently the #1 salesperson and worry immensely about every potential sale because of how much we rely on commission. The salary pay is not enough to live in our HCOL. The owner is also ditzy and micromanages us which is huge time waster. I’ve become incredibly assertive with him and set clear boundaries in a polite way. Right now I’m actually just pissed off that he lied. I’m tired of being stressed about money, my whole life. I don’t want to hurt my career options by quitting this job too soon. What should I do?

I won't get into that story, in short I chose the wrong career.I did land an interview at Dunkin Donuts

just not going to bring up I worked at a Dunkins before, because it's not really relevant after such a long time. I can do ride shares, but the taxes and damage to my car wouldn't be worth it in the long run.  
I'm also a very socially awkward person, so I'm not the best when it comes to interacting with customers. The only reason why I kept my first Dunkins job years ago, the owner liked me because I was willing to go to three of his other locations when no one else wouldn't.  
I am fortunate to have a job that meets my expenses, but I shouldn't have to work two jobs to survive and make more money. I really screwed up with my profession I chose.

15sf5vh,Disability Rights Blues,"Took an internship in fundraising at a nonprofit this summer.
Got tasked with a series of projects that increasingly added up to building the organization’s entire approach to Accessibility. Taught the event team how to plan accessible events, wrote a 30 pg. guide. Stuff like that. Stuff other interns were very much not doing.

Asked to single-handedly create an entire presentation for the salaried staff of the org.
Which I did but tbh I don’t have the full training to do it right ,and with my current disabilities that kind of thing is exhausting for me. I’m not working as an Accessibility Consultant. I’m a grad student. You know?

Two weeks before the presentation was scheduled I got a bad mid-internship review from my supervisor, like “can’t follow directions and struggles with communication” bad. So I’m sitting there building a training for their entire staff for zero extra pay besides my internship stipend and this lady can’t even give me a good eval.
Plus I had to insist, INSIST, that she give me credit on the review for the projects that I had done. Like she wrote “supported the team to do x project” on 2 disability projects that I led and did 85%.

Some more equally terrible things happened.
I’m now trying to insist the organization pay me market rate for at least 2 specific disability projects I did since I literally trained their staff, hr-long trainings, as an intern.

15sef0x,"Was recommended for a promotion, i dont know if it makes sense.","I was recommended for a promotion. I am currently inside sales and this will be for an outside sales position where i visit customers instead of making phone calls. This is typically the logical next step for someone in my position and many dont get to even make this jump and get tossed to other places. I was told by the guy leaving that he recommended me for it and i have a good relationship with my wouldbe boss. But there are several things holding me back from pushing this issue as i didnt apply for it or ask him about even when i knew this was opening up two weeks ago.  


Hesitations: 

It seems that i make more money now. I am projected to be in the 130-150 range this year. My counter parts are somewhere in the 90s. I am performing well this year and i am confident i can consistently make 105 plus. He let his pay slip when i rode with him two years ago at 100-105 so it seems i wont have a huge pay upgrade.  


Demand from the customers is much higher leveled than currently. I deal with mostly small customers with small needs and these are large customers who expect alot of you. I feel 7/10 confident about handling the big situations but also i do feel like i will learn that with time.   


It will cost me money as i have to buy a nice new truck (actual requirement for the job) and the stipend seems to be around 600 a month. A new nice truck will cost alot more than that even if i get the stripped down versions.   


I turned down a high paying sales job just a month ago due to its location. Im worried about going through the interview process again to say no to a job that is home, but doesnt pay enough financially. Then i think people stop thinking about me for these things.   


My ideal next position would be my own manager's position and i think this takes me away from that and will line me up on the operations side of things over the marketing side which i feel more passionate about.

&#x200B;

Lastly there is an open position for a counterpart of my potential new boss for a different region. I have thought hard about applying for that. Even though i am slightly underqualified (i have been in similar management positions in similar companies but i am at the top dog of the industry now) i feel good about performing that job but not necessarily convincing others i can.   


&#x200B;

Pros:  
Freedom from the office and from an hourly commitment. I can work when im needed and be off when i need as long as im available by phone.   


More status. This is a more respected position and might have better access to routes i could go.  

&#x200B;

I dont know what the difference in earning potential is actually. I know this past guy was not good at his job but his territory seems like it has the potential. I'll get higher commissions but lose my hourly which is apprx 70k a year. I am going from 600 customers to 60 so less to manage but also more exposure to being vertical. But there should be upside to these large customers as they do alot. I go from managing about 600k of revenue a month to 350k which seems less even if commission is higher.  


My current boss is from marketing and hasnt been in the field. They come up with the dumbest incentives and they dont manage situations well. They did a contest for first to grow a specific product by 40% from May YTD. but the contest was told to us and started July 1st since June numbers werent available yet. Well one of the salesmen naturally hit that before the contest even started. So even though i did hit my 40% the first week of july ( i had to grow by 60k he had to grow by 6k) i didnt get the bonus. And the team goals are grossly miscalculated and never matches up when i keep records.   
This boss is nice and doesnt micromanage, but neither does the potential new boss.  Im just trying to impress that my current boss doesnt get it and i feel like im hearing nonsense left and right and making it harder to do my job instead of enabling my current success.   


lastly on pros: i dont know what each year will bring incentive wise at my current job. Ive been able to take advantage of the current ones well. But its likely they nerf things to encourage people like me to take this kind of position in the future. It seems im low on the totem pole but outperforming and earning most people at my branch. I found out today that im even outearning some machine salesmen.   


1. should i go through the interview process if i feel like ill have to say no?  

2. should i take this if offered?

15sdjrt,Overtime Predicament,"Hello all,

I hope you all had a great Tuesday! I come to you all with a question. I am a young man in my early 20’s doing IT. I’ve been with this employer for about 2 years and things were going well up until a few months ago. For clarification, the environment needs a lot of work, so I’ve been consistently doing overtime since I started. My overtime hours have not fluctuated much, about 10 a week, but I have recently been getting scolded about doing OT. But when I don’t answer calls on nights and weekend and don’t go in to solve problems, I get scolded. This is going to continue until I either resign or they fire me presumably. I’m really upset about this considering I’ve made a lot of great changes and improvements and really have overextended myself and haven’t visited home in some time. I’m starting to become very stressed and depressed outside of work as well. I know most of you will tell me to quit, that’s about where I am with the situation as well. Is there any way I can advocate for myself to make this better for both parties? I understand they are probably upset for having to pay OT, but I’m also upset that they don’t understand that my role and our current situation require it.

Thoughts? Concerns?

Thank you all, have a great rest of your week.",Reasonable_Bad_5491,1,1.0,0,1692154655,2023-08-16 02:57:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15sdjrt/overtime_predicament/,8,2023

15sd14a,Questioning my major in college,"Hi everyone. First off I just wanna say thank you to anyone is reading this and I’m just asking for a little bit of advice for a future career path.

Currently, I’m in school to become a child life specialist but I’m having some doubts because I definitely feel like I could go good for the first five years and then the stress and complexity of it could really get to me and I really wanna go into a job every single day that I love and I look forward to going to. A lot of the things that I like to do in my free time I feel like wouldn’t really be something that I can make a career out of because it’s really hit or miss.

If anyone has any ideas of careers based on my following interests that would be greatly appreciated or if you have any advice.

Some of my interests are :
~ content creation (I am a content creator and I make good part time income but nothing at the moment that I could make a full time living out of unless something happens in the future)

~ I love fashion but I’m really into 80s fashion so I feel like that would be very relevant to nowadays fashion

~ I love art and I love to make things I have a small business on Etsy where I sell resin keychains and more

~ I love working with children

~ I am a very outgoing and extroverted human

~ I love movie production and acting, but I know that acting as a very hit or miss because most people that’s part of the actors don’t make it in the industry

~ I’m a very sympathetic person

~ I love doing things in front of a camera and talking to different audiences

~ I would love my work to be impactful to others and inspire others and I also want to help out people the best that I can it make a difference in peoples lives.

~ I find psychology very fascinating and I also like to know why people do things

If you need any more information, I can definitely give you some but I am a junior in college and I am on the child life track, but I’m starting to have a little bit of doubts. I know my interests are all over the place which is why I’m having a really hard time and choosing specific things to go about my future career path. Any help would be greatly appreciated and thank you so much for your time in reading this. I hope you have a great day.

15sbqus,Decoding Fidelity CRA starting pay and remote opportunity,"Hello, and thanks for reading. This is my first post on Reddit and need some help. I recently got hired as a Claims Adjuster for a major insurer and the starting pay is 50,000.  It’s also 50% hybrid. However, I have a interview for a Customer Relationship Advocate for Fidelity but it doesn’t list the starting pay in the job post or recruiter email. It is also 50% hybrid.  I really don’t want to waste my time going through the grind of an interview if it isn’t a better situation. The interview process for Fidelity as described in the recruiter  email appears long and taxing. So I guess my questions are

1. Does anyone know the entry level pay range for CRA for Fidelity.

2. Anyone know if a specific claims field is better for virtual work or is the financial industry a better bet?

15s9fdj,Do I go with a “boring” 9-5 that still pays more than I make now? Or do I shoot for a job with a relatively more unpredictability than the 9-5 but greater financial reward?,"I’m a 4th year corporate healthcare/pharma lawyer currently practicing at a busy law firm. My current job is 9-6 in the office every day with 2 or so hours of work in the evenings. So figure 9-12 hours of work per day. I started here in February. I make $160k base plus a $10k bonus. 

I realized in July that my current career trajectory as a lawyer at a law firm was not working for me and that my current firm, while not a bad place, wasn’t compatible with my mental health or goals as a new father and husband. I decided I needed something less demanding and stressful and I also need better work life balance and time for my wife and two young kids. 

So I started looking at in house counsel roles at healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. Last week I had 7 interviews with 5 companies and this week and next week I’ll have second and third and fourth rounds with those companies. 

Two of the companies are vendor contract roles, one at a hospital and the other at a pharma company, so very stable and “boring” jobs but they pay slightly more than what I make but for better hours (both around $165k but better bonuses, 10% and 20%, and the 20% one gives equity too). Both basically 9-5 with no evening work and hybrid WFH. One is 15 minutes away from home the other is around 35 minutes so even going to the office part time won’t be bad. 

Two are start ups that pay over $200k/yr and are completely remote, subject to infrequent travel. One is a pharma company that is about to commercialize its first drug, the other is a well funded healthcare company that is already becoming established. But both may be more unpredictable in terms of the work I’m doing and hours required. Both have a room for growth but also risk given that they’re start ups. I’ll know more this week. 

And another is a totally different path (compliance counsel for a pharma company) but has stable hours and pays around $175k and is hybrid 2 days in the office which is an hour away. It’d be a decent WLB role but would change my career trajectory since compliance counsel isn’t strictly a legal counsel role. 

Out of all of the above, what would you recommend I do as someone who is a young dad looking for a fresh start suitable for WLB and raising a family?",FinancialAdvicePF,1,1.0,0,1692143882,2023-08-15 23:58:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15s9fdj/do_i_go_with_a_boring_95_that_still_pays_more/,8,2023
15s98mb,"Almost quit job of 3 months, now things may be improving?","I am 30F and just started at a new company as a Customer Operations Coordinator in May making 52k. At my previous company, I was a Global Planning Support Specialist making 44k. 

Before I accepted the offer at this company, I had a bad feeling. I saw many poor reviews online of them, stating that the company is very anti WFH, has a very “business professional” dress code, and more importantly runs very lean, overtime is necessary, not enough staff, screaming and yelling in the workplace, toxicity (my department was mentioned specifically), too much work and too demanding, no good training, never appreciated, etc.

I accepted anyway because I felt desperate and already told people about the offer.

For the first 2.5 months I sat in between two supervisors. I am a very shy and quiet person and felt disliked when I started. Many people kept telling me how I need to talk more to fit in basically. The job has a very high learning curve and it took all my concentration. I felt my managers were always too busy to help me usually, or if I did ask a question they acted annoyed and condescendingly talked to me. I even felt humiliated and yelled at before.

A month ago, my coworker who had been there since March was fired. A couple hours after he left at lunchtime, they called a department meeting and the senior manager told us our coworker was fired that day because he was behind, didn’t tell anyone, customers and sales reps complained at the sales meeting (sales seems to hate customer service which sucks), apparently lied on order entry metrics (how fast they’re entered), hid emails. The tone was very threatening and the manager went on about how we’re “done” if we enter an order after 48 hours and don’t say anything, etc. It felt very ominous and distasteful for them to spill all about why he was fired and trash his reputation. Right after that meeting, a sales rep and manager badmouthed him personally right next to my cubicle, making fun of him etc. He was always very helpful to me.

Also, this global company sends out a quarterly report to all employees on all the reasons people were fired that quarter, no names, just titles and reasons. Feels very negative and like a scare tactic.

A couple weeks ago my manager rearranged seating and put me right next to my one other coworker who is in my division, she used to be across the room. I previously thought she didn’t like me because she always was rushing over to my desk to tell me about all this stuff that’s urgent or like I’m forgetting, but I had a backlog of like 80 emails for several days because the workload is just so much. I work overtime every week but we’re only allowed 2 hours OT. She seemed rude to me too. But now that we’re sitting right next to each other, we’re getting along well, and she is very helpful. I think she was frustrated with the lack of training I was receiving being seated next to the brown nosing managers. So that’s better. She actually seems to like me, she mentioned how I better not go anywhere or apply to X company, because she needs me right there.

But yesterday, a manager came and talked extremely disrespectfully to the guy next to me, basically talking down to him very badly, saying how he’s been there a year and what does he not understand about X process, and why is he applying it to Y situation, and how it’s all very concerning, basically I got the impression he’s going to be fired soon. She talked to him with such contempt. Seemed humiliating to him.

The director this week is having us listen to an audiobook on our lunches in groups about excellent customer service. She is very sweet and great and is new to the company too, 1.5 years. Also turnover in this company is very high, a couple people have been there a long time but most between 0-2 years. She talked about how we could change our culture. 

Now I’m confused on if I should look for another job. I have a phone interview tomorrow. Maybe things could turn around. But my 3 direct managers all seem toxic.

15s7vur,Bad to leave a job after 3 months during training?,"Hi everyone, 
I’m thinking of leaving a job after 3 months during training. I have really tried to stick it out and to give it my best since it’s in my field and jobs in my field are hard to come by. I don’t know if I could continue though. During the first 2 months of  training—-training consisted of mandatory online modules in the companies’ headquarters. During the 3rd month, I was assigned to train at the actual location. However, there was no real guidance and training. The other workers have been there for 6 years, 18 years or 30 years and do not have patience to teach or train me. No one, including the supervisor, was specifically assigned to train me. I’m expected to “hit the ground running” and work without proper training. I try to ask as many questions as I can but oftentimes people say they cannot help me because they are too busy. The place is short staffed. It’s a long commute for me.The pay is low (I just took it to gain experience). People are gossipy…gives me bad vibes. They are also going to start installing cameras to monitor us (see how long we take etc). Today, one of the administrators told me in front of others that I need to “work faster and produce.” This was kinda humiliating TBH. He could have discussed privately. I was really optimistic in the beginning and tried to make it work…it seems though that I can’t “force” things to work out. Is it bad to leave a job after 3 months during training? I have nothing else lined up at this time. Thankfully, I have my family’s support. If I leave now, should I even disclose this job on my resume or no? Thank you for reading.

15s753o,How can I expand my graphic design portfolio on my own time?,"I'm a new grad who minored in graphic design (majored in Spanish). I've applied to dozens of graphic design jobs this summer, all of which were met with automated rejection emails within a couple weeks of applying or no reply at all. Now I realize just how oversaturated the market is and how weak my portfolio is, given that I only minored in graphic design and only had one internship related to it at a small company. So I decided to stop embarrassing myself and pivoted to applying to other industries, where I've actually gotten a few interviews.

While waiting for a better time to apply for graphic design jobs, how can I add to my portfolio? I don't think I'm built for freelance work. At the very least, I don't know *how* to go about building my own business and I'm not in a position right now to drop anything and learn how to do it full-time *or* on the side. Hell, I'm reconsidering my choice in degree since I came to realize in my last couple years of college that I hate working 100% remotely and I'm better in a setting where I can bounce ideas off others rather than being a full-time one-man team. So my original plan of working in translation and/or graphic design is looking... stupid, frankly.

Still, I really love the creative process of doing graphic design (and translation) work, so while I'll probably begin my professional life elsewhere, I want to keep developing my skills in case one day I change my mind about freelance/independent work or an opportunity at a bigger company near me pops up.

So how can I expand my portfolio when I'm not getting any work or school assignments? Preferably more specific advice than ""just keep creating!"" Is it worth it to design mock campaigns?

15s6qhf,Human Resources to UX Research. Advice on making this jump?,"I’m in the process of deciding what my next career step should be and everyone who knows me best in my life is telling me that UX research would be a good fit. I finally decided to look into it a few months back and decided that yes, it is pretty much everything I want out of a career.

  
My issue is that my work background right now (8+ years) is exclusively in account management and human resources. I personally see the overlap, given a lot of work I’ve done in HR is related to focus groups, interviews, sentiment gathering, and surveys. Plus the added bonus of being the person to plan the solutions/projects/programs/trainings/workshops that came out of those insights. I’m not so sure a recruiter will see that overlap, however, especially with me not having any formal research background.

I do have a Master’s degree from a communication program where about 1/3 of my instructors work in some areas of UX. Although UX is not technically considered my concentration. I also think I know more about theory than practice, as the majority of my classes have been on the psychology of UX.

15s5m9y,Feel like I’m stuck with a lack of progression options.,"Hi all (25M);

I graduated from uni last year with a Ba(Hons) in business  and management, after 6 months and 900+ applications later, false job adverts and a huge hit in confidence I settled for a job. 

I’ve currently been in this role for 9 months and it’s very basic customer service with an extremely low salary of £22k; every time I mention the opportunity of progression I’m met with ‘check the job board for potential opportunities’ which feels like I’m just going to be stuck in this endless loop. 

I don’t want to return to the constant pain of application upon application, but I feel like I’ve already outgrown the role I am in. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or past experiences which helped them?

15s4yji,Should I quit my job?,"I'm fairly weak physically and work in a highly strength demanding job. I thought this would be fine at first but then I developed immense back pain. Over time, my back became really sensitive to the slightest movement. I've been going to physiotherapy for at least 2 months now and I still have not recovered. I'm under work cover so work pays for those sessions, and my doctor keeps on giving me leaves from work. They're trying to find light duties for me but they're not actual roles or things that need to be done in my workplace. And even with light duties it's incredibly painful for me to stand up for too long. I feel guilty for suffering like that, but I can't do anything about it. I'm wondering if quitting at this point would be a bad thing, since i've been getting paid for the past 2 months while being useless. I see no signs of recovery and I'm beginning to lose hope.

15s3ww5,"Feeling stuck in my career due, but can't afford to make a change that doesn't pan out. Any advice?","I'm not usually one to post, but could really use some help figuring out this whole life thing. I'm a 31(M) with a wife 34(F) of 1 year. When I first met her 5 years ago I was managing a restaurant and I knew I wanted more from life to support all the dreams we have of a family. When we started dating I jumped into real estate and spent 4.5 years in it, doing well, but always stressed and not well enough to justify the wrench it was throwing in my personal life. That first year of real estate was so hard, and she stuck by me through it all early on, even though it was a risky chance of having that make our lives more financially stable.  
She has a stable job in healthcare that is amazing which has helped me pursue the riskier career. When the market slowed down at the end of last year, I decided it was time to call it quits on real estate as my main job, and it was a huge blow to the pride and sacrifice we had both made our whole relationship basically. I jumped into a different type of sales, digital ad sales, and the first few months I was crushing it. I've hit a sales slump recently and I feel like I'm playing repeat with my real estate career. And when sales are down, I can't help but feel my own self worth slipping away from me.  
We have been trying to start our family last year and had 2 traumatic miscarriages. The stress of that on both of us has really put us through a lot in our first year of marriage. And making a career jump to top it off. My wife is an amazing woman, and I'm lucky we both are able to handle it together. But in talking to her about how I feel recently, I know the stress is getting to her and me. She doesn't want to see this drag on for years only to jump into something else and be back at square one.  
I'm not ready to call it quits on this new job and am still trying to see it out since there a lot of positives to it versus the real estate career. The one nagging feeling I do have is that while I'm good at sales, it's not where my passion is. I love music and have been playing for 20+ years for fun. I've always felt, even in going to college, that I chose Business over music because it could afford me the option to do something with music later. But the older I get the more I feel like that was such a dumb idea to chase the money, especially because its been average, not a home run.  
And obviously being in the situation I am now trying to start a family life, I can't just jump into something music related knowing that the industry is even tougher than real estate.  
So, I'm committed to sticking it out at this job unless it really flops financially, but I need to figure out how to do something I'm happy doing and can be successful financially.  
Just looking for advice from someone wiser than me since I feel like I can't make another jump unless I know it'll be successful for my family's sake.

15s326c,Can I include my university hospital internship on LinkedIn? Please read for the context.,"I am a recent graduate from Healthcare management major (bachelor degree). It was a 4-year program and on my 3rd and 4th years we had to go to hospital of the university we chose (Uni has 8 hospitals) and do an internship there. It was included in the study program.

When I went there, I chose the branch of the hospital that was international. I was in marketing department, operations unit. It was a small office with 5 personnel. Most of the interns would just go and sit there and do no work other than sometimes bringing tea or coffee to the personnel. Not the interns fault because most of the students were dissatisfied due to personel not giving any tasks.

Well, lucky for me, my supervisor was a great man. He would give me tasks on Excel, translation of documents on Word and bring me with himself to the meeting with patients to show me how he interacted with them.

Btw, I was doing an internship at the office floor of the hospital, I didn't do it with the doctors or the nurses (that's only for medicine, nursing and dentistry students).

Also, patients would send their reports and documents/examinations from other hospital they have been at and he would print it and tell me to take the paper to the related doctor. Doctor would examine the papers and would give an approximate diagnosis and whether the foreign patient would have to come to the hospital or not. Anything extra doc would say, I would report it back to my supervisor.

My main question is, considering all of these, can I include my time in this hospital as an internship or volunteering in the LinkedIn? Keep in mind that this whole thing was part of my university major program so I didn't get paid for it but it was necessary for me to put in hours in order to be able to graduate.

I would appreciate any advice on this. Thanks!",Asthmastrolog,1,1.0,2,1692129188,2023-08-15 19:53:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15s326c/can_i_include_my_university_hospital_internship/,8,2023

15s2irz,Doing work outside my job description,"Doing work outside of job description

Hey all. So, I got hired at a small company to do some ecommerce management. Basically managing things like their Amazon account and website. I’m only about 4 months into the job with a raise to be discussed at the 6 month mark.

Maybe about a month ago, we had to create new graphics for some products. My boss had no one to do this and I told him I have some experience in photography and photoshop and that I could do it for him. I expected this to be a one time thing and I offered my skills to be curteous as I wanted to help. (I know, I know)

Fast forward to now:

Product photography, color grading and graphic design has become a pretty regular part of my job with these tasks taking entire days sometimes on top of my actual job description that I also do regularly.

Each of those 3 skills could be their own standalone position and have nothing to do with my actual job description.

I want to ask for a raise as compensation for regularly utilizing these skills and doing unrelated work but I don’t know if I’m being reasonable, mostly because I’ve only been here for 4 months.

Just looking for some advice. Is it too early or should I just ask?

Since my promotion I've been realising that I do have aspiration for a career that I enjoy and I think that probably lies somewhere in Football. Analysis, Scouting - anything of the sort that would require some sort of data analysis. I am a Maths graduate (2:1).

  
How easily would I be able to move myself over to such a role?

In the past I've been quiet at work, just doing what I've been asked to do and go home & repeat.

Lately I've been speaking up more about things that could be improved, and how it can be improved. This includes my colleagues. 

An example: Today I used someones mistake as an example in a workgroup because this mistake affected my work & consequently it affected the client as well. The reason I brought this up was because I wanted to share an idea on what we can do to prevent this from happening again the future. But now I think I might have kind of thrown this person under the bus? 

And this is just one example, I have a few more where I don't know whether I am being confident & pro-active in making sure the rules are followed, or if I'm just a shitty colleague.

It's just that speaking up is very new to me and I haven't found a nuisance/balance in how to do so without being... shitty. I just flop out words without thinking about them and it scares me because in the past I used to OVERthink everything.

15s0fa0,Advice needed on making a career-path switch-up,"Hello, 

I've recently had a real epiphany about my worklife and how I might put my current role as a freelance sports writer behind me. 

I climbed my ladder very quickly and excelled in one particular field (sports), but I've never really considered translating my skillset until now.

I'm looking at potential career paths that fit my areas of expertise + skills and I was wondering if anyone had any input on what sort of jobs I would be a good fit for.

I'll list some experience I have below and if you guys could give me a sense of where I'm at + potential jobs that could specifically work for me. 

- I was a sports journalist (opinion piece/feature writing, news reporting, and interviewing) for 3.5 years (1 full-time) at a well-regarded online sports publication. I've interviewed and written features on some of the biggest names in the sports I covered. I took in about 15 million views during that time.

- Over the last 3 years I have worked in YouTube script-writing - creating a wide range of high quality video styles that have garnered about 120 million views in that time. Documentaries, opinion pieces, more low-brow content styles, and everything in between.

- I'm a voice actor with about 3 years experience.

- I worked for 6 months as the editor of a sports website, working with a lot of SEO optimisation-related stuff during that time.


Basically, I spent the last 7 years working in this specific field - but I branched out into different content styles and formats during that time. 

Any tips or insight into how hireable that might make me for certain fields would be awesome.

I used to manage and open businesses for my past boss and loved it, even though I worked 50-60 hours a week for not much pay. When I had my daughter, I worked from home during maternity leave and did online school full-time. But after 2 months, I went back to work and had to drop out of school because I couldn't afford it.  
Soon after, my job became unsatisfying, and I started feeling disconnected and down. Since I couldn't afford to finish my bachelor's degree, I started searching for certificates/licenses I could obtain and afford. I decided to get my Real Estate License. After 2 months of classes, my husband suggested that I put in a notice to leave my then current job and just focus on getting my license. I used my savings to pay my part of the bills while I was not working. 

Fast-forward, I get my license and start working. It has been 2 months, I have poured money into this new career. More importantly, I am STILL not satisfied. My husband is also supporting us, as I have no money left. He has not one time complained, and he seems happier that I am at home more. He has also been so supportive in my journey. With out him, I would not have been able to take this leap. 

There is just one problem, I DO NOT like this new career choice! I feel so bad for being so unsatisfied. I have no reason to be. I should feel so happy and lucky that my husband has bent over backwards to support me. 

I do not know what I want to do. I do not know what I even like anymore. I feel so lost. I want to love or even just like what I do for a living. I want to be there for my family as well. I am stuck.

the big mnc has me to work 5 days a week in office where as the smaller company is hybrid. 

also, the offer letter from start up does not include the perks and benefits mentioned by the hr in it. 

which one do i pick?

I’m about a few weeks in and I know it’s early but I do NOT want to do this type of work anymore, long hours for average pay.  Unfortunately this is all my work experience up to this point, I want to start taking steps to find a new industry to work in. I have a BS in Business administration, when I was applying for new roles I did a broader search but everything I got a response back from was agency recruiting obviously and I had to take the job due to financial reasons at the time.

My question is what steps can I start taking to increase my chance of starting in a new role? I’m open to furthering my education if thats an option, any recruiters successfully leave the field?

Any tips would be great I feel very stuck.",Ofwgkta1232,1,1.0,0,1692116995,2023-08-15 16:29:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15rxgh2/taking_the_steps_to_get_out_of_recruitment/,8,2023
15rxe93,"At crossroads about the future, what should I do?","Hey everyone, 

A little bit of a background from me: I was a straight A student before entering college and that helped me secure admission in the highest ranked dept. in the highest ranked university in a major that I truly believed I would love. 

Recently completed my Bachelor's and I'm a mechanical engineer now. 
I did realize by the middle of 3rd year that mechanical engineering might not be best choice of a career for me. 

Maybe due to way too high of a study load, maybe because our department was dead set on getting our CGPA as close to 2.5 which was the grade given on average if the average was 60-75  and I, being someone who always  calculated my worth through my grades was hit pretty hard by that. I did try to improve as much as I could but my overall health was declining too and got diagnosed with hyperthyroidism which had a pretty huge side effect of anxiety. 
But all in all, I ended up with a pretty bad CGPA (2.92) which is something I deeply regret.


And now there are different fields with their own merits and difficulties that I'm looking at. And I don't know what to choose. 

Number 1: 3D Designing of Products: CAD was probably my favourite subject of bachelor's. Honestly speaking, if there is anything related to my degree that I know I do enjoy working with is CAD. And I do have intermediate to advanced knowledge in it. But I was unable to build on it much during my degree due to my own fault. When I wasn't getting the grades that I could swear I had studied for, I ended up spending a bit too much time working on my soft skills like people management, communication skills etc by being in the organizing committee of a few national events too. I know completely my fault and I am willing to put in time and effort to make it right. 


Number 2: Operations/Supply Chain Management: One good thing that came out of those events was me realizing that I am really good at management of people, doing some HR work, doing inventory management and logistics for the events and all. So I looked towards this when I applied for jobs during my last semester but unfortunately I came up short. Especially in a few companies I made it to the very last round and wasn't selected in the end. So, that is something I would love to go towards but most job postings I find in these departments want people from Business and Management side as a primary requirement. And although my chances are not zero but pretty slim. 


Number 3: Data Analytics: it is in one way or another an extension of operations job as it is a desirable skill for many employers but looking for jobs in it opens up a whole new side of IT that I'm not familiar with. I'm taking a course rn and have learnt the basics of the main softwares used frequently in data analytics but I know it's a long road ahead and will take me a long time to be on the same level as someone who learnt these skills in university. And still then might get overlooked for someone who has a degree in it.


So in short, all 3 fields have something that I really like but I'm not an expert in any of them. And as my gpa is really down, it is really up to my skills to show that I can get the job done as good as a 3.9 student.

So I'm at crossroads about which career path I should take and put all my time and energy into learning skills relevant to that so I don't end up wasting more of my time. 


Any and all advices and critisms are welcome. I truly want to get something that is the best for me and while I cannot change the past, I can learn from my mistakes and invest in a better future.",dayumbhunter,1,1.0,2,1692116830,2023-08-15 16:27:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15rxe93/at_crossroads_about_the_future_what_should_i_do/,8,2023

15rwdzi,Got a job opportunity with 1huge positive and many negatives. What do I do,"Hello people, I hope all of are having a great day. Apologies for not taking the names of companies but I think they really don't matter in this situation.

I graduated as an engineer from one of the best  university in my country 2 months ago and I was unable to land a job during the recruitment of companies in the last semester. Got to the last round of interviews for 3 really good companies but sadly couldn't make it to the final teams.
In other words, I could be a choice when they had to choose 30 out of a 1000 but couldn't when it was 2 out of those 30. 

Now I'm home, applying for jobs on linkedIn and other job posting sites. Also, I'm taking a few courses to further develop my skills so I can land a job. 


Recently, I was offered a job by a family connection that is in another country. That country is better in every way as compared to mine and will really help me in applying for and securing master's admission in a good university(that is the main goal for now). 

The problem is that the job has nothing to do with what I want to persue in masters, or what I have studied in engineering. It's closer to a customer service job. And as it comes with that type of job, The pay is really low. To the point that it will be a difficult to live on my own there. I'll probably have to share a room. And to top it off, the job shift is 11 hours. So, I cannot probably keep up with the courses or do freelancing to keep myself financially good. The minimum I need to stay at that job is 1 year. 

The alternative is I keep looking for jobs here (which is getting bleaker by the day) and complete my course and try and do freelancing during the time I'm free. 

So, that's the situation I'm in. What's the best course of action for me?",dayumbhunter,1,1.0,1,1692114514,2023-08-15 15:48:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15rwdzi/got_a_job_opportunity_with_1huge_positive_and/,8,2023

15rw5zl,Should I tell my boss I'm unhappy,"I've got my boss and then under her is a coordinator who I find annoying. He isn't my supervisor. 

He's leading a project for our team and as part of that project, one of us will have to get a special certification. I looked into the certification myself and was on a waitlist to take it, expressed interest, talked to the coordinator about it and he said it would be great for my career... And then he went and signed up himself to get it instead and the company paid for it and isn't going to pay for two certifications. 

I feel disappointed and like there isn't room on this team for me to grow. Any projects go to him because he's so ambitious; I'm just kind of a lackey. I'm generally pleased with my job, but I'm feeling disappointed now and unhappy and I especially don't want to do shit for this dumb project anymore. He offered to send me the link so I could watch the videos in there training to improve my knowledge for his project and it made me so annoyed!

Should I say anything to my boss? I'm really sensitive, and I am crying just writing this, so it will be hard for me to explain how I feel.

15rvy6u,"Scheduling Manager Cut My Hours MAJORLY + Is Unresponsive, What Do I Do??","
I work at an amazing company that provides entertainment and services for weddings/ corporate events—mainly DJ’s, live musicians, photo booths and lighting. They pay great, have awesome people, and offer great benefits. I work as an event staff/roadie, meaning I set up and break down the equipment and occasionally control the lights or photo booths. It’s an awesome job and they’re one of the best in the industry who also treat people in my position within the company very well.

The summer and fall are our biggest times of the year, and this year most recently I haven’t been getting assigned as much work as I was when I was a new and inexperienced employee. This September and October I have 3 weddings currently booked in total, while last year I had 15. 

I reached out in person to one of my managers who has worked with me plenty of times, to ask the reason why and if I can get more work, also because he used to be in charge of the schedule. He said he’s no longer in control of the schedule really, another guy who I barely have had any communication with is in control of it. He said that he’d talk to him though, and that he wasn’t aware of any deliberate reason for the amount of jobs, and to keep up my great work (because I asked if it was my performance, seeing as in the beginning I was slow to grasp the technical aspects of the job but had made a significant improvement and was worried that wasn’t being seen).

So I’m hoping to get more work, and then I see in my email that I only have 1 event offer for the entire month of October, worse than the two I was assigned in September.

To my understanding, the scheduling manager works with this manager I talked to and they have more direct communication, and the scheduling manager reports to the manager I talked to, as in he works “under him.”

Meanwhile employees newer than me are booked every weekend for these months, also because they are the DJ assistants which means they assist the DJ more directly during the event, ride the company van with the equipment to the venues, and otherwise have the same responsibilities I do. I haven’t been given this responsibility because I know I didn’t make the best first impression as someone able to take the higher responsibility, but was told by the non scheduling manager also that he himself had worked for two years only operating photobooths before he started having that responsibility. I do have faith that I’ll be trusted with it eventually, from what he told me, and that I just have to be more patient, which I’m willing to be because like I said I really do love the job. These assistants get more work as well.

Either way, everyone I talk to is busier than me, and this job is my only source of income and I’m also very passionate about it and have hopes of moving up in the company and staying with them for a long time. I ideally don’t want to look for additional work with this job because I’d rather keep my complete availability for them if they need me to fill in or do an event, because this job is so amazing and special to me that it doesn’t even feel like a job, if you get what Im saying. If I work somewhere else, I’ll miss out on potential work here and I want to work my way up to being able to be busy every weekend. Unfortunately Im considering getting another anyway bc I need the money. 

I reached out to the scheduling manager with this email asking for a chance to have a discussion, and CC’d the other manager, but he hasn’t responded. 

Copy of email I sent:

Hey [manager],

Is it possible I can speak with you—at your earliest convenience —about my schedule at [company]? [other manager] may have spoken with you about this, as I had initially reached out to him with my concerns. He assured me there wasn’t any deliberate reason that he was aware of, for my lack of work and to keep up my great performance. However, I wanted to also reach out to you directly so I can get your feedback on my schedule concerns and questions going forward. 

Mainly, my concern is the amount of jobs I have been assigned these past months and my schedule for the Fall.  In September and October I have 3 weddings in total, while last year I was assigned 15 in the same months, as a completely new and inexperienced event staff. This worries me because I understand that these are some of the busiest months. Ideally, I would like to be working more hours during our busiest times of the year as this is my only source of income, and therefore I am completely flexible.  Of course, I also love working at [company], I enjoy working with everyone and I'm passionate about the services we provide.

[Manager], please let me know when we can further discuss.  I look forward to hearing from you and hope you have a great weekend!

Yet this past weekend he texted me asking me if I can fill in for an event where someone couldn’t make it due to a sudden family emergency. I did fill in, and he was very nice through text, but Im worried he’s not going to respond to my email. It feels like Im only assigned work when he’s desperate for someone because he knows I’m available. It’s starting to feel disrespectful, this lack of communication otherwise. 

After I accepted the event through text and thanked him, two days later I wrote “Really appreciated working this weekend, and hoping to hear from you soon about my email I sent. I understand you’re likely busy and don’t mean to hound you, just would appreciate a quick phone call when you’re ready. Thanks” and haven’t gone a response. I texted him a question in the past before as well and he never responded, this is what I mean when I say he’s unresponsive. What do I do from here?


I have a feeling he’ll continue to not respond, and am not sure how to move forward. Please just give me direct upfront advice!! How do I reach out? Should I just cold call him? Am I being irrational for expecting a response, or just wanting to have a conversation so I can have more clarity on the little amount of hours? How should I go about talking with him? I understand he may be busy but as a manager, shouldn’t you be a little more available to talk to the people you supposedly manage and make a schedule for? The other manager is at least.

I interviewed at company B yesterday. I want to follow up with company A just to see how it's going, but I feel I should also mention that I interviewed at company B. I'm just not sure how to go about it. 

I haven't gotten an offer from either yet, so I don't want to shoot myself in the foot if I reach out to company A for an update, and they offer me the position, but I hesitate because I want to hear from company B, and then lose the original offer. Company B is more aligned with my career goals, but may offer pay that is too low for me to survive on. 

&#x200B;

Extra details that may or may not matter:   
Company A's interview process was INTENSE. An essay, a power point, and then 4 individual interviews, so I don't think they'd ghost candidates after that. The job is not exactly in my career path, but kind of adjacent. It would come with decent pay and benefits.

She told me it was needed for her immigration stuff because she is here on a work visa or some similar program.  
  
I am confused as to why my job description information would be needed for someone else's immigration paperwork.  
  
Either way, as I am writing this and following the format she provided, it feels more like I am making a job posting, aka signing my own death warrant.  
  
Am I on the way to be terminated? I spoke with her 2 days after the request to cut to the chase. Literally told her ""I feel like I just made my own job posting to get someone in to replace me. Did I just make my own death warrant with the company?""  
  
She assured me multiple times all was good, but she failed to elaborate on the immigration situation that requires documentation on my job when it's not even for me.

15rsgk8,"I've got to career paths to chose from, and I don't know which one to chose.","I find myself in a perplexing situation and I'm hoping some of you might be able to offer some guidance or insights. I've been grappling with a major life decision that involves choosing between a career in teaching and entering the adult film industry. I know it sounds like a wild contrast, but let me explain my predicament.  
  
Background: I have always been passionate about education and have pursued a degree in education to become a teacher. I love the idea of shaping young minds, making a positive impact, and fostering learning. I've spent years working towards this goal, but recently an unexpected opportunity has presented itself.  
  
The Opportunity: I have a life-changing opportunity doing OF. While it's completely different from my teaching aspirations, it's also a field that has its own merits and unique aspects. The offer comes with the promise of financial stability and potential for personal growth. However, I can't ignore the societal stigma and potential challenges that come with this career choice.  
  
The Struggle: On one hand, I'm drawn to the idea of pursuing my lifelong dream of being a teacher and contributing positively to society. On the other hand, the allure of financial stability and the excitement of trying something completely different is also tempting. I'm worried about how either decision could affect my future, personal life, and relationships.  
  
Seeking Advice: I'm reaching out to the Reddit community to gain some perspective. Have any of you faced a similar crossroads in your life? How did you make your decision? What factors should I consider when making this choice? I'm torn between my passion for teaching and the allure of a potentially unconventional career.  
  
Some Questions:  
How important is societal perception when it comes to career choices?  
Can a person pursue an adult film career without it defining their identity?  
Is it possible to have a backup plan if I choose the adult film industry and later decide it's not for me?  
How can I weigh financial stability against personal fulfillment?  
What are some long-term considerations for both career paths that I might not be thinking about?  
  
Closing Thoughts: I understand that this is a deeply personal decision, but I believe that hearing others' experiences and insights could help me gain some clarity. I'm open to any constructive thoughts, personal stories, or advice that you're willing to share.  
  
Thank you for taking the time to read about my dilemma. Your input could truly make a difference in helping me navigate this challenging decision.

I am afraid of going back just to land in debt and not have a degree thatll lead to me being able to cover it. So what really are my other options when developing marketable skills?

Background: I'm from Sydney (Australia), and I finished my accounting degree (Macquarie University) back in July 2022. I subsequently took a post-uni gap year to take a breather. Speaking of work experience, I held a casual job, which ultimately didn't work out and received a backhanded (negative) reference which was potentially slanderous, hence why I'm unable to list this work experience in my CV.  
  
However, since blasting resumes for Graduate Accountant postings last month (July), I've only managed to get five phone interviews, and two in-person interviews. I'm starting to feel utterly hopeless as I doubt that I'll break it into the accounting industry due to having no work experience during my 'gap'.

15rqijq,Does possessing top secret clearance help me with government jobs? Should I consider renouncing a second citizenship?,"I’ve been bouncing around state government for a while in various mid level positions, nothing remarkable. I’ve been working for the longest time to enter the foreign service. I failed the FSOT the first time and then got to the final stage twice. I have a Master of International Affairs, and quite a bit of applicable experience. Got a conditional offer pulled during the Trump administration and then never got a peep after the QEP step. I was sort of fed up with trying to go the exam route.

I recently moved into something that’s more relevant to my degree which involves intelligence analysis. I never thought I’d get this particular job because it’s highly competitive and didn’t think about it until I was filling out the TS clearance paperwork, but I have a pending Italian citizenship application with theNYC consulate. It took me two years of painstaking work to pull the application together plus a ton of money even though I did it myself. At this point I’m all but guaranteed the citizenship, but my supervisor said it would cause issues and that I would be asked to renounce it.

Is a TS clearance really worth giving up a second citizenship? Would it help me with getting into the FS? I don’t plan on staying in the intelligence industry forever, it’s just not for me long term, but I keep getting told a TS clearance is a golden ticket to a million other jobs.

15rlwwc,"Scheduling Manager Cut My Hours Majorly + Is Unresponsive, What Do I Do??","
I work at an amazing company that provides entertainment and services for weddings/ corporate events—mainly DJ’s, live musicians, photo booths and lighting. They pay great, have awesome people, and offer great benefits. I work as an event staff/roadie, meaning I set up and break down the equipment and occasionally control the lights or photo booths. It’s an awesome job and they’re one of the best in the industry who also treat people in my position within the company very well.

The summer and fall are our biggest times of the year, and this year most recently I haven’t been getting assigned as much work as I was when I was a new and inexperienced employee. This September and October I have 3 weddings currently booked in total, while last year I had 15. 

I reached out in person to one of my managers who has worked with me plenty of times, to ask the reason why and if I can get more work, also because he used to be in charge of the schedule. He said he’s no longer in control of the schedule really, another guy who I barely have had any communication with is in control of it. He said that he’d talk to him though, and that he wasn’t aware of any deliberate reason for the amount of jobs, and to keep up my great work (because I asked if it was my performance, seeing as in the beginning I was slow to grasp the technical aspects of the job but had made a significant improvement and was worried that wasn’t being seen).

So I’m hoping to get more work, and then I see in my email that I only have 1 event offer for the entire month of October, worse than the two I was assigned in September.

To my understanding, the scheduling manager works with this manager I talked to and they have more direct communication, and the scheduling manager reports to the manager I talked to, as in he works “under him.”

Meanwhile employees newer than me are booked every weekend for these months, also because they are the DJ assistants which means they assist the DJ more directly during the event, ride the company van with the equipment to the venues, and otherwise have the same responsibilities I do. I haven’t been given this responsibility because I know I didn’t make the best first impression as someone able to take the higher responsibility, but was told by the non scheduling manager also that he himself had worked for two years only operating photobooths before he started having that responsibility. I do have faith that I’ll be trusted with it eventually, from what he told me, and that I just have to be more patient, which I’m willing to be because like I said I really do love the job. These assistants get more work as well.

Either way, everyone I talk to is busier than me, and this job is my only source of income and I’m also very passionate about it and have hopes of moving up in the company and staying with them for a long time. I ideally don’t want to look for additional work with this job because I’d rather keep my complete availability for them if they need me to fill in or do an event, because this job is so amazing and special to me that it doesn’t even feel like a job, if you get what Im saying. If I work somewhere else, I’ll miss out on potential work here and I want to work my way up to being able to be busy every weekend. Unfortunately Im considering getting another anyway bc I need the money. 

I reached out to the scheduling manager with this email asking for a chance to have a discussion, and CC’d the other manager, but he hasn’t responded. Yet this past weekend he texted me asking me if I can fill in for an event where someone couldn’t make it due to a sudden family emergency. I did fill in, and he was very nice through text, but Im worried he’s not going to respond to my email. It feels like Im only assigned work when he’s desperate for someone because he knows I’m available. It’s starting to feel disrespectful, this lack of communication otherwise. 

Copy of email I sent:

Hey [manager],

Is it possible I can speak with you—at your earliest convenience —about my schedule at [company]? [other manager] may have spoken with you about this, as I had initially reached out to him with my concerns. He assured me there wasn’t any deliberate reason that he was aware of, for my lack of work and to keep up my great performance. However, I wanted to also reach out to you directly so I can get your feedback on my schedule concerns and questions going forward. 

Mainly, my concern is the amount of jobs I have been assigned these past months and my schedule for the Fall.  In September and October I have 3 weddings in total, while last year I was assigned 15 in the same months, as a completely new and inexperienced event staff. This worries me because I understand that these are some of the busiest months. Ideally, I would like to be working more hours during our busiest times of the year as this is my only source of income, and therefore I am completely flexible.  Of course, I also love working at [company], I enjoy working with everyone and I'm passionate about the services we provide.

[Manager], please let me know when we can further discuss.  I look forward to hearing from you and hope you have a great weekend!


I have a feeling he’ll continue to not respond, and am not sure how to move forward. Please just give me direct upfront advice!! How do I reach out? Should I just cold call him? Am I being irrational for expecting a response, or just wanting to have a conversation so I can have more clarity on the little amount of hours? How should I go about talking with him? I understand he may be busy but as a manager, shouldn’t you be a little more available to talk to the people you supposedly manage and make a schedule for? The other manager is at least.

15riyba,"I had a job for 1 month, would you add that to your LinkedIn, or leave it off?","Some simple context:

ESL education 5 years  
Marketing: about 10-11 months total. (First job 9 months, and then 5-6 weeks at another company)  
Currently in ESL again since March. 

9 months in the first marketing job because of ethical concerns about the company I left. 1 month experience was great - but I wasn't ready for the promotion to manager and it was too much stress to catch up in such a fast growing company. I am back in ESL just for money, and I only work 30 hours so it gave me time to recoup. In marketing I was striving to get into the most tech-heavy end of the field, but after reflecting, I realized I am much better suited to just get into a tech role, so I am currently working on that, and my next job hunt will be for a position in tech.

I am never sure whether to include that 1 month in my resume or not, but in the case of LinkedIn would you include it? even if its not always in your resume? I did a lot more in that 5-6 weeks then I have done in the first 2 years of ESL, so it just seems like a worthy experience to include.

I was planning on accepting it. However, I'm in a bit of a dilemma as I'm also in the end-game interview process with another much bigger and higher paying (30K more) company. It's not a guarantee that I would be getting in as I still have to pass my last screening with the guys at the top. If everything goes well, I would be starting early September in that role. 

Obviously, I would be going to the bigger company if they had given me the offer right now. 

My current plan is to accept the job offer at the smaller company and start working. This is basically my backup if I don't get into the higher paying job, I'll still have job at the end of the day. I'm also fairly new to the workforce, only graduated last year and have no experience dealing with these kind of situations.

How would you go about rescinding job acceptance or resigning after 2-3 weeks without burning the entire bridge down? ",shashayrealsmooth,1,1.0,2,1692074432,2023-08-15 04:40:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15rid69/rescinding_job_acceptance/,8,2023

15rhz32,"Quit a well paying career, big title and brand name in order to keep learning and growing? (M40)","I work for a well-known multinational, have a big title, and take home 150k USD p.a. while living in an exotic country with low income tax and cost of living. I have a realistic chance to make it to the leadership team within the next 2-3 years. Many people would probably be jealous.

  
But I feel burned out. Not because of the workload. I certainly work a lot and more than 9-to-5 but it's the lack of motivation and excitement that's burning me out. The work feels primitive and doesn't intellectually stimulate or challenge me. It's project management and always the same type of projects. I'm not learning much. In fact, I feel like I don't have any marketable profile---I don't have any hard technical expertise, whether industry nor functional know-how, but I'm just a project manager. And this has been burning me out because I like to learn; I like to have expertise; I like to work analytically, solve problems and build solutions.

  
People online and offline tell me that we should keep learning and growing but I'm wondering whether I'm reckless and a dreamer for considering to quit this career and start all over.

  
I have two degrees in IT and have always loved to write code or work with data, so I wouldn't start completely at Zero, but it certainly would be a huge change and taking risks and a pay cut. And I guess that's what's holding me back---I've never been a risk-taker and have always been looking at job safety and saving/investing for retirement, and it scares me to take the risk of failing and ending up with a low paying job.",OldAnimal8529,0,0.5,6,1692073247,2023-08-15 04:20:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15rhz32/quit_a_well_paying_career_big_title_and_brand/,8,2023

15rgxpk,a career lost girl looking for advice,"I am a recent graduate and I have no idea what to do with my career life. I’m also super hard on myself and want to be doing the best thing at all times (not realistic i know)

I graduated with a double major in Biology and Spanish in hopes of going to Medical School which did not happen. The reason is because I did not want 500k+ in debt considering I had to take out 60k in loans for undergrad. Graduating college I figured I would continue work as a medical assistant which was absolutely not paying the bills and patient care for such little pay was not fun. I then became a recruiter to see a bit more of the “business” side of things. What I’ve realized with these two jobs is that I hate staring at a computer, I hate the Monday-Friday schedule, this job is not reliable and one I can jump back into after having kids and being a stay at home mom. Oh and the salary + commission is awful since my commission fluctuats so drastically. (as a recruiter you’re paid off of your employee that works). Not to mention finding quality candidates is an absolute roller coaster.

What I want at this time is a better work life balance, no computer staring, and something more medical. I also want to hopefully be a stay at home mom in 3-4 years but be able to have a job I can get back into? A reliable and stable job? A job I can work myself up to making six figures? (everyone’s dream I know)

The careers i’m currently considering is either 1) a nursing degree but I would want to do it at a community college because it is cheaper but would take 2.5 years. What I like about this is ability to work 3-12hr shifts, reliable job, stable pay, ability to change fields anytime, and a lot of flexibility. What I don’t like about this path is adding about 20k debt to my already 60k debt, I’ve heard nurse coworkers are the absolute worst, school is stressfull af and I fear the- what if I don’t like it… (2 medical device sales. what I like about this is there’s opportunity to grow, this is more in the medical field, opportunity for high salary, don’t have to go back to school and add debt. what I don’t like is the pay might fluctuate a bit, work life balance is M-F. this might not be an easy career to get back into after being a stay at home mom (I assume, don’t know).

I don’t know if that was the whole country or just my university. My first major was psychology with the other two being literature and philosophy. I ended up dropping psychology because I couldn’t keep up with all the studies and timelines to remember and ended up double majoring in the other two. Psychology would’ve gotten me better job prospects, but I real my enjoyed literature and philosophy (and got a lot out of them!). I wonder if I should’ve stuck with the subject that would’ve given me some career direction or be happy that I really enjoyed what I studied.

15rdpae,"Putting Studies and Myself First: Contemplating Job Exit, Need Your Perspective","Hey Reddit community,  
  
I'm standing at a crossroads in my life, and I'm reaching out for your valuable insights and advice on my current situation. I have PCOS and endometriosis for context.  
  
Last March, I joined a hardware store as a casual employee. Now, I'm seriously contemplating a change. Here's the backstory: I was brought in for a temporary stocktake role with the promise of transitioning to part-time permanent after. Unfortunately, this promise has been clouded by inconsistency and uncertainty over the past year. Unfortunately, budget constraints have resulted in cuts to casual employee hours.  
  
Back in May, my manager discussed the possibility of me transitioning to a ""homemaker"" role with my husband who works there full-time. Meanwhile, I've been dealing with health challenges that limit me to 6-hour shifts (which I've repeatedly communicated to my manager and supervisor and have provided a medical letter from my doctor). It wasn't until July that accommodations were finally made, but I've noticed a decrease in available shifts compared to other casual employees.   
  
The training process hasn't been smooth either. I received just one day of training on my first day, and despite requesting more guidance, I've been told the ""sink or swim"" is the normal approach. I thrive with writing notes, but understaffing prevents that as of this year. It has been hard to adjust to the system, procedures, and policies when I come in for a shift due to the inconsistency of shifts and lack of support on the floor. I am not the only casual who feels the same way, and our workplace union is at 80% capacity now. 

  
In the previous month, I reiterated to my supervisor that I'm only capable of working for a maximum of 6 hours. He acknowledged this without any issues. However, my manager asked why I was leaving early even though she knew I couldn't work an 8 hour shift, in front of half the team on the floor. She suggested I advocate for myself, even though this condition restricts my capabilities at work, particularly due to prolonged periods of standing.  
  
Recently, my manager mentioned budget approval for hiring five permanent team members in my department. Colleagues mentioned my name and my manager could be an option. This hope was dashed when the budget was retracted the following week.  
  
The effect of the toxic work environment and ongoing issues has affected my health. While I appreciate my colleagues and love interacting with customers, the management's lack of consideration for my training needs and health limitations has been disheartening.  
  
I'm currently wrapping up a small business and management course by December, along with an administration course where I'm just five papers away from completion. Armed with these qualifications, I'm optimistic about securing a full-time work-from-home position. Despite my current lack of credentials, I've consistently secured interviews.  
  
So, fellow Redditors, I'm at a turning point and would like an outsider's opinion. Any advice, opinions, or experiences you can share would be immensely helpful as I navigate this critical decision. Thank you for taking the time to engage with my story, and I'm looking forward to your thoughts!",CrazyPlantLady95,1,1.0,0,1692062665,2023-08-15 01:24:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15rdpae/putting_studies_and_myself_first_contemplating/,8,2023

I am becoming very familiar with the daily processes of my station and my coworkers while they have high standards, but they're working with me to get me up to that level of polish. I am 25 and actively going blind due to glaucoma and other related eye problems.

Over the last year and a half its gotten to the point where I can't really read off physical paper, unless everything is in bold. When I write on Reddit, I'd like to say the page is zoomed in 175% or so on my desktop. I am usually very ""cards on table"" with my colleagues, but when it comes to this stuff I really just don't know how to break it to them that I'm not illiterate I'm just going blind faster than I thought and I'm not a charity case.

I know its a huge organization.. Before this, I was working in media as a copy writer and in kitchens, this is my first ""real"" job and I am trying to show that they made the right choice. I just genuinely don't know where I could go from here given that this job is very clerical. I'm taking pride in the work I produce, but that's mostly because again I don't want them to think I'm a damn charity case.. They've all commiserated with me about how they were in my shoes once that I'm doing okay, but I don't know how to take that? I get off the clock and think ""there's more I could've done"", I'd much rather be in a media pit working audio or copywriting which is minimally creative, than producing clerical documents with little hope for advancement or a way forward.

15rd8fx,"Boss keeps promising development / leadership opportunities, but never provides any; denied my promotion, again.","For the second time in a year, I've taken what I thought was a very strong argument to my boss about why I deserved a promotion. Our company maintains a Job Catalog with a description of every job in the company, and I had provided examples for every requirement showing that I am working at a level above my current job title and pay grade. I had even just returned from presenting at an industry conference.

They denied my request, with the rationale that I didn't have any leadership experience which is 1) not true as I was the main point of contact in my job prior to it being canceled and me ending up on this team and 2) not stated as a requirement for the pay grade and job title I'm seeking.

In isolation this is something that I'd be more receptive to, but this is the exact same reason they denied my request last time, saying they would get me some development opportunities, which never came to fruition.

I'm frustrated because our department is seen as ""less than"" compared to other parts of the company so my work experience isn't valued by other hiring managers in regards to internal hiring. I know this because people previously in my department have had to take lateral moves for career progression while younger, less experienced people from other departments have gotten promotions.

This is essentially the ""need experience for entry level position"" situation, just at a slightly different point in my career.

I'm being passed up by people younger than me, with less experience than me, with less education than me, and my boss isn't following through with their promised development opportunities.

Currently, I am unsure about the next certification to pursue. At 19 years of age, I am employed as a material handler at CTDI, a role I'm not particularly fond of.

I graduated about a year ago with a engineering master, i have good grades and no failed exams, everything felt good and most of the courses were interesting. Since then ive worked at a company for a year. My work is kind of more IT orientated than what i'd like and the work assignments is not quite what i studied for. 

Thing is, i find it so boring that i do the bare minimum, i just cant find the motivation and procastinate instead. And frankly, i feel like my personality and traits are not a good fit for this job. 

Because of this im just so much worse at what i do compared to my coworkers.  I just feel like a fraud, which leaves me sleepless at nights with the feeling that they are going to fire me anyday now. I stress so much over this and im probably depressed. 

Obviously i need to change to another employer but whenever i look at descriptions of work ads i just dont apply because i feel too stupid. My confidence is just at an all time low. Im so stressed that im too stupid for my degree and that im now fucked by debt.

Anyone thats been in my situation? How can i come out of this?

Is my cv going to look like shit if i apply to a new job after only one year? And what do i tell them when they ask about references? I have good references from past jobs but i dont want to tell my current boss that im searching for something else.

15r8dk0,How can i move up into my career as a minor?,"Graduating early is not always the best move.

Hi, I just recently turned 17 years old and graduated last spring while I was 16. While graduating early was great it has its limitations. I currently work at a grocery store part time, the pay is 12 dollars and the hours are very low (4-16 a week at most). I don’t have a car and my checks fluctuate about 50-150 a week (60-90 going to rides to work) I’m barely breaking even and while i don’t pay any bills i don’t have much other money support from family(I buy all my own clothes,food,etc) . I planned to work and save up enough to enroll into college. But because of my job misleading me and multiple other workers about the hours ( saying the hours are 20-35 for part time and giving us those hours for about a month then drastically cutting them to less than 16) It is almost impossible to save money especially with inflation rates rising rapidly and now don’t know if i will have the money to enroll in january and possibly will have to wait until next august or possibly longer it’s been really hard finding part time jobs that pay decent or any full time job that will hire a minor and I don’t wanna be stuck in this position until next year when i turn 18 where i am lucky to break even 50+ dollars. Some weeks i don’t even make enough to get to work  and have to pray someone will give me a ride. Are there any career fields that won’t require me to be 18 or have lots of experience? Any side hustles I can do to get by? I have been looking into trade schools to possibly help
me get into a career field but a lot of them are somewhat expensive and also require you to be 18. I live in Texas any government programs/organizations/agencies that can help me
find a better/full time job or provide any sort of on the job training/certifications would also be greatly appreciated.

15r81g0,$1800 biweekly admin supervisor or $1500 biweekly executive assistant in the federal government? (CAN),"

Cross-posted
Hello Reddit.



 

TL;DR  Canadian 33 year-old female with no completed post-secondary (only partial). Working at a good organization since April 2022. Promoted twice but still on temp contract. Making $52k/year but because I’m tax exempt(Treaty) in this organization I make $1800 biweekly. Bright possibilities of permanent position but no sight of career advancement within. Was offered a permanent job as executive assistant for the federal government. Will make $60k/year but this isn’t tax-exempt. Will probably get $1500 in hand after deductions. Bright future for career advancements and training possibilities. Unsure if I should take the new position or stay where I am.

 

 

I currently work for a Unionized Child and Family Services related agency. I have been here since March of 2022 on a maternity-leave contract working as one out of ten administrative assistants. I’m a very hard worker by nature and despite my lack of any formal post-secondary education I was promoted to the only Management Assistant for our 13 directors as the original management assistant is now the executive assistant as the original executive assistant is on maternity leave. I am still on a term contract which is set to end in November of this year. Last month I spoke with HR to ask if they had any plans for me after my term contract was up and they said that they would like to make me the administrative assistant supervisor but instead of waiting for the term contract I was already on to end, they decided (with my consent and with a small pay bump) that I could add the title of admin supervisor right now and start doing some of the duties of the supervisor but I need to continue the role of management assistant until November. This has caused a decent amount of strain to my already heavy workload and I’m finding that my stress levels have risen significantly but I’m holding on to the fact that working 2 positions is only temporary until November.

The benefits from this organization are AMAZING (100% coverage for most things). I enjoy my coworkers a lot. The organization hosts company lunches bi-monthly. They’re very welcoming to having staff put events together so I’ve been able to have a lot of fun with that. I bring home $1800 biweekly. I really enjoy this organization and I have a lot of plans as a supervisor to greatly improve our service, our training methods, etc. I find this work very meaningful and close to my heart. This is an in-person position with the round trip from my home to the office is 80kms. The downside is, as an admin supervisor this is as far as my career here would go unless the organization needed an admin director but I don’t see that happening in the future. And I’m still only a contract employee on paper. It’s very emotional work, we deal with broken families and troubled people. Sometimes I bring this sadness and frustration home with me and I can’t disassociate for hours after work which strains my marriage. I also do a decent amount of unpaid and unacknowledged overtime. I will have to travel to remote northern communities and spend at least 3-4 days at a time probably every month/couple of months. That’s really about it right now.

 

Earlier on in February 2023 I had applied for a federal government position because I was unhappy (disgusted) with my previous supervisor and his lack of moral, character, empathy, work ethic, etc, and I wasn’t sure if there would be a position for me at this organization when the person I was covering for came back from mat. leave. I had an interview and while I didn’t get the position I interviewed for, I was placed in their pool of qualified candidates for similar positions. In July 2023 I received an email from the federal government asking if I would be interested in interviewing for an Executive Assistant position. I accepted and the interview process went well to the point where I’ve been offered the position. In the interview, the interviewer let me know that this is a hybrid position (2 days mandatory in office, 3 days my choice) which is really cool. The government has a lot of training opportunities and they have great benefits from what I hear. The salary is $60k/year but it’s not tax-exempt so I would be walking away with $1500 biweekly or so. The interviewer specifically mentioned that most executive assistants are only in the position for a couple of years before they move on elsewhere in the government so it’s a gateway in. The round trip from my home to the office would be 92kms.

 

 

I’m very conflicted and would appreciate an outside view. My current organization is lovely and I’m sure I’ll get permanent but then this is the end of the road for me career-wise as an Administrative Assistant Supervisor. I make $1800 biweekly compared to the $1500 I’m expecting to bring home if I switch. It’s a substantial pay cut but it wouldn’t break our budget. As Executive Assistant I feel this is a step down from my current job title. But working for the federal government opens so many doors and it’ll be easy to transfer to a different province (we are planning to move in the next 5 years). I’m very happy being in Administration and having a team work under me. I enjoy being in a leadership role so much. Being an EA sounds fantastic as well, getting to know all the big names in government, their likes and dislikes, but it’s not the same as leading a team to success. I’m already/only 32 and I’ve never truly thought about a long-term career before, one that I could maybe retire with. I’m scared of missing out on this opportunity to further myself but I’m also scared on losing everything that I already have with my current organization.

 

 

I’d really appreciate if someone could chime in with their opinions. Like I said, this is the first actual career I’ve had and I’m already/only 32 with no completed post-secondary behind me.

 just wanted to ask some questions to actual professionals out there, people who make a good living as audio engineers.  
  
I want to get into this field. I'm so sick of tech and development that I want to switch gears for my passion, which is music. I've been a musician my whole life (I'm not the best, I'm not the worst, but I'm average) and I want to do something I enjoy doing, even if that means making a bit less than what I do now.  
  
Scanning the threads, I see a lot of doom and gloom. A lot of ""Don't go to online schools!"" ""Don't use these courses"" ""be prepared to not make any money"" ""my friend graduated from X school and is now a dishwasher."" It's all totally exhausting. I'm not even sure if many of the people posting these types of comments are actual industry professionals or just people who went to a trade school, didn't put in the effort, and now work a service job they're bitter about.  
  
I fully expect a hard road, I fully expect to create projects and a portfolio, I expect a long road of learning.  
  
With that said, what is the best path to take to get there? I don't live near any major cities that provide schools with these types of programs at the moment, and I don't really want to move to one just yet without job prospects or a reason. I want to play it smart, i'm 39 years old, I don't have a lot of time to pick the wrong path and pivot down the road. If I see a good area with a school or program I can join that will give me a leg up, I will consider moving.  
  
here are my questions if anyone can help out:  
  
What is the best learning path?  
  
Will studios or companies expect a 4 year degree? If so, what are some schools to look into/avoid?  
  
If you were hiring, what would you want to see on a resume/portfolio?  
  
How much experience is necessary to get my foot in the door?  
  
What potential roadblocks can I expect, and in your experience would be the best way to avoid them or learn from them?  
  
Best places (online or in person) to network.  
  
I know this is a lot for any one person to answer. However, if anyone out there that's a true professional can give me some insight, even possibly provide mentorship or point me in the direction of where to find a mentor, that would help so much.

I was not accepted into my ""reach"" schools (top schools in the US), and while I was pleased with the offers I received from other universtieis, I felt I needed a change in my life. I identified Germany as the best option. I then decided to apply to universities in Germany, and I just got **accepted into my top choice**, which is one of the best for economics in Germany (my new chosen field, as universities in Germany do not offer international relations at the undergrad level). I plan to complete a **three-year-program in Economics**, and complete two internships during my summers (the first one in Europe and the second one in the US). Ultimately, my goal is to either return to the US for a Masters Degree or apply to one of the top graduate programs in Europe. I envision working in an internationl corporation, NGO, or possibly even diplomacy.

I feel really dumb for turning down the offer and choosing to stay at home.  I’ve continued to look at other music jobs closer to home but to no avail. I either receive flat rejections or ghosting. Even for assistant roles I know I could do.  Do you really need the internship experience for entry level marketing roles in music?

15r3tcv,Can I change career path at 31?,"Hello everyone,  
I've got a background in marketing and have spent my professional life primarily focused on copywriting and email marketing. To be honest, though I do enjoy email marketing more, both fields tend to feel a bit dull to me, especially copywriting. No offense intended towards copywriters or those aspiring to become one – it's just my personal perspective.  
Interestingly, my interest in numbers and statistics has been with me since childhood. However, I had some terrible teachers that left me feeling inadequate when it came to math and statistics. Lately, over the past few months, I've found myself highly intrigued by data analytics. The process of delving into data, tackling problems, and deciphering patterns really captivates me. Given my penchant for analytical thinking, it seems like a natural fit.  
Still, I'm grappling with the idea of switching career paths. Is it a wise move? How do I go about it? The IBM Analytics course caught my eye, even though the goal feels somewhat distant, and patience isn't my strong suit.  
So, what's your take? Does the investment of time and effort justify the potential outcome? What's the optimal strategy for transitioning into this new territory? How would you approach it?  
Furthermore, I'm curious about freelancing in data analytics. Is that a viable avenue? Do businesses actually hire freelancers for this kind of work? Your insights on these queries would be immensely appreciated.

15r39n3,Routes To London REPE Firms For Non-UK Resident.,"Hello everyone,

  
Seeking career advice in CRE here.

  
I graduated in September 2022 with a Bachelor's in Business Admin and Finance from a top-tier French business school. Interested in CRE, particularly Acquisition. I completed multiple RE internships, accumulating nearly 2 years of experience out of 4.

  
Started at a London-based PM firm managing Airbnbs in 2020. Then joined a real estate investment startup in France for 8 months as an acquisition analyst. Worked on small deals (average €250k, maximum €2.5 million) for individuals. Followed by an apprenticeship within the same firm. Regret not choosing a larger company, but due to circumstances (Covid/lockdown), I chose to continue working with them.

  
Last December, I started seeking roles in London (acquisition/AM). Struggled due to sponsorship constraints and lack of significant company experience, I believe. Began looking in France and secured a Valuation role at a major broker firm.

  
I'm still aiming to move to London (early 2024 would be great), possibly in valuation, as it presents opportunities. I'm also wondering about the timeline for applying to jobs there (since I started in valuation back in May). Additionally, I'm considering the best strategy from here to enter REPE when the market rebounds. Should I attempt to transition through Capital Markets first, then move into REPE?

Yet, the posted hourly rate is $26-$29 per hour. This is a level II analyst position with an environmental consulting firm. However, the firm is huge, has been around for almost 40 years, and they have around 100 employees + many locations throughout the state. So presumably, they are doing okay financially and I live in California, a very high cost of living state. 

I currently make $35 as a database analyst and would like to shoot for $40. When I initially saw the salary ranges, I thought that would be absolutely possible. I applied for the job on LinkedIn so I did not see the employer estimated ranges of $26-$29 until I looked at the job listing on Glassdoor later. They did not list them on LinkedIn

15r27nv,My coworker is driving me insane,"I work in a blue collar field. I’ve been at this job for about 14 months. I work with two coworkers, an office manager, and a supervisor. My supervisor really likes me. He keeps telling me I’m going to take his job when he retires which would give me a significant salary increase. But I think he is telling me that to keep me around because he knows I can’t stand my coworker. He keeps changing his timeline. First he says it will be 1-2 years. Then he says 5 years. Now he says 2-3 years. There is nothing in writing and I haven’t received any kind of salary increase in the mean time. 

I am thinking about trying to find another job because one of my coworkers is really taking a toll on my mental health and I don’t know how much more I can take. He is an obese slob, very immature, and super lazy. I can barely do my job without him interfering and telling me I “don’t need to do that right now”. He’s left keys in equipment that ended up getting stolen. Leaves 15 minutes early every day and will never stay late to finish work. He always uses the excuse that he’s too fat to do certain jobs. He basically does nothing all day and I handle the majority of the workload. He talks shit on everyone behind their back. Including me. He calls in sick every time it rains or snows. He makes my job harder than it needs to be and even when he puts in effort, he isn’t really contributing. My boss is aware that he is enabling him and keeps telling me he’ll fix it or fire him but it’s been the same thing every day since I worked here. My boss is in another office all day and is hands off in most of the physical operation so he doesn’t see a lot of stuff that is bothering me. I’m at my wits end and think I need to find a different job to keep my sanity. The only problem is that I’m having trouble finding a job that isn’t a slight decrease in pay. 

I’m just tired of dreading coming to work and being angry all the time. It’s starting to make me angry at home as well. I am starting therapy this week to work on it.

15r1wtn,I can never create anything good enough for my supervisor. What should I do?,"I (23F) am in my first salaried job out of college as a marketing associate. My main tasks include designing social media images, and writing email campaigns and blog posts for SEO. 

I spent HOURS last week creating a group of images and writing a blog post promoting a webinar series my company is doing later this month. I came into the office this morning (Monday) to see my images completely changed and my blog post completely red in track changes. The changes my supervisor made to my images seemed more preferential and not based in actual design principles. For the blog post, my supervisor didn’t give me great detail on what she wanted with the post, so I did with what I could and got upset I included details that she didn’t want me to include, it seemed like she wanted me to just read her mind regarding the instructions. I had a few people, including her own boss, look at the creative assets before I sent them in. I took their change suggestions, and got their seal of approval just to to clock in this morning and see my supervisor completely changed everything. 

This has happened quite a few times already. I understand I am very young, and have lots to learn. I think I just need any advice I can get because I am so new in my career.  I think it’s mostly just frustrating because I feel a little useless in my job.

15r1nu9,Unethical HR — What CAN I do to contribute to change for the better?,"TLDR; I want to do what I can to make a difference in my company in response to toxic HR without making a martyr of myself, but don’t know what options I have. My anger leads me to feel I wouldn’t mind getting fired if I’m fired for living in accordance with my values, but I also know this would not be as effective for change for my co-workers and community as it would be to be smart about my efforts. I want to learn how to navigate this. Any ideas? How can I contribute to change in HR in a strategic, smart way?

I work for a non-profit agency. Our company culture has been so toxic that turnover has been severe (went from 150+ employees to 64 in a two month span). An outside organization that focuses on employee experience was hired in attempt to fix some of the issues, and some changes have since resulted. Our CEO stepped down, for example — I feel confident this was unanimously encouraging for employees. HOWEVER, the HR director, hired by the CEO while she was still standing, is successfully maintaining what I’d describe as an autocracy. This is directly nullifying much of the work the employee experience group is trying to do — it is almost as if she is dedicated to turning the company into a dumpster fire.

I was able to accept the toxicity until HR’s retaliation against my supervisor — one of my company’s most valuable employees — escalated to severe punishment for a significant but unsubstantiated claim. We have reason to believe this claim was NEVER investigated — I don’t understand how this is legal. The C-Suite member over our department was against the punishment of my supervisor; our manager also tried desperately to protect her. The employee experience group was in support of my supervisor but said there was nothing they could do because of a certain policy in place. My personal therapist says this sounds like a witch-hunt. Without her, I will struggle — she is foundational in our department.

I cannot give many more details, such as what policy (or lack there-of) is allowing this to happen. This is because of the lack of transparency in the company — I don’t know what is going on, half the time. I do know none of my teammates were ever asked about the allegations made against my supervisor, and even our department’s C-Suite member’s attempt to protect her was not enough. I also know my supervisor had been standing up against HR’s harmful actions in the past — she was an active boat-rocker and relentlessly advocated for us. This is what leads us to feel HR took what they could to retaliate against her and ran with it.

I know I could quit, but I want to learn the ways in which I am empowered to stand up for myself and my team from this experience. I also am a boat-rocker like my supervisor, and I have a hard time remaining quiet when I know something is wrong. However, I know I cannot act without strategy because HR is known to retaliate. I’m okay with getting fired but also know martyrdom is less effective than “living on” to fight for change. I’m trying to identify what options I do have in response to this so I am empowered to stand up for myself and my close co-workers in the future, even if it isn’t at this agency. 

Does anyone have any ideas about what I CAN do? Is it a valid concept to “set boundaries” with HR? Is it stupid to try to undermine HR, or to try to get her in trouble for what she’s doing? Can anyone share stories about contributing to change in a sh!tty workplace and how they did so? What relevant federal policies should I look into, if any?

Thank you. 😊",bwinnnnie,1,1.0,1,1692035329,2023-08-14 17:48:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15r1nu9/unethical_hr_what_can_i_do_to_contribute_to/,8,2023

15r170t,"I am a lawyer who's looking for a more relaxed life, what can I do?","I (early 30s) have been a lawyer for a couple years now, practicing in in somewhat niche area of corporate litigation in Ontario, Canada. I am finding that I am not happy with my job - I feel burned out (and have since not long after being called). I discovered fairly early on that litigation is not my thing, but where I work has a good reputation so I stayed while applying to other jobs. I have been on and off applying since I was called, mostly to solicitor roles in firms, in-house, and government. maybe 100 applications so far, 1-20 interviews and only 1 offer (which didn't work out for unrelated reasons). While not getting any other jobs has been hard, I am also really starting to question whether I want to stay in law at all.  
  
The hours are pretty miserable - though I will say much better than when I articled, and much better than many of my lawyer friends, but still generally worse from a lot of non-lawyers I see. Hours are bad even for government lawyers in my area of practice.  
  
There are a lot of nice people that I work with, but a few really awful people that due to the nature of litigation, I can get stuck with on a file for long periods of time.  
  
Solo practice won't really work as I don't want to do litigation and have no solicitor experience - I am not sure I could successfully learn enough on my own to get up to speed quickly enough, or to get clients.  
  
Unfortunately if I don't stay in law, I am not sure what else to do. my legal career is basically my first ""real job"" outside of school - so I am also not sure whether I dislike practicing or just working in general, so I am afraid of going back to school and hating the next job too.  
  
So I guess I am looking for advice if anyone has any on:  
  
Should I continue to apply to other law jobs? If so, is it worth my time to continue to apply to solicitor roles even though I have no solicitor experience? If not, what else should I be applying to?  
  
What are some other realistic career options that I could move into? Despite the career choice I am a fairly laid-back person, and would like to have a family in the not-too-distant future, so decent hours would be nice. I love writing and editing, research is good too, and I think I am good at explaining complex concepts in understandable ways. Other than that, I have a science undergrad and was pretty good at math, science, psych, and English throughout all of my schooling, all of which I enjoyed. If it helps, what drew me to law was the writing, research, and logic puzzles - I enjoyed the LSAT and law school, just not practicing.

I've been working as a software developer through a contract for the last 18 months. Unfortunately, they decided not to renew the contract or hire me on full time as they were looking to downsize the team. I have until the first week of September before I'm officially let go. Other jobs I've had have been either full time or contract-to-hire; this is the first time I've been in a position where I know I won't have a job a month in advance. My resume looks good and I'm planning to continue working with the contract company that hired me in the first place as they've been very good to me. I've also started sending out plenty of feelers to previous contacts in the industry.

I'm not particularly worried about financials as I have a decent nest egg to get me through a few months, but with a month in advance, finding the motivation to actually work knowing you won't be there soon is kind of tough. I had some vacation scheduled sometime in this month and was just considering taking some extra days on top of it since it doesn't really matter. I'm not going to just blow off the job for the next month, but is there really any consequence for taking more time off between now and then? I feel like the absolute worst they could do would be to just end the contract early, and if they do, well then I have more time to actually focus on looking for jobs and maybe actually take a couple weeks to myself.",Vectys232,2,1.0,1,1692032526,2023-08-14 17:02:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15r0eiw/contract_is_expiring_in_a_month_how_do_i_approach/,8,2023

i've been freelancing in graphic design (web, print, etc) for 7 years now and it would be way easier for me to get a job in that sphere right now. however, it doesn't pay much where i live and there's very little remote options. 

on the other side, last year i got very interested in web development and learned some basic frontend skills. it's not enough to even get an internship for now and the field is very competitive. hence, i want to dedicate a few months of hard work to building a portfolio and improving my skills, but i doubt i will be able to combine it with a full-time graphic design job. 

this potentially can open up remote opportunities that pay a few times more than graphic design, but i don't know if it's worth it, or how much time it's gonna take (the time during which i could be earning AT LEAST something with graphic design).

I didn’t like that they were adamant about paying me around my starting range, but I happily accepted anyway and just wrapped up my background screening requirements. Today, a different job called (company 2) and said they wanted to offer me a job. In this role I’d be doing something new in a different sector. It’s also fully remote but pays around $80K with good benefits. The biggest difference is the pay and the company is smaller than company 1. I also appreciate the fact that they offered me more than what I asked for. I really like the people at company 1 that I’d work with, they’re super friendly and some are from my home town. The folks at company 2 were ehh.. but it seems overall laid back. I’m really nervous because company 1 is looking forward to me starting in a few weeks and I hate back tracking or letting people down.

15qxvz3,Trying to figure out if I should accept a new job,"I have worked for the same company for about 7 years. I make $32.50 an hour, get 4 weeks pto, 100% of my health insurance premiums are paid for and it's pretty decent insurance. It's a pretty good job, but I drive 45 minutes each way and there have been some recent changes that I don't really agree with. Also there's not really much more room to advance with this company. 

I was recently offered another job for $40 an hour doing somewhat similar work, but it does not have health insurance benefits.
I was told there are also quarterly bonuses of usually $5000-$10000. Depending on how projects go. 
 It is a 1099 position, but would offer a lot more flexibility for me which would be nice because I also run a side business that I would like to devote more time to. 
The new job also is willing to give two weeks of pto, despite being a 1099 position. 
I was doing a little research and it seems that buying insurance for myself at the same level I'm used to now, would cost me about $400-$500 a month. 
A big draw for me is that the new company is less than 10 minutes from my house. The work is also a bit more interesting / challenging and there's definitely room for advancement and making more money if things work out like I was shown. 
It's a small business with about 3-10 people working there. 


Just trying to figure if it's worth leaving a stable job at a company I have good history with that offers great benefits for a little more flexibility and being closer to home at a company that doesn't offer the benefits I'm used to.",rthwy,2,1.0,4,1692026936,2023-08-14 15:28:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15qxvz3/trying_to_figure_out_if_i_should_accept_a_new_job/,8,2023

They quickly moved me to a different, high stakes section of the line and soon enough I wasn’t working the job they originally hired me to do anymore. 

I tried my absolute best to meet their needs but the owner told me while he was firing me that although he saw tremendous growth in me during a short period of time, he wanted me to be someone who could replace him and take over his duties as kitchen manager.

I feel completely blindsided because that was definitely not what he asked me to do, even when he moved me. He said I could use him as a reference and that he liked my attitude but I’m not sure if that’s a good idea if he’s going to tell people I’m too slow.

15qxp72,Bad financial decision?,"	
I am about to make one. Hopefully not. I need talked down.

Here's my situation: I work at a job with terrible hours, I never see my kids and husband. My husband has been almost doubling his paychecks because of all the overtime he has been doing until the new person is completely trained which could take months.

I have been dedicating a lot of time trying to find a remote job, and every day I want to walk off the job. My husband says I can go ahead and give my 2 weeks notice.

But without a job lined up that doesn't seem wise. But my husband is bringing in double his income. But it won't last forever, maybe 6 month to a year. But there are days I literally don't see my kids.. literally. I SHOULD be able to find a remote job (customer service, call center etc) within 6 months.

It's almost 50/50 in my head, every day I waver between the 2 thoughts.

I have been toying with the idea of starting my own bookkeeping business.

15qxjg9,Which careers could I pursue with a joint masters in Psychology and Technology?,"Hello everyone! Recently I was approved for a new Erasmus Joint Master in Cyberspace Behavior and E-therapy with a scholarship. It's ""an innovative programme that looks into behavioural and computer sciences to offer a transdisciplinary approach to study and intervene on human behaviour by means of digital processes, products and services (PPS)""

I'm a clinical psychologist with with a specialisation degree in Neuropsychology and experience in social care and e-therapy (in Brazil, we just need a bachelors to work as a clinician, however it demands 5 years of study and normally we pursue a specialisation). I'm considering a career change after concluding this master. Working as an online autonomous therapist has been a little disappointing to me, it's really tough to build a career in this field. I'm not confortable with a freelance/individual business routine, so I would like to pursue a job in a tech company or industry, even though I will continue looking for a remote one.

I was thinking of careers like Human Factors, UI/UX research or even behavioral data analysis. The program is really research focused and also I will have to develop a project with someone from exact sciences background (IT, engineering, computer science and so on). You can see its curriculum below:

SEMESTER #1 ECTS

Brain, Mind and Behaviour

Research Methods in Cyberspace, Behavior and e-Therapy

Cyberspace, Behaviour and e-Therapy

Option I

Option II

SEMESTER #2

e-Therapy in Clinical and Health Psychology

e-Therapy in Rehabilitation

Cognitive Neuroscience Applied to Cyberspace

Behaviour Disorder Related to Cyberspace

Individual Differences and Personality Related to Cyberspace

Practicum I

SEMESTER #3

Cyberspace and Teleconsultation

Telepresence and Teleconsultation

Ethics and e-Health

User Experience in Teleconsultation

SEMESTER #4

Practicum II (a 5-months long internship in a partner university, research lab, hospital, or company)

Dissertation-Project

It's worth mentioning that two semesters will be in Spain and France respectively, so I will have the opportunity to learn both languages, becoming able to speak four in total (Portuguese, English, Spanish and French). Additionally, the classes will deepen my knowledge in statistics and teach me to programming in R. I'm truly open to take online courses and do part-time internships to complement my CV.

That's it, any advice will be appreciated and thanks for your attention! :)",KoiD3,2,1.0,0,1692026159,2023-08-14 15:15:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15qxjg9/which_careers_could_i_pursue_with_a_joint_masters/,8,2023
15qxfi2,I feel as if I’m getting picked on at work. I’ve no idea how to proceed.,"I’m using a throwaway since my usual account mentions some identifying details and I know some of my colleagues use Reddit. I’m trying to keep the details as brief and as vague as possible, so apologies if anything doesn’t make sense. 

Back in October, I (25F) landed my first office job outside of temp gigs. On the surface, things are good. I have a varied and interesting job in an industry that interests me and I’m saving money since I’m living at home with my parents. I should be pretty content. In reality, I’m really struggling. I cried in the office last week in front of a coworker. I’ve been paralysed with fear over going back to work tomorrow. I called in sick last week due to stress. I feel like I used to feel when I was bullied in school as a teenager. The main reason for all this is because I am being picked on at work. 

I don’t want to give away to many identifying details, but I’m starting to feel really upset over the way people treat me at work. I tripped a few months ago and people still bring it up to tease me. I couldn’t find a set of keys last week that weren’t in their usual location and everyone made jokes about it on the group chat. Someone called me the “office punching bag” a while ago. We had a karaoke night a few months ago and a colleague changed the lyrics of a song to make fun of me. I made a very minor mistake a while ago and a member of management teased me for it in the teams server that we all have access to. A lot of the jokes reference very minor mistakes that have no impact on my work. Management haven’t approached me with any mistakes I’ve made and I’m not on a performance plan or anything. I still feel useless at work. I feel like the teasing is feeding into my quality of work. The more stressed I am, the more mistakes I make. The more mistakes I make, the more people tease me. I’m really starting to reach a breaking point and I just don’t know what to do. 

I’m considering quitting, but I want to get at least a year of experience in this role. I also don’t want to be pushed out because I can’t tolerate a joke. I don’t know if I should bring the whole thing up to management as management are often the ones making the jokes. We don’t have a HR department since we’re a small company. There is someone who handles HR-related issues, but she is very close to management and I don’t think she’d want to rock the boat. My current plan for now is to bring up the teasing in my exit interview if I do quit. I’ve no idea what else I can do.

I am not talking about reviews made by people that are hired and will reach out in 1-2 days.

I did my CV on one of those sites, and funny enough they gave me a 100 after the first review.

At this point, should I even trust them? One of them could even find my work experience that is clearly stated in the middle of the page, another found ""I and me"" in my CV. Good for them but I couldn't find those.

15qub26,I’m being asked to join a manager on-call rotation-should I ask for a raise?,"I work for a healthcare system as a department manager for one hospital. Being on-call is not in my current job description, although since starting in January 2022 I’ve been responding to off-hours pages for my hospital. I brought up my concerns about being on-call 24/7 to my boss, so now the management group is developing an on-call rotation. With the number of managers it’s looking like I’d be on-call once/quarter. The other managers seem to be fine with just absorbing their rotations into their work (we’re all salaried). When I brought up compensation they proposed a “comp day” but my boss basically said a comp day won’t be built in, but if you respond to a lot of calls during your week that you should just take a day off the following week. My issue with this is that the nature of my work would make it difficult to just take an unplanned day off. Every day I have important meetings that impact big projects and groups of other people, so I can’t just decide to take a day off with little notice and reschedule meetings that have been on my calendar for weeks. It also doesn’t make sense that the team of techs I manage get paid standby when on-call but I’m expected to be on standby for free. So my question is if I should ask for a raise in my salary to factor in the additional responsibility to my job role?

15qrwx9,Job hunting and all the rejections made me depressed,"Hi! I am not sure I can post it here but I need to vent, delete if it cannot stay.  


As the title says, several months of job hunting killed all my little confidence, hope in the future and will to live. I (25F) graduated from an IT university in 2020, and I've been looking for jobs until the summer of 2021, without any luck. Then went to pursue a master's degree as well, and I graduated this June, 2023. I've been applying to jobs since like April this year, more actively from the second part of June. I have applied to 100+ jobs, receiveing around 3-5 rejection letters almost daily. Literally 0 invitations to interview or any positive news. I am a recent graduate, and besides university projects I do not really have any experience. And I do not get hired, mostly because of lack of experience.   


Hearing daily that I am not good enough, while having this huge pressure of not having money and living with my parents in a VERY toxic setting has made me extremely depressed, and I also got to a point where I am thinking about suicide every day. Even though it may seem that I am super negative or whatever, I know that I would be a great work force, once I would get used to a place and get some initial help. However, I cannot prove this since my CV lacks experience.   


I am trying to learn and exercise more daily, work on hobby projects and all (following courses, started a few projects etc) but it is extremely hard without a will to even live, meanwhile still gettin tons of rejection letters. I am slowly getting to a point where I feel sick to my stomach thinking about all this IT stuff - as in I don't even want to work with it because it feels so impossible to get into. And I am griefing my 5 years of spending my time on this, without any luck.    


And I am hard working, and enjoy coding, just simply my mind is a big enemy right now, that is fueled by the constant rejection and negativity, which physically does not let me to do anything. I feel numb and hopeless.   


I am not sure that there is a way out of this bu I would really want to work as a front end developer, yet it does not seem that it will ever happen.

On the basis of my computer engineering master's I'm trying to get an internship or an entry level job. I simply want to do proper engineering work, and that too related to computer related industry.  
  
Do you think mentioning of my pursuing of two master's on my resume will help me, or affect me in a negative manner? Does it look bad or weird mentioning pursuing of two master's? Will it elevate my chances of getting hired?  
  
One of my friends was suggesting me that I should only mention computer engineering master's since it shows that I'm more focussed and also shows that I know what I really want to do with my life. It has also been pointed out that the potential employer might think I'm overqualified or too academic for an entry-level position. Since I don't have any experience for the jobs I want to apply for, therefore I think internship or entry-level job is the best choice for me.

What's your opinion? Could you please guide me? Thanks for your time.",PainterGuy1995,1,1.0,2,1692004717,2023-08-14 09:18:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15qplqu/is_it_a_good_idea_to_mention_that_im_pursuing_two/,8,2023
15qo3fe,I feel lost at my first job out of college. Help!!,"I (23/F) just completed my MBA in May. I joined the post graduate programme right after my bachelor’s without working in between as my parents wouldn’t allow it. I still live with my parents (This is very common, almost a norm, in the country where I’m from). I have always wanted to work in HR, I did a few internships while I was working on my MBA and I quite liked it. Most of my internships were with startups that had less that 100-200 employees. After I completed my post grad, I got into a huge company (18k+ employees) as an HRBP. While the people seem nice, the company puts a lot of stress on the employees. Here are a few things which I found a little dicey about the company:


1) While the rest of the company comes in around 9:30 AM and leaves by 5-5:30 PM. The HR Team is expected to be there till 7-7:30 PM minimum.

2) I live in a really busy city. My commute one way is almost an hour or so. The communes along with the office timings makes my day a 12 hour day (I leave my house around 8:20 AM and reach between 8:30 PM and 9 PM).

3) The team structure is horrible. The team consists of me, another new joinee and two people who have been in the company for almost 5 years. Our manager came in around December. The other two people don’t like him as he joined after them and they don’t talk to him at all. The two senior members directly report to our manager’s manager. The two senior employees, along with the manager, give me and the new joiner work and it’s really complicated as it’s like we have 3 managers.

4) We weren’t trained at all or told what the policies and processes are. We have to figure things out on our own and the manager does not respond well to being asked questions or doubts. This is landing me and the other new joiner in a lot of trouble with senior management as we are blamed by the team for almost all big issues.

All this is genuinely taking a toll on my mental health. I’m stressed and anxious and I don’t know what to do. Am I in the wrong here and underprepared for my job? How can I make this better? I can’t even speak to HR as I am the HR. It’s my first job and I feel like I’m so incompetent as I am unable to do it.

15qjo0e,No Education. No Training. No Interests. I have no idea where to go.,"I'm in my mid twenties and my entire adult life I have struggled to just get by. I dropped out of college due to bad grades and failed classes suspending any financial aid thus not being able to cover costs without going into debt. Every job I've worked I can't hold for more than a year or two due to being let go for underperforming which is made obvious by the fact I have others getting started in my same position (at the same job) doing better than me within a month after I have already been there for well over a year. This has been in all of my jobs at entry level IT, customer support, retail, and food service, or really any hobby I try to pick up. Despite trying my very hardest to improve and do the best I possibly can, I seem to fall short in every regard as my incredibly slow ability to learn and capacity for what I can learn are always in my way.

What doesn't help at all is that I really don't have anything I'm interested in doing. Any hobby or interest I've had my entire life has been dropped within a couple of years because I simply lose all care for whatever it is for seemingly no reason. Hobbies and careers I once looked forward to pursuing now seem like they would be a massive chore to be involved in. The only thing that I once enjoyed and still do is playing video games and that really isn't a career. 

I'd like to not be a complete loser sitting in my room watching YouTube all day barely getting through by hopping between dead-end jobs. It would be nice if it could be in a way that doesn't make me hate having to do it in the first place. However I don't see any useful skills I could have that would help given my track record.

Any and all help is appreciated.

15qg53h,Advice on managing up via managing sideways,"
Our team has an unusual organizational design and it has made me start to hate my job. 
My boss has a person who works for them as sort of a general helper.  I’d say the things this person is responsible for in their job description have been completely ignored to the detriment of our department (evidenced in the employee survey). Instead, this person has taken on the role of monitoring other’s projects, and being the intermediary for all communication to our boss.  
This means that information regarding my projects is supposed to go through this “general helper” instead of direct to the boss.  GH ends up demanding a ton of rework, challenges every decision made (even those approved by boss) with a ton of education required on every topic, and generally takes up my time that could be better spent doing my job.

 I’ve also confirmed multiple times that GH does not pass on info that I provide, if it’s different than what boss might be hearing or want to hear. Boss is pissed when they first hear of it from me.

General Helper is someone they brought in to the company- trusted prior employee and considered high potential.
Is there anything I can do to adjust this organizational design or should I just leave?

I’ve started just ignoring requests from GH when I can, but sometimes when they ask me for an update they can share on a project they’ve scheduled daily meetings to discuss or when they say they did a quick review and realized my work was wrong (it’s not, GH is just ignoring the other info I’ve provided and common sense).

I (m28) got hired as a assistant project manager, there is no real project manager. I just didn't have previous experience. I was just being over used as a designer in a different field previously. So anyways I project manage, procure permits which is generally a whole job itself, source materials and figure out pricing, do most of the designs, do actual production on a regular basis, and whatever else helps.

I know project managers at big companies get six figures quite often, I talk to ones from these bigger companies daily and honestly they feel clueless and incompetent compared to myself. I've been doing it only for 9 months but my boss is a high level of perfectionist so I've constantly had to perform to a higher standard. Which I've done far better than the average bear.

15qdykd,Should I look for new job?,"Hello Everyone, 

This is my first time posting so I am sorry if I break any rules - This is something I have sat on for several months now. I am leaving some details out for the sake of anonymity 

Typically being a ""high achiever"" as stated by previous supervisors this situation is embarrassing so I thought I would anonymously turn to the internet first.

I accepted the role (same tech company, different role within the organization) I am currently in about a year ago and it has been nothing short of hell for myself. The previous people in my role did everything manually and documented zilch before leaving the company. So, the first 3 months were truly getting a grip of what is going on, learning how everything is connected, and trying to create efficiencies in these horrible processes. This, obviously, led to some strenuous relationships with my internal business partners. 

The situation I currently find myself in now, many months later, is those same business partners making my day-to-day exhausting. Not trusting my work, nitpicking any presentation I speak to, and even being verbally berated in front of my supervisor and their supervisors (I did take this to HR).

The main reason I have not moved on from this role internally is because those business partners put me on a performance improvement program which lasts for several months so I cannot. I have not started apply externally, is because my 401K will not fully vest until next year. 

&#x200B;

The question I have is - Should I stay and hope 1. to not be fired due to these business partners 2. this toxic environment dies down enough for me to last until the 401K fully vests? Or should I move on and just forget about the remaining 20% of 401K that has not fully vested?  

&#x200B;

I can answer any questions that might make this situation more clear - I am young in my career, definitely do not love what I do (understanding that to love what I do would mean taking a HUGE pay cut), and am quite naive when it comes to how big of an impact this decision can have on my life.

I went to school to become a high school teacher and worked in the position from 2019 to 2021. The job was ultimately not for me and I left due to mental health reasons in October of 2021. In the years since, I had a very difficult time finding work, mostly doing odd jobs while substitute teaching and working as a stagehand in local venues. Back in March of this year, I got a job working with my wife for a branch of UC Davis as a plant nursery technician temporarily, as we had decided to not renew our least that is up at the end of this month. We made the decision to move in with my parents in Placer County so that we can get a fresh start and find solid jobs in the area, with our ultimate goal being to buy a house and start to build equity. Fortunately, she has found a career path with lots of options for work at the city, county, and state level and has a good idea of what she is looking for. In my case, I am quite the opposite. In addition to teaching and live entertainment work, I have also worked for a retail nursery, as a barista, carpenter (mainly flooring), and warehouse manager. I worry about looking at white collar work as it seems like AI automation is on the horizon, and due to severe carpal tunnel/tendonitis in my arms and wrists, blue collar work is also quite difficult for me. Figured I would turn to the fine people of Reddit to see if anyone has any suggestions on options that I might start exploring.

15qcj45,Should I Omit Employment for Six Months or Less on My Tech Sales Resume?,"I've sent out hundreds if not over a thousand, resumes over the last six months, and I'm not getting much traction. I think the issue is my employment history; it looks like this:

15qcbet,What should I do?,"Hi Reddit, this is one of my first posts and I’ve been debating it for a while, I’d love to get some feedback.
I (21m) have been working a construction job after finishing 6th form during covid times. I work with my dad who’s been doing it 40+ years. 
Currently I’m making good money. This year probably around £26-27,k (This is outside of london so quite good money really)  I’m aware this is quite a lot for my age and my dad probably pays me more than I’m worth to be honest. I also have the added bonus of when he stops working, I can take over from him and be making a lot more, Probably 60k+ 

Now you might be thinking I’m ungrateful, but I’ve been thinking about changing career drastically. I know I’ve got it good. Good money, short days, lots of free time, and a small business to take over…. But I just don’t know if it is ‘me’. 
I’m picking the skills up okay, but I just don’t know if it’s really what I’m ‘meant’ to be doing. I don’t think I’m particularly practical. I’m very good with numbers and I always thought I’d do accountancy or something in finance perhaps. One of the things I enjoyed about being self employed was actually doing my taxes and reading up on tax laws as mad as it sounds. I also feel like I should make my own way in the world rather than just doing what dad does.
Now, the two questions
1) am I mad for wanting to do something else when I’m in a good place?
2) what on Earth can I do? I don’t really want to go to uni. I don’t know what job I could do or how I even get into anything else now. I’ve never applied for a job and I really don’t know where to start. Have I got any chance of getting something where I can progress to having a decent career? I don’t want to throw it all away for a ‘dead end’ job.
I also like the prospect of working in London. I don’t live in london but people from my area can and do commute in so it’s an option.

Would love some feedback, thanks in advance 😀",Otherwise_Feeling484,1,1.0,1,1691965695,2023-08-13 22:28:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15qcbet/what_should_i_do/,8,2023

15qa30g,Does it make sense to make a lateral move to return to a former employer?,"I work at a big 4 bank (let's call it A) and accepted this role after I got laid off in my previous company.  I am based out of the west coast. There is a company B located in the east coast where I worked a little over a decade ago. Being closely affiliated with the public sector - it has historically been very stable and even after a decade my former coworkers check-in now and then to see how I am doing.   
Since I left company B, I have noticed my career has progressed very little. Some of my former coworkers there (including the manager I am referring to) - have taken at least two if not three promotions and here I am struggling to keep just one promotion. My guess is this has to do with the fact my domain of work has kept changing every time I changed jobs in that I failed to develop subject matter expertise in any one area before moving on (forced to in many cases). Whereas my former colleagues in company B have been in the same or similar type of business/domain even when they changed jobs internally.  
I am honestly just exhausted of job changes and there is an opportunity to potentially join company B again. However, it's a lateral move from where I am. Would it make sense to move to B given my past history (worked there from 2007-2012) there with the hope of having a more quicker career ramp up and growth rate?",gofardeep,1,1.0,1,1691960369,2023-08-13 20:59:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15qa30g/does_it_make_sense_to_make_a_lateral_move_to/,8,2023

2. Are there better master's programs not listed that you would recommend instead? 

3. Would it be worth it to get this type of degree considering most of my internship experience has been in a mechanical test engineering role?

15q7f96,"Got my first ""real job"" at 30, would it be a bad idea to quit for an internship abroad?","Pretty much that. Due to family and health issues I only graduated at 30 and got my first corporate job while I was in my last semester, though I had unskilled jobs before. I've been there for 9 months. However, I've been thinking about an internship program that I saw was open right now for an opportunity to spend a year abroad. The thing is I never could afford to go into any Erasmus or other exchange program though it was a dream of mine since I was in High School. These type of programs are usually only an option for younger people but this one has an age limit of 30 (included). 

On one hand, I want to get that experience, but on the other, I know that once it's over I'll have to come back and find a job at 31/32, with 9 months of actual experience and one year of an internship. Also, the internships, though related to my major, are all on the field of Internationalization Estrategies which is pretty different of what I do know (Accounting). I'm not married to the idea of doing accounting for the rest of my life but I know that going from field to field isn't going to look good on my resume either.

So yeah, I don't know what should I do.

15q6lm9,"I feel like quitting my high-pay, low-stress job related to my education and try something totally different. How to figure out if it's a right decision and what are my options?","Thanks for reading, I hope it will be useful for even more people than me :)

For 3 months I've been working full time as data scientist in banking company. It is my second job in DS. This one turned out a little bit disappointing - they don't give me any real, interesting tasks and I feel my potential is wasted. On the other hand the job is really low stress and I work like 3 hours a day and I'm paid well for it. It seems like a comfortable situation to somehow finish my master degree in mathematics (year left, full-time but very elastic studies - I'm not 100% sure if I can work and study simultanously but I'll try). I have also a opportunity to quit this job and start working half-time in science institute, which would give me half the money, but potentially work would be way more satisfying. And then continuing my studies would be even more obviously managable. 

The problem is that I'm more and more aware of the fact that it might not be the right career path for me. I mean, I like math and programming, I spent whole bachelor studies being trained to do that and I'm good at it after all. And most of my close people have IT-related hobbies and jobs, it's always been like that. But when I ask myself a question what I REALLY would love to do in life, it never is the answer, I realized. It's like it's okay, but you know - we all have just one life and might want to make it awesome rather than ok. When I think what really makes me FULFILLED, something different comes up to my mind. 

I used to be (for 4 years) a math tutor for high school and college students - and it made me happy and proud. I liked the feeling of working with real person, the human connection, making someone's day and potentially life better by sharing my knowledge and passion with them. Once I was feeling really depressed, took a week off in my prev job and spent it whole on tutoring and immediately started to feel great. Also when I think of different people I admire, my personal heroes and gurus, they all are: physiotherapists, educators, psychotherapists or high impact podcasters (like Andrew Huberman, indeed making others' lifes better by sharing his knowlegde with passion and honesty). I would also see myself as some kind of team manager, someone who lead others' and help them feel good and effective about their jobs. In general I want human connection and somehow utilize my social skills gained after years of effort.

I am only 24 so I guess I can still change my career. But I don't know what to do, I'd start a degree in psychology or so but what if it turns out not as expected and I lost a good salary (whatever you say, money can buy you some happiness, at least now I can affort things like therapy, travel, healthy food, so it's also important). I've been thinking of finding something interdisciplinary like cognitive science, maybe weekend studies and keeping my current job for life comfort, but I don't know what's next and how to really assess what are my options after such (or similar) studies. And even if it's true I don't want to be a data scientist. I'm just lost and don't even have a concrete question in my mind, so please just share any thoughts you have.",Antique_Crab1837,5,1.0,4,1691952000,2023-08-13 18:40:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15q6lm9/i_feel_like_quitting_my_highpay_lowstress_job/,8,2023
15q5gg0,How do I explain this gap in my resume after switching my career?,"Hi All,

**Context:**   
In 2021, I graduated from University with a BsC in Marketing. I then went on to work in a Digital Marketing role for just under a year before switching careers to UX Design. I worked in the UX Designer role for about 9 months until I was laid off. It has now been 6 months since I was laid off, and I do not expect to get a UX Design role anytime soon due to the industry being brutal. 

**Problem:**  
 I am now planning to get back into Digital Marketing until I can find another UX Designer job, but I have no idea how to explain the gap in my resume. Both roles have been under a year. I am afraid of the interviewer asking me these questions:

1.  Why are you making the move back to Marketing?
2. Why did you work as a UX Designer?
3. Why did you leave both roles so early? 
4. How do we know you won't leave again?

Does anyone know how to effectively answer these questions?

TL;DR: I switched careers very early and want to move back, do not know how to explain it during a job interview

15q4yhe,Should I (17M) quit my new job a week after starting it?,"For some background, I was a server for a little less than 2 years at my previous job. I would define it as high-middle class dining and on an average night I would probably make around $140-$200 from tips. I recently quit that job for two reasons. For one, the kitchen staff were assholes and would always give me attitudes for their mistakes. For two, for my final year of cooking class, I'm required to get a job at something food-related, so I saw this as a good opportunity for a change of scenery. 

In my search for a new job I landed a similar serving job at this breakfast restaurant chain. I've been here for a little over a week and it's been okay so far. Everyone of the servers and my manager are incredibly nice and patient with me as I familiarize myself with the menu. Of course though, the kitchen staff have absolutely no patience and don't like to listen to a single thing I say to them. As for the pay, it's definitely a major downgrade. I prefer working Thursday-Sunday during the afternoon and the tips really aren't much so far and I've heard they don't get much better. On my best night so far I made around $90 before tax and it feels like I have to work so much more compared to my last job. I'm aware I probably have to get accustomed to this sort of thing, but I really can't imagine doing this every night for at least the rest of the school year. 

That brings me back to the title. I was talking with a friend who works at this fast-food chain recently and he was telling me that I should go work there. They pay $15/hour straight and he's told me that they hire anybody and the work is usually chill. I'm thinking of really taking the offer and applying, but one part of me feels really bad leaving the breakfast place behind as almost everybody is really nice. Should I quit the new job or stay?

New job offer pays $100k per year but only gives 8 hours of PTO per year (and does not have the potential for much more) comes with the advantage that I will not have to manage employees so that will make life a lot easier, but also the disadvantage of starting somewhere new

As the title says I am torn if I should take this or not.

The job description said there’d be writing involved. As a writer with 11 years of experience it’s the main reason I applied. And it’s why I thought I was hired. 

But all I’ve been asked to write is ChatGPT prompts —because no one in the markcom dept actually knows how to write from scratch— and to sprinkle keywords into these soulless texts to make an SEO dial move into a green area. 

They actually do have blogs that need to be written but they spend about 2k a month on paying freelancers to do it (and we’re just talking 5 blogs a month).

Basically, this is a job that every moron could do. I don’t get to play to my strengths and I foresee a bore out in the future because colleagues who’ve been working here longer do exactly the same work. 

I plan on talking to my manager and suggesting that next to my normal tasks I also write the blogs. Because even with the blogs the job would still be easy but at least I’d get to use my brain and my experience. And since they obviously have the 2k a month budget for it, I will ask for a pay rise.

I just don’t know how to approach this?   Should I refer to the job description in the ad? Should I wait until my probation is over (next week) 


TLDR: I’m in my probation and my job is too easy with no promise of a change in tasks at a later stage. I plan on telling my manager but I don’t how to approach it should I refer to the tasks that were in the ad? Should I wait until my probation is over (next week)?

Any advice on what I should be doing differently?","I am currently in my thirties and have amassed around eight years of experience in product management, predominantly within the realm of physical goods. My academic background lies in design, and collaborating closely with design teams has always been my greatest source of joy. Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to actively participate in various design processes.  About three years ago I decided I wanted to make a career change and redirect my focus on Product Design and User Experience. Design and working with the people using the products has always been my favorite part of the job.   


About two years ago I dove headfirst into making that switch. I started taking online courses (not bootcamps) and connected with mentors to help me improve my skills and create a solid portfolio.  I landed a contract gig in the UX and product management realm for a B2C company. While I loved the experience, the fact that I operated as the sole UX designer and product manager, coupled with this being my first real world project meant that it's not the greatest portfolio piece. This aspect has posed a challenge, considering the remainder of my portfolio primarily showcases ""passion/student"" projects, which I personally consider stronger.   I've been told that my portfolio looks great by mentors & recruiters but In an competitive industry that's only gotten worse with all the tech-layoffs I feel like I stand no chance against those with more experience. I'm kicking myself now because I saw a lot of people I went to school with make this career pivot years ago and I was I was smarter to do so then.   


After the contract, I kept hunting for those product design roles. I had some great interviews and even made it to the final round a few times. But after enough rejection emails I knew I had to face reality and snagged a PM job, since I could only be unemployed for so long.   


  
My current situation leaves me at a crossroads. I'm not sure how much longer I can work somewhere that is understaffed and keeps starting new projects. I know this all bound to blow up sooner than later and the stress is getting to me.   


Does anyone have advice on where I should go? I'm all ears for different ideas. Grad school seems cool but I'm not sure how anyone affords it. If someone could offer any advice on how to make this pivot work I'd be forever grateful. Also, I've been dabbling in basic front-end coding lately, thinking it might give me a leg up in snagging a product design role.",meka_ghidorah,1,1.0,1,1691946198,2023-08-13 17:03:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15q464h/struggling_to_make_the_career_pivot_that_ive_been/,8,2023

I was immediately promoted to a new role that, while not his old title, has many of his old responsibilities. I’m taking over supervising his direct reports. They’re not re-hiring for his role.

15q0ks0,How do I decide my next steps?,"I’m almost 30 now, and I recently started going back to college. I’m only part time getting a degree in Data Analysis, but pretty soon I’m going to go full time school. I’m about halfway through a bachelors now.

I’ve noticed a lot of the students at the school think Informatics/Data Analysis is a pointless degree because they think something like a computer science/computer engineering degree is far more useful. 

The problem is, I’m getting older and I can’t afford (with money or time) to switch degrees. I know I want to be in this field - working with data - but I’m also very interested in programming, cybersecurity, weather data, and agricultural technology. I originally wanted to go for data analysis because it’s flexible enough to work in multiple areas of interest, but now I’m anxious that that is too broad and I’ve shot myself in the foot. 

I’ve been working towards getting certifications in different areas, like cybersecurity and programming, so that I can have a more well rounded resume. 

I feel stuck and overwhelmed, and I’m losing confidence. The fact I’m almost 30 is definitely contributing to my panic here, and I feel childish for not knowing “what I wanna be when I grow up”. Am I overreacting at this point? What’s a good way to figure out what career i should aim for? Does anyone in these fields have any suggestions for more actions I can take to be a better candidate in the job market?

15pwt6w,Challenges with Choosing a Career and Progressing Forward," If you could take a few minutes to read this and offer your suggestions or opinions, I would be extremely thankful. This is my first post on Reddit.   
I'll try to keep this as short as possible. If you need any more information, I'll be happy to share it :) I am 20 years old and living in Europe. There are two sides to my problem.

  
First side:  
 I'm currently working as a freelance video editor on Fiverr,  and I've been doing this for 4 years (since I was 15), and have been successful so far, I've gained solid video editing/color grading skills for my years and gotten constant work from clients every month (have over 1000 reviews, 5-star rating). The average salary in my country is around 700-800usd and I earn nearly twice that per month for a few hours of working per day when I want. I'm really grateful for my journey so far as I made an income which is very high in my country for my years, also love what I'm doing and always seeking to improve my skills and learn more skills and software to get broad knowledge and be a professional one day.

  
Second side:  
 I'm studying computer science at university. I enjoy attending lectures, and it's not much of a problem for me to study and pass exams. Mathematics poses a bit of a challenge, but nothing overly daunting. There's a lot of material covered both in January and June, and almost the entire month is dedicated to studying. I would describe myself as an average student. I've reached the halfway point so far, and I know I can complete it if I continue studying as I have been.   
  
The problem I have is that I don't know what to do next and what to pursue in the future. Specifically, I enrolled in college with the intention of becoming a programmer and working for a company like everyone else. Now, I currently feel caught between two fires and I don't know what to do or which direction to continue in.

  
The issue is that I have limited time for learning what interests me in my free time: to learn programming and pursue that path, working in the IT industry and freelancing on the side (for extra income). However, this would prevent me from becoming a professional in the video industry, as it would take up a lot of time to learn and excel in programming. Alternatively, I could focus solely on learning about video production and continue freelancing, perhaps even starting an agency (in which case, the four years of college might seem wasted).

  
I've also considered something in between, for example: if I wanted to focus solely on video production to utilize what I've learned in college, combining programming and editing/animation/VFX. Currently, I'm lost and unsure about what exactly to choose and stick with. If I hadn't been freelancing, I would have completed college, focused solely on programming, and gotten a job in the industry. If I hadn't enrolled in college and only freelanced, I would have continued that way. Right now, I'm doing everything half and half, and I'm not sure if it's good for my future career.  
Any thoughts?

I applied everywhere and got hired in a software engineering role.
Things don't work out well as my manager switched my role to a tester and told me he didn't believe I can be a software engineer. my colleagues disagrees, but the decision has been made.

I have no experience other than a tech job so far. and tbh I feel I lost my passion entirely. My major was in CyberSecurity but lack of experience made it hard to get a job in tht role, despite it being my passion. Which is why I also apply for software engineer roles at the time.

The tester job didn't really fulfill me in my company and I feel too burn out to even learn another software engineering skill. I had plans to learn more coding so tht i can secure a more high paying software engineering job but I am really, really, not interested in them at all if im being honest.

15psi5v,Is it a good move to ask for a raise?,"I am currently a student and i work part time in a startup alongside my studies (it’s been 9 months). The company pays me well compared to other companies, however the work is more stressful. I usually have to put in 2-4 extra hours per week (which is compensated). On top of that, i generally dislike the work because it’s unrelated to what I’m studying in my degree at the moment. I have been actively looking for part time work that pays the same or more, but no luck. I cannot settle for less because i have additional obligations that take up a big chunk of the pay (apart from the usual student expenses). 

Recently two things have happened. My rent has now increased quite a bit, and that made me live on a budget of $3 per day for food which is not comfortable at all. Second thing is that a few employees have decided to leave the company, and that left the company scrambling to hire replacements in order to get work done. 

Now everyone around me is telling me that this is a good opportunity to ask for a raise while the company is in this position. I would generally ask for an additional $2/hr, But i feel hesitant due to the following reasons:  


1. My pay is relatively high already compared to other companies.  


2. It doesn’t feel right to take advantage of the company’s misfortune when they have been nothing but nice (apart from the work pressure). 


3. It would look even more bad to just do that and then leave the company anyway if i found a job that aligns better with my career goals.

He asks a few questions about the menu and then asks to put in an order. Management wants me to tell him “your server will be right over” but instead of refusing him service because I know the bartender will be a while I take the order. I fully intended to give the check to the bartender so they get the tip. I got accused of stealing the customer to try to get more tips.

I cut the first kind as instructed but the other breads are different shapes so I cut them differently to try to get the portions as close to possible as the first kind.

When I was still in school, I worked at part-times that are $18/hr, so there’s a gap for me. 

I’m just really debating whether I should take this job now, since I’ve been extremely exhausted from doing all the interviews for the past few weeks, and the wait is frustrating. But just by talking to the manger doesn’t sound like a job I wanna work for long term. Another thing, all of my past jobs on resume were all under 6 months. There were things that I wasn’t happy about so I quit them(although I don’t specify these reasons in the interviews), and it’s been a concern for almost every hiring manager, which might be a factor that I couldn’t move past to some of the second rounds. I do have a plan to work in the same job long term, but this might be conflicting if I take this job now. 

Any opinions or advice would be appreciated.",Beneficial-Flan9187,6,1.0,11,1691908525,2023-08-13 06:35:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15prk3u/should_i_take_this_job/,8,2023
15prehh,Can I apply for another job in the same company while waiting to hear about the interview about job 1?,"Hi! So I just graduated from college in May and I’m looking for an entry-level job. I just applied to two jobs within the same company. For Job #1, I got moved to the next step of the recruiting process and invited to complete their first virtual interview a few days ago (I had to record my video responses). I’m still waiting to hear back from them, but it has only been a few days.

I haven’t heard back from Job #2 back. However, I’ve been refreshing their job postings and I saw they just posted a new job posting (Job #3) that I am more interested in since it fits my experiences and skills really well, more than Job #2. Job #3 is also entry-level while Job #2 is mid-senior level. They both required 3+ years of experience, which I already have.

I was wondering if it would be okay to withdraw application for job #2 and apply to job #3 instead, while waiting to hear back from job #1 whether or not I get selected to move on for the second interview? I’m still very interested in job #1. All of the jobs have very similar job responsibilities.

This company is part of a sports industry and they are hiring for an upcoming busy season in Sep so I’m just a bit worried because all of these jobs are seasonal, meaning they’ll be closing applications and recruiting people pretty fast before the season. I just don’t want to sound too desperate.",thepokebowlismine,2,1.0,1,1691907960,2023-08-13 06:26:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15prehh/can_i_apply_for_another_job_in_the_same_company/,8,2023
15pratc,Guilt about leaving a job I love,"I recently had a bit of an unexpected financial situation come up (my financial aid package for grad school ended up being over $10,000 less than I originally believed it would be for the academic year). I am working with the financial aid office to try to find some solutions, but things aren’t looking super promising, and any fix may be more of a “band aid” than a true fix. Because of this, I am thinking of leaving my current part-time job for a full-time position. I can’t make other options work, such as working a second part-time job or asking to increase my pay or hours, because it will disqualify me for my state medical coverage, so I need a position that will provide medical coverage as well as more money. I know my department does not have the need nor funding for my position to become a full-time one with a complete benefits package. I feel so incredibly anxious and guilty about leaving my current job and coworkers. I honestly love my job, coworkers, and managers, though I don’t think that it is a job I would want to stay in forever or necessarily in the field I would like to end up in after grad school. My job spent months training me for this position, which is fairly complex, and I’ve only been working there for 7 months. My main friend group is made up of some of my coworkers, and they’re basically the only friends I have right now. I feel like I’m betraying my coworkers/friends and management and being ungrateful for the training they’ve provided me. I also feel like I have an obligation to stay because it’s about to be busy season and I know my leaving will cause a lot of stress for a lot of people. My workplace and managers have also been flexible in supporting me through health and mental health issues that I’ve experienced while employed there, and this is probably the most healthy workplace I have ever worked in. At the same time, I basically have no savings right now and am barely going to be able to make ends meet if I stay. If one little thing goes wrong in my life right now, I’m screwed. And I don’t have family or friends as a safety net. I have two cats that rely on me, and also I rely on me, but I can’t stop thinking about how this will impact everyone else and my relationships with my friends I work with. I don’t want to feel alone (basically all of my friends right now are coworkers) and feel an obligation to take care of my workplace’s needs at my own expense. I guess I’m just looking for advice, reassurance, or general support. Please be kind, this is not an easy time for me and I have a lot of other stressors in my life right now as well.

15pr089,Conflicting job offers…,"Which offer to pick? Retirement gig over shaping career path?

Background: I have close to 3 years of work experience in my practice area. Generally ppl in my field are working around the clock in high stress environment.

I have two offers on the table: 1. In the same area of practice with 30% raise and normal working hours; or 2. Practice area that I am interested in working in and building a career around with 4% raise. The only hesitation I have with the second offer is that it was initially posted for a level 2 at a higher salary, range comparable to the first offer. When I received the offer, I was then informed it was for a level 1 position at a lower salary, lower than my current. I’ve had multiple calls with HR and hiring manager and have not received a new job description but was able to negotiate for the 4% bump from my current salary. I was informed that was not a reflection of my experience level but the job was changed based on their evaluated needs.

If not for the strong interest I have in the practice area and the types of projects I would be on as well as the boost to my resume to continue in the practice area in the future, I would not entertain the second offer at all. I recognize red flags when I see them. 

However, the first offer is in my current practice that I would not like to pursue further. It has everything else I would look for in a job otherwise: 8-5 work life balance, great pay and compensation structure, great company, better commute, and more independence in my work given my experience level. 

Both jobs have great opportunities for advancement. My question is which one would be the better choice? I’ve struggled for the last couple of days and can’t seem to reach a solid decision.

I’ve been contacted by my previous employer and they have offered me a full time position with similar duties to my part time position. I dreamed of them offering me a full time position for the last three years I worked there but it never happened (Covid hiring freeze). This full time position would pay 5-6k more than my current job, my commute would be about double what it is now, and the benefits are better. 
My only hiccup is that when the position was created it was for two departments, one of which I had a falling out with several people. These people wouldn’t be my boss but I would have to collaborate with them on a regular basis. The issue was never really resolved we just went separate ways.

We have had many resignations in the last few weeks due to division restructure and just general unhappiness. Two of my team colleagues handed notice in and will be completing a handover with me. And with everything in my soul I just DO NOT want to do this work.
For context, I have been in my industry for 10 years. It’s a niche industry which I kind of fell into, it’s boring but I get paid pretty decently. 
I can suck it up and just do what I can while looking for other jobs.
Or I can hand in my resignation, have some stress-free time to myself to think about what I REALLY want to do moving forward. I have no debt and enough savings to last probably a year without working (though I’d rather not use it all) but I’m concerned about quitting a stable, well paying job in the current economy (inflation, rate rises, rent increases, lots of job layoffs etc).

15pnw49,Feel like I'm trapped in my career as any change would result in a large paycut,"Hello all,

A bit of long story short backstory here, I never finished my college degree due to some circumstances about 2 years ago and was temporarily working in the HVAC field as a helper doing install work for $15/hr. 

Well I luckily ended up getting into the engineering side of it which I absolutely excelled at and it ended up becoming a permanent career. I am now 24 years old making roughly $130-140k/yr depending on overtime. Sadly I do know the limitations of the field I'm in here and I have no possible further progression in terms of title/position. The only thing I have to gain is more experience, getting better at my job, and making a bit more money. I know the cap will end up being at about $180k. I hope this doesn't come off as me sounding like I am complaining about this as I am beyond grateful for what I have. 

Really my problem is I feel like I've ""maxed out"" my level in my career here and being so young I would like to continue my advancement. I am also starting to get a bit bored in this field. I've looked into other positions in other engineering fields and it seems like anything I choose would require a paycut, and realistically not have that much of a salary gain potential in the longrun.

Really any advice on how I should evaluate this and progress further would be great. I appreciate any responses.",Downtown-Web-5678,1,1.0,2,1691896625,2023-08-13 03:17:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15pnw49/feel_like_im_trapped_in_my_career_as_any_change/,8,2023

15pk84j,I have conflicted feelings leaving my job,"I have been working for a job for 2 years 8 months. This has been my dream job that I wanted ever since I was a child. My last day is this coming up Tuesday. There is over 50% turn over rate for this job (a social services/non-profit). I am getting a similar job that pays $6,000 less a year. I’m leaving because I wasn’t promoted. 

In February I had to take emergency leave and needed services provided from my job which I was denied for because I work for them. I made a complaint to the director and it eventually worked out. I was on FMLA from February through April. This has created very hard feelings for me because I feel like values weren’t upheld during this time for me and my family. 

My employer has worked closely with state legislative for an increase in budgets for retention efforts. We are also a union. We were approved for bonuses which took a 8 months to go out due to bureaucracy. I got half of mine while I was on leave in March. During this time my supervisor kept messaging me asking if I’m going to leave. I said no, I’m staying. The bonus was half because they weren’t sure I was coming back. Other coworkers have walked out while I was on leave. There were two people on my unit now, me being one of them. 

In March my supervisor also told me I got approved for a promotion which is $10,000 more than what I make currently. She said my paperwork was submitted to HR. I get back after April, no promotion. In June in a unit meeting I make a comment about how slow the promotion is being. My supervisor reacts weirdly. A week later one of the managers and her have a meeting with me and let me know I’m not getting the promotion. When they submitted the paperwork they forgot my employee ID number and have since then given promotions to other people. This was 10 minutes before the leadership zoom meeting with the director about retention. My coworker got the same talk to. 

We were understandably pissed off and asked difficult questions. We had follow up meetings separately with the other coworkers who didn’t get the promotion. Managers did PR work but weren’t able to answer the hard questions (there were 7 available slots for promotions but we now had to apply to the positions instead of getting it automatically like the last 20 people). I said that I’m not going to do work based off of the level someone would do above me. We were expected to continue to fill in as supervisors, manage a full case load, and train new staff. I suggested getting something similar to supervisory pay or cutting our responsibilities. They said no. I have the highest amount of cases based of those not promoted. I even have more than those who did get promoted. 

Management did more PR work and wasn’t consistent in their reasonings. Very bad take on their part. A lot of lying and desperation to keep people. Told me originally only me and 1 other coworker didn’t get promoted (same one on my unit). Then they found out I had friends on other units I was talking to and they expanded that number. I found out it was 7. 

I rage apply to 60 jobs. I still do my work well. I applied for the promotion and 2 months still nothing. I accepted a new job and start this coming week. Management is trying hard to fix their mess but  it’s more in a manipulative manner (if you leave the job application for promotion is withdraw they say). 

What makes me have hard feelings is that one of the 20 people promoted was the one who denied me and my family services. 

Just hard feelings. Tough decision. I told them if they promote me before I leave I’ll stay. Doesn’t look like it. This is my dream job.",MiddleAd6510,2,1.0,1,1691886064,2023-08-13 00:21:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15pk84j/i_have_conflicted_feelings_leaving_my_job/,8,2023
15pjugr,"A golden opportunity has appeared at a job I left earlier this year, but my current job is pretty chill","A bit about me, for context: 31M, in rural central TX. Have a degree in biology, majority of my work experience has been in science education, animal husbandry, and museum exhibits. Lifelong passion for this stuff but had some horrendous and borderline tramautic experiences with past jobs, namely at a major zoo. Pay in this field has never and probably will never be great, but it's improved slowly for me over the years. Side note: probably autistic too, but never been formally diagnosed. Has made things a bit more difficult at times. 

So here's where I'm at. I've  held various jobs, increasing in pay and importance, at a local science museum for kids here in TX for the past 3 or so years. This place has a great mission and great team members, but the upper management (2 guys in particular) has proven toxic, incompetent, and worse to an almost comical degree. Turnover is incredibly high and they've always had difficulty hiring since its about an hour from two major cities. Team morale is usually in the toilet, but almost everyone enjoys the work itself and some stick around longer than is good for them due to the good people at the lower levels, plus various other perks depending on your department. Also not a lot of jobs in this town unless you move closer to the big cities. 

I was at a manager level, and the guy in the director level above me was one of the 2 guys I mentioned that was universally hated across the organization. Not gonna go into the details too much, but he's an egotistical asshole who bungled dozens of projects and yet kept getting promoted by the new CEO directly above him, who is basically an older version of him, if a little less conniving. The part that stings most is that I was after his job before it was even created, but despite his incompetence with the subject matter, he is a better ""business man"" than I and swooped in before I knew he was even interested - and bam, suddenly he was my boss. Earlier this year, another large promotion and raise were waiting for me, but I knew it would put me even closer to him so I was really reluctant to accept. Before that could even happen, an exit opened and I took it pretty quickly - and did not regret it. The level of stress I was under should not be understated, and my depression and anxiety were the highest level since I left the zoo about 6 years ago. 

Now, I work at a ""glamping"" resort in the same town. Basically a place where you pay to stay in a really fancy tent and have 100 acres to roam around on as well as a swimming hole at the river. A beautiful place and a real treat to have spent my spring there among the wildflowers, wildlife, and beautiful weather. My new boss is an incredibly nice woman, and actually the wife of one of my old friends/coworkers at the museum. She's been incredibly understanding and flexible with me, but I am finding myself bored, coasting even. The hospitality industry is not where I expected to find myself. The work is pretty easy and straightforward (cleaning tents, checking guests in, light maintenance work), and the team is small and interacting with our guests is usually pleasant. I even recently switched to a 4 day, 10-hour work week which has been lovely. Not really any room to grow though, and I'm not really learning anything that I feel will benefit me later. The pay is slightly more than I was making when I left the museum, but not as much as I would have made if I waited for that promotion. Honestly I'd feel pretty sad to leave after just getting comfortable here. 

NOW HERE IS THE KICKER. One of my old coworkers from my department at the museum just quit, and was one of their most important, and mistreated employees. It's a small town so I'm still friends with some of those people and grab drinks occasionally, including at his going away party. When I got there, they said ""you'll never guess what happened at work!"". I thought for sure another one of them had quit too, but it was actually the dickhead director this time! (who was not at the party) After a bit of conversation it hit me that now my dream position at the museum was now wide open, and it was obvious to all that they are going to be desparate and that I was a shoe-in. They were all in love with the idea, even saying ""if I could work for you I'd never quit the museum!"". I even called one of the other directors for her opinion (she has always stuck up for me and her employees, someone that everyone agrees is trustworthy). She was also very supportive of the idea and told me how badly they need me back, although the idea hadn't occured to them yet since it was obvious that I left with no intention of returning. She also offered to give her thoughts on my ""list of demands"" that I had typed up, with the intention of going into a discussion with the CEO in the next week or two to test the waters. I have some pretty specific plans in mind to improve team morale, communication, productivity, and guest experience. Mostly stuff that I had tried or wanted to try in years past, but the director always got in the way. The CEO is a piece of shit too, but I feel pretty confident that as long as I have a certain level of autonomy, I can handle him on his own. Nothing's perfect.

I should clarify pay here as well. Never made more than 28K at the zoo (yeah, I know), and started at the museum at 32K. Got bumped to the manager level and made 40K, now making 42K at the glamping resort. All of the lower level staff at the museum got raises as soon as I left (literally to keep more people from leaving so the organization wouldn't be left in ruins), now all making 40-42K like I have been. The director that left was making about 58K (after a recent raise) to the best of my knowledge, and I know anything above 60K would shut down any conversations so that is where I am going to start negotiating, assuming the CEO is open to this whole thing. This level of pay increase would be life-changing - easily covering rising living expenses, the impending return of student loans, my increased car payments and insurance costs, and giving me the financial room to truly enjoy my hobbies for the first time in years, especially travel. I'd even be able to start making real progress on my credit card debt and savings. Also, if I return to the museum I will gain back some good perks such as 3 weeks PTO (2 weeks at new job), 5 days professional development time and the ability to take my dog to work. 

Perhaps the biggest benefit is the resume boost and returning to the career trajectory that I've been maintaining since high school. I'm truly passionate about this line of work, and after leaving I started to feel a bit naked once the initial relief and novelty wore off. I have been thirsting to take my skills in this field into a real leadership role, and have always surprised and impressed myself with my management of people in past positions, even I was on the middle of the ladder rather than the top. Recently too, one of my best friends, a top-level curator at one of the best zoos in the country, has been calling me almost monthly begging me to come work for him. Even though the pay is 46K for a non-leadership role, the zoo is amazing, and I'd get to work for a great guy like him, it's in a part of the country that I have zero interest in living in - I quite like Texas and I grew up here. I'd have to leave my friends, family, and girlfriend behind too. I'm not really considering his offer seriously at this point, but it's a fall back since I could see him working there for the next 10 years or more. When I left my zoo several years ago, the fact that still kills me to this day is that I was better at that job than any other job I've had. I was a rising star, really, and older people in the industry told me they were excited to see what I'd do next. But I bailed on that and never bounced all the way back. But with a higher-level role that I've wanted for years just staring me in the face, it's hard not to be excited despite that organization really putting me through some shit just a few months ago. I'm even looking forward to the challenge, which is kinda weird since my work ethic has always been... let's just say ""tied to the level of disdain for my superiors"". 

So what do you think? Am I being naive? I've never really faced an opportunity quite like this, and it's the first time real financial stability has seemed possible. I'm definitely going to find myself busy if I take this job, but I'm scared that it will escalate to nothing but stress and abuse. I plan to set clear boundaries and demands, and will be perfectly willing (if disappointed) to walk away if negotations don't go in my favor or if I smell something I don't like. My zoo experience was so defining to my work life that I've since been fascinated by labor practices and management in general, so I feel like I am fairly aware of the risks here despite being cautiously optimistic. Maybe I just needed to put all that in words to figure out how I feel, but would love to her some outside opinions!",DracoRJC,2,1.0,0,1691885068,2023-08-13 00:04:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15pjugr/a_golden_opportunity_has_appeared_at_a_job_i_left/,8,2023
15pjmeq,Can I apply for another job in the same company while waiting to hear about the interview about job 1?,"Hi! So I just graduated from college in May and I’m looking for an entry-level job. I just applied to two jobs within the same company. For Job #1, I got moved to the next step of the recruiting process and invited to complete their first virtual interview a few days ago (I had to record my video responses). I’m still waiting to hear back from them, but it has only been a few days.

I haven’t heard back from Job #2 back. However, I’ve been refreshing their job postings and I saw they just posted a new job posting (Job #3) that I am more interested in since it fits my experiences and skills really well, more than Job #2. Job #3 is also entry-level while Job #2 is mid-senior level. They both required 3+ years of experience, which I already have.

I was wondering if it would be okay to withdraw application for job #2 and apply to job #3 instead, while waiting to hear back from job #1 whether or not I get selected to move on for the second interview? I’m still very interested in job #1. All of the jobs have very similar job responsibilities.

15pjbv9,How do I help my direct report's and my salaries be equitable to the rest of the team?,"I was recently ""promoted"" into a manager position (in quotes because I wasn't given a raise nor a choice really) and my direct reports are the team I was working in up to this point.

I can see everyone's salaries now and something caught my attention: the salaries for everyone sit in the middle of the range listed for their titles except for two people: myself (female) and another female direct report. Both of us currently have salaries that are several thousand lower than the low end of the ranges listed per title. I can't see my new title's range exactly but I can see the range of my previous title as someone else on my list has it, and I'm below the low end of that one so I assume I'm below my current one as well, but I can't be sure.

I don't know if this is a sexism thing or not: there's one other woman in the team, and she has a normal mid-range salary, but none of the men have salaries on the low end at all, including ones sharing my direct report's title and my previous one. They're all at or above the middle. It kinda feels like sexism to me but I don't wanna jump the gun and want to get my ducks in a row.

My question is how do I go about correcting this? I've never been in a management position before, nor did I receive any training with this title change, so I don't know how  salaries are decided. I don't know how much power I'd have in correcting my own anyways as I assume my boss would likely be the one to have to fight for it, but how do I correct my direct report's? My thought so far is to make my case to my boss for both of us, but he was both of our boss previous to my title change so likely already knows and either can't do anything or doesn't care. If he can't or won't, do I go to HR? I really just want our two salaries to float in the middle of our respective ranges like everyone else, or at least sit within in the listed range for the titles.

For reference, my direct report got a super positive yearly review this year, and mine was rather positive as well, just to eliminate the 'maybe just a bad employee' theory.

Obviously if I'm told tough luck, that's a different discussion that I'll deal with if I have to.",why_though_throw,1,1.0,0,1691883734,2023-08-12 23:42:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15pjbv9/how_do_i_help_my_direct_reports_and_my_salaries/,8,2023

15pdpyp,"How would you cope with this situation? Overwork, Back to office, etc.","I want to start by saying that I am looking for another job right now, but given some of the challenges I see with the job market, I know it won't be a fast process. 

The Issues

I've been at this company (construction/engineering) company for 2.5 years in a position that's a little higher than entry level. During the interview I was told that I would be on a path for advancement in the coming year. 

1. I have been told to wait a little longer for mentorship and advancement. During both of my reviews I've been told that I am not ready and my performance is a 3 out of 5. It turns out everyone received the same feedback from the same supervisor. 
2. In April, my VP level supervisor/hiring manager was laid off/fired after 18 years with the company. Many of my co-workers were spread out and now report to different supervisiors in the same department.
3. Two weeks later our front office admin was laid off. I was immediately tasked to take over that job under the guise that the responsibilities doesn't equate to a full-time position. I now have to do the job I was hired for *and* the office housekeeping work. 
4. After a week I realized that it was a huge mistake. I am worn out. My job is now 0-60 without any breaks. I am pulled between meeting our clients needs, meeting my departments needs, communicating with vendors (with hard deadlines) and having to do the office work (phones, shipping and delivery, mail, taking care of the break room, ordering supplies, managing building maintenance, ensuring HR related paperwork gets scanned and emailed to our parent company HQ, and so on).
5. I have been going to the office three days a week since July 2021 and now I am told that I have to go in 5-days a week. Over the past two weeks, we have been working on a large project/proposal and by Wednesday I was sitting at my desk, hungry, tired, sweating, and having (probably) anxiety-related twitching.   My body feels stiff, and I want to scream and run out. 
6. Yesterday, I was given new tasks from an employee that resigned a few weeks ago. So now I am doing work for three people, including my job.
7. 5-days a week in the office will be challenging since (1) I use Thursday and Friday now to actually get my primary job done w/o all of the office stuff I have to do, and (2) I have a chronic illness, and being at home at least two days a week helps me deal with the physical and mental stress of my job while still doing my job.
8. My job is not progressive and I fear that this will make it harder for me to move laterally in my career despite having an MBA (2020 as a returning student)

15pclu0,Suggestions for Career Shift (Creative -> Stability)?,"Hello good people of r/careeradvice,

My wife is a creative professional who works in a studio (think video shoots, photography, etc).  She is currently a freelancer.

I'm supportive of her career, generally, but I think her industry is changing, and over the last 2+ years, there just hasn't been enough work.  Also, when she does work, it's very famine -> feast, and I get snowed under with her working long days where I basically become a single dad and it's completely unpredictable, which is bad for my mental health.  I also work fulltime in a demanding career.

She's very reluctant to give up her career, but we need her to make more money (two kids, bought a house, etc).

What are some suggestions for decent-paying jobs she could take up as a stopgap when her freelancing is slow, or maybe even transition to if her industry just isn't viable?  Preferably it would be a field that would decrease, not increase, the chaos and stress of our lives.

Her skills:

- Professional communication - she is great at correspondence and drafting publications etc.  She used to work for a book publisher.
- Administrative skills - she has been an administrative assistant and is good at coordinating people in a professional seetting
- Design / Style - she is not a graphic designer, per se, but she's good at putting together marketing materials, working with some light design, has great aesthetic chops, great with interior design etc
- Crafts - she is great at fiber arts, handicrafts, sewing, making shit in general
- Culinary arts - she has a culinary degree, is very talented in the kitchen, with a focus on healthy food / special diets.  She has worked as a personal chef in the past, but found it to be a lot of hours and didn't like being bossed around by demanding rich people.
- Community work - she has a strong interest in community affairs, development, justice, etc.

15pc30r,Found out I’m pregnant after accepting offer,"I was headhunted a couple of months ago and ended up receiving an offer for a role that would be a significant step up in my career as well as a 40% pay bump. The only con is the role is mainly in office, while my current job is fully remote. In any case since this is such a big step for my career I accepted the offer, but still haven’t resigned in my current job as my manager is out on vacation. 

Well, all was good until I started feeling a bit strange last week. Turns out I’m pregnant. It was definitely not planned, but we are over the moon and so happy to be growing our family. If all goes well I’ll be working at the new job for about 5-6 months before going on mat leave (8 months or so since I’m in Europe). So basically I would spend more time on leave than actually working during my first year in the role. 

I really don’t know what to do. On one hand I have worked my whole life for a role like this. On the other, I don’t know how this will be perceived by the new company or even if this the best time in my life to make such a big change.

15pbs39,Seeking advice on how best to use a systems engineering degree and potentially emigrate,"So, I've just graduated with a master's in systems and control engineering at a reputable university in the UK. During my time at university, I did a fair bit, including rewriting altitude records with my university rocketry society and winning a highly competitive leadership scholarship with a UK engineering organisation, amongst other things. I'm not saying this to gloat but to give some perspective that I've not just got the degree.   
I'm currently interning at an engineering consultancy in London, which focuses on civil engineering and cities. My role leverages fairly few of the skills I developed during my course, and focuses mainly on data-related tasks, I'm mainly using SQL and Python day-to-day. I enjoy this but I feel like a beginner with SQL, and that I'm not best using the skills I was taught.   
This brings me to now, where I'm considering my options and what I want in life more broadly. I'm considering different paths I could take, as well as different countries I could work in before I settle. I enjoy complex systems, systems thinking, and modelling complex systems; but I don't see many explicit roles being advertised for. This leads me to my first question:  
Q1 - What roles could I look into that use systems thinking or complex systems modelling in the workplace?  
Despite this, I'm also thinking about potential moves into finance or consulting.   
Q2.1 - For those who've moved from engineering to either finance or consulting, how was the move and did it bring a net benefit to your life?  
Q2.2 - What is the reality of working in finance or consulting and coming from an engineering background?  
I'm also considering different places, including the US, Canada, Australia, and The Netherlands. All of them have pros and cons, and have their own difficulty in moving to. Nonetheless, I want to get a feel for these places to know where to settle in later life. I'm considering applying for the working visas for Canada and Australia, or moving to The Netherlands. My deadline for exploring these places is around 5 years. I recognise that it is hard to get professional work on a working visa. I don't explicitly have a question about this, but if anyone has any pointers or advice on travelling for extended periods of time after a degree, input would be greatly appreciated!",barcodenumber,2,1.0,0,1691864900,2023-08-12 18:28:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15pbs39/seeking_advice_on_how_best_to_use_a_systems/,8,2023
15pbiws,Should I quit the job I started 2 months ago?,"I worked at a hardware store for 3 years and in that time, I did cashier work, work on the sales floor, inventory maintenance, and bookkeeping.I had very good departure and upon my departure, he told me that if my new job doesn't work out, they'd accept me right back. I started working at a community bank two months ago, as I am studying finance, and thought it'd be a good way to get into the industry, I work as a teller. I've enjoyed my time at the bank, but working with very large amounts of cash and the strict regulations have been kind of stressful. The staff and customers are super nice, I just don't think it's for me.

The bank is very, very small. And including me, has only 5 people employed. I'm kind of the outlier as I'm the only male who works there, and am the youngest by quite a stretch (I'm 19, there's another teller who's 20, then it's 43, 55, and 60). And I sometimes find it difficult to relate or contribute much to the conversations. 

Another thing is there was always something to do at the hardware store. There is a lot of times at the bank where we may not have a customer for extended periods of time, and there isn't really any cleaning or busy work to do, so you just kind of sit there on your phone or doing puzzles or reading. Which is great, but I like being productive and feel bad for just sitting there doing nothing. 

The staff is super nice and friendly, but there only being 5 people in total, you tend to run out of things to talk about. 

Point of the post is, should I stay in the bank which is in the industry I would ideally like to work in, or go back to the hardware store where I'm more familiar with the environment and there's more to do.

Based in the UK. I was recently told my only report was being made redundant. I'm still processing this info I'm upset and distressed, I had no warning our team would be impacted. I'm a manager but also given tasks and projects similar to an individual contributor role. My role is safe from redundancy (for now).

I'm not sure what to do still, but due to the title of my role and that I won't be managing someone soon but still a 'manager', I wanted to get some advice. Should look to move away from this title as soon as possible as it then might put me at some kind of risk of redundancy in the future?

15pae8a,I have two job offers. One is a lot of work and pays more and the other is a lot less work and pays 8k less. I'm nervous that I'm making the wrong choice.,"The higher paying job hired me pretty quickly (within a week did 2 interviews and sent an offer letter) and the lower paying job took 4 weeks to do 3 interviews. Not to say that matters but it does show me how organized the company is if their hiring process is slow or fast.

The higher paying job is a lot more work. Lots of calls, tracking, recording screens, meetings, etc. It pays a lot more than the other job, 8k plus 12k bonus. I'm just nervous I won't do well because of how closely they monitor you. I will most likely be locked in the room all day to get the work done.

The lower paying job is very similar to what I was doing before and it's a smaller company. They don't track you and only have 2 meetings a week. For the most part, they don't bother which is a big plus for me.

I probably sound lazy to you. I know I'm capable of doing either job. I do prefer flexibility and an easier work load because it allows me to still do pick ups and drop offs for my kid and be sorta present at home.

I'm running out of time to choose because I only have until today to decide. I thought of course I'll take the higher paying job but it's not exactly the right fit for me. The lower paying job is more my speed, its just the pay that sucks.

What do you think?

EDIT: The lower paying job can give me 45k instead of 42k! The higher paying job is 50k plus 12k commission guaranteed. So now we're talking a 5k base salary difference BUT there's still that 12k commission I would get with the higher paying job.

15p9jjs,"Are there Meyer-Briggs for career options/guidance councilors for adults, that I could utilize to make a career change?","
[Massachusetts] MBA Fine Arts. Worked on the creative graphics, UI/UX side of educational and corporate businesses. Currently work as a department manager at a grocer. Oddly enough the creative side of my career plays well into my current retail profession.

I enjoy aspects of both professions. I do like what I accomplish each day. The creative worlds technology I feel had left me behind though I often daydream of being a project lead. My current profession has too many layers to effectively make change in the way it’s needed - global retailer. 

The one downside I feel in both careers is the inability to grow. Currently, in reality I could always go up through store management and make more but it feels more akin to a babysitter job. Store managements hands are tied tighter than my own.

I’m confident but always second guess my accomplishments believing there’s got to be someone better than me out there, even though I know a good portion of getting hired is knowing your personality jibes with the culture, that your someone others want to work with 8+ hours a day.

Currently, I’m responsible for a variety of budgets - purchasing and labor. Responsible for 50-80k plus (at times) of perishable inventory at any given time every day. Employees and young, old, US natives and from abroad with various levels of educational background.

We serve the public and managing complaints is part of the game. I do well with that and have been complimented by management when overhearing my conversations. 

Am accountable to metrics that if goals aren’t met, have to answer for them. In extreme cases enacting hyper-care to remedy the problem, essentially having to look over the offenders shoulder at every step. I make that process just uncomfortable enough for them so they pay greater attention going forward as to not have it happen again. 

I’m a fair manager, firm but understanding, leading with positive reinforcement that makes any criticism doled out taken more seriously. Becomes more effective and I’ve found as a result it needs to be said less.

I’d say my biggest hang up is confidence, not believing I’m good enough for a more advanced position despite succeeding in past career changes - recognizing and learning from mistakes is a skill set I feel is very overlooked. I’ve taken falls, only to self correct and propel myself forward many times.

Suggestions on an adult guidance counselor of sorts? A Myers-Briggs for career options? Any careers come to mind after reading this?

There's tons of course on websites like skill share, udemy, Google certificates etc, but I'm just not sure where to start. I'm quite good with computers, so maybe software development?

The listed base salary for the new position is $135k but my understanding is that there are essentially guaranteed raises each year (unless you royally suck) of about $11k, maxing out for this position at $200k.

I have been in my current role for 9 years and am currently making $105k, and am anticipating a job loss in December (the place where I currently work has a new leader, and my current boss informed me the day before this person started that the new leader already had somebody that he was going to bring in to fill my role as well as many others. He's giving us a little bit of a runway to find something new).

I have never negotiated salary before for any of the positions for which I've been hired.

In addition, we are expecting a child in late November and I want to make sure I can get at least two weeks of paid leave without it affecting any vacation or sick time or having to take it unpaid.

If offered the position, I would like to ask for $145k and two weeks of paid leave following the birth of our child.

The only reason I know she is leaving is through the usual grapevine.

I really don't want to go to the surprise party. It feels fake and, since the boss is leaving on somewhat bad terms, I don't think it's appropriate. They are also planning some tacky decorations, bagels etc.

15p3cak,New American Funding- Red Flags to Not Ignore,"I’ve worked in corporate for about 6 months at New American Funding (NAF). I’ve got a family so I’m actively seeking a new role before leaving. Since I’ve come here I’ve had several old colleagues reach out to ask about opportunities and I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone come here. Here is what I’ve witnessed and or been told, you be the judge:

1) Dishonest recruitment
   - No paid maternity leave, despite touting female owned and Best Places For Families to Work (a paid for and heavily influenced award), and awful health care

- 401k match -  50% up to 6%, is only deposited once a year at owners approval and someone just told me that when it finally got deposited this year it was capped at $1500 (wtf)

- They call themselves a “family” 🚩🚩🚩, lay-offs are done with no severance, and owners speak incredibly poorly about people after they leave

- Fake dedication to minority communities (see below)

  
2) Every good deed is a PR stunt orchestrated by husband and wife owner aimed at driving sales and personal egos

-  Although not explicitly written this way, they recruit with their mission of homeownership for all referencing their internal initiatives focused on closing the gap in Hispanic and Black Communities, as the market has been tough there are pretty substantiated rumors that they have told marketing to tamp down marketing efforts that resonate with these communities in the form of decreasing diversity in imagery as their credit is lower, they have lower close rates, or they don’t convert on the phone so not worth it. I’ve also heard they are quietly removing this focus from their company objectives. As a minority myself, I also have a mission which is to inform my community to take their business elsewhere 

- White savior complex- Please read article where wife calls herself Oprah of Black Lending

3) 100% Privately owned by husband and wife CEOs, this could be a good thing but…

- weekly temper tantrums by 60 year olds

- will scream doesn’t want to be surrounded by yes men, but absolutely wants this (especially the guy), and is!

- brought in teenage son to implement a tech project built on AI- he wasn’t an intern, experts weren’t consulted, engineering team was just made aware 

- will be blamed for their own bad decisions 

- Constant references to how they’ve always done it when there are new ideas

- Reference just getting Chat GPT or AI to do it at every turn

- References to how wealthy and successful they are to demonstrate why they are “right”

4) Surrounded by yes men

- Guy at the top is Chief Strategy Officer but misuses the word strategy regularly. He is like Jafar to the Sultan (except this Sultan is less wise)

- Everything the CEO wants to do is derivative, reactive, and fueled by the last person he talked to, an article he read, or a dream. Not an original thought to be found leading to a constant gross misuse of resources. Project management teams who schedule meetings for Mondays so they can add any new ideas the CEO thought over the weekend to the “project charter”

- Blur lines on using company resources for personal endeavors

I graduated last december with a degree in wildlife ecology. I struggled for a while looking for a job, and finally I ended up taking a summer LTE position in agricultural research. Its a good and fun job but it only pays 15$ an hour and most of my coworkers havent even graduated.

While I can keep working into the autumn, things are slowing down for sure and ive been trying to figure out what to do next.

It seems like I cant really get any positions I could live off of long term.

I was thinking of going for an online masters, maybe in statistics or data science or something like that which could compliment my degree well. Cause I am pretty good at using software and enjoy working on the computer and things like that.

But its kind of a scary thing to drop more money when the degree i just spent the last 4 years working towards hasnt done much for me. 

And plus I keep shifting my focus onto different potential paths every 5 seconds because I don't know what the right choice is.

And to be honest I dont know what Im doing. I dont know what would be a waste of my time or what would be a good path. But I feel like I need to do something before its too late.

15p0of7,Should I negotiate for my first job that i think i’m under qualified for?,"Hello my fellow peeps,

Some insights will be absolutely appreciated! Here’s the story. 

TDLR: I got an offer for my first post grad job, it’s paying the lowest of the JD range, but a lot higher than i think i’m worth based on other jobs i’m interviewing for, should i negotiate? given the job market situation atm as well.


Story: 

I graduated 8 months ago and i’ve spent the entire time looking for a post grad job. I finally landed one at this sportswear company (my field of interest/expertise). This job is one step higher than other jobs i’ve been interviewing, so it’s making me feel somewhat under qualified, thinking i was lucky to even land this role. 

Consequently, when I was interviewing, i gave them a range that’s at the lowest end of the pay scale based on their JD range. (still significantly higher than other companies, due to the higher position)

They then offered me an amount that is closer to the lowest end listed on JD, however based on searching on glassdoor, avg base pay for the similar role is about 10k higher. 

Now, knowing that my experience isn’t the most compelling, Im definitely not reaching for the moon and ask for that 10k difference, however 5-6k would be ideal. 

How should i go about this negotiation, given my situation and experience, as well as the overall job market situation? I’m definitely hoping that negotiations won’t cause my offer to get pulled.",thejayw,5,1.0,4,1691834767,2023-08-12 10:06:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15p0of7/should_i_negotiate_for_my_first_job_that_i_think/,8,2023
15p0dti,Should I go for a permanent mental health research NHS job or a fully-funded PhD in Psychology (UK)?,"Hi, I'm having to make a very difficult decision here. I've been offered a permanent full-time NHS mental health research job (£36-42k,  £29k after taxes). On the other hand, I've also received an offer for a 4-year fully funded PhD in Psychology with a stipend (£18k) plus the opportunity to work alongside the PhD, making my total income at about £23k.

I have an MSc in Clinical Psych, and I'm confused which option I should go for, in terms of financial benefits and career progression. Most people in mental health research seem to have PhDs. I'm unsure if I want to go into academia or work in the NHS in the long run, but money in the long run is definitely a big factor in my decision making.

15ozoh3,Quitting no notice due to fear of retaliation/health,"Would you mention this in a resignation letter? If so, would you go into detail about why you are quitting? 

I know I'm likely burning this bridge but I have a job lined up and I know the second I give notice they'll fire me anyway. They've repeatedly gaslit me and manipulated me when I tried to politely tried to correct them. For example, I tried to tell them denying me an accommodation that HR already approved would go against the ADA and could get the company in trouble. They denied my accommodation for two weeks but then I noticed they backed off harassing me about it. Only to discover the message HR sent them (company email that the entire site accesses and can see all messages sent/received) telling them they were wrong and to back off. Management never informed me of the ""miscommunication/mistake"" or that I could have my accommodation back - I had to dig that info out myself. Another example was when I had proof I gave one deadline but then, assuming there was no proof they got upset that the deadline wasn't coming up ""fast enough"". They told me I was wrong, accused me of lying, and wrote me up for failing to perform. I've heard from the grapevine about similar employees giving notice and being let go no notice from these particular managers. There are many more examples. So I plan to send the email at the end of the shift on my last day before walking out the last time. 

I know it's probably not ""professional"" but this is causing my health to go even more downhill so I need out.

So, if you were in my position, would you state the reason for no notice? Would you go into detail like the stuff mentioned above (obviously rephrased to sounds more professional)? Lastly, would you attach their boss to said email?",Jeanlee03,3,1.0,0,1691831292,2023-08-12 09:08:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15ozoh3/quitting_no_notice_due_to_fear_of/,8,2023
15oy3xa,I like my current job but headhunter is offering more money,"As it stands, I really like my job. I joined this company 18 months ago with zero experience in this industry and only one year of experience out of school working. 

A month into the role, the person who hired me quit, and due to circumstances, I was given the opportunity to take on more responsibilities and gain experience (but not with a big pay increase). I've learned a ton, feel supported, and really believe in the company. I'm kind of meh on the people I don't directly work with and the culture but the work itself is good. I'm giving input, making decisions, and doing things I typically would not be doing with my experience or age (24), which has been incredible for my growth. I don't even have the balls to tell my manager there's another company due to her being so supportive of my growth and career, I just think she'd be so upset on a human level of us getting along so well. 


I never really thought I'd be in this position, but a recruiter reached out, and they're offering to bump my salary by 20% (up to 75k), making things kind of complicated.

This is a company that seems kind of cool but was recently acquired by a different company and is looking into restructuring. I'd be second in command for my department, and they're looking to flesh it out from there. It seems a bit more strict (professional dress code), would add 20-30 minutes to my commute, and overall uncertainty about the culture and stablity of this company/job(There's no red flags, just never actually know until you're in it). 

Has anyone ever made a decision like this that could share their experience? Right now I have a lot of room to grow, a very stable job in this uncertain job economy, but this money would definitely add to my quality of life.

15ovyxr,Serious imposter syndrome: What can I do to overcome it?,"I started a new job in June and I realized my confidence has floored. I love my coworkers, but I do get intimidated by my boss. Her delivery and choice of words can be very off, despite her kind intentions. She also isn’t very clear on giving instructions. I find myself consistently asking the staff for help instead and avoiding asking her for help. 

I always had some sort of imposter syndrome growing up. But now that I’ve started my first ever full-time job, it’s starting to feel more serious. I get intrusive thoughts of thinking that I’m disappointing everyone and that I didn’t live up to the expectations people had of me, since I did so well during my interviews. I physically feel my lack of confidence, if that makes any sense. I feel more vulnerable at work and have intense anxiety of what others think about me. I feel like my lack of confidence has been apparent to others through the language I use when I talk about myself and when I get flustered (which is often). I’ve never had such low self-esteem like this! I also noticed I’ve gotten more reserved. I’m the youngest staff member as well.

15oszm3,My Career and Prospects Are A Mess,"Hi,  
I currently work (freelance) as a Video Editor, typically for Youtube. I have collected multiple clients who are for the most part reliable. I have been doing this for the last 4 years.  
I am good at the job, but I do not like it. The job does not pay particularly well and has no rear likelihood to scale much as I am somewhat tied to the same Clients at the moment. I am trying to reach out to other clients but it is unlikely in the freelance Youtube video editing atmosphere to find high paying jobs. The vast majority of Youtubers are actively seeking to pay as little as possible.  
I live in a relatively poor country (Serbia) where the prospects of earning a high income via traditional jobs are quite low. I am 32 years old, married and earning enough to live comfortably and vacation multiple times a year (this is not that expensive here).  
But almost every day I lie in bed concerned about what to do in the future. The current jobs are not scalable and almost every avenue I attempt at other income strategies so far ends up confounded by my scattered mind, possibly ADHD but it's something like a need-to-know-too-much which prevents me from just getting on with what works, even if it doesn't feel right.  
I could start something like a YouTube/Social Media consulting service where I advise people for their own channels. I have experience with that both for my own and other people's channels. But at this point this seems like a massively saturated market and the doubts creep in and I return to the existing clients.  
I don't know what to do, I am perhaps scared of the future more than anything. I am sure there are plenty of jobs I potentially could pursue, but the doubts inevitably overtake whatever ideas and hopes I conjure.  
I'm not sure if this post is useful to anybody. If you have any advice, please lay it on me. For the most part I am just writing this because I was lying in bed and couldn't sleep because of these fears.

I have been on dayshift for 8 Months after having been on nightshift for a year on the same unit. I prefer days over nights.

 However, 

I’m not fully happy with my job and have been wanting to either go for graduate school, or switch specialties as an RN. 

For a while now I have been wanting to do something more or at least something different. 

I was recently offered a job in a neonatal ICU, which to me sounds so interesting and exciting. Completely different from what I do right now. The con of the job is that it’s for nightshift.. and it’s making overthink if the job is worth it.

I’m very worried about going to Night Shift. I have a happy life outside of work because of my normal schedule. I work the same hours as my significant other and I have time to do things I enjoy.

 I feel that work life balance is good for me at my current job.

I guess I just want input on whether I should accept the job and if it’s worth it.. I’m getting a slight promotion salary wise but nothing crazy. It would be in an area that is different which is what I want i wanted. It’s just not the schedule that I want.

15opxly,Is 200/night a reasonable request for a traveling med/bio sales rep?,"Background:
- I work for a small company (going on my 5th yr) and exceed my monthly quotas by ~100%-150% literally every month since I started. Company is so impressed with my sales methodology they have me travel to train new oncoming reps (which I get comped for)

- Company has given me a fair salary increase yearly which is nice. My meal per diem is $50/night and gas is 66 cents/mile after 15 miles which I believe to be fair.

- after 5 years, I am asked to be more mindful of hotel expenses, even though I am averaging only around $180 per diem on my hotel expense. I am now told I can't spend more than $150/night on hotels (after hotel taxes/fees. 



Requirements:
- job requires ~40-50% travel so I am on the road just about every other week (mon-fri) and a nice hotel is the one thing I have to look forward to.

- I'm traveling mainly within Dallas/houston and find many of the cheaper la quinta and holiday inns within the $100-150 range (AFTER hotel taxes/fees) are run down and have weird smells which is concerning due to humidity levels in these cities. 

- $180-200 (after hotel/taxes) is reasonable IMO and allows me to stay at a decent place for the week, especially considering how much traveling I do.



Question:
- Hotel prices have greatly increased the past 2 years. Is $200 per diem a reasonable request for me to push for?",Pale_Geologist6617,0,0.5,9,1691800648,2023-08-12 00:37:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15opxly/is_200night_a_reasonable_request_for_a_traveling/,8,2023

We share the same cube space at work so I have to overhear all of her extremely loud disruptive conversations everyday, but this isn’t even the reason why she’s toxic.

She oversteps in her knowledge and acts so confidently about topics that she has pissed off several higher ups by lecturing them about their own business/topics while she was incorrect. She always tries to challenge or lecture me about my own process and understanding and is consistently rude to me. Her overall mood swings, condescending rude tone, aggressiveness, overstepping into my space, etc. has made her incredibly difficult to work with. We are peers on the same level but do completely
different jobs. 

I really enjoy my boss and feel like we have a great relationship. I have brought up before how working with this coworker can be tense at times because I feel like she wants to do her job and mine. However, I have brought up how rude and aggressive she is and I feel like my boss has started to pick up on it. I’m getting pushed to the brink of needing to quit because I can’t handle working with her personality or communication style. How do I handle this?

I will try to keep this as short as possible as it's a long story.  
  
For context I'm located in a major city in the US.  
  
My mother has severe mental health problems and mental health problems run rampant on her side of the family. She has been homeless off and on throughout her life and is currently living in government housing because she is deemed disabled due to her severe mental health issues. I don't really have a relationship with her and don't even know what her actual diagnoses are. She abandoned me when I was young and has been in my life off and on since then. Her refusal to cooperate or tell the truth relating to medical questions made treating my own medical issues nearly impossible when they first presented.  
  
I have most if not everything under control but will live with lifelong anxiety and phobias and despite them being dramatically better than before I am still unable to fly to travel or be in buildings above 2 stories.  
  
I can go in the building I just can't go above the ground floor without crippling anxiety that after the second floor gets so extreme I can no longer talk and will have repeating panic attacks until I black out or manage to leave the area.  
  
I have improved on this and am planning on undergoing exposure theory for these phobias once I have health insurance. My state does not offer it to the public unless you are a senior citizen, pregnant woman of low income or disabled of low income. I could easily qualify as disabled but don't wish to go down this route due to the fear of future negative impacts on my life and livelihood.  
  
My attitude with my own medical issues is that I just accept I will have to work harder and longer than others to get where I need to go and there is no point in feeling sorry for myself or making excuses as it will get me no where. You play the hands you are dealt and I've accepted this.  
  
I am able to successfully hide all of this from everyone in my life other than my spouse and direct family. Every employer that ever become aware of any of my issues quickly changed their behavior with me so I learned young to never let my employers know about any of this.  
  
\------------------------------------------  
  
I've always loved technology and have spent the last 10 years studying various technologies and about half way through that process realized my real passion was in penetration testing, exploit development, and vulnerability hunting.  
  
I am due to finish an online degree in cybersecurity in the next year from a regionally accredited university backed by the NSA and have a few entry level IT certifications and I know it's time to start getting IT experience.  
  
My plan is and has always been to make a career working from home knowing I will likely make less than peers, struggle more for positions than peers, and have to be more competent and qualified than peers who can take advantage of in office work opportunities.  
  
Working in a downtown office building or similar is not a possibility for me, at the very least the near future in years.  
  
Does anyone have any advice for me regarding how I should approach this or just generally given my situation?

I have most if not everything under control but will live with lifelong anxiety and phobias and despite them being dramatically better than before I am still unable to fly to travel or be in buildings above 2 stories.  
  
I can go in the building I just can't go above the ground floor without crippling anxiety that after the second floor gets so extreme I can no longer talk and will have repeating panic attacks until I black out or manage to leave the area.  
  
I have improved on this and am planning on undergoing exposure theory for these phobias once I have health insurance. My state does not offer it to the public unless you are a senior citizen, pregnant woman of low income or disabled of low income. I could easily qualify as disabled but don't wish to go down this route due to the fear of future negative impacts on my life and livelihood.  
  
My attitude with my own medical issues is that I just accept I will have to work harder and longer than others to get where I need to go and there is no point in feeling sorry for myself or making excuses as it will get me no where. You play the hands you are dealt and I've accepted this.  
  
I am able to successfully hide all of this from everyone in my life other than my spouse and direct family. Every employer that ever become aware of any of my issues quickly changed their behavior with me so I learned young to never let my employers know about any of this.  
  
\------------------------------------------  
  
I've always loved technology and have spent the last 10 years studying various technologies and about half way through that process realized my real passion was in penetration testing, exploit development, and vulnerability hunting.  
  
I am due to finish an online degree in cybersecurity in the next year from a regionally accredited university backed by the NSA and have a few entry level IT certifications and I know it's time to start getting IT experience.  
  
My plan is and has always been to make a career working from home knowing I will likely make less than peers, struggle more for positions than peers, and have to be more competent and qualified than peers who can take advantage of in office work opportunities.  
  
Working in a downtown office building or similar is not a possibility for me, at the very least the near future in years.  
  
Does anyone have any advice for me regarding how I should approach this or just generally given my situation?  
  
This has been my plan for many years but it's nearing time to act on it and I know it's dramatically harder to find WFH roles especially early in your career.",jinglejangletouchmy,1,1.0,0,1691780728,2023-08-11 19:05:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15ohkpw/advice_for_someone_with_medical_issues_entering_it/,8,2023

15ogr74,Should I stay or should I go?,"Ok Reddit. Do your thing. 

I recently interviewed and was offered a position at a different clinic. They offered me the same pay rate that I'm at in my current location. I accepted and informed my boss, who offered me a $4 pay raise if I stay. 

My current location
Pros: laid back, friendly, beautiful view, I can play on my phone for half the day. Hour long lunch. I haven't been here long but my boss has already told me how lucky they are to have me. 
Cons: seeing naked old people all day every day, not a whole lot of variety, I never know my schedule, I am told the day before what time to be at work the next day, surgery days are 2x a week and low key gross me out, the company does not pay part of the insurance so it's not affordable, we are about to be short staffed due to expanding.

The new job location
Pros: they claim the insurance is affordable, a consistent schedule, half days on Fridays, a variety of daily patients, I get to do my favorite part of this profession including point of care tests and phlebotomy.
Cons: 3 out of 5 of the employees are family, 1.5 hour lunches, I'm not sure what the provider I'll be working with is like. 

Basically I'm bored with my job. I was hoping for a pay increase with a new job but they offered me the same. My current boss is offering a pay raise if I stay. I'm just not sure if the money is worth the boredom if I still can't afford the health insurance. The little things get on my nerves and I'm not very keen on the naked old people bit day in and day out.

I usually leave interviews feeling very confident and excited thinking I'm moving to the next round, and then I get a rejection email with no explanation. If I ask for feedback I get ghosted.

15oeut5,"I was laid off, now I’m applying like crazy. Should I message the hiring managers?","Context:
Few years back I was offered a job at company (let’s call them A), I sent the offer letter to my (at the time) current employer. They matched the offer and I stayed. 

Fast forward some time, the same situation happened except this time I left. I was with that company for some time before the workplace was eating me alive. I was pushing everyone and couldn’t balance life and that with what I was making. I left there for a higher paying job and better company, except that company decided I was overpaid and canned me only a few months in.

So now I’m out of a job and desperate for something.  

Okay, now the question:

A is hiring again, so I applied on ZipRecruiter. They viewed it a few times, gave it a thumbs up, and that’s all I’ve heard. Granted, it has been less than 24 hours. 

The same director that offered me the job from before is still there, and I’m worried he remembered me and doesn’t want to live forward. Of course, this is in my head and nothing to go off of except for what I presented. 

I was thinking of messaging him on LinkedIn, something like “hey, I applied to an opening your company has. I know last time I decided to stay with my employer, but after some time experiencing other companies I would love to make A my home for the forseable future. A is an obvious place to grow and learn and I know I would be utilized well with you.” 

However I’m not sure if it’s appropriate, or if I should reword it. I did also get an interview with another place, but they’re a way further drive, different hour shifts, but slightly better paying out the door.

15oep5y,Ultra Long 5 Year Breakdown to Self-Loathing in a Tough Job Market/ Economy,"So, I'm posting here because it's semi-anonymous and I cannot bring myself to actually post this on a social network as myself because I'm embarassed, hurt, feel less-than, and really not in a good place. Apologies for the length but I need to get this off my chest.

I left an organization in 2017 that I had bee with for almost 5 years. It wasn't perfect but I overachieved my sales plan year after year, received multiple promotions and really felt like I was good at my job. Then my former colleague was promoted to my manager, he was arrogant as an individual contributor and even moreso an awful leader. He decided he wanted to push me out regardless of the fact I was on target for over 100% of plan and delivered the same thing to him the year before as he was my manager. There was no upward mobility in our region, no other sales teams to go to and relocation was out of the question given my wife's career was taking off, so I opted to venture to a new organization to escape this leader.

The first organization I went to was a complete mistake and I knew within the first two weeks it was not a long term fit for myself or any sales person for that matter (the turnover rate I witnessed while there and subsequently after was a revolving door). I thought it best to stay for a year so I didn't look like I was job hopping and really mess up my resume (happened anyway) and I stayed on until the right opportunity came my way a year later.

The next organization was a really exciting opportunity to work for a great leader (still friends today), but 3 weeks after starting the leader told me that I wouldn't have a job in the coming months. Turns out, the acquisition of our company that originally wasn't looking into ""doing layoffs"" was now laying off 33% of this large company upon completing the acquisition and my team and our focus area would not be included in the new company going forward! - Hey at least I got a large sign on bonus, paid for 5 months to do nothing, trips to Vegas & Seattle etc. but.... huge anxiety because again, my resume is taking a hit that shows I cannot stay at one place ""long enough""

I followed my leader to our next gig together and this lasted almost a year and a half. The company had tremendous potential, our sales were rapidly accelerating, our RSUs were looking good regarding a potential IPO. Then at the end of Q1 with a late-stage Q1 pipeline ready to pop for almost 1.3M COVID shuts down all business and all budgets dry up immediately for the type of software solution we sold. I was immediately included in a large percentage layoff for the organization in April 2020.... Hooray for the 2nd layoff in two years!!!! This resume stuff is working out soooo great at one of the most crucial times to attempt to get a job.

Did I mention we had just found out my wife was pregnant a few weeks prior? Application after application, interview after interview I had secured two potential positions - one with a former colleague I knew who wanted me on their team but as I reached completion of the process a hiring freeze was implemented for months, the other I received a verbal offer from HR and accepted only for the SVP to give his boy the job (without interviewing) before the paperwork came over for me to sign!!!

5 months go by, I'm in a really dark place - I'm doing everything and anything I can to make the money we need on a monthly basis (which is super hard starting from scratch to net 10K per month), I start thinking that I'm worth more dead than alive and that at least my unborn son would be well taken care of (tearing up as I right this sentence). Luckily, in September, a former Head of Sales at the company I was with for 5 years had relocated to a competitor and was looking to bring on staff to spin up their first enterprise sales team. I was very grateful for the position and stayed for a year and a half until the market got better (I took a pay cut to go there and the market was better for me to get back to where I was better and there were a lot of growing pains between the enterprise team and the inside channel that had impacted enough of my deals I did not see the company as a long term fit)

I received an offer from a headhunter and took a role with an up and coming software company focused on a niche space with a great track record. My boss was nice and the team supporting me was fine. Remember that unborn son I mentioned? Well, he's now just over 1 and has just been kicked out of two daycares over the last few months due to biting (he is/was a lovely kid besides this and all the teachers and classmates loved him according to the teachers/parents). Living in the state we were in, we had no family support and not a strong appetite to attempt another daycare for the same result to happen we opted to move back to our current state to be surrounded by family for him to grow up around and to be closer to both aging grand mothers that we knew we would have to start taking care of in the near term.

We sold our house in 5 days! The house I had just finished being the GC on for a second story addition building all the creature comforts I could ask for and was a real kick-in-the-pants to let go. Of course, I knew there would be risk moving to this state in terms of my current job and I knew that prospects for my sales background/compensation were not going to be very easy to find. Turns out as expected, my job will not port to this area (and I don't blame them - very happy with how they helped me transition) and I find myself again without work this past November.

Times are bleak on the market as a crest of layoffs start to happen at a lot of large tech companies due to the uncertainty with market conditions in the economy. I get back to that really dark place again, hey I'm worth more not here than I am here... My kid will be well-taken care of surrounded by family and will have the safety-net needed to have everything he ever wants (tearing up again as I write this sentence). I have been through a roller coaster of emotions over these five years with too many starts and stops too many hiccups, and a very depressing/demoralizing circumstance of events. 

Anyway, I leverage my network which feels like the thousandth time and my buddy introduces me to a manager that used to work for him at this company that may have a role open up in my state. We meet, hit it off really well, and we work on a strategy that would take a few months to put me into territory Jan 2, 2023. I am very appreciative of this opportunity but within 4 months and after their business did 33% of revenue as a whole they did a percentage layoff and I got caught up in another one again!!!! - This one probably hurts the worst (and I've already mentioned how dark it's gotten) because I was already closing deals in excess of $200K, I had just received additional accounts two weeks prior that had outstanding contracts over $4M annually and had been driving up and down the state to meet with each of them as their new rep on the account. It was a SHOCKER! But I feel like they looked at my history and said screw it, he's used to this and can handle being laid off for a 3rd time in the last 5 years!!!

My last paid date was the end of last month but my last date of employment for a tech company was May 10th. Over that time I've taken a college class to understand if I want to switch careers right before I turn 40 (maybe, but that route is not the one I'm going to take), I took my real estate licensing and passed the exam (something I've wanted to get to do some personal investing over the last few years), I joined a real estate agency that I thought was a great fit but quickly discerned it was not (and that being in tech for a full time role is better suited for me at this time). I just got turned down by a tech company where my former seatmate had reached out to me about the role years prior (never was the right time) at an exciting organization where I knew multiple leaders....

After all this, I feel really the lowest of the low. I have been beaten up over and over again (mostly by my internal self-hate), I'm lost and I feel as though the resume I tried to protect is the biggest deterrent for me to get an honest seat at the table for a role in this ultra-competitive market.

My son means everything to me, so I do not feel I'd ever go forward with those dark thoughts however, I'm not sure how I can keep picking myself back up again and again after getting knocked around so many times. My self-worth (like I'm sure there are a lot of other people out there as well) is at an all-time low. As mentioned at the top, I am embarrassed... embarrassed to go back out into my network for what feels like the thousandth time and ask for their help. Embarrassed to post something like this on LinkedIn because then people can really see how ""worthless"" I really am (internal self-hate - crying as I write this sentence), and embarrassed to add the open-to-work symbol because I've been so flippant about my career in the past (my perception of how it would be viewed). Hell, even writing this I've almost deleted it a few times.

So... where the hell do I go from here?

15oef5l,How to deal with covert criticism,"I have been on the field for only 1.5 years. A coworker of mine has a tendency to criticize my work behind my back, especially on my days off.

This is lengthy. TLDR: How can I deal with passive aggressive coworkers?

He has mansplained so many things to me that are acquired, but basic skills.  For example: How to place the wheels on a pallet jack (He was wrong and I was correct. I went with his placement anyway and it didn't work.) Explaining to me how to tare a scale when I used the auto tare feature by simply placing the boat and turning it on. He explained and demonstrated his preferred procedure multiple times because I didn't do it his way. I didn't bother explaining my method because the was directly after the pallet jack incident and throughout the week he had whittled away at my patience for him.

Maybe he thinks I am an idiot. He is more experienced than I am in this specific profession but I am diversely seasoned and highly capable. 

Anyway, I feel like the things that have nothing to do with the calls that are actually what I get paid for making have biased him against me in a passive aggressive and extremely stressful way.

I got a permanent offer from this company recently and was feeling very secure. The following day, he trash talked the summation of my  previous three days of work behind my back and sent an innocent peer over to explain to me how things are done when he could have easily pulled me aside and talked to me about it. This immediately shook my confidence and took away my victory in the battle against imposter syndrome. 

I could be right. The problem is, the work is literally  interpretation and there is no definite and correct answer. The safest answer is to call it exactly what everyone else called it because thats what we expect to see here. The best argument wins until proven otherwise. I don't like to argue and when put on the spot, I freeze and can't defend it. While I'm working, I'm in the zone and I see it all clearly. I can take my time and don't have anyone looking over my shoulder.

It could just be me.

I have had experiences like this in the recent past. I had an engineer fall in hate with me because he was upset I fixed something against his will (to the benefit of the program) but with my supervisors permission and then was proven correct when I said it was an issue of polarity and not phase. He made my life a living hell afterwards because he was in with my boss' boss. I have had others in the distant past when people were upset that I overstepped bounds. Ie: technician doing science, scientist doing engineering, scientist managing technicians, etc.

I'm not perfect, but I like to get things done correctly. I am quiet and only speak up when I know that I am correct.

The bottom line is that I am trying to establish myself in a late in life career. I have issues with self confidence and conflict avoidance. It is impossible to feel secure when this guy just trashes my work and doesn't come to me first. I'm trying to learn, grow and thrive and this does the opposite.

How can I approach this while maintaining security in my career and learning from both the explainer and the experience?

15obogm,"I got a raise, was happy, now I feel terrible","So I (m28) started working for a smallish sign shop back in November. Before this I just did graphic design / production in a different field. The owner brought me on as a assistant project manager. Knowing I'm new to the industry. But they were planning to sculpt me into a project manager. 

Well skip to now, I do project manage, I deal with customers and work out every detail and plan how it's going to happen, I make the quotes, I source the product, figure out pricing, procure permits from the city, do most of the design, I can run every production machine here, vinyl, banner printers, laminator, router. I figure out shipping and packaging as well. And I even had to train the new artist since the people with 30+ years exp weren't really stepping up to show him the ropes. He was also brought in completely new to the industry. Anyways that's my situation.

I was hired at 17hr, felt understandable being they needed to see if I would sink or swim with such a new role for me. Well I'm swimming pretty dang well. I've seen others come and go. A lot of people here are slacking. So recently I tried to negotiate for 20hr, the owner is a decently nice guy and said how about 19 and on your year of being here in November we can talk again about it for more. Talking after 9 months is kind of strange was his point. So I left there happy I got a raise and promise of more talk. Which I'm not worried about him following through on, he's a straight shooter.

But my point of this being, I feel real shitty the day after this. Im not a huge fan of this job, it's stressful, the owner is a wild level of perfectionist so there's always something not right to him, I'm pulling a lot of weight idk what amount would make me even like this job and quite frankly idk how to ask for a super high amount, this is technically the most I've ever made. but I do know I'm doing three different high paying titles worth of work  If I was at a larger company. I feel like I'm getting kind of fucked.

15ob7i7,Not sure if I’m going down the wrong career path,"Hi,
Im 21 and having all sorts of doubts about what I want to do. I feel like I need to make a big decision fairly soon really.
I’ve been working a construction job with my dad who’s done it on his own for over 40 years. He makes good money. Probably at least 60k I’d say. I’m currently earning about 27k (obviously not a set figure as self employment income isn’t guarenteed!) 
I also have the added bonus of when he stops working, I’ll take over. 
I like some aspects of it. We don’t work every day, probably 4 days average as the weather has to be right. When it’s sunny, being outside is great. 
You might be thinking this sounds good and what am I even questioning, however, I’m just not sure if it’s ‘me’. I’ve never considered myself particularly practical. And while, 3 years in, I’m picking a lot of it up, I just don’t know how good I’d be on my own.
I’ve got a good head for figures. I like numbers. I always thought I’d be a good accountant or something more along them lines. I often feel like I’m wasting my life doing this and that if I want to make the jump to something else, accountancy or similar, then I need to make the jump soon, before I get close to buying a house which I’d love to do in my mid 20s

15oaycu,What Career Path will be better for me as a Software Engineer?,"I'm an international student with a Canadian PR and I wish to build a career in Software engineering. I have two choices:

 - Study undergrad in Canada, obtain citizenship, and then move to the USA on the TN visa.

Or

- Study undergrad in the US directly and then look for jobs, secure H1B, and start working during the OPT period after graduation. 

What would be the better option for me?

Money is not an issue and my long term goal is to work and settle down in the US. Also, if I go ahead with the second option, I'll end up losing my PR for being out of country for too long but I don't think it'll be an issue because I don't plan to work/live in Canada anyways.

Is it fairly doable to secure a job and start working in the States on the TN visa?

15oam0m,New position returning from ADA protected leave?,"I am a nurse at a large academic medical center.  I work a desk job and am hybrid, 2-3 days in the office.  I have been on ADA protected leave for about six weeks for surgery.  I did not qualify for FMLA since I hadn't been in my position a year.  I go back to work in about a week.

About three weeks into my leave, my boss called and let me know that our department had undergone some changes due to a massive budget issue.  Due to these changes, I would be reassigned to a new department.  It was a lateral move, though I would lose the 4% bonus my current position receives annually for specific reasons.  I  told her I was not thrilled about this, but would accept since the only other option was a layoff.  Based on my research, this is legal to do while on leave.  However, I started polishing my resume, just in case.

This week, I got a call that now the new department wants to have a ""discussion"" with me before the transfer occurs.  This sounds like I now need to interview for this job?  I'm concerned if I don't interview well or they just don't think I'm a good fit, then I'm facing a layoff?

I'm looking for advice.  I've started looking for outside positions, however, I do a very specific job and the field is limited.  I'm unable to go back to bedside nursing due to physical limitations.

15oagi6,I have 3 offers and have to choose by the end of the day.,"Just looking for an outside perspective because it’s been a rewarding but very conflicted week lol. 

So good news: I have three different offers! (I had a fourth one this week that looked amazing but that I ultimately had to decline for BS reasons, still hot about that one).  I don’t know how this happened, honestly. My biggest priorities for any potential job are whether it allows me to provide for my son, whether it’s fairly compensated, and whether it aligns with my personal values. I’ve been through a lot in my life and have kind of made it my life’s mission to help people who were in my situation. I’ve been able to do a lot of that with volunteer work, but I’ve also been lucky enough to have some jobs that have aligned with those goals. 

So here are the three:

1. Prisoners rights paralegal for a legal aid society. This aligns with my personal values and I’ve been in communication with a landlord who listed a two-bedroom apartment within the prospective salary range that’s a 17 minute bus ride away from the office. (It’s relatively cheap because it’s a six-floor walk up in the BX, but I’ll take it. The local elementary school is also decent). They’re willing to pay the maximum amount for me (which is like 66, and I don’t receive child support, and it is NY, so that’s fueling my reservations). However, the benefits package is pretty comprehensive, and it is very highly rated on employee review sites. 

2. Reproductive rights paralegal for a national civil rights org. This also aligns with my personal values and would pay me more (72), which would put me over the edge in of itself. However, I have heard from multiple sources that this particular org is extremely toxic to work for and has a high turnover rate. If I have to pay the bills, I have to pay the bills. I had two interviews for this job, though, and during the first one all my prospective supervisor did was brag about himself and how much he’s been integral women’s reproductive rights. My last job was also super toxic (I was not working in the nonprofit space at that time, just litigation support at a state agency), and I remember feeling that pit in my stomach every time I came into work. I don’t want that feeling again, BUT it’s more money than I’ve ever seen in my life and I have a son I need to provide for. 

3. Community organizer at a grassroots organization across the country. This is more in line with the kind of work I want to be doing for the rest of my life, but it’s all the way in CA and I’m currently on the east coast. They’re aware of my situation and, even though they were only looking at candidates from the area at first, were open to me because of my resume and want to partially assist with relocation expenses, which is very based of them. However, housing costs seem to be rising in the city and many of the local elementary schools are dramatically underperforming. They would pay really well (about 70). I really got along with my interviewers and it seems like a very tight-knit organization; I genuinely feel honored to be invited in. But I’m wondering about the logistics of such a move and the daily realities of not having a car lol. 

I’ve been talking this over with my mentor (basically my mom) and friends, so I’m not trying to be all “Reddit, into thy hands I commend my extremely personal and pivotal life decisions.” But I’m just trying to get a third party perspective on this based on some pros and cons.",borzoiprincess,1,1.0,0,1691764163,2023-08-11 14:29:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15oagi6/i_have_3_offers_and_have_to_choose_by_the_end_of/,8,2023

He has me and one other guy do all his work plus our work and he takes credit with his boss who unfortunately works remotely in another country. He has been caught multiple times copying and pasting our emails as if it were his own to sound knowledgeable of the system.

I have been offered a general manager role which would be a big step in my career and something I don't see happening any time soon at my current company. The catch is that I would have to relocate to South East Asia (currently in UK) and I would earn less than half of my current pay. Additionally, I would be moving with my partner and employment opportunities for him would be rather limited there.

I am completely torn between these two options.

On one side this is an amazing opportunity and I believe the role would open up more doors for me career wise. I also just want to experience something new as I'm only 22 and these opportunities don't arise often.

However, I am reluctant to give up my current pay and am worried about my partner's employment options (although the company did mention they have a few other roles open).

I am not looking to stay there long-term and would simply use that role/experience as a stepping stone to move to a better paying location.

15o8oyi,I got the job! But I’m worried about the background check,"So, I need advice. After over a year of searching I was finally hired to work as an administrative assistant for a contracter that works closely with a federal government agency. As part of onboarding, I have to complete a background check.

It’s been very in depth so far, asking me to list every address I’ve lived at in the last 7 years, every employer and supervisor I’ve had, people who knew me when I was living at each residence etc. It also asks if you’ve ever been reprimanded or fired at any of of your past jobs. The thing is, I was fired from the serving job I had before my current one for not showing up to 2 of my shifts, AND I kind of ghosted out of grad school 3 years into my program. My instinct is to lie, since my future boss damn near out right told me to lie about whether I’ve smoked weed within the past year, so I know some bending of the truth is maybe expected?

But I’m scared to lie, it’s such a weight on my conscience, plus I worry that I’ll be found out.  My boss told me to contact him if I had any questions about anything and I wonder if it would be helpful or stupid to reach out to him and ask what I should say? I vaguely alluded to a less than amicable break with my grad school advisor during my interview but not getting fired from my old serving job, so he has at least some sense of what my conflict is. 

I know this sounds like a total mess and trust me, I feel like one. But I’ve done so much work to fix myself and I really am so eager to get started at this new job and give it my everything.

15o83a0,"Want to switch teams ASAP, but i fear I’m in too deep","Trying to be as generic as possible, so bare with me if the details seem murky.

I started working in January.  Took the role of the position from my internship last summer. Was glad to be back with the same company, same team, and I was ready to get a big start to my career. 

At my company though, there is plenty of different opportunities internally, and there was one role that I wanted to go after.  I had no idea it was a thing until after I started interning, didnt know it was being offered. I kept it in the back of my head, but now I wish I could start doing that role on Monday.

One of the conditions of my position going from intern to full time, was that I got an invite to the company’s training program for 12 weeks tied specifically to my role. Alongside, half of that time is spent traveling. So I’m very much appreciative of this opportunity, and so far it has been a blast being in this program.

But in parallel to that, comes my work. My team was very small; just my boss/mentor (<10 yrs exp), my senior teammate (<30 yrs exp), and myself (rookie). Halfway thru the year, my boss leaves unexpectedly.  So now my workload greatly increases, and I lose my closest connection to learn from. Currently working 60 hours during the weekdays, with more hours coming in on the weekend. I am being asked a lot for someone who was accustomed to majoring in beers not that long ago. I appreciate having the high expectations, but man this is not the type of work I want to be doing long term.

I don’t think it would be so difficult if I didn’t know that my dream job was a desk away. I wish I could just start the conversation and say I want to transfer teams/position, but I don’t know the smartest way to do so. This training program I am in is currently running, and ends in early November. Part of me admittedly feels bad that I’m jumping ship from a role that the company has invested in me to learn in, but I need to do what’s best for me. This other job is just a complete match for me versus the one I’m currently in.

So the thing is, the job I want asks for two years of experience to start full time. I could wait until i get my 24 months, sure. But I want to see how much I can shrink my timeline. I’m waiting until after my training is complete, so let’s say 12 months by then. Plus my internship, thats 15. And I have a master’s, so I think I could parlay that into my case. On top of that, I am an internal candidate, which can shrink the amount of onboarding needed. How early could I start having these talks with my company to transfer positions? Maybe July? Wishfully thinking, January?

Another thing too, how do I start these conversations? Do i approach the leader of the department I want to go in first? Or do I start out with my current boss?",rs71,1,1.0,0,1691758257,2023-08-11 12:50:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15o83a0/want_to_switch_teams_asap_but_i_fear_im_in_too/,8,2023
15o6tao,Adhd and misunderstanding leadership,"I'm a 40 years old software engineer, was just diagnosed with Adhd last year, and believe I finally undertood what I did wrong my whole life when it vomes to leadership.

At school, I always had good grades. I was pretty sure I was not an average student. I could guess the answersnin the tests by doing associations. But my memory was flacky and I was mocked and bullied frequently because of my odd behavior.

Still, I left school sure that I would achieve great things. Which obviouly never happened. At least thecway I thought.

I was forgetful, disorganized, unatemptive. At the same time now and than I could do some little things that impressed people (thats was me in hyperfocus, an adhd thing).

I achieveed a little but never got to a leadership position. 

Now that I am medicated and understand my condition and I can see why I was never trusted for such positions.

I understand now that leadership comes to:

Bring your ideas and have initiative to make then happen
""Convince"" peers and subordinates to work in your initiatives
""Convince"" superiors to spondor your ideas
Be organized, be on top of things, and have a good memory to  remember the status of  things when needed
Delivery results

I believe I failed because I thought it was just a matter of been smartest person in the room.  But it has nothing to do with it.

And I understand now, that you have to act like a leader before you be are promoted. Otherwise, you wont be promoted.

15o5ybv,Career for an unintelligent failed 3D Artist?,"Hello there. So I have been really struggling to think of a new career path. I couldn't manage to find a job as a 3D game artist which was the one thing that I used to consider myself decent at. It's been 5 months since I started applying and I didn't even get a single interview. For this reason I am starting to think of finding a different career but the problem is I am not smart my grades where always pretty average.  
I have a high school diploma that I got in Germany, but because I have only been in Germany 6 years I don't speak German well enough to be able to do anything past high school plus because of financial reasons I had to move back to my home country so I couldn't do something even if I wanted to. In my home country thinks are even worse since I can't go to college because my home country has this exam that you need to do in 3 different subjects to enroll in college but I have never been to school here so there is no way I can pass it. I can also build and repair computers but I suppose you need some sort of degree to do anything worthwhile with that.  
Tldr I am a failed 3D Artist with below average grades that can speak 4 languages, but can't really spell well in any of them and I can't go to college because of stupid circumstances that are outside of my control.

15o3yji,Exploring Career Pathways: Seeking a Traineeship for Specialized Growth,"I find myself at a crossroad in my career journey, and I'd like to share my thoughts and aspirations with this wonderful community.   


As someone who has previously worked as a 1st-line helpdesk technician out of necessity, I've come to realize the immense value of diving deep into my work, collaborating within a cohesive team, and tackling intricate challenges head-on. Unlike my previous roles, I yearn for specialized tasks that resonate with my analytical and problem-solving inclinations.

My career path has been diverse, ranging from 1st-line helpdesk to database roles  and frontend-er two diffent jobs within the samen company with a brief venture into frontend development. Through these experiences, I've discovered my passion for becoming a true specialist by uning my core skills alike analytical thinking rather than taking on multifaceted roles in hectic work envirement. My ability to discover discrepancies within software design enz., such as uncovering potential security risks, has taught me the importance of meticulousness in the (tech) industry.

Currently, I'm exploring the realms of software development and cloud engineering. I've dabbled in C# and obtaind a offical state certificate and i'm currently delving into Python to optimize my job search process. My journey has been a mix of self-paced learning, often driven by online resources like Pluralsight, Linkedin Learin and short traditional academic Software Batchlor study.

Despite my skills and aspirations, I find myself grappling with several challenges. The lack of a formal degree and my struggle with dyscalculia have proven to be obstacles, particularly when pursuing traineeships or similar opportunities. I'm keenly aware of the demand for software developers and cloud engineers compared to roles like testers or low-code developers, alikek salesforce and I aim to seize this opportunity for career growth.

My ideal scenario involves securing a traineeship that offers above-average compensation, aligns with my strengths, and provides a stable, fixed team environment. However, my lack of a degree needs your solotions to enter, and I'm seeking advice on how to overcome this challenge.

I've received guidance from recruiters and industry professionals who emphasize the importance of making well-informed choices for long-term career prospects. They've encouraged me to avoid short-sighted decisions that could hinder my growth.  Their insights have led me to pursue a traineeship to deepen my knowledge while gaining industry-relevant certifications.  
   
Starting a traineeship seems to require a diploma from an art academy ;) if you lack this, you're expected to take a test. However, it appears that they only focus on the test score. I want to emphasize that I'm aware in advance that my performance in a math test, especially without the use of a calculator and under time constraints, might yield a lower score. Additionally, if you don't possess the right status, some traineeships are inaccessible. Unlike others, I find myself stressed due to the urgency of getting my career on track in a thoughtful manner to ensure my success.

For traineeships that are available, certain criteria are set: having a bachelor's degree, being under 30 years of age, or having a specific status like being a refugee or receiving benefits. These individuals likely don't experience the same stress, as they receive financial support during their studies, while I find myself depleting my resources

 I really thrive when I dive deep into a task. I believe this is why I was able to effortlessly identify a software design flaw in an assessment application that lacked IP logging. This flaw allowed, without detection, the creation of two seemingly 'unique' assessments from the same IP address, right under the nose of the assessment staff. 

I've lost faith in traditional job applications. Take a moment to put yourself in the shoes of an employer using platforms like Indeed.com. When you create an account for an organization, you'll notice that your CV is automatically rejected by the AI if it doesn't meet the knockout criteria. For instance, being under 25, lacking a certain number of years of experience in C#, Powershell, and Azure, not owning a car or driver's license, residing outside a specific postcode, or having irrelevant recent work experience.

I'm torn between the following options:

1. **Software Development:** Currently focusing on C# along with Python, Powershell, SQL, (tigegers, functions, procedures) SQL  Server,  Azure.
2. **Cloud Engineering:** 
3. **Software Testing:** 
4. **DevOps:** I have the impression that communication is more prominent here compared to Software Engineering (SWE) and Cloud Engineering.
5. **Cyber Security:** There are two Security Operation Centers (SOCs) within a reasonable driving distance, but to be honest, I'm not comfortable with driving. Also, I don't have a car. This means I need a workplace that's within biking distance or offers a hybrid remote option.

**Wishlist:**   Securing a traineeship allows me to catch four fish at once: consistent income, meaningful tasks, free accreditation of knowledge, and liberation from continuous job applications. This understanding comes from recognizing the reluctant cycle I find myself in.  I aspire for a traineeship that offers an above-average salary.  A workplace that's either within biking distance or offers a hybrid remote setup, or is easily reachable by train within an hour. I'm naturally a morning person, having worked in shifts during my younger years, which taught me the importance of a consistent daily rhythm. I seek a role that involves consistent interactions with fixed individuals instead of constantly changing contacts. I really want to leverage and deepen my analytical skills, and a traineeship would help alleviate some of the existing challenges. Despite receiving invitations for traineeships, I've encountered the hurdle of not having an HBO diploma. I'm looking for a role that isn't as dynamic as a 1st-line helpdesk position. I want to dive deep into tasks and focus on process optimization. I'm seeking a role where I can gain transformative work experience. For example, a Lowcode developer might struggle to find new opportunities if the only provider in the province closes down. On the other hand, a C# developer with knowledge of Python, Powershell, SQL, Azure, UML, and BPMN could potentially switch more easily. This adaptability could also extend to transitioning to Lowcode development.

As I navigate this journey, I'm curious to hear your thoughts, suggestions, and insights. How can I overcome the limitations imposed by my lack of a formal degree and challenges like dyscalculia? How can I best capitalize on my strengths, such as my analytical prowess and problem-solving abilities, to find a fulfilling and specialized role that aligns with the ever-evolving tech landscape?

Thank you for taking the time to read my story and share your wisdom. Your input could be the guiding light that helps me break free from the cycle and unlock new opportunities for growth and success.",HaEnne,2,1.0,0,1691745734,2023-08-11 09:22:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15o3yji/exploring_career_pathways_seeking_a_traineeship/,8,2023

15o3nh8,Should I pursue this new option?,"Sorry for the lengthy, there is a lot to this. 

I (28f) have been in my current position for a little over two years. I enjoy the job, but I can not stand the people I work with. They are cliquey, and gossipy. As well as they all have degrees , which is brought up almost daily, but they lack common sense or social awareness . So that's mildly annoying.

For example, I recently went on maternity leave when I had my youngest, and I got a ridiculous amount of calls asking for me to come in and do things, since the girls covering didn't know what to do. This wouldn't have been an issue for me, except for several months before my son was born, I requested that they all come and train with me as much as possible. My boss even insisted that they come train, going as far as scheduling times for them to come over and learn. Out of the three , only one of the girls consistently came over and took notes, she even wanted to take over a few times while I observed, to make sure she knew what she was doing. The other two girls adamantly refused, and the one or two times they did come to train they didn't pay attention or take notes. 

So, while I was on leave, these other girls got irritated because they didn't know what to do, and my job was taking up too much time. Granted I work in accounting, and it was year end when my son was born, so that's on me. Anyway, they got an annoyed with covering my job, and on top of the ridiculous amount of phone calls, they decided to go to upper management and complain about me not doing things ""correctly"", thus making their lives more difficult. Example, our filing cabinet was a wreck for a while, and I will take full responsibility for that being an issue. But the two weeks before I had the baby, my actually productive coworker and I went through and reorganized all of the files to make sure they were ready for audit. I was having issues getting the files put away during my pregnancy, as the filing cabinets are up higher and I am short to begin with, add a giant pregnant belly and restrictions for climbing up and it's recipe for disaster. When I returned to work this week, these same files we worked on were back to being absolute chaos, with things out of order, in the wrong files, or generally just shoved wherever they would fit. I know for a fact that at least one of the girls had done this, as my husband works nights at the same company and wandered into my office to charge his phone , and caught her going into the files. 

That, among other things, was brought to my attention less than 20 minutes into my first shift back, when my boss's boss came in and scolded me. I was told that even after 2 years, I needed a refresher on how to properly do my job, and she was displeased with the ""work"" I put in, so she would be pulling my extra tasks until I ""got the hang of"" what I am supposed to do. As well as my 'refresher'course would be overseen by upper management.

This was infuriating for a few reasons. 
1.) I have gotten nothing but praise and good reviews on my work up until this point. I was given access to sensitive information because they said ""we know that you can be trusted to handle this accordingly"". If I was doing so well, why come in and say I'm shit at my job and need to be in a supervised 'refresher'? 
2.) I literally just got back to the office, roughly 15 minutes before that point. I get the urgency of wanting to discuss this with me, but I hadn't even finished setting up for the day yet, or had a chance to remind myself where to start after 8 weeks of being gone. 
3.) I feel like the two girls that complained about me were just irritated because they have been dropping the ball more often than not, and right before I left they were both called into meetings telling them they needed to get it together and stop taking so much time out of their day to gossip and chitchat. So they took that irritation out on me, instead of discussing their grievances with our boss .
4.) My pay is ridiculously low for the type of work we do, and I am barely scraping by even with my husband's paycheck. When I asked for a raise , I was told we had no money in the budget for raises at that time . They must have forgotten I have access to our budgets , and saw all of the raise money only get distributed to upper management... While the rest of us are stuck down here in borderline poverty land.. 

All of this to say that I received a call from a new company that would like to start the interview process this afternoon. The salary is almost 3x what I am making now. It is in a different field, sales, which to be a little braggy is my strong suit. 

I would love to pursue this, as it's a dream position for me, but given the economy at this time, I'm scared to leave my company and start over. What if after a few months there are layoffs, or something happens to the company itself and I am out of a job ? Should I stay at a place that I hate, and I am miserable, or should I take a chance at something that I would love to do and already know I am good at?

15o2920,Advice for dealing with regret (leaving a job I loved)?,"Main question is in the title.



If you’re interested in more context:

I had a job at a restaurant I absolutely loved for nearly 2 years. I left a few months ago for 3 reasons:

1. I technically wasn’t eligible to work there anymore (my boss said he was happy to pull strings to keep me on, but I’d lose my seniority for choosing my favourite shifts. I also didn’t know how long he’d be able to keep me on at that level).

2. I needed more hours for the summer months that that job couldn’t give me.

3. Most of my favourite coworkers were leaving at the same time as me.

I’ve recently started another job and so far it looks like it’ll be good, but I just miss that old job so much. My boss was the best boss I think I’ll ever have. The scheduling was super convenient, too. And mainly I just felt like I was so good at that job! It was so comfortable and rewarding.

15o22d7,Is data scientists the right career for me,"I’ve recently finished my undergrad from biomedical science with 2:1. 

I thought the next course of action was to apply for GEM or  PA but after reflecting my past experiences working part-time as healthcare assistant, I decided not to go that path (I had awful experience with manager / supervisor in the care facility made me feel like I didn’t know what I was doing, shouting at me which resulted in high level of anxiety and made me realize I probably this wasn’t career path for me. As introverted as I am It’s hard to do small talks  when you aren’t extrovert and talking with different people did took away a lot of my energy 😅) Also seeing the state healthcare system really put me off. 

I could just do lab and biomedical scientists which I won’t mind but I don’t really see myself doing routine lab work everyday… i would get bored, I want to actively solve problems. As a matter of fact I don’t think I really want to work under NHS. 

I’ve only recently heard about the  data scientists and I started to become interested. Based on my research so far it seems pretty decent profession for me.

15o1qxx,Internal Promotion: How to Approach Salary Increase Request?,"Company laid off senior manager who part of the responbility went to me. I'm now being promoted from one position to another and was allowed to write my own job description, title, etc...I've already been doing the job since March. 

Salary in my area is $117,000 for jobs with similar roles, experience, and specialty, benefits (some better, some worse). 

I'm currently making $68,000 + 7.5% annual bonus. I would keep the bonus percentage in my increase. 

For reference, a senior manager with 15 years of internal experience (lateral and promoted roles) is making over $150,00 + ?% annual bonus at my company. 

My job description and title is already approved by HR and *""Moved into the system for 'Market Analysis'.""*

**Would it be unreasonable for me to ask for an increase to match?** I've been with my company for 9 years now, and have excelled (not my words) in each position up until this point. 

This is a major shift in responbility from what I was hired into my most recent
internal position for. 

My next question is, **should I be upfront about my salary request before anything is finalized?** That way there's no shock and a bit more pressure on my manager when HR gets back to them, already knowing how much I am going to be asking for. 

My manager overall has been incredibly supportive, along with my director and HR. But there have been no discussions around salary, other than their acknowledgement that I have been underpaid and this is supposed to ""right-side"" me.

I was working a level up all this year from my position because I was told that’s how you show you’re ready for the next level. I was told throughout this year I was getting promoted. 

Imagine my surprise after my evaluation that there was no mention of promotion. My review was glowing. I didn’t really have any improvement areas either. I asked after what was up. I was told I’m not getting promoted because I’ve only been at this company 4 years and it has to be 5 in order for my to move up. 

I just can’t comprehend that that’s the only reason. There has to be something I did. I keep getting the short end of the stick and being overlooked. I don’t see the point in trying anymore.

15nyxum,Does anyone have any experiences moving to a city they wouldn't want to live in for a job?,"I (24M) have been looking for a job for around 6 months now without any luck after getting laid off from my last job. I’ve gotten interviews at a few companies but haven’t gotten an offer until now. Location-wise, I’ve mostly been searching where I've (Vancouver), or larger cities such as Toronto, Montreal, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. 

I recently got an offer for an engineering position near Santa Barbara. It seems like a good job that I think I would be able to learn and grow from, and it pays pretty well (100k). The problem is that I don’t know whether I want to move there. 

I’ve lived here my whole life and I’ve got my family, an established social circle, and a girlfriend of 1 year I don’t want to leave. I know that a lot of people say to get out of your hometown and experience the world and I’ve wanted to do that but I’ve always imagined going to a larger city where there are more people and experiences. I love going to concerts (went to 20 last year) and I’ve been getting into climbing and improv. 

I’ve lived in suburban areas before without a car and I felt incredibly depressed because of the isolation. I’m pretty extroverted but I’m picky on who I consider close friends or girlfriend material and I worry that I wouldn’t be able to find people my age that share similar interests and values. All of the “Pros of Living In Santa Barbara” articles I’ve read list things like being a small, cozy town, outdoor activities, and historic museums and architecture, none of which appeal to me.

From the research I’ve done, I also feel like the salary is not that big of a step up since Santa Barbara is such a HCOL area. In my mind, it seems like the only real benefit is that this is a confirmed offer where I could establish my career. In return, I’d sacrifice my social life, girlfriend, concerts, potentially my sanity, and not even save much more than I could with a job here. I’ve always been a work-to-live guy and I’ve been happy with making an average income at an average job and living a fulfilling life outside of work.

My family really wants me to go, saying that I shouldn’t waste this opportunity and that I could always come back if I really hate it. But in my eyes, it’s not worth all the effort unless I stay for a while, so I would want to commit for minimum of a year, if not two or three. But the thought of living somewhere without a thriving nightlife or a large population of people my age scares me. 

My gut is telling me not to go but my brain is telling me I should take this rare opportunity. I guess I’m just looking for someone to tell me that it would be stupid not to go or that it wouldn’t be worth sacrificing my happiness to go. Does anyone have any similar experiences?",Clone5656,1,1.0,3,1691728960,2023-08-11 04:42:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15nyxum/does_anyone_have_any_experiences_moving_to_a_city/,8,2023

15ny1iw,I just found out my creative writing helped me get my new job,"I've been looking for a job in my field for a while, and finally found one. During my final interview, they asked about my skills, and I mentioned that I write fantasy/sci-fi novels as a hobby, even showing them a hard copy I had on hand since the interview was virtual. 

Several of my new coworkers had made references to my writing this week, but it's listed on my resume so I didn't think anything of it since my resume was distributed to the department when I got hired. Today I learned that one of the people that had interviewed me, who is pretty high up in my department, had actually read my book after I mentioned it (both of them!), and liked my writing well enough that they thought I'd do well in the job since it involves technical writing, even though I have virtually zero prior technical writing experience. That wasn't the only reason they hired me, but it was a contributing factor. 

I'm just blown away that someone considered my writing good enough they'd consider hiring me over it. I don't really promote my creative writing much to people, so I'm always a little mortified when I mention it to people, and they actually seek it out and give me good feedback.

15nv6ot,"Put in my 2 week notice, but my employer is trying to change my mind.","I (27M) work at a small safety company (8 full time employees) that sells, services, and rents occupational safety equipment. I manage the rental department and help the service department as much as I can. When I started in early 2021, there were 4 technicians. Since December of 2022 it has just been myself and another part-time technician to manage both departments. Recently, the other technician put in his two weeks due to the stress and burnout it has caused. Now I would be the only technician for both departments. I am also burned out and have been struggling with the pay and outlook for this job.  My mental health and physical health are in the gutter and I am sick of feeling overworked and underpaid for the role I do. Two days ago, I hit my breaking point and put in my two weeks without having another job lined up. I felt like I needed to choose my health over money. 

I knew the owners would be in panic mode as soon as the they found out I was leaving as there would now be no one to run the service and rental department. I received a couple voicemails and a text right after work asking to chat about it. First thing next morning I had a meeting with the 3 owners and they expressed how they have never had an employee like me and have never fought this hard to keep an employee. After I explained my reasoning, I was asked to take a paid leave of absence for a week and  give them a salary to work with along with some other things that may change my mind. I told them I didn’t know if any of that would change my mind, but I would consider it and get back with them. 

What do I do now? I have a bachelors degree in exercise science and would like to be doing something related to this eventually. Should I take the pay and benefits bump despite the hell that’s about to ensue, then keep looking for other opportunities? I’m also worried about finding another job if I choose to prioritize my mental and physical health. 

When I was hired, I took the lowball offer and it has made getting a size-able raise much more difficult. Below is what I am thinking about asking for now: 

Current package:
44k, salaried
Vacation: 2 weeks

I currently work remotely part time making $50/hr. I don't have any benefits. I have been in this position for about 3 years now. My job is asking me if I am interested in full-time work with limited duration. I have an idea of some questions I want to ask but I am unsure of how to word them. I also am unsure if there's questions I'm not thinking of that I should be asking. 

I know I want to ask:

1. What will my tasks/projects be full-time?
2. Will I be hourly or salaried? (not sure how to negotiate pay either?) If hourly, will I be paid the same rate? If salaried, what is the salary?
3. Does this position include benefits?
4. How long is the limited duration? Is there a possibility my position could be renewed at the end of the limited duration? 
5. Will my supervisor stay the same? 

That's all I can think of for now. If you have any advice on how I can word these in the meeting I would greatly appreciate it. Also any advice on how to advocate for myself for a salary/wage I deserve.

15nu2qf,Is it rude to tell a company that you're interested in them partially because of their international offices?,"I'm (26F, USA based) in the market for a new role that would ideally take me back across the pond. Europe is home. I have a recruiter interview tomorrow with a company very much aligned with my career development goals, but that I'm only considering in the first place because of their offices in Europe. 

I did not apply to a job with this company, an ex colleague offered up my name when their old boss asked if they knew anyone qualified and open to switch. 

My questions are: Do I tell this recruiter that I'm interested in their international offices? Do I shut up and pretend I'm planning on staying in the US as to get further in the recruitment process? Do I casually ask about policies in place for that kind of horizontal mobility? I can't tell how the recruiter will react, so I want to sort of gauge my honesty. 

I feel like sometimes, switching offices can be experienced as switching jobs entirely (both for the person switching and the team they leave behind). Most companies have a 1 year policy before requesting a transfer, I'm aware of that. I would be willing to do another year in the US if I were close to certain that I would have a successful transfer when the year's up. If it's a good company, I would remain with them for years I'm sure, but not in the States.

15ntzkb,Question about uncooperative team members,"Hello

I set up a throwaway account to avoid creating problems as my actual account maybe recognized.  
I recently started in a new job. It was a growth opportunity, small raise, but good career step. Got a 'leadership' role.   
Manager is supportive but a workaholic and expects similar from others. I have two peers say Bob and Betsy that have been in their roles for 10+ years, each with 3-6 people supporting them. I do not have any direct reports at this time, and was told I would get approval to hire my team over the next few months.   
From a work perspective, I have taken on several projects that were previously not getting done and manager keeps pressuring me on completion dates. Work quality/content is nowhere near the expectations that were set when I interviewed. Mostly lower level tasks (I am the analyst/project manager all-in-one because no one supports me in the role). I spend 10+hours every day at work (this is an in-person role) in addition to joining calls early in the mornings.  Projects are dragging because of the lack of any internal support.  
B & B have specifically instructed their team members not to help me with any questions / requests etc. Every question / request must go to one of these 2 (depending on what it is about). They are both highly protective of their turf, and do not want to share information. Betsy is extremely rude and unhelpful. To the point that she has a reputation with some stakeholders (internal and external to the company) who actively avoid going to her unless absolutely necessary. Bob is an expert in blocking and delaying to answer any question. It has been a nightmare to even understand the basic systems and processes in the company. 

I have pointed these issues out to my manager but with no real response except that I need to be able to influence without authority. There are a couple of analysts who try to help out when their managers (my peers) may not be around, or over IM/email directly. I avoid going to them because I am not sure what the consequences would be to them if found out.  
The whole group is very quiet (it is full time in office) and essentially avoids small talk because that has been the tone set from the very beginning by B & B. I moved from a role where I had lively team members, very interactive all the time. So I find this lack of positive activity very unnerving. I am having a hard time breaking it because that is frowned upon by these two.  
I am at the point of just quitting and not showing up to work as it is so stressful, almost hostile. I have stayed in here to tough it out almost out of spite. In the very first week of my job (and multiple times since), Bob specifically said this is a very complex job and the previous guy lasted less than 3 months. Over the past 6 months I can see that the job may be complex, but there is more to it than the job itself as to why the person before me left.  
Any thoughts, anything that I can do to get around this or make my life better?  Thank you",notgonnakeepthisacc,1,1.0,0,1691715123,2023-08-11 00:52:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15ntzkb/question_about_uncooperative_team_members/,8,2023

I thought it went well enough, but when we discussed the next steps of the hiring process, he said “I’ll be honest, we have a lot of impressive candidates, so, that I’m happy about.” and just let me know there would be other interviews coming up. However, he also said when talking about the other candidates “I  hope I’m not disappointed.” I guess after he interviews them. I didn’t think anything of it at the time, but I started thinking it was like passive aggressive, since he started our interview telling me how impressed he was by my application.

15nsjab,Am I kidding myself pursuing a Creative Media degree?,"I’m currently 23 and going to be 24 when I graduate. I did a lot of creative work in high school such as broadcast journalism, photoshop editing, video editing, and graphic design so I thought this major would be a good “practical” degree, as I like it, am good at it, and feel it could be very versatile.

My passion is acting. Every waking second outside of school I spend auditioning and being in productions on the acting side. Initially I wanted to go to school for acting, but due to the lack of money for me to go to college and Covid making everything online, I didn’t feel it would be worth it to get an online acting degree. Instead I chose to pursue a creative media BA with a minor in journalism at my local state school in order to come out of school with no debt.

I’m now a year from graduating (I’ll be done end of spring 2024) but I keep doubting myself. I know what I want to do is act and I plan to move to Los Angeles after graduation with some friends, but I can’t help feel that my degree is going to be useless. I’ve yet to get any internships and honestly don’t see myself being able to get any before graduation. I have a small portfolio but nothing insane, so I don’t think that could help me get a job either. When I tell people what my degree is I always get the same “What do you plan on doing with that degree?” question and honestly I never know how to answer it. All I want is to be an actor and it feels this degree may have just been a distraction with no benefits at all.

Im just not sure what to do. Am I kidding myself getting this degree? Sometimes I wonder why I didn’t just major in theatre, but I kinda hate everything about theatre except the acting part, and even then I don’t enjoy Shakespeare or anything classical. I really like what media offers but I know this is a cut throat field so maybe I should try to do something else before graduating? I often have thoughts of abandoning this degree entirely and enrolling in an acting conservatory. I still have a year left so I’m unsure if it’s even worth it to continue wasting my time if this degree won’t benefit me at all. I just wanted some career advice on if what I’m currently doing is impractical or not.",throwaway62957216,2,1.0,3,1691711345,2023-08-10 23:49:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15nsjab/am_i_kidding_myself_pursuing_a_creative_media/,8,2023
15nrubw,Potential Scenario: Backing Out of Written Offer,"**I'd love to hear about some experiences about backing out of written offers.** ***While this isn't a current predicament that I am in, I am planning for all sorts of scenarios in my job hunt journey.***  


I have just signed a written offer (not a contract of employment; employment relationship is ""at will""; there is explicit language that the employment offer is still contingent upon background checks, etc.) for an amazing opportunity that meets my work culture, team structure, and internal mobility expectations. The job doesn't start for another month! However, I just had a first-round interview with a company that is my chance to finally work towards my transitioning career goals. This is a position where I can learn a lot from, and it happens to have much higher pay, less in-person time, and offers the team dynamic I am looking for.   


I know I may be getting ahead of the ball, but I would (in a heartbeat) choose this second company if they did offer me employment. Normally, I would be turning down any companies that reached out after my written commitment, but this was just too good to pass. I'd love to hear how anyone handled backing out on written offers. How did you approach the conversation? Who did you talk to? What type of repercussions (if any) did you face?

15nqysp,I am 19 juggling university and a high-paying IT job while living at home. What should I do?,"For some background, I am 19 years old, live in the US, and was recently promoted to a Systems Engineer for a pharmaceutical company with a salary of about $110k per year (Pre-Tax). I live with my parents and attend university as a full-time student. The school is one of the top 50 in the United States, and I commute to class which typically begins after 5:30 PM allowing me to balance both. I refuse to take out student loans and pay my tuition in full at the end of each semester which totals about 16k per year after scholarships and tuition reimbursement. I will be graduating with a Bachelor’s in Information Technology within the next two years. I contribute to my 401k up to what my employer will match and currently have $40,000 put away in a high-yield savings account. My credit score is around 790. Understanding my situation is odd, I am trying to determine what the best route for me to take would be.  
On the personal side, I need to work on maintaining a good work-life balance and a healthy lifestyle. Over the past year, I have been putting in about 13 hours a day, six days a week at work while keeping up with school which has taken its toll, but I still really enjoy what I do. From a financial perspective, I am trying to figure out what the best use of the money would be. A big question on my mind is whether or not I should buy a place. My parents are lovely people, and I am incredibly grateful for them, but I do have the desire to move out. I would prefer to have a roommate to lower costs and am exploring options ranging from a proper house, condo, or apartment to even potentially considering the prospect of a duplex. However, being completely new to this, it is daunting when considering questions like: How much should I set aside for the down payment? Is it smart to go ahead with the current interest rates? Should I prioritize looking for a place that could be rented out later on? With that being said, I am really curious about what alternative options are available if purchasing a home is not the right fit.

15nqux3,I just found out none of my colleagues like me,"So I just moved across the country for this job about a year ago. I started remote in my home state and the rest of my team was in office until I was able to relocate permanently. I went into work, did the work happy hours, made an effort to casually say hi over teams and shoot the shit, but I realized I had little to nothing in common with them and they all had very similar interests and things I felt a bit isolated. We have each other on IG and even text from time to time. I am also the only person of color on my team. Today I found out that I am not a part of a group chat on IG, from our temp during one of our happy hours. She’s apparently in it. And when she brought it up in front of me everyone looked around and got very quiet. I didn’t ask because I figured I wasn’t told for a reason. But everyone was texting under the table for the rest of the evening and I just decided to leave.

I know it’s not me. I have really great friends at my old jobs, like close personal friends. And I’ve made several new friends in my new city. I go to concerts and sports games and all sorts of things. By all accounts I’m pretty interesting. And I’m usually told I’m warm and kind. I have noticed that when I talk to my coworkers they pause and look at each other before they respond and it’s always just unnatural. One rolls her eyes anytime I join in the conversation and if i bring up conversation it’s usually dead within seconds. I’m a bit more reserved but I talk when needed. I like meeting new ppl and asking questions. It’s just very hard because I want to enjoy my work life that I moved across the country for and I just don’t.

15nqkoe,Transitioning from a career as an attorney in a midlaw firm to… something else?,"Hey all,

Long story short is that I’m an attorney in a midlaw firm and I’m just over the billable hour / traditional firm lifestyle. I clerked out of law school for a state Supreme Court Justice, worked as a prosecutor for my state’s largest county for about 2 years, then got a job with a large firm. I left that large firm for the midsize that I’m currently at after about 1 year because I thought my previous firm wasn’t a good fit, but as of late, I’ve realized that *I* am not a good fit for traditional law firms. Billable hours has especially been a drag and I want out. 

The problem is, I am not sure where to go from here. I want the flexibility of managing my own schedule, while also bringing in similar pay at my current firm. While I am okay with taking a pay cut, I don’t want it to be too steep. 

Any insight on where to go from here? Have any of you left the law all together, and if so, what did you do? Any regrets?

15nq29o,How Long To Wait Until Following Up on Offer Letter?,"After several rounds of interviews and reference checks at a small company, I was emailed last Friday mentioning the hiring manager would like to give an offer letter. They asked for my mailing address and start date. 

The following Monday, I followed up and was told the CEO and CTO are finalizing the title and pay for the offer letter and should have the offer by this week. 

I’m getting a little anxious and want to follow up tomorrow, but I’m worried it would come off as impatient. The position just seems like a good fit for me, small tight knit team and working on something I’m passionate about, so I just wouldn’t want this sort of opportunity to slip through. 

So I’m wondering if following up tomorrow (assuming I don’t hear anything before lunch) or Monday might be the best way to go? I don’t want to sound pushy but would be nice to put my mind at ease a bit haha. 

Also, is it typical for a small company to take so long for an offer letter? My current company had an offer letter within the day of giving me a verbal offer and assumed it would be pretty “copy/paste” for most situations.

15np07u,WHAT DO I DO😭😭,"Need advice.

I had lasik done and ever since then I’ve had severe dry eye which makes my computer job pretty difficult sometimes. I have a bachelors degree in business management and would love to find a new job.

I wouldn’t even mind taking a lower paying job but I need a job where I’m not staring at a computer all day. Most lower paying jobs also don’t offer much for insurance. I’ve thought about going back to school but can’t take that much screen time either. I feel like I’m in a lose lose situation. 

The main thing Is I need insurance. My job now provides very good insurance for my expensive eye drops and time off for my eye appointments. My boss is super understanding too which helps tremendously.

I was diagnosed with a rare form of neuropathy (corneal neuralgia) from the surgery. I had a coworker who ended up leaving her job due to a different rare eye problem, and apparently she went round and round with insurance trying to ve covered under disability. I think I could probably file but since I am still able to work I doubt they will give me any type of disability. I hear from a lot of people it’s hard to prove your disability.

I can function but computer screens and wind are my biggest enemies. I would quit my job but I really can’t because I NEED insurance.

My HR Manager said FMLA just protects your job while you’re gone and you won’t get paid which makes me nervous if I have no income. Im wanting a new job because I feel l this one is slowly making my eyes worse or going to ruin them completely. Too much screen time for anyone is bad.

15nnshx,Am I Wrong for Requesting Compensation for Additional Work Responsibilities?,"About a month ago, my workplace posted a position for managing the company social media on their website, noting the position would only require a few hours a week and be compensated through a stipend. I had been informally helping the Communications team with social media for months (even though I work in another department), and immediately reached out to ask whether I could be considered for the position (which I would complete in addition to my regular position). They quickly agreed and we began onboarding. 

They did not mention the stipend this entire last month, so today I built up the courage to ask the Communications director about whether they were still offering it. She responded that the stipend was only for someone outside the organization, and our CFO would likely not approve a stipend for an existing employee of the organization. I was a little shocked at her response and just managed to reply “oh, okay!” before she promised to talk to the CFO about it.

I have been doing work for the Communications department for the past month and the workload is about to increase significantly (definitely past ”a few hours a week” like they listed on the position posting) due to the seasonal nature of my industry. However, I can attempt to complete the work within my normal working hours if I get more efficient. It is worth noting that I am an exempt employee. These new responsibilities are not included in my contract. This is my third year with the company.  

On a personal note, I enjoy social media work and want to grow my skill set, but a big reason I took on the additional position is because my student loan payments are resuming soon.

15nn2kq,Need help: paid internship email,"Hi. For context, my internship will start on January 2024, but I need to prepare my application (to companies) this September 2023. I have a list of company prospects and one of them replied to my inquiry regarding internship opportunities. I’ve applied to them before (for a summer job, but I was not chosen). Another information is that I connected with the President of the company on LinkedIn a day ago and I got accepted (as one of his connections). I used those two scenarios to build connection on my application to them.

Now, the President personally sent a reply to my email saying they can take me next year but depending on what area I want to work with them (I want marketing or creative), they will be open to pay me. But if I don’t get to offer business value, then the company won’t pay me. I’m new to this, so how can I tell them on email I prioritize learning and having a paid internship at the same time without sounding so demanding? I really want to work on his company because I felt a connection while browsing about them and I admire their works.

15nmdoj,Job is giving me self esteem problems,"Hi everyone, It's quite a long text so I'm jumping right in! 

Im a junior software developer and I joined a big company with 3 other friends. 

We all come from different backgrounds, mine being the most far off from technology. We meet each other's in a coding bootcamp and we got hired for the same company and got allocated to the same project. 
I've been working no more than 6 months now and things are going sorta rough. I have previous work experience but I still feel a bit lost in what to think of the situation and how to deal with it. 

In barely 6 months I already had three meetings about how I don't stand out technically. I am very open to feedback but all of those conversations were pushing the same points without any concrete prove. The conversations always start the same ""we think you would excel at a more functional level"". The last conversation I had (a week ago), I got a bit feed up and was much more assertive, telling that despite appreciating the conversation a feedback session is to be given feedback, and I asked for concrete examples. The team leader rambled for a bit saying that I ask too much, and it seems that I struggle with basic things. I pushed again, for concrete examples so that I can do better and tackle the things that are alerting to them, the team leader would smile it off and say ""we don't want to discourage you, we like you and that's why we hired you, you could be a really good business analyst"". 

Some context for the situation, we don't do code reviews and when assigned a task I try to push it to the end even when having some questions here or there, I compile all of my questions after running through multiple examples and my questions are always very direct, no rumbling no nothing, I explain what I'm trying to achieve, what I've done so far, what I research and what I'm getting stuck on. I spend some of my time helping and answering everything that needs answering, I'm working as a Full Stack now but I'm a bit better in front end, and the only one from the juniores that knows some of it so everytime I can, I help.

I'm quite talkative and sometimes I like to go into detail in maybe things that don't need it's true but for the rest of it, I might talk with my seniores two times a week asking more often than not, not help but just confirmation that I'm going on the right track. 

My colleagues don't feel the same and I know that comparison is the thief of joy but I don't feel or see myself as less than them technically, I have my struggles like they have theirs but I'm feeling that the expectations for me are higher and they have more time and space to fail. I can do a lot of one-one comparations, like for example, taking more time on a task. If I go off one day of the delivery day they take the task from me and assign it to another member (not the juniors), when joining the project for about three months my colleagues were doing some testing and fixing minor bugs, I was assign development tasks without any sort of supervision (no code review, no walkthrough the business idea). 

In my third week I was assign a task were I supposedly had time to explore a task and was just to get more comfortable with the ideas involved, I had my boss come to me and ask me taking my time was a matter of technical difficulties or if I was just unfocused. I tried not to make too much out of it, maybe he meant it in a nicer way and was just looking out for me, but time moved on and it really doesn't matter how much tasks I do, how much I achieve if I come close to fail they come at me with those sort of talking. 

From then on and have been on and off from development and was also assigned a huge task for the technical design of a new plataform (had to do everything from data models, to design the architecture, detail the APIs and screens). 

But even so, everytime this sort of conversation happen I always get pushed to a more business role again, and it's happening once again. They got me documenting API services now. 

Me and my three friends just got offered a more permanent position at the company as developers and while congratulating us in the meeting our boss is giving pep talks to each one individually (nothing too much, also saying what we could be better at), and when he gets to me he says ""I already think you would be better of as an analyst but you don't care"" and laughs it off. 

I'm confused, frustrated and quite honestly sad. I've worked a lot to get here, I didn't just do a bootcamp, before that I had been self studying for a while, taking some courses and trying to figure out were my skills would be better applied to while working full time. Changing careers was huge for me, since I had previous work experience and was in a good path to become manager, but I really enjoy technology and development, despite knowing I do struggle a bit, I try to get better, understand things better and being helpful to the team. 

The sadness unfortunately builds up when I see members from my team in situations that I'm certain I would be called up for or when my colleagues ask me for help, good enough to help but not good enough to be seen and given credit to. 

Not sure what to do, I know I don't want to be long in the company but since this is my first time working as a developer...this is giving me some self esteem complexes.",Tiny-Dimension-2079,1,1.0,0,1691696911,2023-08-10 19:48:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15nmdoj/job_is_giving_me_self_esteem_problems/,8,2023

15nkvc4,Working in very underpaid job and I cannot leave because of my family.,"I’m (24f) crying while texting this. I’m crying everyday and shaking with anger. Antidepressants doesn’t work on me anymore and of course I can’t afford a therapist.

When I was a new graduate, I immediately find a job. 2 weeks after I have started, the accountant has forgot to enter the amount on system that I must to took from the customer. Which was 2000 euro. Of course it became my fault because I’ve just started and I’m an inexperienced young person. So, they terminated me.

3 months later I found a job again. They taught me literally nothing and I kept asking about what to do they were telling me they will explain how to do it but they didn’t and I’ve started making mistakes.. They were saying that I’ve should have known this because they explained things to me before. Lots of yelling, insults… 2 months after that CEO has called me into his room, he terminated me by saying that I’ve made them lost 7k-8k euros. 

One year has been passed and I’ve terminated twice. I became good-for-nothing according to my family. My father is telling me that he understands everything he knew there is mobbing the companies are doing this very often to young people.

Few months later I’ve found a new job again. Terminated again. We have faced racism in there in our own country. The company has just been established we were 15 Turks in there and a few weeks later they hired 30-40 European people. My friends either left or got terminated for stupid reasons. At the end of the month only 2 Turks remained in there. You cannot imagine what we were going through… I couldn’t leave because my father told me there is nothing on your CV right now that I have to endure for 1 year. I called him everyday told him everyday that I had enough. He doesn’t listen because he is always right lol. Got terminated 2 weeks later anyway because of my decreasing performance while our supervisor decreased the number of the leads we have to call. Ofc he planned this beforehand. 

Yay! My 3rd termination. 

Something like this happened one more time and I’ve got my 4th termination.

Now I’m working on this job since last November. They taught me nothing again I’ve learned everything myself because the people that were before me did not know anything. I am the customer service representative. The sole one in the whole company. I’m also involved with customs clearance, saving the company’s ass from millions of dollars punishment. I’ve made them gain 30k euro from nothing by finding legal gaps. Solved their problems before I started. I’ve even made them (the general manager) learn about the job, the things she did not even know. Taught other partner companies too because we also shipped with them. They adore me. 

The minimum wage has become 11.400 TL last month. They had to raise my wage too and they paid me 12.000 TL. My same wage before the min wage raise in the whole country. I’ve started shaking with anger and anxiety because I do not deserve this at all. My general manager told me she’ll raise my wage 3k TL more by saying that the company is about to bankrupt. Then why the hell did you hired someone and paid him 22k? My fathers friend is also the ceos friend he talked with ceo and the ceo told him they will raise my wage anyway they will pay me 15k I know that I told my father I want to quit it’s not worth it I’m not making money in this job I’m thinking 2848283 times before I order a damn pizza (350 TL). I’m working and can’t afford a Nike. I begged my father everyday I want to leave and today the told me to F off. 

Should I leave my job? If I do , my parents will psychologically abuse me everyday.

15nk8um,Quitting Job to Return to School?,"Hey everyone! Recently the opportunity came along where I am able to return to college full time. 2 years ago i graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. Being only 22 and not having any prior experience in the field, I have felt very lost, and couldn’t find a job i enjoyed for the life of me.

I landed a full time position at a bank, which i am currently employed at now. It wasn’t a job that I necessarily wanted, but i needed something to pay the bills for the time being.

Fast forward to now, I have been working here for over a year and FINALLY decided I want to return to school to become a Physical Therapy Assistant, which is something that always has interested me, as well as obtain my Certified Personal Trainer certificate. I was accepted into a community college in my area that will allow me to do so as long as I start this Fall.

I was going to give my 2-week notice next week, until I recently ran across a problem. Another employee in my department had just up and quit yesterday, and now the department is really short staffed. I can’t really blame them for quitting, our boss is a bit toxic and doesn’t create a comfortable work environment. 

Since that person, who happened to be a close friend, quit just a day ago, all the other employees are really sad about it, and have been saying things to me such as “please don’t leave us! we appreciate everything you do!” (i know, perfect timing right?) Little do they know, I already have my resignation letter ready to be sent and signed. They have never really shown me any sort of appreciation and are being extra nice to me now, it’s almost like they know…

I know I really can’t worry about everyone else and have to do what is best for myself, but I am just really worried to see everyone’s reactions when I give my notice not even a week after a close friend of mine also quit, especially since my boss can be a bit difficult to deal with.

Does anyone have any advice to help me calm my nerves over this? I have been pretty anxious about it, even though I finally have an opportunity to further my career in the field i received a degree in and worked really hard to get for 4 years. I overall just need some tips or advice on what to do or how to handle their not-so-positive reactions.

15njynn,"Lied about company I was going to, how bad is it going to look after I update my linkedin?","I left a job of many years in which I felt underappreciated and ultimately underpaid. Nobody really looked out for me. Like 3/4 of the staff were well paid managers in a very toxic environment - acting like a pack in their best interests. This was derived from terrible executive leadership who was clueless but also retaliatory, so all these people were protecting their best interests I kind of get that. All in all I was a 0 in this company, nobody cared. I saw how other people were promoted or given raises as others backed them up or propped them up.

Anyways due to this toxicity I ended up desperately just looking for any job. I ended up getting a really good job. I didn't think it was going gather as much attention as it did. 

On a weekend I had one of these very important managers - I'm a zero, call me as if we're buddies and wanting to know all the details. At this time my head was not in the right place, I was scared, things weren't as solid at the new place, and I wasn't comfortable sharing the company I was going to. One because I overestimated their power, I was afraid of things falling through at the new job, and this manager in particular had a previous employee he was close with that worked at the new company I was going to work for. All in all I felt I was jumping ship into greener pastures and taken by surprise and at the moment of this call I ended up lying about the company I was going to. I just used a competitor name, didn't think much of it as once again I'm thinking I'm a nobody at this place.

Next day, my manager wants me to ask my new employment place for an extra week to stay at the old job to train my replacement. He makes it a big deal with HR, and HR also kept asking and they also kept asked what company I was going to. Again I lied to HR and used the same company I had told the other person over the weekend. I didn't think it was a big deal. So out of these two people, my bet is it started with the one that called on the weekend, on the next couple of days everyone at the company knew exactly where I was headed, people in remote offices in other states, etc - it was crazy, it's like the secret and gossip spread like wildfire. Next thing I know everybody ""knows"" i'm going to XYZ company. Not only that but at the moment I didn't think about the different companies reputation so in restrospect, it's as if I had told them I'm going to think any company a large number of people dream of going to. It was the talk all over, people were surprised, others seemed jealous, others seem to want to get close or keep in touch because they want to network with someone at XYZ. 

Anyways it was all a lie and 90% of the people in my linkedin are from that old job. I'm still going to the same industry but to a not as stellar competitor. 

1. How is it going to look? Should I care?

I want to keep these contacts in there just so that my profile doesn't look empty. I guess it's going to look bad on me, but I didn't think from these 2 people it was going to spread like wildfire or that people would care. 

Worst part is a bunch of people started quitting and looking for other jobs right after because I guess they felt left behind.

I've felt embarrased and I know I should have probably been more straightforward and be like I'm not ready to share it, but I'm quite young and was taken by surprise on a Sunday morning.

&#x200B;

So is it going to look bad? and/or should I just act like I got mixed up since I only told 2 people not 100+, or maybe act like nothing happened and that they're in some sort of Mandela effect and I didn't say that.

15nj7ge,Which job offer is a better choice?,"Need help deciding between 2 job offer's

I am having a hard time deciding which of these job offer's I should pick. Here is the information I have for both the jobs. 

Job number 1.) Salary: $52,000

Health insurance: Employer pays 50%

Retirement plan: 401k with 5% match
PTO: After 1 year I get a week vacation and then after 2 years I get 2 weeks of vacation. And then after 5 years I get 3 weeks of vacation.

Holidays: All major holidays are paid

Commute: 10 miles to get to the job (about 20 minutes each way)

Growth: A lot of opportunities for growth

Job number 2.) Salary: $47,840

Health insurance: Company pays 100% but only to employee, if I add a spouse or kids I have to pay the difference for putting them on my insurance.

Retirement plan: SEP IRA, the company contributes 10% of annual gross salary into this retirement plan and I don't need to contribute anything of my own income it's given by the company.

PTO: After 1 year I get a week vacation and after that each year that goes by I get a day added for PTO. They also give us 2 sick days each year.

Holidays: All major holidays are paid

Commute: 40 miles to get to job (about 40 minutes each way)

Bonuses: Employer said they do performance bonuses and the employees end up making more money based on performance.

Growth: A lot of opportunities for growth

I'm stuck between the two offer's because job number 1 has a little more salary and PTO is rewarded faster. And smaller commute. But Job number 2 has 100% paid insurance and performance bonuses. But it's a longer commute. I also don't know which retirement plan is better between the company contributing the 10% of annuall salary or a regular 401K with 5% match.

15nikn3,Can I file an HR complaint because my manager refused to stay home while sick?,"My manager has been sick with a cold or something similar for about a week now. She left early Friday, was out Monday, and has been in the office Tuesday, Wednesday, and today (Thursday). She has the capability to work from home (the rest of my team does not) and her manager would be nothing but understanding if she decided to take a day off. She also has a lot of PTO/ leave available. My team and I are also more than capable of handling anything that might come up in her absence.

However, she has been in the office and coughing repeatedly without covering her mouth, wiping her nose with her hand and touching surfaces, and on the rare instance she does cover her mouth while coughing, it's loosely with her hand (that then touches communal surfaces).

Despite my best efforts to Lysol and Clorox literally everything, I am now feeling like I am about to be sick as well (sinus drainage, sneezing, stuffiness, sore throat). I have a vacation planned for next week so I am extra angry about it. But even if I didn't have plans, I still don't want to be sick (who does?). If I do proceed to feel worse, am I able to file an HR complaint about this? What can I do, if anything?

15nifgs,"Found out my coworkers make more than me, how do I go about asking for a raise?","As the title says, my coworkers and I all got hired around the same time so we had built a good working friendship. The scope of our roles all increased within a few months and my coworker said that we should all be getting paid $130k for what we're doing and I told her ""I don't think they're going to give us a raise of almost twice what we make"" and she asked me how much they're paying me and I told her I'm making 75k and she was surprised because she said she was getting paid 95k. Another coworker in our inner circle said she was making 85k. 

Now this information made me furious, not at them, but at the company. They did have more experience than me seeing as one was 6 years older than me and the other one was in her 50s (I'm 25); however, I don't think that's fair since we are all doing the same job.

To add insult to injury, the one making 95k was let go because she was not meeting expectations and the one making 85k quit (not sure why). I'm here putting up with the stress and my manager says I'm doing a great job so I think it's only fair that I get paid 95k.

I was told that I would be added to a wait-list to be allocated to a position which could be anytime within the next 12 months, so I could be allocated in the next weeks or in months time. They didn't specify when but I have been waiting since late-June. And last time I emailed them the recruiter told me she would email me as soon as possible. 

Recently I successfully passed another job  interview for an administrator role, although the pay is way lower for me it is better than being unemployed and it would be an experience to work at an office as I haven't done that before. Also there is no guarantee about whether I would be allocated and I don't think I can remain jobless until then.

The question is what do I do? Shall I tell this new job honestly that I have been put on a waitlist or just start it anyways because there is a chance that the allocation could take a while. I kinda don't want to tell them in fear that they gonna revoke the offer lmao.

15nibpg,My Employment Counsellor has given me some bad advice - how do I approach this?,"When I spoke to him last week, he said he was going to send me a resume and cover letter sample to use when rewriting my resume. My resume is ""too generic"" and needs to be ""focused on a specific job"".

The sample Cover letter he gave me has a **lot of grammar mistakes**, uses & symbols, it **didn't seem professional**. So I took my original cover letter and rewrote it to ""focus on the specific job"". 

The sample Resume is okay but the **bullet points are really long**. I've always heard to make points short, sweet, and get the info out quickly. So I took my original resume and again, rewrote it to ""focus on the specific job"". I cut out unrelated job experience except the most recent.

&#x200B;

I sent it back to him and he says both are all wrong. I was supposed to **copy and paste the text** from the cover letter (with **poor grammar** and a different job position and **skills I don't possess**). 

On the resume, the bullet points ""**should not be short and occupy at least one full line**"". He also said I need to write ""accomplishment statements"" which is true, I missed that.

He also wants me to **take off all my education** because it's ""not focused on a specific job"". That can't be right... If I'm applying to jobs that require computer skills, wouldn't they want to know I've taken a College course in a computer field?

I know he's the resume expert, but some of these suggestions just seem to be bad. Should I confront him?

15nhpnz,Tough love time: You're gonna sue a company for rejecting you? Good luck with that.,"Too often anymore, I'm seeing ""I applied to X job and met all the qualifications. They rejected me. How do I sue the company into oblivion for rejecting me despite meeting all the qualifications?"" That's the neat part: you don't. And you're making everyone else's lives harder with the entitled attitude (and I'm not a boomer so I don't throw the word ""entitled"" around lightly).  
  
In most countries, the only possible reason you'd ever have a case to possibly win some amount of damages is if you can prove beyond any reasonable doubt that you were passed over for being part of a protected class. This is the case not only in the US, but also in more progressive places like much of Europe. A job applicant is just that: an applicant. Until the employee-employer relationship officially commences on your start date, you have virtually no rights within the company, as you're not even part of it yet. Outright discrimination is about the only thing you're protected against, and you'd need bulletproof evidence to prove that it was due to your membership in a protected class and not some other factor. Otherwise, good luck finding a lawyer to even look at your case.  
  
Nobody owes you a job, and *applications are never a guarantee*. Not only do you have to check most/all of the boxes in the job description, but there's a million other factors at play here. Maybe your timing was bad. Maybe your soft skills didn't measure up (if you're threatening to sue, this is very likely). Maybe the VP's nephew applied for the same position. Maybe the hiring process is performative to demonstrate need for an H1B. Or maybe the job posting was never real to begin with. Yes, this absolutely sucks, and we're all dealing with it, but the only factor here you can really control is to take a look in the mirror and make sure your soft skills are in check. Ask yourself: ""would I want to work with me?"" If the answer is no, do some introspection and think about how you might work on that.

Also consider the impact on your marketability as a candidate. Even individuals who litigate legitimate grievances could be discriminated against (legally) by future employers. That background check isn't just looking for felonies - civil litigation is going to show up too. Fair or not, an employer that doesn't know you well yet is going to have a hard time taking on someone with a history of suing employers. If you'll do it to another employer, how do they know you won't do it to them, too? While some of these individuals have legitimate grounds for litigation, the harsh reality is they likely won't get the chance to explain their side of the story. Usually in a job search, you don't get that chance, so *the facts have to speak for themselves*.  
  
I firmly believe this mindset is a major driver behind the rampant trend of ghosting. Companies know there are people out there that would happily sue them for simply saying ""thanks, but no thanks,"" so they instead say nothing at all. Sure there are other factors out there, like recruiters that just don't care, but this is likely a major driver.  
  
And one last thought - stop getting attached to job postings until an offer letter is signed & countersigned (or really in 2023, until you've reported for orientation and *that first paycheck has cleared your bank*). ""Spray and pray"" is unfortunately the new normal. You're not gonna get very far applying to one job at a time & demanding they hire you or else. Even if an offer seems imminent, in these uncertain times, assume it's going to fall through and keep applying other places until you report for your first day of work.

But… the company is not on a growth trajectory which will likely not change in the future and all senior positions in full of dinosaurs. Now, I’m interviewing for an Analyst role in a reputable life-science VC fund in another European capital.

15nhmz1,Just got laid off. Do I immediately look for a new job or just take the severance and take a break?,"I work as a programmer at a company that does health technology and my role was just eliminated thanks to cost cuts. They told me I have 8 weeks to look for a new role within the same company, and if I'm unable or unwilling to find a new role then they'll just terminate me with about 7 months of total severance.


Personally, I'm kind of relieved. I can *already* feel the stress of deadlines lifted from my shoulders. The pay and benefits at this job are very good, but I've been feeling pretty burnt out and unfulfilled in this career. The work isn't interesting and I haven't ""excelled enough"" in my performance reviews to be considered for promotion, despite having several years of experience in this field (I've been working for several years straight since right after I graduated college). I see this as a rare opportunity to take some time to just travel and work on personal projects. An extended paid vacation, basically. So I'm leaning towards just taking the severance and chilling out for some months, and then looking for a new job towards the end of the severance period. 


I had a conversation with my aunt about this. She's a very smart and successful career woman, but she's also pretty conservative. She said that I should immediately start looking for a new position, and kind of half-joked about how I'd never be able to find a girlfriend/wife while I'm unemployed. I didn't really take it to heart, but at the same time I am pretty worried about how tight the economy is right now in the tech sector. In the worst case, if I have trouble finding a new job towards the end of the severance period I'd have to move back in with my parents so as to not drain my hard-earned savings. And living with my parents would really suck since my dad is kind of an old cantankerous authoritarian. 


Any thoughts or similar past experiences?

15nhk1h,"How to handle a low-ball offer for a job I want, but don't really need?","Hi all, I apologize in advance for the length of this post.  
I am in the fortunate position of considering an offer for a great job while I currently have a great job.   
I have been in my current role at company A for around 2 years and earned a big promotion earlier this year.   
I was recently aggressively recruited by our biggest competitor, company B, and went through the interview process for a role that would be a great fit for me on a team I really enjoyed talking to.   
I discussed salary expectations with HR before they constructed the offer and even proactively revealed what I'm making next year to help expedite the process.  
Despite that, company B came back with an offer that would be nearly a 30% paycut over the next 2 years. The way their salary and vesting structure works, my compensation would grow to around 25% more at company B by 2026, but I wouldn't recoup the initial loss until the very end of 2027 (cumulative compensation at Company B would be 1% higher than at company A by the end of 2027). This assumes no salary growth at company A, which is probably too conservative- I am very highly regarded and have a great relationship with my skip.  
I believe I would be happier at Company B, the role is a much better fit for my skill set and I do think there is much more growth potential, but it would involve a big move for my family that would take us much farther away from both my spouse's and my own extended families. If the money were equivalent to what I make now, I had already decided I would likely take the offer and make the move.    
I was expecting some negotiation, but I was pretty shocked by how low the initial offer is. It definitely unnerved me (probably their goal), but also left a bad taste in my mouth. I am 100% positive that the offer range for this position can reach a number that would make that initial 30% deficit closer to 10% while also increasing comp in later years. I'm pretty confident that I can get there through negotiation, but I initially viewed this as the starting point and it is a little below my walkaway number.   
I'm fairly sure, but not 100% positive, that there is enough room and flexibility in the salary range for this role to get to break-even from day 1, which would generally be my minimum expectation for a new job involving a big relocation. The accelerating comp structure and growth potential at company B does make this a little more flexible.  
Any advice for how to handle the negotiation? My plan had initially been to be very straightforward, but the low-ball offer makes me think they're playing games and just expect me to make a counter and then split the difference (I'm pretty sure their target base salary is the midpoint of what they offered and the number I gave HR, for example). I'm tempted to counter-offer with a package that is at or above what I believe they have available to hopefully put a stop to the games and restart the negotiation on a more reasonable footing. A top of band offer is much closer to what I'm making now than the bottom of band offer they made.  
For what it's worth, I'm only in my 30's, but company B is a place I could see retiring from, while company A definitely isn't. That said, it doesn't really feel like I'm at a spot in my career where it makes sense to take a step backward for future growth when I do have significant momentum in my current role.   
I am definitely willing to walk away, but I would hate to talk myself out of getting an offer that I would accept.   
These are both senior level technical roles at very large companies.

15ng046,How to adjust to a “healthy” workplace after leaving a toxic job?,"
I recently started a new job at a pretty large company after spending nearly 2 years in a small, dysfunctional “family owned” business. I was a team of one and I did all the marketing/PR/communications. I was always stressed and anxious at work, and even after work I was depressed and dreading the next day. I had no other team members and I reported directly to the owner, who didn’t know anything about my job and couldn’t help or mentor me 

I’m 2 weeks into my new job and there are like 100 people in my department. My manager is very supportive and gives me clear expectations, and my team members are all so knowledgeable and I’m learning a lot from them 

The problem is that at my last job I learned to be overly cautious and very defensive. My boss was hard to get a hold of so I became very self-sufficient and would only bother him if it was absolutely unavoidable. He was also quite critical and like I said didn’t have any knowledge in my area so I would just work on projects to completion without any input from him, and then hold off on reporting anything to him until it was 100% perfect. I had to spend a lot of time learning things by myself because I had no one to learn from. 

Now I’m struggling to work in an environment where my manager wants to know if I’m struggling with something so he can help me, and where collaboration/learning from other people is encouraged. It’s hard to explain but any sign of “weakness” or lack of knowledge made my life harder at my last job, so it’s hard to drop that mindset now. I can’t relax.

 I.e let’s say im making $100K (IM NOT!) in the new role as a base salary- if the YOY growth in the line Im managing grows by 15% - I will get 15% of $100K which is $15000 bonus at the end of my  year in the role. The problem is I dont know what last year’s numbers are (so I dont know my goal is to beat and start making a bonus). Also if I get close to that goal but dont beat it, he makes money and I dont (besides my base salary)


Am I crazy to think that I should be getting a % of sales instead? Anyone have experience getting paid this way? I have never been in a sales role that pays YOY growth vs. Sales. Also ive never waited a year to get paid in a sales position.

So they said it’s a scale and 16 is the lowest and it’s based on experience and they are not just hiring bodies.

I asked politely what what range was. 

But I feel this will reflect negatively.

15nf93i,Should I apply for a similar position to the one I got rejected from at the same company?,"I recently applied for a job that would be a slight career change for me. I currently work in the same general field (academia), but in a different department (think student affairs vs librarianship). Since my school is small and understaffed, I routinely collaborate with people in my current university’s student affairs department and sometimes even pick up some of their work and lend a hand when my workday is slow/empty. Beyond that, I also have a lot of transferable skills that would suit the posting and I met all of their basic requirements.

I am passionate about the work this new position would entail, and really looking forward to making a career switch. Sadly, I got rejected before the interview stage. In their email, they said they are pursuing candidates with skills and experience which more closely match the position. This is fair, on paper it’s clear that I’m making a career change, but this is one of the few postings I’ve seen where I haven’t had even a shred of self-doubt (rare for me) about my ability to do the work.

The university I applied to has a nearly identical posting at a different campus several hours away (relocation would not be an issue for me) and servicing a slightly different student population. There is nothing about my work experience that makes me more qualified to work at one location or with one group than the other, and either posting sounds like a dream job, to be honest.

Should I apply for the similar posting or would it be a waste of my time and theirs? I know the worst thing they can say is no, and I don’t mind hearing it, but I also don’t want to end up on some sort of “too persistent, do not hire” list.

If I do apply for the similar posting, should I redo my cover letter beyond updating a few details like the position title/location/students served?",placeholderffs,3,1.0,2,1691680573,2023-08-10 15:16:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15nf93i/should_i_apply_for_a_similar_position_to_the_one/,8,2023

I am burnt out on the work and am wanting to start a better job/career that will challenge me and help me earn more.  Currently I am making about $80k a year, but it isn't enough to buy a starter home since I live in Washington State. (High cost of living and a lot of my income goes to taxes/deductions) I could in theory buy a house, but I would be eating top ramen for every meal and wouldn't have extra money for repairs.

One direction I have been looking into is IT, specifically the networking department and what certifications I would need to get into the field.

I have also heard of other possibilities such as project manager and engineering technician that don't require degrees that could be potential options.

As far as education goes, I have a high school diploma, trade school certificate, and about half the credits needed for an AA degree.

What is the best way to leverage the experience I have to get myself into a better career with more fulfilling work?

15ndpwz,Should I take a week off after my first month?,"I am beginning full time work with my law firm in October, after having recently received a law degree. During my studies, I worked for the same firm for two years, part time during the academic year and full time over the summers. I was offered the full time, post-grad position about a year ago, which I accepted. It is a smaller office of a larger firm. For context, it is a law/legal job on the east coast of the United States.

Recently, however, my brother has asked me to join him on a one-week-long hiking trip in a foreign country during the first week of November. I have wanted to do this hike for as long as I can remember and I haven’t seen my brother in almost three years, so I jumped at the opportunity. However, it would mean taking a week off of work just under a month after my start date. 

My position is salaried, and offers “unlimited” PTO (which I recognize is not “unlimited”). According to my offer letter, others in my position can generally expect to take 2 or so weeks of PTO per year, subject to communicating with my supervisor/HR and so long as it does not materially impact any work deadlines/obligations. 

In my two years working part/full time with the firm I have always received excellent feedback on my work product. I also have a good relationship with my managing partner, however, they would likely prefer that I not take off a week. Nevertheless, the week being so early in my career would likely mean that I wouldn’t have many substantial projects that would be put on hold, and I would be able to provide at least a month’s advance notice. Candidly, I don’t particularly enjoy the position regardless and I performed well in law school so I am not completely out of hope if I were to be fired but I certainly would not prefer it only a month in. 

My gut reaction is to take the trip. It’s one week in the beginning of my position (which could cut both ways). I have a good rapport with my firm and the managing partner, and, more importantly, I haven’t seen my brother in almost three years. Thinking about my future, realistically, in ten years will I regret taking a week off of work (and potential repercussions) or will I regret missing out on time spent with my brother?

My question is: should I take the week off, and if so how should I communicate that to my manager/ avoid negative consequences?

I figured I do not need to provide details, and can simply state something along the lines of: “apologies for taking this time so early, but something personal with my family came up and I will need to take X week off. I will, of course, ensure that I will meet any deadlines, and will be back the following week.” 

Thank you! And if you need any additional information to answer the question I am happy to provide it.

tl;dr: Work starts in October, brother I haven’t seen in years wants to take a week trip in November. Should/how do I ask for the time off?",Logical-Hat-5067,1,1.0,14,1691676885,2023-08-10 14:14:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15ndpwz/should_i_take_a_week_off_after_my_first_month/,8,2023
15nd78s,Contract Extension. Any chance to renegotiate within the next year,"I accepted a contract role in order to advance my career. It was for 6 months in Talent Acquisition. Ultimately it ended up being a paternity cover but the team was hoping to add an additional member full time. Side note it was a significant salary bump and I negotiated to get on benefits and PTO

My contract came to an end and the department couldn’t add me on full time. Another department, HR, offered to pick me up for a year while one of their members is on an assignment. I accepted because I’d like to be with the company long term and it’s another chance to further my career.

I kind of shot myself in the foot by not renegotiating at the time but was wondering what my chances were at maybe a 3 month or 6 month mark into this new role? Even though I already am in a significantly better place pay wise than I was a year ago, I’d still like to progress

I am a 21 Year old female, and I am the youngest person at the company by a lot. Yesterday my boss told me I was no longer able to sit next to my friend Justin (I've sat at his desk every lunch break since I was hired) because there ""could be rumors"". He is OLDER than my dad, our office is FULL of cameras (which are watched 24/7), and it's never just us... his desk is near 3 other guys we talk to. It is never NEVER sexual at all in any way - we spend the first 20 minutes talking to his wife on facetime every day.   


My boss told me I wasn't allowed to tell him that she said that either... I am not even that upset that I can't sit there, I am just more upset that she's micromanaging MY lunch break, and its hurtful that I have to stop being friends with someone because the old gossip ladies here have decided males and females can't be friends. ON TOP OF THAT we have a MANAGER here who is KNOWN to be a creep, they make jokes that there are lick marks on his computer where all the girls sit because all he does it watch the cameras. He CONSTANTLY makes comments to girls AND a girl even got him several times on a recording. BUT he hasnt been punished once, the girl just got moved to another office building.

I have been working for a company since Sept 2022.I was hired to work a English and Spanish general reservation line for a fall centre work from home type. I have never once been moved to any Spanish line nor received any phone calls although I always got my extra dollar for it . They then moved me to a customer care complaint department where they tell me that this position need filling immediately and there is no word on the Spanish department . I have been working all year long trying to get over to the Spanish department.customer care department is horrible it’s so much complaints one can take and tolerate that it stresses you out especially if this company want you to de-escalate the problem yourself with no training to this really their not one manager you can transfer to it’s unimaginable and this is a hotel chain. I have now received my final warning because I forgot to tell guest a hotel FD manager will be contacting them although they told me to tell the guest they will not compensate them for their horrible stay. This is unbelievable what kind of nonsense is that I get a warning because of this I didn’t de-escalate the matter and what not it is . I asked for my hours to be cut to part time and they told me no they need full time . I was supposed to start training for said Spanish line this upcoming Monday and now they have taken that alway plus the extra dollar I was making seem they no longer wanna pay me it and are putting me to general reservations line . This is driving me to wanna just quit tbh I feel I was hired for one thing and now they are trying to avoid that overall and just trying get me fired as this is my last termination as they said I believe . How should I go about this if I should quit I feel like they pushing me over for me to lay belly up which is sad.

My issue lies with my side job. My boss at my main job asked me to do the books for his side company about two months ago. If I knew what I was getting myself into I never would have took it on. 

My issue is I can’t get the things I need from him, I can’t get questions answered, I can’t get any time from him to discuss things that need to be discussed. He blows me off constantly. And if and when I do get any time with him he’s rushed and distracted, taking phone calls and sending texts, and having to cut our meeting short because he’s got something more important on the go I guess.

Your not just giving me passwords and sending me on my way.”  Oh of course not, he said!

15n9e2c,Painted myself into a corner with semiconductor career - ways out?,"Hello everyone,

My abridged CV:
- in my late 30s
- Degree in Chemistry
- Industry-adjacent PhD 
- 7.5 years of work experience as Process Engineer in the semiconductor industry


Semiconductor Engineering is my sole non-academic work experience. Would obtaining an additional BS or MS be a viable path to transition from a PhD/Senior Engineering role into a different career field, or would you recommend different approaches?

My current expertise is highly specific and may not translate well, and my chemistry degree is likely unviable by now due to never getting practical work experience in that field. 

Due to family commitments, I've gotten constrained to job opportunities within my state, with just one relevant option in the semiconductor field (my current job). 

I feel like I‘ve painted myself into a corner, and my very limited job selection creates long-term insecurity and risks (despite being stable for the foreseeable future). 

I'm seeking improved work-life balance and broader job prospects, preferably in chemistry-adjacent fields like Biotechnology, Food Science/Process Engineering & Pharmacy, but I’m also interested in Electrical Engineering & Mechatronics (would probably need to start at Bachelor level on the last two. For anything chemistry-related I see possibilities of directly being accepted for an additional Masters).

I‘ll have the financial stability to very comfortably pursue a career change in 3-5 years from now (approx. BaristaFIRE level). I‘m not sure how hiring managers would react to such a transition, though; and I do wish to remain in the professional workforce at some capacity.

15n70oh,I had a rough start into what I want to get into. How do I move on?,"Sorry if this long

I'm currently in community College for automotive classes and wanted to get into the industry by starting with a job that was related. Last week, for the first time I was fired from a job in less than a week. I was starting out as general service tech (oil changes and tires) position.

I won't lie and say that I can be a little antisocial but I'm willing to get work done when it's needed and in a timely manner.

Everything for this job I had seemed like it was fine until some problems came up

- I was pulled aside for not responding in a proper way to the general manager and shop manager instructed.

- I meet the shop manager on my second day and he is the grumpy old type person that wasn't very helpful in training me, came off as cold and crude most of time. 

- Training was literally thrown to the other general service techs to show me how to perform work, which is fine at some capacity but not 100% of the time. 

- The 2 other general service techs that I was working with were not going to be available long and short term, making the shop manager try to rush my learning and training in less than a week after getting the job.

- The location I was working at was considered the ""training"" location and was also pretty quiet at most times so we weren't always getting cars to work on every minute.

- I got grilled for being inactive and not doing anything when there was nothing else to do when there was no work to do or secondary tasks when it was quiet.

- When there was a car to work on, I'd try to help and learn/practice more, but I'd be told to either take over the whole job or backoff.

- The day I get fired, I was informed that I did not use a piece of equipment properly and was not informed about my mistake way until I had the final ""talk"". The General manager was right there watching me when I was improperly using the equipment and didn't bother to correct me on how to properly use it.

Apparently I wasn't performing up to their ""standards"", when it's been less than a whole week and they were just willing to fire me just like that. 

I held a job at a fast food restaurant for well over a year and quit that one and just to get fired in less than a week with this new one. It's unfair for what they did to me, but I'm probably better off without them. Now I have no job and can only hope the 1 of the 4 I have applied to are willing to hire me. 

So far, I've had one interview at a more professional company that has even reached out to my community college a few times before about automotive job opportunities. I think I may have good chance at landing this one, hope to hear back from them fairly soon.",badcobra2003,1,1.0,0,1691658137,2023-08-10 09:02:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15n70oh/i_had_a_rough_start_into_what_i_want_to_get_into/,8,2023

15n3k5h,CDL Class B driver looking for career change that has upward mobility.,"Hoping this community can offer some guidance on potential career changes from a CDL driving background to something more aligned with my passions and future aspirations.

Background:

Current Position: I've been a CDL Class B driver, despite having a Class A license, for a while now. While the job has been financially decent, the prospect of being in the driver's seat indefinitely is not what I envision for my long-term future.

Military Service: I obtained my CDL Class A by joining the Army Reserves and working as an 88M. I served until I reached the rank of E-5 SGT.

Other Work Experience: Over the years, I've held positions servicing customers as a milkman and was also an assistant manager at Dairy Queen.

Interests: I'm deeply interested in fields related to accounting, finance, numbers, data, AI, and electrical work.

Goals and Concerns:

I yearn for a position that offers more autonomy or allows me to be part of a team without the confines of a truck cabin. Ideally, this role would be in the tech, finance, or even the electrical field.

My long-term earnings goal is around $120k annually, or at least a path that can lead there.

As a sidenote (and I hope this doesn't detract from the main focus), I'd love a future where I can partake in recreational cannabis use without work restrictions. Currently, this isn't feasible with my CDL role.

College isn't off the table, but the thought of amassing debt is daunting.

My fiancee is pursuing her master's degree, so relocating based on her academic pursuits is a possibility.

Request for Advice:

Education/Training: Are there tech schools or apprenticeships in or around the Vancouver, WA area that align with my interests?

Career Transition Strategies: Given my unique background, are there specific roles or fields that might be a good fit, considering my interests?

Resources: Are there websites or local resources that could guide my search?

Networking: Any tips on building connections in the tech, finance, or electrical sectors starting from a CDL background?

I truly appreciate any input, advice, or guidance that can be offered. The idea of truck driving indefinitely is daunting, and while I'm open to it under certain conditions (e.g., federal cannabis legalization and top-tier earnings), I believe exploring other avenues now will lead to a more fulfilling future.

TL;DR: Experienced CDL driver with military background in Vancouver, WA seeks career transition advice into tech, finance, or electrical fields. Open to education but wary of debt. Also, aspiring to a future with potential for cannabis use without work restrictions.

15n36hj,How do I tell my boss/manager that working until 4AM on the weekend and not having a day off in 11 days has ruined my mental health and quality of work?,"Basically, the title.

&#x200B;

I work as an engineer and typically do 9am-5pm.  I am salaried and do not get overtime.

&#x200B;

More often than not our team has to do things outside of those business hours, as there are things that, due to old technology at my current company, cannot get done during normal business hours.

&#x200B;

Recently, I had to work from 2pm-4am on a saturday.  


Then, from 5pm-930pm the next day (Sunday).  


Then, I get a ping at 7am the next day on Monday for something that urgently needed to be fixed.

&#x200B;

And I've had to work after 5pm every day since that day.

&#x200B;

It has mentally destroyed me.

&#x200B;

I haven't had an ACTUAL day off in 11 days now.

&#x200B;

My quality of work has drastically declined.  My brain feels like radio static every morning.  I can hardly focus.  

&#x200B;

Prior to this, I was a top performer.

&#x200B;

I'm at my breaking point, but cannot lose this job or I cannot pay my bills.  The market for my profession is incredibly abyssmal at the moment so quitting doesn't seem like it's an option.

How do I tell my manager that I'm now burnt out from all of this without getting fired?

I also have pretty serious fatigue and chronic pain issues from herniated disks and such from a car accident. I retired from a job recently because I just couldn't handle it anymore and receive a small pension. 

My problem is no one will hire me for actual IT tech support. My resume makes me look pretty accomplished, but ultimately I've dabbled in a million tech fields and am an expert at none of them. I just want to do something I already know. One firm even called me after I had applied for 4 different jobs and offered me a job as a fairly high level web developer which I really am not qualified to do because they thought since I built a web page 20 years ago I was qualified.  They said I was a bad fit for the tech support job and that was the end of their explanation.  I turned the web dev job down because the thought of trying to figure out how to use the tools I didn't know stressed me out too much, and i could see there would be no one to train me. 

What am I supposed to do here? I was told by colleagues I'm too qualified for what I'm applying for. I'm competing with people 25-30 years younger than me for these jobs. Honestly I'm not sure I could handle it anyway.

But I feel like I’m being held back. I’d like to think I advanced pretty well in my skill set here and I’m an asset to the team. 

However I don’t feel accomplished. My job is easy most days. I want to get more into the electrical/programming side of my trade and I’ve asked multiple times to go to classes and learn more. And their answer always is “whenever we’re fully staffed… or.. oh, you don’t need to know that here, we’ll just call someone in” 

But where I’m stuck on what to do is because of the benefits of this company. The medical benefits are great. I have some medical issues so it’s nice there. The schedule is nice, it’s shifts but I work half the year (12hr days) and I’m able to take a lot of time off. Im taking around 7 weeks off this year. And the retirement is great, I started here when I was 21, I could potentially retire here at 50-55 very comfortably. 

Im just not sure if it’s the right move to go on somewhere else when I’m not sure another company around where I’m at can beat the benefits/pay/schedule.",autonononomus123,1,1.0,0,1691642401,2023-08-10 04:40:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15n27h5/torn_on_if_i_should_leave_or_stay/,8,2023

15n0t1n,Which direction should I head in corporate work?,"I (29F) currently work remote in the pricing department at a fortune 50 company and while it's great for the experience and pay bump I don't necessarily enjoy the work I'm doing and the stress for the rate of pay.

I've been in the position for almost a year and I'm looking for advice on figuring out my future moves. I'm planning to stay for a bit more but I want to start planning where to go from here. I don't want this position long term and would like to increase my salary from 57K to 80K range or more if possible. 

Whether that has to be done slowly or can be done with one pivot. I'm not sure which direction I should be headed in as I'm not super passionate about any one thing.

I've thought of moving positions within the company to a different field but I'm undecided on what area that should be. If I should I aim for team lead/manager, or sales, etc.

I've also thought of going into pricing for a different field and moving companies to get a higher salary bump that way.

Or possibly going to graduate school for an MBA or project management as well.

Anything passed a year or two would be too much time. I also have to consider that I'm currently debt free in the education department so I don't want to return to increase my debt if it's not going to offer a good salary increase/return. 

I've even thought of trying to get into the state department.

As you can see, I'm stuck and undecided. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Some career facts: I was previously in medical billing for a Healthcare company for 2 years. Before that I worked around 5 years as a small business owner with a family owned start-up that was focused on airport transportation. Kind of a competitor to uber but small time/more area focused.

I have two B.A.'s one in international studies and the other in history. I'm also fluent in Portuguese.

I will leave the company in 2 months and believe my relationship with her might improve afterward, but now I feel emotionally drained, and I have a strong repulsion feeling towards her. It is weird, but I am always nice in her presence even though I do not want her around me.

The issue is that now I am super busy at work, and I already told her many times that she should not stop by to talk to me. PERIOD. I say it in a nice way, but she still does it. Yesterday, a senior was rude to her as he wanted to speak with me while she was at my desk talking. Today she waited for him to be at closed doors to come to my desk. She still stopped to talk to me 3 times, and every time she did it, she interrupts something important that I am doing. She also mentioned today that she is emotionally dependent on me, and I feel suffocated. My feelings about her are mixed and I just want to go to work and finish what I have to do without being interrupted. I do not want her to stop talking to me completely, but I want her invasive behavior to cease. How do I say it in a way that she can understand when I had said it so many times already and she does not seem to get it? Or she does understand but she does not care (?).

15myt64,I want to leave my job after 2 months,"So bit of a back story ive gotten a decent paying job for my level of experience, it's a admin role and it's hybrid working. 

I absolutely hate it, no one talks to each other in the office and it literally feels like when I am there even if its 3 days I feel like my soul dies a little every time.
The reason I haven't left is because I've dropped out of university and the job I did have whilst I was at uni I quit in January, after I left I was job hunting for roughly around 3 months, its really difficult to find jobs currently in the uk due to the recession we're basically in.

So I don't know what to do in this case, im afraid it will look bad to potential employers that I've left after only 2 months but I genuinely cannot stay there, the people may seem nice but I've noticed some microagressions towards the people of colour there and everyone's nice to eachothers faces but it's all so passive aggressive especially management, the people who are supposed to train me are making it seem like its a chore which makes me not even interesting in learning. I've gotten in trouble few times now for not coming in on the days I'm supposed to and working from home instead but I genuinely feel like throwing up every morning I get up for work in the office due to the anxiety.

I just really want to leave, I've started applying elsewhere but I need advice on if most admin roles are exactly like this, so I know maybe I should look at other roles. But at the same time I like hybrid working and I wish I knew of a role where I could do that and still have interactions with people e.g customers face to face too. I've applied to receptionist roles as well as I really did enjoy working in a grocery store during uni loved the customer service side of it and my colleagues were the absolute best, right now these colleagues don't care about anything other than getting work done and going home no chit chatting and socialising it's all so monotonous, no human touch whatsoever.

Can anyone advise me on what to do in this case, what jobs would suit someone young inexperienced who likes social interaction and doesn't require a degree.

I have yet to really integrate into the team - I’ve tried, but they seem very used to processes from before I began here, and I fear that it reflects on my performance that I am still not included in meetings and emails. I also have not yet learned to navigate the very fragile relationships between coworkers, so I have accidentally stepped on toes without realizing it. 

It is honestly a very intense environment, which I normally wouldn’t mind, but because of all of the internal shifts it constantly throws me off. I feel like I’m swimming without Floaties. 

I regularly ask my manager for feedback and she doesn’t really ever say anything negative. I also have a hard time giving her feedback or telling her what I think would benefit myself or processes or the team because she tends to defer to “well, we just do what leadership wants.” Any advice or thoughts?",Southern-Setting-486,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1691628790,2023-08-10 00:53:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15mxb92/feeling_uncomfortable_in_my_new_role/,8,2023
15mwchl,"Does this sound like an intentional snub? No response after internal interview, found out I didn't get the job through others discussing the new hire.","I'm just really confused by this situation and unsure how to move forward--it feels like I am in trouble/have something to be ashamed of when I know logically I don't, but that is keeping me from reaching out to HR for clarification. I have interviewed with my broader organization enough to know that they do send rejection emails, but this time I did not get any response.

Higher ups approached me to ask if I was interested in applying and let me know it would be posted soon. I interviewed on a Monday and was told they should make a decision by the end of the week, but also not to worry if it took a bit longer. Thus, I didn't worry too much as the next week came along with no response, and I planned to follow up on Friday or Monday. However, on Thursday my direct supervisor and I were discussing with our team how I need to get trained on something, and I guess she was considering if it was worth the effort given the possibility of me leaving because she said, ""You're staying, right?"" I told her I hadn't heard anything and then asked if she heard they had chose someone, and she told me what she heard but that it was all unofficial. The next day, my other boss initiated a discussion where he said he assumed I was staying in his office, and I said again I hadn't been given a decision. He let me know he assumed that because he saw the role's desk moved to its new area with another name plate. So I confirmed by looking at the directory and that name was in the formerly vacant slot with the version dated Thursday.

The more I think on things, the more I feel it was all a farce from the beginning. I'm irritated that my bosses may have affected the decision because they are openly upset that I was asked and considered it. I wonder if I was only encouraged to apply to start drama and irritate my supervisor, who had asked them specifically not to take me away from our office. Alternatively, I wonder if I was asked with this outcome being planned as retaliation for my earlier refusal to work with someone. That someone is the reason why the position was vacant to begin with, because he sexually harassed the previous employee and got away with it. I feel HR may be in on it because the victim's attempts to move departments strangely did not work out, and she ultimately just got to move buildings but is still part of the same broader department as him. 

I'm just disappointed in everything, really. From the moment they asked me I knew I was in a tough spot and that my current bosses/coworkers would be upset, and I felt uneasy knowing why the position was open, but after a lot of wrestling with it I decided that I shouldn't reject an opportunity without at least interviewing. I went through with it in good faith, trying to focus on the compliment of being approached, but I don't feel that was returned. While I know I was not guaranteed the position and I was actually considering turning it down if offered, I don't think I should have found out through the grapevine.

**TL;DR:** Is it normal when interviewing internally to find out you didn't get the job when you hear and then confirm rumors they chose someone else, or is this as disrespectful as it feels? I have only had one other internal interview elsewhere, and they did call me to let me know someone else was chosen.",No_Advertising5369,11,1.0,6,1691626323,2023-08-10 00:12:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15mwchl/does_this_sound_like_an_intentional_snub_no/,8,2023

15mvht4,How to approach 1:1 - requesting promotion?,"Hi all, I am an experienced mid-career professional. I make 260k. I would like to have a discussion with my manager about a promotion and development planning for the next phase of my career.

I have a standing 1:1 next week. We have one every other week and typically just talk shop. There is never an agenda.

Do you think it is worthwhile to give my manager a heads up that I want to redirect the meeting, provide her the topic areas and justifications in writing or just go in with my pitch in mind and give her no warning?

Regarding the actual meeting - Any advice on structure or how to approach. My plan was to direct is as development planning and discuss short, meduim and long term goals

Short (now) - Mid-year promotion and raised based on what ive accomplished

Medium (12 months) - Attain new skill set through xyz

Long (2 years)- gain her assistance in devlopment planning allowing me to move into a management role (shadowing her at meetings, handling various projects for her to gain additional exposure to senior management etc...)

I'm in the process of changing my employment authorization status (I'm an immigrant in the US and I'm changing my overall immigration status). I will have a period of about 7 months starting mid-September during which I cannot be employed lawfully, but can and will continue residing here lawfully.

I currently have:

\- a personal Roth IRA account at Fidelity.  
\- a 401(k) with my employer, where I have been contributing for many years along with my employer match (all of my contributions have been into a Roth account). The money is invested in a mix of various stocks and bonds with the help of a robo-advisor.  
\- stock options in my employer company (mix of vested and unvested options). It is a privately-owned company, and my earliest options cancellation is in 2029.

As I understand, I will need to roll my 401(k) into a Rollover IRA. My Qs:

\- Could someone help me understand that rollover process with the steps that I would need to do please?  
\- How will the individual shares/funds ownerships transfer to the rollover IRA?  
\- Are there any tax implications that I need to be mindful of during this rollover?

15mv2bs,Should I mention my current job during an interview?,"I’m interviewing for a job in a field that is (mostly) unrelated to my current full-time role, which I’ve had for eight months now. During that time, I have been doing a lot of freelance work in the field that I am currently interviewing for a FT role in — my current FT job is just $ to me, and I have not invested much into it beyond what is required of me.

In my application for the job I’m currently interviewing for, I submitted a resume which only listed my recent freelance activities (since they are more relevant and impressive). My question is whether I should bring up my current FT job during the interview. My concerns about doing so are the following:

- I have only had my current FT job for eight months, and I don’t want to look flighty or unfocused
- I have not said anything to anyone at my current FT job about an intention to leave, and would not want to list anyone there as a reference in any case, since I’ve been pretty much cruising there while focusing on freelance work the past few months. I have plenty of references from previous jobs and freelance work within the industry I’m currently interviewing in.

Now, here’s where I’m torn. The government job is only an 18-month contract, so there’s a risk. However, there is opportunity for extension/advancement and would be a foot in the door.

I have an Industrial Eng Tech diploma and have worked in Metals Processing since graduation (not directly using my diploma).

I have some spare time due to the rotating shift I work and lately I’ve been thinking about using this spare time to learn new skills on a part time basis (preferably online and flexible) that I could eventually maybe parlay into a new career. 

Working 12 hour rotating shifts including nights and weekends doing manual labour in a dirty, health-harming (literally toxic) environment is starting to become a bit of a drag and I’m starting to think I would prefer to transition to a different career.

I am extremely fortunate to have received two job offers from two great tech companies. In June I was let go due layoffs but quickly interviewed with company X who ended up offering me a job.  Obviously ecstatic, I accepted even though I knew that start date wasn’t until august. It was a good offer and I didn’t want to be unemployed for long. It is an at will employer.

Since accepting my offer with company X, I eventually secured another job offer from Company Y. They are both great offers but, company Y is willing to pay me 25% more on my salary/yr and I am also genuinely more interested in working for them. I already tried to negotiate salary with company X but they wouldn’t budge.

Company X and company Y both have my start date as 8/21. I fully completed the background check for company X but I am still waiting on the background check to clear for company Y.

With my start date approaching, I want to notify company X sooner rather than later that I will no longer be accepting the job. However, I don’t want to notify company X until my background check clears at company Y in the event that something happens. I don’t have a record but you never know 🤷‍♂️.

JOB C - $35k/yr up to 30 hrs a week contract gig, non profit

Since it's cheaper out there, I'm hoping to get back some of my sanity by taking one of the job's off my plate, but I'm having a really hard time choosing. I'd love to hear from people who have had to debate head (financial) vs heart (passion) when it comes to career decisions! 

Here are pros and cons of each job:

JOB A -
- PRO: they don't care where I live within the US 
- PRO: high income with not a ton of responsibility and a terrific boss 
- CON: the content is soul crushing and not aligned with who I am / what I care about or what I want to do long term at all 
- CON: there's low stress right now while we are on hiatus (how im able to hold 2 other jobs) and was relatively low stress while we were in season last year but I covered for my boss on maternity leave earlier this year and was so stressed that I broke out in hives for months and had regular emotional breakdowns so idk what to fully expect when we are back on, i just know I can't deal with that stress again 
- CON: doesn't seem to be any upward mobility
- CON: entertainment jobs are very tumultuous so I never know how stable things are, have had layoffs in every company I've worked for in this field 

JOB B:
- PRO: love the team and my boss 
- PRO: the work feels very fulfilling and in line with my passions 
- PRO: they don't care about where I live in the US
- CON: does not feel like there is room for advancement, my colleague has been with the company for years and got a new title but it doesn't sound like she got a raise or promotion 
- CON: lower income 

JOB C:
- PRO: I think this is my favorite of the 3 lol
- PRO: the work is very fulfilling and in line with my passions 
- PRO: it feels like there is a lot of room for growth, I just started a couple months ago and they've already brought up the idea of bringing me on full time and teasing the idea of moving into a more senior role (nothing is concrete)
- CON: there is an expectation that I will move to MA eventually  
- PRO: I would love to live near the coast and love old crusty sea captain vibes over typical beach towns lol 
- CON: MA prices look really high and I think I've had enough financial struggle in CA that I have been looking forward to a reprieve in GA and am nervous about going back into struggle mode...

**Rephrased Question for Recruiters, CEOs, Team Leaders, Business Owners, University Deans, and College Professors, and police**

Hello,

In September 2022, I came across a distressing situation involving a minor through my analysis of a photo and its associated metadata. The subsequent revelations and the potential implications were quite alarming. I took initiative to uncover significant details about the photo that even the Flemish government acknowledged were overlooked. This recognition has encouraged me to consider seeking a reference from the leadership of the unit involved, as I believe the competencies, behavior, and knowledge I demonstrated could be valuable in roles that emphasize analytical skills.

However, I'm currently in the process of completing my bachelor's degree, which prompts me to consider what specific competencies to request in a written reference. I'm reaching out to inquire about the essential competencies, behaviors, and knowledge that would be relevant to include in the reference request from the Belgian authorities.

Reaching out to get some guidance. I am interested in a business consulting career for a company and eventually down the line on my own as an entrepreneur. 

Currently, I am working in Corporate Finance for a fortune top 10 company. I am really enjoying it. I am in a leadership development program so I am getting exposed to multiple business areas of finance. I want to continue this job for a few years, however, I think I want to do business consulting in the future.

I like the idea of business consulting for the following reasons: 

\- I like the idea of connecting with people and helping them achieve their goal

\- I feel like I can do it on my own in the future & I basically never want to retire. I want to be old and still helping people with business problems 

\- I like dressing up 

\- I want to solve problems 

&#x200B;

For those in consulting, do you think I have the right idea of consulting? Can you help me set realistic views of what it would be like as a consultant? What are the pros and cons of consulting? How can I get into consulting work? MBA needed for consulting?

15mqwgw,Advice for handling a lazy coworker?,"This coworker has been at our company about 3 years longer than me. We were both promoted to co-leads on our team at the same time, and have to complete two fairly tedious tasks on a near-daily basis. The outcome of these tasks is time-sensitive, and other departments rely on their results. I know that he knows that we are both responsible for these tasks. We are included on the same emails and Slack messages related to them.  
  
Since we work remotely, I really have no clue what he's doing on an hourly/daily/weekly basis. But after a few months in this shared role, I realized that he quite literally never did either task. I tried to focus on my own work, and do these tasks as I had been, without compensating for him. However, one of these tasks is consisently very time-consuming, and doing it without assistance was eating into time I needed for my own projects (and frankly, my resentment was building). So I messaged him about it very diplomatically, and offered to work out a schedule for this task so that we were both evenly completing it. After that point, he started contributing a bit more, but still dragged his feet until I left for a week's vacation. Since the vacation he's been on top of it, presumably because my absence forced him to realize that it was a lot of work it was for one person.  
  
I continued to keep my head down and do the second task solo — just felt like it was easiest and not worth another confrontation. The second task didn't get done at all while I was on vacation, but at the time it wasn't as big of a deal. Since then, though, the volume of the second task has increased significantly, and once again, it is eating into the time I need for other work. I'm about to leave again for another week, and I'm concerned that this task won't be done at all while I'm gone + will generate a huge backlog of work  
  
Honestly, I'm not sure what to do. I haven't involved management yet. I don't really want to message him again — I'm not his boss, I hate having to tell another adult what to do, especially one who knows better and is probably taking advantage of me to a certain degree. Pretty much all the advice i can find about handling a lazy coworker says you should just keep quiet, do your own work, and let management pick up on what's happening.  
  
So my instinct is to just go on vacation, see if he picks up the slack, and assess from there. But I have a pretty strong feeling it won't get done, and I'll be back to this rumination lol. I'd appreciate any advice here!",beatricerumfoord,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1691613763,2023-08-09 20:42:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15mqwgw/advice_for_handling_a_lazy_coworker/,8,2023
15mqst3,Advice about coworker.,"Not sure if this is the place for this but here we go anyway.  

So I have a job… and I have a coworker - white male in his 60s.  This is a customer service job, but sort of specialized to one specific product, and one person could do the job, but because we need to provide support during all normal business hours, there are two of us.  

Now the issue is that my coworker, over the last few years, has retired on the job. The other issue is that my supervisor is a weeny and won’t do anything about it.  

What do I mean by retired on the job - well, as things have evolved coworker just refuses to do them. For example, there was a fax machine that was used for many years. Well everything went to email right. Coworker was kinda mad the company got rid of the fax machine (20 years later than everyone else ever) and refused to scan docs and email them.  There are more examples than that but extrapolate that to everything!!! Coworker doesn’t even check company email and no one disciplines him for it. 

So, as things went on, I made a mistake and just rolled my eyes and just did the work because I didn’t care. I just wanted to do the job and support our customers. Coworker was happy to let me do everything.  

But now it’s to the point where coworker isn’t even answering the phones and all the pressure is on me by supervisor and customers.  Like why aren’t I doing enough???? But this is why there are two of us!!!  I went on vacation and coworker didn’t even answer the phone while I was gone. I’m getting the brunt of the displeasure for the bad service while coworker does nothing. I am the epitome of productive punishment.  

I know this is a management problem but my supervisor won’t manage.  Not long ago he asked me when I thought coworker would retire and to drive my point home I said “he’s already retired.”  Supervisor just nodded and said “yeah I know” like it was so disappointing but nothing he could do.  He could actually hold him accountable but he won’t. And unless I quit - which would essentially shut us down completely - on paper everything looks fine. 

So I don’t know what to do. There’s probably nothing I can do. But this is so nuts. My partner keeps telling me to quit. But I don’t want to quit. I want him to quit! I love my job, I just need a little bit of help.  

I try to at least make coworker uncomfortable some. Like I turned off the internet to his computer so he couldn’t just watch YouTube all day and he got so pissed!!!! It was a glorious two days!!! But the IT guy came by and turned it back on and was like well that’s weird. About a month later I did it again and again coworker couldn’t handle it and threw a fit and IT came. But I think the IT guy is on to me so not going to do that again.   

I don’t know what to do - there’s nothing I can truly do - but I wish there was. I know coworker needs a paycheck and insurance but it’s driving me insane that he is doing nothing and no one is saying anything.  He’s old and he’s tired and I get that but this is also a job and he’s not doing it. And it’s affecting the customers and me. Anyone have any ideas?

15mqqnk,Accepted Job Offer - Dumb Mistake,"So here's the situation: I recently accepted a job offer from a company...... 2 days after being terminated at my current one (on a 30 day PiP with impossible metrics). The final interview for this job occurred two days after I was terminated. Stupidly, when the manager passively asked me if I still worked at my old company I said yes.

10 minutes layer and I get the job, contingent on a background check by Sterling.

My main fear isn't what my old HR team will say - I'm certain they'll just give dates and roles. It's that they'll look at my background report and see my last day as two days before the final interview. Stupid mistake on my part and I let fear overcome my sense in the moment.

In this situation, what would you guys advise? Maybe wait for the background check to clear and see what they have to say?

15mppv4,I yelled at my coworker yesterday / How do I not let her get to me?,"I work for a small company and have one coworker that drives me nuts. It is at the point I've been looking for jobs for awhile but that isn't the easiest thing right now. 

Yesterday I was in the middle of a task (that required a lot of focus) and said I just needed a few more minutes to finish up and then I would look into the thing she asked me about. She then continued to beat a dead horse and ask me the same thing 2 more times with my same response. By the 4th time I blew up, yelled at her to shut up and walked out the office for the day. Every employee was there to make it more awkward. Honestly they are surprised I didn't throw anything. 

I apologized this morning for yelling and we buried the hatchet supposedly. I'm sure she will give me some back handed compliments and retaliate in ways I won't speak up about anymore. Like blasting the radio, running her space heater all the time (our building doesn't have a/c and is usually 75\*F in the summer), facetiming/talking on speaker with her adult kids. 

I've brought up my issues with all of this and how some of them drastically affect my productivity with my boss. I've even provided solutions like moving the radio closer to this coworker, getting a speaker for her computer and he just says to leave it alone or he doesn't want to deal with it. Wearing headphones for myself won't work. Partially because then I'd have two different songs I could hear (the radio is that loud) and I have to answer a landline phone multiple times a day. 

Until I get another job, how do I keep her from getting under my skin? I know I should let it go but I bring it home every night. I then spend all day Sunday dreading going to work Monday.

15mohmo,Should I ask my coworker friend if he gave negative feedback about me?,"TLDR: should I ask my friend/coworker if he is the one who gave the bad feedback about me to my manager?

Full version:

I am an employee and also have a side business. My deliverables are up to expectations even-though I spend a around an hour or two of my working day(of 10 hours) doing side-business-related stuff.

Today, my manager told me that he heard negative feedback from someone about me that says that I am not focused enough on work and that I spend 40% of my time working and 60% “on other things”.

My manager said that he cared about results mostly(which I am delivering) and that he was surprised to hear this feedback, and he was worried that this feedback will be done in written form as well and affect my end-of-year raise.

I am lost and I am not able to know who gave this feedback. Me and one team-mate who is my friend, whom I trust and I spend a lot of time with, are the only team members who work in a separate branch than the one where my manager works, we have lunch together every day and he is chill with me when I share some news about my side business.

There are other “suspects”, who might have comments on me, who are not as friendly with me. They see my results but they are not present with me and we don’t talk much.

During lunch today, he shared with me some negative feedback about someone and I told him to tell our manager about this, he replied that he doesn’t want to “hurt him”.



I am worried that he is the one who told her that, because he is the closest physically. I am thinking of asking him if he said that or not. 
But I am not sure it it is a good idea to ask him. Telling him would show that I am in a weak place now. And I don’t like to show vulnerability to others especially at work. 

Note: I am an employee since 10 years at the company and the team mate I mentioned works here since 5 years.

15moaie,Is it normal to feel this much pressure as a grant writer?,"I’ve been working as a grant writer for a small nonprofit (less than 50 employees) for about 2 years now. So far, I have been able to retain our grant awards from previous years and have managed to secure a large (more than $50,000) government grant for the organization. The problem is that I constantly feel like I am failing horribly in the role and feel pressured to meet what feels like unrealistic funding goals. On top of that, the person who was in the grant writer position before me had the help of an assistant. The assistant quit shortly after I got the position, yet the workload has increased tremendously (they never filled the position). It is nearly impossible for me to seek new funding opportunities and even apply to all the opportunities on our organization’s grant matrix because I am averaging about 5 grant proposals per month. Today, during a meeting, our CEO stated that with are way below our grant funding goals for the year and I felt like a complete failure. While I am a good writer, I often feel like working in this field isn’t for me because I have such bad anxiety attacks and suffer from imposter syndrome due to not being able to reach our organization's goals. I’ve been working in the nonprofit sector for a while so I am very familiar with the fact that the work can seem to be never-ending. I guess what I am asking is if it is normal for nonprofits to not reach grant funding goals. Has anyone else working in grants/development had a hard time securing grants for foundations this year? We received a lot of funding during COVID-19 but I wasn’t there at the time and given the circumstances, it seems unrealistic to expect us to achieve those numbers post-pandemic. Any tips and strategies that anyone can offer for writing effective grants would be greatly appreciated.  
  
I hope this post isn’t all over the place, but I am just having so much anxiety that I am going to lose my job over this.

15mnj2j,Time to quit?,"I've been with the same company for 13 years in sales. I work remotely and it's gotten a bit stagnant, the support staff isn't available anymore and it's a real pain to get responses from the warehouse about products.    It's not a difficult job but it's hard when you can't get answers.

No raises in 5 years, I get a salary and a small commission plus a car allowance.

What I'm asking is what would you do?  These are some options I'm thinking of giving them.

1. Give me a sabbatical for 6 months until they hire enough support staff
2. Switch to straight commission with car allowance and no expectations beyond selling
3. resign / ask to be laid off - I've been looking for another job haven't gotten past any 2nd interviews.

I'm open to other suggestions.  

I think that I'm just going to pack it in regardless though.  I have 6 months of savings AND a side hustle that pays about 25% of what I currently make. I could step it up and maybe it would be equal to what I'm making now but at twice the effort.

I originally just thought this was an issue w chemistry being a genuinely useless degree due to the lack of innovation in the field (all
The really useful stuff in chemistry has been figured out decades ago) so I figured if I got an MS in mathematics I could go into cryptography since at its core it’s connected to one of my favorite concepts: the 2nd law of thermodynamics.

Starters, people seem to seriously underestimate how ignorant HR departments can be.. I know a guy making $250k in HR who genuinely doesn’t know the difference between objective and subjective..
My advisor keeps telling me that employers value math degrees “bc they can think critically and work hard” and this honestly sounds like boomer talk to me.. employers want to plug and play and do as little work possible to hire someone. When I look at the job prospects for a MS in math it looks like I’d be making LESS money than I am

15ml3df,How do I navigate turning down a job offer I already accepted without burning a bridge with the company?,"Hi everyone!

About two weeks ago I received a job offer from another company. I wanted to reach out to my current company to see if they would counter but it got delayed with my boss being out on PTO. I ended up having to accept the offer so I didn’t lose it.

It took about a week but today I received a counter offer from my company with more money that I want to take. It’s about a week and a half before my projected start date. 

How do you reccomend navigating notifying the other company I won’t be accepting the offer. I’m nervous because they are HUGE company in my industry so it’s very possible that in the future I may want to work with them one day. What’s the best way to go about this to not burn a bridge, do they keep these kinds of things on file?

15mkv61,"Any advice on ""starting over"" in your career? My boyfriend (26M) is struggling.","Hi all!

So, as the title says, my boyfriend (26M) is struggling in his career path. Right now, he works as a cashier in a local bakery. It’s good (not great) pay and he likes the social aspect of getting to interact with customers, but he definitely hopes not to be in the service industry long term.

He is planning to make a shift into another field that pays well and is more sustainable for the long term. He has interviewed for a few sales positions- windows (he actually worked for a window replacement company for a few weeks but felt very scammy), solar, paper. This is a possible avenue for him- he's very charismatic so he would make a good salesperson.

I personally think a trade would be great for him (carpentry, plumbing, air conditioner installing/repair), as these skills will always be in demand, but I think he feels intimidated by learning a completely new skillset that would take a few years before it began to pay off, in addition to $$$ spent for certifications/trainings.

We (27F&26M) are starting to look toward the future together (marriage, kids, house, alladat) and he is starting to think about how he can provide for us and our future family.

He is super brilliant and has a lot to offer but has unfortunately come upon some financial and family hardships that have held him back. This has definitely hurt his confidence and I just want him to feel secure & confident in his path.

Does anyone have any experience with starting from scratch in a career field? How did you go about this switch? Did you need to go back to school? How did you support yourself during this switch? How is your career going now? What guidance would you give to someone ""starting over""?

TL:DR, 26M boyfriend looking to make a career change. Does not want to be in service industry, but does not have lots of experience in other fields. Would need to start from scratch in any other fields.

15mkuh0,Career change,"36 yr old male looking to change careers, not sure where to start I’ve been working in construction as an electrician since I was 18, I found myself early on not really feeling fulfillment in the trade, I only finished the schooling and got my full masters in the trade to please my parents in my early 20’s.  I’ve been working on industrial camp jobs that paid lots of money but I’m away from home for 2 weeks at a time and that in itself has affected my personal relationship with my partner, I’ve done mostly commercial/Industrial work with minimal residential and almost every time I delve into a new area of electrical I cringe at learning new things about it. I’ve been told I’m very good at being an electrician (not to toot my own horn) I’m good at it but I dislike it. It’s not something I wake up in the morning and look forward to doing everyday and I find myself getting sick of my work environment after about 6 months of being in the same factory/job site etc. Feeling lost about this decision to change careers as I only know electrical and am unsure as to where I should start looking. I’m great at troubleshooting electrical issues, I did very well at electrical maintenance and new industrial construction but I feel like I’m sick of it to the point where I get very depressed looking forward. I could open a company and keep going in the trade as working for a paycheck for many different companies for so long has just gotten me by and working for people in construction I’ve found over the years has made me feel stuck  in life financially. Maybe the fact that I work for myself might be the change I’m looking for but I find I dislike the trade altogether.

My boss and another director at my workplace have been in a ""pissing contest"" as of late (according to my boss). They've been sending each other very strongly worded emails, having heated 1 on 1 meetings, etc. I don't know this other director very well, I see her in weekly staff meetings, but that's about it. 

During our 1 on 1 yesterday, my boss was telling me about this situation. They've been working together for 20 years and says they've been fighting about this specific thing almost the entire time. 

My boss then said ""She also has a race chip on her shoulder""  
I go ""....What?""  
""Yeah, she has a race chip on her shoulder. She's only nice to black people.""  
I say ""Well, she is the only person of color in upper management.""  
She gives me a funny look. Then says ""Has she ever been warm or welcoming to you?""  
I say ""No, she's never spoken to me.""  
""Yeah, well she's all over Rachel"" (a new employee who just started who is a black woman) then she goes on to say ""A few years ago a white lady working here went to HR about her because she felt discriminated against by her for being white.""  
At this point, I'm so uncomfortable in the conversation, I want to leave.

We finally wrap it up and I say I have a call with a client and leave. I feel disgusted. I think she was completely out of line and what she said was inappropriate and racist, or at the VERY least, extremely racially insensitive. I'm very proudly Mexican and felt so incredibly uncomfortable by these comments.

If you read any of my prior posts, I have a lot of issues with my workplace and specifically my boss who is very lazy and incompetent. Any advice?

15mjr9p,Internship Going Well Suddenly Cut Short and Given 1 weeks Notice. Feeling like a rug was pulled out from under me?,"Today I was ‘Let go’ early from my first marketing internship (5.5 months there) with just a few days notice so I finish next week. I say it that way because they are not formally firing me (as far as I know right now), just ending my internship early, and with no courtesy or warning. I was a good intern and was often praised throughout my time, but things suddenly shifted in vibes I was getting from my superior for no reason. I show up everyday eager, excited, driven, hard-working, and our marketing team was very social and close. 

My direct superior decided not to even to be present during the termination meeting and pretended the whole day that nothing had happened, knowing everything that went on during the meeting she couldn’t even muster up the courage to attend. The interview was conducted by another team member of our marketing group. Got in the meeting room and was joined by HR lady who slid an NDA in front of me. I got zero explanation for the sudden “end of internship” when it was supposed to continue through the fall, as was discussed in a meeting just weeks ago.  

The team discussed hiring a second intern who I would train this fall about a month ago (during the original meeting where, again, I was told my end date was in the fall and I would continue to have a spot on the team. 

I have discovered that they hired a new intern literally a half hour before they randomly gave me my end date. It was apparently supposed to be me training an intern and then moving on to bigger projects and getting more experience, but now, it’s just someone taking over my internship halfway through, who also has almost equal qualifications. Again, no reasons given, was told nothing but positive things in the meeting. Not a single negative thing. 

I’m a little stressed since I may be relocating next spring and the internship was going to end at the perfect time to start interviewing for full time positions with other companies. But now I have an awkward 3 month gap and I’m scrambling to figure out if I should relocate sooner, take some independent marketing classes on my own and gain experience that way, or find a short term, low key new internship to fill the employment-time gap.

2 years in sales for a high-volume/luxury brand in Las Vegas.  
2 years as an account manager for a film company in Los Angeles (an exploration I undertook when I was younger).  
3 years as a service advisor.  
Currently, I've been working for 3 months as an assistant manager.  
  
My career path has been entrenched in the auto industry, a field that I hate, but I am good at. I'm also pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with approximately 2 years remaining. However, I'm taking my time with this and covering costs as I go. As I prepare to buy a house, I'm aiming to leverage my experience in the auto industry for something else or a leadership position.  
  
I'm particularly drawn to leadership, project management, or roles involving risk analysis (which I realize requires my degree). My previous supervisors hold me in high regard, and I've consistently achieved objectives. My contributions to my current role have significantly impacted our store, resulting in consistent YOY growth of over 20%.  
  
I've been presented with job offers from three different companies, including Tesla—an opportunity that excited me due to its benefits and ability to grow. But, this opportunity would entail a $30,000 pay cut for me, in addition to a one-hour commute (which isn't a bother). While I initially considered joining Tesla and taking a pay cut with the intention of later transitioning into a different role and advancing within the company, it cant happen due to the house and other factors.  
  
I am fantastic with people, numbers, have strong organizational skills, I am logical, and very motivated to learn and educate myself to grow. I'm eager to explore new career avenues that promise growth. If you have any suggestions for potential career paths, I would greatly appreciate your input.

15mh54n,Career change?,"I recently relocated to another country and I am on a fixed term contract for a government department for 12 months. They hourly rate is really good and it equates to about $125,000 per year before tax. No benefits. 

Problem is, that I absolutely hate it. I find it painfully boring. Extremely frustrating. Poorly managed. I was hired as a consultant to improve things, but everything I do gets shot down. They are hyper resistant to change and it seems as if I have been placed in a position as a tick box to appease the regulator. I find the job to bring me no joy or provide any form of meaning in my life. I count down the hours until I get to go home. 

In my previous position in my home country I worked in the private sector for a multinational company. It was fast pace, high pressure but I loved the work, the company and I found what I did meaningful. I often worked overtime (luckily paid) without realising because I was that engrossed in what I did. 

Unfortunately, the area I stay in now, there aren't many organisations in the same field that I have studied and worked. It's difficult to find remote or hybrid positions that would make alternative options possible. 

I applied for a position at a multinational but in a completely different industry and got the position. A lot of my soft skills (and to a degree my technical skills) are transferable. I'm sure I might enjoy this position more (but I have no guarantee). Unfortunately, this position pays far less, about $40,000 per year, but is full time permanent and includes benefits. Also there would be room for growth, unlike now. 

It's difficult as I am busy with a master's degree in my current field and this will take me completely out of the field. Can still finish my masters though. On the other side, the current position I'm in is related to my field but not exactly benefiting my career prospects and goals in any way really.

We do monthly one on ones and that’s my only interaction I have with her and lately the one on ones are increasingly more negative and demotivating leaving me annoyed with work when I otherwise like my job. They increase my monthly budget for our office and I didn’t meet it along with many other offices and instead of making a plan on how to help they increased my budget more and I was asked what I’m doing wrong? Excuse me? 

Anyways. I don’t think managers are exempt from constructive criticism from their team but knowing who she is this would put a target on my back if I let her know my thoughts on how she can be a better leader. 

Has anyone done this and it turn out okay or am I better keeping my head down and ignoring the poor leadership until next month?

15mgcn1,Is PTO more important than health insurance? Can someone help me pick between these job offer's?,"Need help deciding between 2 job offer's

I am having a hard time deciding which of these job offer's I should pick. Here is the information I have for both the jobs. 

Job number 1.) Salary: $52,000
Health insurance: Employer pays 50%
Retirement plan: 401k
PTO: After 1 year I get a week vacation and then after 2 years I get 2 weeks of vacation. And then after 5 years I get 3 weeks of vacation.
Holidays: All major holidays are paid
Commute: 10 miles to get to the job (about 20 minutes each way)
Bonuses: no bonuses
Growth: A lot of opportunities for growth

Job number 2.) Salary: $47,840
Health insurance: Company pays 100% but only to employee, if I add a spouse or kids I have to pay the difference for putting them on my insurance.
Retirement plan: SPP IRA (I don't know much about this retirement plan)
PTO: After 1 year I get a week vacation and after that each year that goes by I get a day added for PTO. They also give us 2 sick days each year.
Holidays: All major holidays are paid
Commute: 40 miles to get to job (about 40 minutes each way)
Bonuses: Employer said they do performance bonuses and the employees end up making more money based on performance. They said they make sure their employees feel rewarded for their hard work.
Growth: A lot of opportunities for growth

I'm stuck between the two offer's because job number 1 has a little more salary and PTO is rewarded faster. And smaller commute. But Job number 2 has 100% paid insurance and performance bonuses. But it's a longer commute. I enjoyed interviewing with both companies and they both are companies I would like to work for. I just want to hear opinions and put of the benefit package which one seems more valuable? I know insurance can be expensive but I also know that having more PTO and being able to spend time outside of work is also important.

15mf6ym,Degrees but not sure what I can do,"First things first thanks to anyone that can help. 
My short story:
I'm 31 and live in Florida and work for a big company that doesn't really pay that well (shocker)....but it has a ton of different positions as well as more in the future as we are building a massive addition to the company. So I am finishing up my capstone for my bachelor's and should graduate in a couple weeks. I will have a bachelor's degree in Science of business administration and management but am also going to get right into my master's for my MBA and more than likely get a dual masters because there's another master's degree I want which is the master's of management and leadership. I also am at the top level of the NSLS (national society of leadership and success). 

As far as experience I went into all the trades after HS as well as opened a business with my father back home. From there I worked at the largest aerospace defense and military contractor. (At least to my knowledge they're the largest) so like I said now I work at this other massive company here but I am trying to get a supervisor role which is my first salary position and I feel like they're going to fight me on it regardless of my degree because of experience???????? I think I have enough experience based on my past and degree etc......I don't understand what to do because as previously being a labor worker and still am at this company you always see the white collar workers who make really great money and think I wish I had a degree so I can make that money as well. I'm just confused because I feel like I started late in life and even with my degree that I'll have in a couple weeks I'll probably not get the position and continue to make garbage hourly pay. 

Should I go elsewhere for work that'll appreciate my bachelor's degree and acknowledge me getting a dual masters??? What company should I try and work for? This doesn't make any sense because for my literal whole life I've been told if you get your degree it will open doors....so far I see no doors opened. Maybe I'm just being too pessimistic.

15mf3sy,"Saying ""No"" can help your career","Learn to say no. I find a lot of people are too agreeable. My background is in IT.

Managers will try to convince you take roles that may stagnate your career. Say no to those. They might offer you a salary that doesn't measure what you are truly worth. Say no and counter.

Now, in order to say NO, you must know your career goals, or know what you are capable of doing.   


Example: I have been in situations where I meet requirements of say, a ""Senior Analyst"" but managers want to you to take the more junior position. They will try to sell it to you many times, but do not fall for that trap. 

I can recall many times this happening over my career when I was taking contract positions like Mat leaves or 2 year positions. Managers pretended to be my friends and at the end of it all, they would offer you a really bad deal under the guise of being ""secure and permanent"". I have always remained firm, and have left those early for better opportunities with better pay.

Works the same way for salary. Always negotiate. Say no to the first number.

Happened to me recently where my temp contract didn't get converted, they offered to keep me for inconsequential roles, tried t oget multiple people to sell it to me, and I said No. Even used my personal situation against me, I said no.   


Ended up resigning after securing something better (negotiated the salary there as well). My manager was pretty bitter I left because it impacts their retention scores.

Another tip: never share personal stuff going on, no matter how nurturing they may seem.

15mezuz,I suspect my boss is an anorexic and an alcoholic.,"I’ve worked here for about 4-5 months now. It is a brand new business, and it’s been a lot of work but very rewarding. I love my job, I love my direct boss. 

Our general manager, however, is another story. She is notoriously unproductive. Never answers her email, doesn’t finish payroll (half of our employees didn’t get paid/got paid late last pay period), she has never once deposited money into the bank even though we’ve made a lot of money lately. Her hands are always shaking and in meetings she can barely formulate sentences. I’ve never seen her eat. She’s admitted to me that she “wants to be on a liquid diet”.  She looks to be about 5’10” and MAYBE 100 pounds or so. Her eyes are always dull and she always seems stressed. She talks about her weekends which usually centers around drinking. One time she missed a meeting I was leading because she had to go to the liquor store because of a sale. 

She once told me that “all her days run together”, and it made me incredibly sad. She doesn’t have any friends and constantly isolates herself. She is new to our area and I’ve tried to include her in community/networking events but she doesn’t engage. 

I’m done with this. Our business will fail with her in charge. I just have no idea what to do about it. I’m new to the workforce and new to this company.

As a result of poor timing and personal failings, I have yet to secure a position in said field, or in really anything related to CAD drafting, which I am also pursuing. This isn’t the topic of this post however. 

What is relevant is that I was recently and unexpectedly contacted by a rather large tech company regarding what I thought was an architecture-oriented CAD design role (as the recruiter mentioned my resume in the initial email), but according to the job description it’s more oriented towards telecom network mapping, something that I know next to nothing about. Training for the field was said to be provided, and they were apparently looking for someone with a construction/design background. Practically anything is better than my current retail job, but even in spite of that I am a bit hesitant to jump into something so wildly different and unknown than what I spent 5 years training for (if I even qualify for this!!)

Would something like this be worth pursuing?

I was recommended by another colleague who had left company A a few months before me to join company B. Now the same colleague has recommended another former colleague from company A for a role in my department.  


The problem is I didn't enjoy working with this former colleague as they had a very condescending attitude, were highly competitive, secretive, and weren't receptive to feedback on their processes. My boss at company B had a meeting with me to discuss my experience of working with this ex-colleague as they were considering her for a part-time (possibly full-time later) role. I was honest and said I didn't particularly enjoy working with ex-colleague since they didn't communicate properly and I often had to do more work because of their ineffective processes and adamance to even consider any feedback. I also added that that was my experience and it was possible company A's toxic work environment festered an ecosystem of mistrust.   


I really do not want to work with this colleague as they implemented some processes that led to micromanagement in the first place. What do I do?

15mds6c,Is quitting the right choice or I am just emotionally weak?,"
3 am at night and still no sleep. Here I am again thinking about quitting my job. 

To give a bit content of how I got here, need to start 10 months ago. I was a junior analyst who joined my current company for a year and half, when my manager decided to pursue other career. I got the chance to step in and did really good job then got promotion to senior 2 months after. Then they hired a new guy to replace my manager. 

Soon, I start to feel less and less ownership of my work. That guy was super detail and always have millions of questions. He tracks all my mistakes, ask me to always keep him update whenever I finished anything right away, share him my to-do list every week and he even ask to read my draft email before I send it. I feel like I was been talking down, and feel I don’t know anything and I am not competent of my jobs.( I really hate when he always end a sentence with “make sense? “). He also said once if I made some mistakes, my creditbility and reputation is badly damaged, and this idea has been hunting me ever since. And the worst part, I wanted to approve myself so badly but I still make mistakes sometime, then I start to punish myself for not being perfect. It made me had panic attack if I forget to send an email, or wrongly input a number in the excel. 

Some of my friends heard my complain and said that guy is just doing him work, which in a way I agree, cause he need to sign off on 90% of my work. However, I just couldn’t adapt it and I can’t stop taking things too personally.  Now I am experiencing depression and anxiety, which are impact my life and relationship with others. It’s really uncomfortable whenever I think of going back to that job and work with this guy. I know I am too sensitive and have all kinds of problems, but I am unhappy.

Over the last couple years pay rises have been no way near inflation and money is becoming an increasing stress to me. $60k (median income $62k now not USA)
Jobs that I would be qualified for are popping up around the 70-80k.

 Boss(B) who effectively mentored me, and has been amazing recently(3 months ago) had an accident and has become paralyzed.

His partner has attempted to take over running of the business, which has effectively stepped on my toes. I have had to teach her how things are done, while at the same time being told I need to stay in my lane. Keeping in note I was included, taught, and opinions respected with B.

Country is in  a recession and has had a noticeable effect on the business, I am doing all I can to keep business rolling and new customers/clients. However it's not realistic to ask for a significant pay increase.

If I leave I am significantly concerned at the continued running of the company, even if given time to train a replacement. My duties these days involve operations, purchasing, dispatch and logistics, sales and IT. I delegate what I can to B partner and another staff member, but most of the time I have to pick it up later to clarify, follow up, and fix.

15mcuss,How To Communicate Clearly,"University teaches you to communicate the wrong way.  
  
**You are told that the best way to communicate new information is to:**

* Recount all the context (introduction)
* Describe the analyses that you've done (methodology)
* Explain the findings (results)
* Highlight the implications of those findings (discussion)

This is a very bottom-up / process-oriented approach to communication. But it's the wrong way to communicate in a business context.  


**Why?**  


Because executives are busy, rarely care about the detail, and only care about the answer.

**So start with the answer first.**  
  
When an executive asks them ""what should we do?"", they are expected to respond crisply with ""you should do X"".  
  
And then they follow with a short summary of the 3 main arguments and the data that support them.

**So it looks something like this:**

* Start with the answer
* Describe argument 1 with supporting data
* Describe argument 2 with supporting data
* Describe argument 3 with supporting data

**So how's that sound?**  


Clear. Authoritative. Persuasive.  


The implication of top-down communication is that it forces you to have already synthesized and summarized the information into one simple recommendation and three supporting arguments.",CareerScienceco,1,1.0,1,1691581201,2023-08-09 11:40:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15mcuss/how_to_communicate_clearly/,8,2023

Here's where it gets odd and we just don't know how to negotiate. His location is taking over another poorly performing location nearby. Its been happening department by department. So, for example, the CFO is now CFO for both sites. The CEO is for both sites, etc. His department is next. So, the new manager position would oversee both locations and he wants to be the PM at both locations.  

We know everyone from his current location that now has 2 sites has gotten a raise or bonus or something but we don't know what (obviously). He currently makes 100K (no overtime) as an hourly employee and a regular manager position would pay around 150K.

The question is what/how do you negotiate when you would technically have 2 jobs. Well, 4 jobs if you count the project management duties at both sites. He'd be expected to visit both locations regularly throughout the week, and it is a 45-minute drive one way.

He already knows that he would do ox, y, and z to bring the other profitable (and compliant). Can he request a bonus based on a percentage of how much money he can save or somehow tie in a bonus in addition to his salary?

15mb8dz,Seeking Career Advice,"Dear Reddit Professionals,

I'm at a big crossroads in my career and could really use your help. I've got an ACCA qualification and have worked in Audit, Finance, and Accounting for 10 years. I spent around 6-7 years at a big company and then switched to a Government Company dealing with Equities and Real Estate. In my new role, I've been focusing on Financial Reporting and Internal Audit, and I've been a kind of advisor to the CFO/CEO. I've also been handling the company's accounting records.

The company recently started a new ""Executive Office"" department to help the CEO and the Board. The director of this department told me I'd get a better job title and more money. I talked to the Vice Chairman about joining this new department, and he said yes and promised to improve my pay.

Now that I'm in the new department, the director seems to have forgotten about the new title and pay raise, and I haven't heard anything from the Chairman's office. There are some interesting roles in this department, like being an Investment Advisor. But I'm worried because I don't have much experience in that area and I don't have a CFA qualification.

It's confusing because the department hired people for strange roles that don't match the usual structure. I'm really serious about my career and hope to reach a top-level position someday, but I'm feeling lost. I've applied for many jobs, but I don't get any feedback. I'm not sure if my resume or my experience is the problem. If you have any advice, I'd really appreciate it.

I'm trying to decide whether I should talk to the director or the chairman about the Investment Advisor role or if I should just leave. They're planning to bring in new people to take over my current job, which makes me a bit sad. I sometimes think I should have joined the finance department instead, but I want to take on new challenges and responsibilities.

Also, I'm studying for the CIA Exam at the end of the month. Sorry for the long message, and thank you in advance for your help.

15mausc,New Dad needs career advice,"29m, married for a year and son is 2 months old. Up until now I’ve always worked the restaurant life but quit my last job in late 2018. I’ve been working odd jobs since then, mostly under the table stuff. I stopped pursuing my bachelors degree around the time I quit my job, but I at least have an associates in computer science, which I know isn’t really worth anything when job hunting…

Some background: My brother in law is the head of software engineering at his day job and has a side business he built from the ground up. He created a web app that works with private schools, think managing students, classes, etc. He also designed the payment processing portion of it as well. There’s about 20+ schools on board and it’s doing about 1.5 million in revenue a month and it’s just him coding this thing when he’s not working his day job. He keeps mentioning this is just a drop in the water and it’s in the final stages to start marketing it out. 

Late last year he and his family moved back to our home state and I mentioned i had been taking some online Javascript classes. He mentions he has a side business that he’s been working on by himself and would love for me to work for him. He knows I’m still learning and I would have been taking on a Junior role and so far it’s been 6 months and I’ve learned a ton.

He’s basically been creating issues in the form of tickets, assigning them over to me, then i’d read them over and create a merge request and assign him for review. He would go over it and point out anything that I needed to change and we’d get it out running in production. 

While I have been enjoying this, the problem is since my son was born, I’ve realized what I’ve been being paid won’t be enough to comfortably take care of my family. But I feel like since I’m still learning, his reason for paying me the amount is justified since he’s basically mentoring me. I’m looking at this like a paid internship… 

The job offer was 30k/year, but as a 1099 contractor. I didn’t have any income at the time so it sounded great, but i’m wondering if i’m going to get backlash come tax time since I’ve barely been able to save anything and also have been out of work for the past 2 months since my son was born. Anything I did have saved, was just about immediately drained after he was born.

My wife makes 55k/year and is set to start going back a few days a week starting next week. her job offers health insurance for her and the baby. Her income is stable so no worries on her end… I’ve been thinking of how can I make more to provide for both her and my son. 

I’m afraid i don’t stand a chance applying to any relevant job in my desired field since I don’t have a bachelors coupled with not having enough experience since I’m still in the learning process…

I live in Virginia close to some shipyards and played with the idea of learning a trade. There’s a bunch of entry level job posted that I could apply to. I really don’t want to go back to the restaurant industry…

I need some guidance on a few things..

15maaeu,"Help me brainstorm a core, part-time job for my 1-person business","I am currently ""in between jobs"" as they say and I'm considering starting a 1-person business.

I have background in programming (web and mobile), as well as in product management (I led a product department for 5 years). Currently I'm getting into digital marketing (PPC, CRO, lead generation, copywriting and analytics).

I have many small-business/projects ideas that I could be working on as a side hustle. However, I see them as ""experiments"" and I figure I will need a stable source of income next to these experiments. Basically the setup I consider most is a core part-time job (B2B, maybe a contract job) and the experiments on top of that in my ""free"" time, outside of the part-time job.

The issue I have is twofold: one, I don't really want the core job to be a programming job, and two, it seems it's not that easy to find a part-time product management job.

I'm looking for ideas for the core job that will be my stable source of income.

15m88rj,Should I quit my internship?,"I got an unpaid internship at a big 4 auditing firm recently. I wanted to get a part time job before university to build confidence and independence (and by part time job I mean a retail or customer service job), but my parents basically forced me into doing an internship for a company instead because my dad is a finance guy, even though I have no interest in finance or accounting and don't want to pursue it in the future. Not a single word about internal auditing is going into my head because I can't muster up any investment or interest for it.

  
The first day was absolutely miserable, it's basically everything that's been my nightmare since I was a child. The soulless white collar office environment, the boring work, the environment made me feel miserable in hours and only solidified my decision to stay far away from finance and pursue my dreams in arts and social sciences instead of ever resorting to this for the sake of money and safety.

15m6o87,Past harassment is ruining my career.,"25f and landed a role at my dream company. Sexual harassment ensued, to which I stood my ground. Rejected advances turned to hostility from my boss, and i was ""let go"" the day after reporting him. The next job I landed, the same thing happened (only much, much worse) and I quit on my second day. 6 months later, I started working at my current company. 

I work in a highly competitive industry and I'm great at my job. The problem is, I'm traumatized and I turn into a mouse in the presence of managers and coworkers. I received little support during my past incidents, and I even had my long time mentor tell me that I should have stuck it out, should have dressed more conservatively, shouldn't have been so disagreeable. That messed me up more than anything- i know its not my fault, but having this happen twice back to back makes you second guess yourself. I used to be an absolute force in the workplace, but now I'm shattered and it's ruining my current job.

I am a top performer, in line for a promotion, but it sounds like they're thinking about passing me up. My boss is hesitant because he doesn't think I'm confident enough in my work to move up yet. I don't know how to explain to him that my work is the only thing I'm confident in- I just can't interact and ""network"" with colleagues the way everyone else seems to do. I'm so awkward and quiet around the good men i work with. I know I need therapy, but I guess I'm just looking for advice and support.

15m6be5,Internship Suddenly Cut Short and Given 1 weeks Notice. Feeling like a rug was pulled out from under me?,"Today I was ‘Let go’ early from my first marketing internship (5.5 months there) with 7 days notice so I finish next week. I say it that way because they are not formally firing me (as far as I know right now), just ending my internship early, and with no courtesy or warning. I was a good intern and was often praised throughout my time, but things suddenly shifted in vibes I was getting from my superior for no reason. I show up everyday eager, excited, driven, hard-working, and our marketing team was very social and close. 

My direct superior decided not to even to be present during the termination meeting and pretended the whole day that nothing had happened, knowing everything that went on during the meeting she couldn’t even muster up the courage to attend. The interview was conducted by another team member of our marketing group. Got in the meeting room and was joined by HR lady who slid an NDA in front of me. I got zero explanation for the sudden “end of internship” when it was supposed to continue through the fall, as was discussed in a meeting just weeks ago.  

The night before this happened, I was looking through my teams calendar to see my what my end date (exit interview, etc) on the teams calendar was and i was included in all of the meetings through November, the agreed-upon end date. I checked this morning after our chat and saw that everything had been removed by this morning.

The team discussed hiring a second intern for me to train this fall about a month ago (during the original meeting where, again, I was told my end date was in the fall and I would continue to have a spot on the team. 
I have discovered that they hired a new intern literally a half hour before they randomly gave me my end date. It was apparently supposed to be me training an intern and then moving on to bigger projects and getting more experience, but now, it’s just someone taking over my internship halfway through, who also has almost equal qualifications. Again, no reasons given, was told nothing but positive things in the meeting. Not a single negative thing. 

Looking for opinions from anyone with similar experiences. Thanks guys.",Killahkush222,2,1.0,1,1691560087,2023-08-09 05:48:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15m6be5/internship_suddenly_cut_short_and_given_1_weeks/,8,2023

15m52gx,How to deal with a toxic boss,"I want to preface this by saying I've been working in the accounting and finance industry for over 9 years and have built up great experience in a number of large corporations. I am no stranger to shouldering responsibility on short notice, busy periods and hard work.

However I've never felt more disrespected in my career than in my current role. Been employed for over a year at a pretty large group of companies, working primarily under one manager. Our relationship was good from the start and he's definitely on the more demanding side but with very bad communication. 

Over the course of the year, I've been given substantial workload both within and outside of my job description, expected to meet unrealistic demands like completing 8 months worth of work in 2 weeks (just because my manager wanted to see if I could do it), worked weekends and 6am to midnight on weekdays all without OT pay or time in lieu, given no assistance from others in the wider team even though I asked my manager for support and also dealing with him constantly texting me outside of work hours and expecting an immediate reply. There have been many occasions where he has physically prevented me from leaving the office way past my working hours of 9-6pm because he wanted me to help colleagues to complete their tasks. He has admitted that he wanted me to do this so that he doesn't have to do it himself. I've cancelled appointments, dinners, plans and events to accommodate his demands even though they aren't related to my work in any way and was never communicated to me in any capacity before that instance.

I've pushed back many times on unreasonable tasks/timelines and tried starting multiple conversations with him about how to improve my workload and working conditions. My efforts go nowhere because he shuts me down straightaway and still forces me to obey his instructions. I asked for mutual respect and boundaries and he's told me that those things don't exist (????) I can feel my anxiety levels increasing to unbearable levels and due to my inability to switch off or spend time with the people in my life, my relationship with my partner is also struggling. I tried speaking to my manager's supervisor who basically told me it's normal expectation within the organisation and supported my manager 100%. Every time I try to speak up or find middle ground, my manager cuts me off and insinuates that maybe I'm not ready for a ""fast-paced free-flowing environment"". Which is absolutely false and insulting as I've been working in this industry since I was 21 and none of my roles have been an easy ride in any way. The difference is I had managers who worked collaboratively with me.

Recently he demanded me to stay back in the office until 3am to help a colleague meet his deadlines but for work that I have zero experience in. When I told my boss that  I could only stay till 7pm due to a very sick partner at home, he threatened to fire me in front of my colleagues, berated me and told me to ""Fuck off"" when I asked for an apology. He then proceeded to ignore me for about a week, even though all my attempts at communication were directly related to work.

I also learnt that he has ostracised another female colleague a couple years ago because she stood up to him in the past and he now leaves the room when she's around. The only reason he still has limited communication with me is because I report directly to him. I've caught him glaring at me in the workplace many times and feel extremely uncomfortable. 

I'm in the process of looking for another job but until I secure one and hand in my notice, I have to deal with his rudeness, passive aggressive comments and downright condescending responses. It's appaling and when I reported this to his supervisor, he swept it under the rug again. 

So I'm just wondering if anyone has had similar experience with an arrogant, stubborn manager who seems to have zero respect for his subordinate -- what happened and how did you overcome it? Right now, I feel like I'm hanging on my a thread and cannot believe I'm dealing with this in such a professional environment.

I was already up for a promotion when they retired and they past it up the chain and then that higher level title also quit and it got punted even higher up the chain.

They sat on the request for 11 months despite my monthly followup with all relevant departments and finally offered me the promotion this August. However, since the initial request my job has vastly changed in terms of the workload and responsibilities and the promotion they offered seems to be a very low ball offer for what I'm being asked to do as I am still filling in most of the responsibilities of the two high level managers they have yet to replace.

I don't want to seem ungrateful but I also feel under valued. Should I take the low ball offer and look for work elsewhere or should I try to negotiate even though the initial offer took a year to get off the ground?",Public-Pudding2020,1,1.0,2,1691551762,2023-08-09 03:29:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15m3kpu/should_i_renegotiate_my_promotion/,8,2023

15m21fp,How to portray luxury hotel serving exp on resume? Any industries/careers/hiring managers actually see any value in this? I’m in denial that I’ve completely stagnated,"I graduated from college with a BS, business and BA, international studies from a state school in 2013. From 2014-2018 I worked in the trade show/conference space in sales support, digital marketing, content/copywriting, account management, partnerships.

I quit my job in 2018 to go to a coding bootcamp (I started learning html/css/js while working on emails and websites) but had to bail for unforeseen financial reasons.

I got a job at a major luxury hotel in the restaurant as I had been a server all through high school and college.

This job is fucking hard and has killed my soul and hope. I have no energy outside of work. I haven’t been able to pivot into anything - customer success manager in SaaS, account  manager in tech are the main things I was trying.

I feel like recruiters/ hiring managers see me leaving my job and then waiting tables and it just breaks their brains.

It’s making me extremely bitter that this intense customer facing job is seen as useless by most of the corporate world.

It’s not Applebees. I’m hosting  private dining for boards of directors, just today had the attorney general and a hedge fund manager at my table.

Is there ANY way I can package all of my experience into something that would potentially be a step forward in pay?

I currently make ~85k and have a great stock plan and health insurance, but it’s completely and utterly dead end.

There’s no server 2, senior server etc. management just means working 20 more hours a week for less pay, and almost every single manager has quit since I’ve worked here. It’s abusive.

15m08p8,How did I handle this? (Time with companies),"Ive bounced around a few jobs less than a year. I was interviewed on the phone by a hiring manager and she asked why I was with company A for 8 months “only.”

Me: I was with company A for 8 months. It was family owned. By the fourth month I was certified. By 6 months I was handling solo assignments and installing units. I left to start my own business. 

Her: And how about 5 months at company B?
Me: “Company B wasn’t a good fit. It was inconsistent with my goal.”

Her: Why are you seeking new employment now?
Me: I work for a start up and it’s not structured. I want something more structured, with a large well established organization. 


Her: “I was just curious.” No biggie.


She was cool and sent me to the next higher up for an interview.


How do you handle the adversity of not being respected or taken serious despite being more qualified and handling more responsibilities that are elite level? For example, I do all the hands on installing for our company. But due to me being with company currently for less than one year it’s almost like red tape.

Quite frankly, I feel time doesn’t equal how good you are. I can come in and do the job better than a person who bas been there longer.

I started working at my current company \~1 year ago. Remote work, \~55k USD P/A (After 1 year working there; initially it was \~53k). My company offered a decent referral bonus and my wife was seeking a better job so I mentioned it to her. She applied, got the job, and was offered 60k USD. Her role and title is the same as me, she just works under a different manager on a different team in my department. She got the job around May.

I've been overjoyed for her, but I am also now keenly aware I'm undercompensated. In terms of qualifications, we're both undergrads; I have two majors, she has one. She has \~1 year AP experience, I have \~1 year in competition regulation and \~1 year at a research lab (Transcribing, mind you). She is a local and I'm an immigrant, but there's no language barrier or anything. 

How do I get pay match - or even higher, given my longer tenure? My company does pay review around February, but I'd prefer not to wait if at all possible. My understanding is that in the United States there is a wide range of views towards how acceptable it is to say ""I know \[coworker\] is being paid Y, I want a raise to match that"".

Losing a job is never easy. Last month, I faced this very situation when I was laid off from Microsoft. Working for Microsoft has always been one of my dreams, and when I learned the news about me letting go of my position, it was quite heart breaking to be honest.  
  
Immediately after that I was filled with self doubt and anxiety. My confidence went an all time low. I was consumed with worry about how my family and I would navigate this challenge. With six people depending on me, the financial situation became an immediate and overwhelming concern. Those first few days were the toughest.  
  
But since then, something amazing happened to me. And that was community, colleagues, friends, family and complete strangers have been coming out to help me at every step of the way. I feel overwhelmed with the amount of support I have received and I am grateful to have such amazing people in my life. Now, I feel like I am completely over the fact of what happened last month.

15lu70o,Bad communication from the top,"I work for a family that owns several small businesses. I hold a sales position but have also helped with marketing and events for the last few years in two of their business. One is in the service/nightlife industry and its been a hot mess for the last 2 years. Failed restaurant, GM quit, went through a chaotic period of bad replacement managers and finally they settled one of the servers into the job. He's the only person in 4 years I've been unable to work with. We started out as friends but after he took on the role, he started taking over some of my tasks, communication got worse and for months we've been unable to even speak to each other. The owners know this.

All of this comes back to the owners being absent. They are very busy and not nearly as involved as they need to be for this place to be successful, but I love them dearly and we are very close, like family. They've made some bad decisions in the past 2 years. The constant state of chaos turned me from being the one holding it all together to a resentful employee. I don't even spend time patronizing the business anymore. 

In May, I rage quit, told them I was done and they could hand everything over to the Mgr. They begged me to reconsider and we had a meeting. I told them how burned out I was and I could not make things work with the manager. My sales job was good and I wanted to focus on that. They were going to talk through things and get back to me with a solution. That was 3 months  ago. 

Now we are approaching an annual festival that I have been lead on planning for the last few years. They normally reach out late summer to see if I will take it on, then offer me a flat fee of pay for the project. This year they did not do that. I ASSUMED, they were going toward a team planning this year. We had 1 meeting with the 4 of us to kick off the event and it was bad. Manager and I basically sat there and nothing was done, the tension could be cut with a knife. A couple weeks ago I asked who was responsible for booking bands and such to which one owner replied, ""You've always been lead on this why would that change now?"". YET they still have not had a conversation with me about the event or offered me a fee. I don't have it in me do do this. I used to love planning events but I'm dreading anything to do with this business anymore.

I told them that I didn't want my burnout to turn to resentment toward them, and they agreed, but their lack of action has led to exactly that. The manager just emailed everyone about planning and I haven't responded. What should I do? I'm trying to overcome the people pleaser, especially when it's clearly not appreciated, but don't want to cave and take on all the stress that goes with this.

Basically, I create maps that tell the construction crews what to do. I don’t hate this job in the slightest, but I feel incredibly isolated from all of my coworkers (possibly due to me being the only queer person in the office to my knowledge). I was also recently passed over for this year’s “Cost of Living” pay increase due to a lack of seniority, but the new hires brought on after me are getting a “market adjustment”.

I'm trying to help my boyfriend make the switch from blue collar work to white collar. We were looking at apartments and the lady said they are looking for unexperienced people. I do have related job experience in admin and retail but I am unable to apply because I am a full-time student that starts school at 8am and finishes at 5pm M-F. And Saturday Sunday from open to close at a salon. I thought about just applying my self but my entire school day is the working hours. I'm only able to work like I do because of him working as well.

My boyfriend has only worked manual labor jobs he does things like stocking and keeping the stores he works at organized and depending on the hours he works he is available to help customers. He does the heavy lifting around the store. He's been working here for years and has been doing this kind of work since graduating high school. But it is wearing down on him and he as well as I am ready for a switch. Problem is I don't know how to draft him a resume or cover letter that can relate his work skills to leasing. I also don't know how to apply the lady told me in passing and never really told me how to apply. I've never been in this field.

15lss1t,Working remotely from Dublin initially before returning back home to USA,"Just wanted to get some advice on a career needle that I am trying to carefully thread. I have been living and working in Dublin for the past 2+ years as an electrical engineer in the power system industry. While I love my current job, I am looking at opportunities back home in the USA as I would like to increase my salary and take on more challenges and fast pace responsibilities.

I have been interviewing at various companies based in the USA but ultimately run into the same problem halting me from moving forward very far in the interview process. The issue is that my partner and I likely wont be able to return home to the USA until another 2 years, meaning the potential company I move to would need to be okay with having me starting remote from Dublin initially until we physically return to the USA. From what I have found so far one of the only ways to accomplish this would be to utilize an HR services contractor, or some type of PEO service to manage the payroll and taxes aspect for the US based company.

One thing that makes this challenging
 is that my partner has two years left in her studies, her final year will likely require us to move outside of Dublin to another city across the country. Because my current job requires employees to be in the office at least 3 days of the week, I may need to move jobs regardless. I would prefer that the next job I move into is for a company that I see myself involved with for many years into the future, I would prefer not to move to one job within Ireland now, then another job when we return to the USA in a couple of years.",GnarlesCharles,2,1.0,0,1691525131,2023-08-08 20:05:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15lss1t/working_remotely_from_dublin_initially_before/,8,2023

15lrt2l,How should I navigate a new responsibility while trying to get paid for it?,"I have been at my current company for 2+ years, and a long tenure at another company prior.  When I joined, I was told that after one year I would be eligible for a promotion.

After one year, I was moved from an individual contributor to a manager with a team of 12 people. I also continued with my individual contributor responsibilities; nothing fell off my workload.  I asked if this transition came with a promotion, and I was told I needed to wait until promotion call outs occur, which was about 6 months out and a promotion would be effective another 3 months after that.  My boss reassured me my promotion was a priority.

One month later, I was asked to lead a large optimization project, essentially making me a product owner.  I accepted the role, in addition to both my initial individual contributor and manager responsibilities. No promotion still.

A few months later when the promotion callout opens up, we were discussing which of MY employees we would be promoting.  When I asked about my promotion, my manager told me the executive team was working through a reshaping of the organization and there were a number of promotions tied up in it, but the agreement was that it would still be effective in March.  March comes around and I was told May, then June, July and now we're in August.  I still have not been given a promotion.  My reviews have been phenomenal.  I'm consistently told I'm a future leader and how I've been a huge value add to the company.

In the past few months, there has been a lot of discussion about formalizing my role as a product owner, but again, this promotion is tied up in the reorg. Today, my boss told me there is a very big need for this position, and if I'm interested, there is a possibility they could route my work over to this product owner role ""ahead of any HR exercises"".  Basically, they could get me in the role sooner than what HR can do for my promotion.

I'm tired of feeling unrewarded and undervalued.  I want to get paid fair compensation for the work I do (which by their own words, is incredible).  To be clear, I have no issue with going above and beyond; you don't get a promotion for doing your job well.  My issue is that I have taken on the role of three people with no reward for doing so. Now they want me to take on a new role with more responsibility and I get to hope for a promotion.

How would you navigate this conversation to say, ""Yes, I'm interested, but I expect to get paid.""?",tryin2gitpaid,1,1.0,3,1691522974,2023-08-08 19:29:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15lrt2l/how_should_i_navigate_a_new_responsibility_while/,8,2023
15lrs3k,"A few options ahead, share your experiences if applicable.","Good afternoon folx! 

I (33y) have recently been informed that i still have 36 months of post-9/11 GI education benefits remaining.  and have been doing a lot of consideration on the paths that i would like to take, as i have found that pursuing my passion in art as a business has been killing my passion for the art, and am wanting to separate my creativity from monetization. 

I have no wish to pursue any careers that my military experience would directly apply to. 

It may sound like a lot of options, but i have narrowed down my wants to 5 areas… each with valid reasoning. So i am mainly asking for those in these fields to share their experiences, to help better gauge if it is something i can see myself dedicating my life towards. 

So, the following options are what i have come to;

1) pursue a business management degree with my VA benefits and a welding tradeschool on my dime; i have experience welding and enjoy it, but need to really brush up my skills and technique through a tradeschool since its been over a decade since ive last welded. The business management degree is to better prepare myself to open my own welding shop. Welding also represents longevity in career availability as there are many aspects of welding that cannot be automated effectively yet. Sidenote; welding is also art applicable in my spare time, to keep my passion in art alive. 

2) pursue an Aerospace Engineering degree. I have a knack for problem solving and already enjoy designing things in general. I am self taught in CAD, a fe 3D modeling/animation programs, and work on personal tinker projects often. I also have personal connections in the industry, but any meaningful position they want a degree for, which is entirely understandable. 

3) minerology/geology degree. My “art passion” and mentioned earlier in my post is lapidary work(the cutting of rocks and gemstones into jewelry ready pieces) and jewelry crafting. I have a deep interest in minerals from a scientific process aspect, and would love to study more in depth. This option would also allow me to have a career that pits me directly around people that can help supply the most interesting of materials for my passion in art. 

4) Youth therapy. This is the “life fulfillment” option, in the sense that i know how desperately i needed an experienced adult to care about the things i was going through. The programs of the 90s just were not what they are today (so much progress it is besutiful, but so much more yet to be made!). This would also be the hardest on me from a mental health perspective; it would be very difficult for me to disconnect myself from certain case types, and having my hands bound by protocol would would take a heavy mental toll on me. One i would happily take on, but one i need to consider heavily on if taking it on contributes towards the greater good i want to see in the world. 

5) Classical Greek/Roman studies. This is kind if something i do on a daily basis anyways. I have several dozen audiobooks ranging frol mythology to historical regarding the time period and geological region that i listen to daily. It is a period in time that truly “calls” to me. This is also, as i understand, a very very narrow career field, in that i would almost be solely limited to teaching jobs post studies/research. 

My main questions i would love to hear from people on;

1) expectations vs reality of what you ended up doing? 

2) how viable is the job market in your field? How crass-field applicable are the skills you picked up?

3) how stressful is the environment, and what kind of stressful is it? E.G.; is the labor mentally taxing, or physically so?  Is there inter-office political structures you werent expecting? Etc

15lqp3d,Nerves after job switch.,"Okay  -  I’m looking for some advice or perspective on this. Im 26 just switched from a former corporate job doing tech support/ help desk remotely for incoming calls. I’m graduating from community college with an associate focus in cybersecurity. I’ll be finished this winter. I also take care of my dad who’s is 75 and homebound.  

Previous job: Average call volume was 10-20 calls per day. The job was completely remote but pretty simple in terms of support. Very hardware focused , and just setting up service tickets remotely. The work was easy but there was no room for growth. No raise, bad benefit coverage, only lateral promotions. Also it was contracted position, so just really felt like a number in the corporate world.  My boss was super nice and accommodating but still had to push a lot of the corporate BS. Nonetheless between the people calling and the micromanaging/corporate changes to save money - it made to dread every time I woke up to log on. 

So after applying around I got interest from a smaller new MSP business that offered 10-12k raise from current job. I accepted as it seemed reasonable and like a new opportunity to grow- they are headed down the cybersecurity route as a potential service to new clients. So this was my biggest winner. However I’m just a few days in and I’m pretty nervous about the work here. I just don’t know if I’m going to be able to be a contributing factor and if it’s worth the stress. 

New job:
So new job is 45k a year, 401k, health, PTO. Etc.
The company is pretty new as a MSP and has made some recent merges. Due to internal reason they are expecting large growth and could be taking in more clients. I was hired for level 2 help desk and the work is nothing I’ve really done professionally, only covered briefly in my schooling and academics. The position is not remote so my commute went from WFH to 13 miles each way. (20 min am 30 min pm commute)
My colleagues are very nice and there is only 2 other guys working help desk for the business. 
I’m excited at the potential to learn and grow with them but I’m not sure if I can 1) keep up 2) adjust to all this being reasonable.

Thankfully we are able to utilize my dads benefits to get some in home nursing, but I was also able to just leave my computer and check on him. Now I’m 15-20 mins away with no traffic. I am just kind of second guessing my decision to make an abrupt change for more money.. heavy imposter syndrome and not sure if I made the right choice.

About a year ago I was contracted by a tech startup to do some marketing work for them. It was really fun and I kinda got obsessed with it. 

The problem was this was a tech startup... and I didn't know a damn thing about tech or Saas at the time because all of the work I'd done up to that point had been for marketing agencies. 

I started studying and trying to learn more about Saas marketing, and eventually got a decent understanding of what I needed to do. 

But, I also love ChatGPT, so I used it and got some prompts from [a newsletter](https://www.theaicrunch.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic_social) I read sometimes. 

I built these elaborate plans off of what ChatGPT gave me and pitched them to the CEO (it's a small team so I had contact with the CEO daily) and he loved them. We started implementing the plans and they acutally worked. 

We crushed our revenue goal immediately after and then again for the next 3 months. 

Fast forward to mid-July and I'm on vacation. I get a call from the CEO and he said he wants to offer me a full time job because of what I did with marketing. He told me what he was prepared to offer me and I immediately said yes. 

The offer included a great salary (more than double what I was making) and 2 full percentage points of the company (worth $200k in equity). 

I haven't fully accepted it yet, but I have a meeting with the board of investors at the end of this week. I feel like a fraud and idk what to do.

15lo2cm,In a dilemma with my course (incoming freshman),"Hi, so I am in a dilemma with my program. Should I pursue Computer Science or BS Psychology? Which one is more opportunity wise?

My personality is more aligned in working with computers, but psychology is my interest. In terms of working, I can see myself working in the computer science field instead of psychology. However, I don't have enough knowledge about programming and I am not that good in maths. 

In psychology, I can see that it is really my forte for I am interested in the human mind and behaviour but I don't see myself working in that field (I lack social skills and I am easily drained with social interactions). I am into psychology only for the purpose of fixing myself, so I don't really see psychology as a field for my future job.

15lmy5a,Exploring a new career path,"hi everyone! I’m going to try to explain this the best I can, but I apologize in advance for a longer post :) 

I’m a 24F that currently works as a videographer/producer for a professional sports team. This is my first full time job out of college and so far it’s been a fun learning experience. Of course, like most people in an entry level job, I know that this is not my forever. I’m currently halfway through my second year at the job and I can’t help but feel like something is missing. 

Since I can remember, I have loved and been passionate about music. Whether it be making playlists, discovering new artists, diving deeper into the lyricism/stories behind songs, etc. This has mainly been a hobby of mine I’ve done on the ice but lately I’ve been toying with the thought of working in the music industry. 

I could easily transition as a videographer/producer, however im curious about what other careers might be around in the music industry that I could explore? I love to be creative, I’m extremely organized and love storytelling/finding the meaning behind people/artists/songs etc. I am very personable and connect well with a wide variety of people. A little more on the shy side, but willing to learn and try just about anything.  if anyone has any knowledge (whether you’re in the industry yourself or know someone who is) I’d love any/all suggestions & ideas.

15llwjm,"Is it worth it for me to explore other companies in my industry, or have I reached the 'salary peak' with my current employer?","Hello everyone,  
  
I've been working in the security industry as a security guard for a subsidiary of a large corporation (>100,000 employees) since January of this year in Germany, earning a gross annual salary of 44,000€ at the moment. Through various further training opportunities and tenure within the company, I can potentially increase my salary to 53,000€ gross annually in about 5 years, while maintaining the same role and responsibilities. Of course, there are also shift supervisor positions, but I won't delve into those for now. So far, I'm extremely satisfied with my current employer and don't really plan on leaving here in the next few years. However, it's always a good idea to keep an eye out for other opportunities that might offer higher income, right?  
  
Yet, after a lot of research within the security industry, I'm getting the impression that it might not be very sensible in my case. Nearly ALL the jobs in Germany I've come across that match my qualifications seem to come with salary reductions of over 5,000€ per year.  
  
Even job postings that require a qualification level higher than mine usually mention an annual salary that is either on par with or slightly below my current salary.  
  
Now, here's my question for all fellow professionals in the security industry here:  
  
What's your take? Should I keep searching or let it be?  
  
And just out of curiosity: What do you earn and how many years have you been in the field?

Remember to have a nice day, y'all

The Ivy League evaluation process has taken longer because they, for some reason, do a background check **before** checking references or offering a job.

I've made the Ivy League recruiter aware of the offer, and she's asked if I can get the deadline extended to the end of the week, as their last reference call isn't until tomorrow (the day of my deadline..) and THEN they'll have their decision ready...the day after my deadline.

My gut feeling already knows I now want the job that's been offered to me, (internal, lateral move; I get to keep my benefits; higher salary; great opportunities for growth/learning) but I can tell the Ivy League team **really** wanted me and did so much work evaluating me. I would ask the other recruiter to extend it, but I don't really see a point- and don't want to risk leaving a bad taste in anyone's mouth...?

So, would you extend or thank the Ivy League recruiter for everything and withdraw the application?

I'm 26yo male. Currently working as a cafe supervisor. Living in NH. I'm about to move in to a one bedroom apartment and my wages are going to be tight. I had been living paycheck to paycheck since I started college, and up till now this is the first job I've had where I can save, and now it's going to get rough. And I don't want to stay at this cafe, my bosses are sociopaths; have done terrible things.

I make around $1650 biweekly after taxes. After rent, utilities, student loans, car payment, bills, etc. I put $200 into savings with maybe $250 leftover to remain in checkings each pay period. I have about $5800 right now that about a grand will be spent on this apartment, not including $2400 to move in, and about $1700 in my savings.

I went to school for graphic design in 2015 and graduated with a bachelor's. Never had a design job, either I'm not good enough, lack of jobs, or the jobs won't pay well until I have at least 5 years experience. Thus I'm $35k in college debt. Currently I have paid all other remaining debt besides my car payment. 

I'm exhausted everyday after work running around. My gf has an office job and is refreshed after sitting down all day - we essentially feel opposite after work and I wish I had energy. Should I try going into a trade school and start a new path? Is there a job I may be qualified for now to try and navigate? Do I try landing a GM job somewhere for more money? Maybe a non-profit for loan reimbursement?

2 years as cafe supervisor
4 years as a security guard/supervisor
1 year social media marketing

I went through a rough divorce and ended up leaving the field and have job hopped since.

15ljk1c,Do I quit my lowkey job for a better paying more high stress job?,"I (22F), have been working at my lowkey job for a year and a half - it’s my first job out of college. I work in a division of my company’s sales department as an operations representative (fancy way of saying I do operations for our existing accounts). The culture is super chill, and my boss is like a second mother to me, I am friends with almost everyone else in my department. 

Lately I have been feeling stuck at my current job since there isn’t any room to grow internally and long story short landed an interview with a medium sized fintech start up for a position as a Sales Development Representative. Although I’m in sales right now, it would be different since I would be cold calling/ emailing/ and talking to prospects to set up meetings with Account Executives. A few girls I met through my current job started working there and really love the job and that the culture is similar to my current job - everyone is friends, jokes around, works but has fun. 

Here’s my pros and cons of my current job and possible new job: 

Current job salary: 50k base w/ 60k OTE

 • no raise, only “raise” in commission (our commission is extremely unpredictable. Last month it was $350, a few months ago it was $1600… so I never know how much I’m going to get per month) 
* No position to grow into i would stay as an operations representative 
* Love the culture and people
* Can rarely work from home (only if I have a doctor appt or something) 
*  have to pay a toll when coming and leaving work
* 14 min commute 

New job salary: $55k base w/ 70k OTE
* Promotion to Account Executive within 12-20 months 
* 8 minute commute 
* WFH Monday and Friday 
* I know a couple girls there and culture seems chill and similar to my current job

I’d like to negotiate with my current job to raise my base salary to 55K and let me WFH 2 days a week - that’s the outcome I would like since I’m pretty comfortable at my current job, but feel like I should get out of my comfort zone, try something new, and challenge myself.

15lixjp,Leaving a job very early on,"Hi everyone, 

I recently started a job that required me to move about 500 miles from home. I’ve been here for 2 weeks, and this has been the most anxiety ridden two weeks of my life. I work 13 on 1 off, 13 hour days, and my landlord managed to rent out the apartment we had agreed on in the two days before I arrived. So I’ve been up in a hotel and haven’t had time to sort out housing. 

The job itself isn’t horrible, it’s just the hours being the main difficulty. I’d like some insight about potentially leaving respectfully. I appreciate the opportunity the company has given me, but emotionally, I can’t handle it. Even my anxiety meds can’t keep up. I hardly eat, can’t sleep more than a few hours, and don’t have time to do things I think could help it.

15limsv,How do I get out of being stuck in mediocrity and find a direction,"I am going to work harder and I am going to improve myself. I am here looking for general advice, learn about other's experiences and maybe to just get nudged into the right direction.   
I am wasting my time - I am - A lot. I see a lot of people going off to MIT, Yale, and Harvard, and all that. I am studying right now in a very, very, not even second-tier college - it's like among the bottomest rung of all the colleges in the world. Now, I'd be fine with it if I didn't think I was capable of more. But I feel like I am really intelligent and could be doing more. I come at the top of my class without even trying at all. I got placed before all my classmates, and I didn't even try at all. I put in 0 effort. So many people even in my college are doing so many things out of the way. I am doing nothing. But with 00000 effort, I'm still able to be at the top. I am very scared for my future now. None of my classmates, I feel, are at my level when it comes to a lot of things. I don't even know what to do now. I wanna spend my life with people smarter or at least as smart as me so that I can grow. I am not trying to be braggy, although that may not be obvious. I am just stating what I am experiencing.  
( I couldnt get into a better college owing to lack of trying and a bit of bad luck. In my country the college one gets into is exclusively based on just the final examinations score. I studied nothing all year as you might have guessed. 2 weeks before my exams I had some medical complications and a week before I underwent a surgery. :P It was a tough time, but I kinda pulled through, crammed in the last minute. I managed to score 92 percent. Well okay. now with that I could only get into the college I got into if i wanted to study only CS which I was adamant about in addition to disadvantageous reservation policies in my state which I shouldn't complain about. Now I could have taken a different path. I could have tried for better colleges that considered different entrance exam scores but I didn't wanna do that because that involved a lot of work.)  
Now in college I ace all tests without studying at all! And that has made my life very easy and also made me extremely lazy. I feel like I am wasting my life now. Since things have come easy for me ever since the beginning, I feel like I am sinking. I want to be in a more challenging environment, take on more. I don't know what to do with my life. Now I'll tell you what I want exactly - I want to find something I like - something I want to study about - do my masters in - something I am passionate about - I have nothing like that so far. I want something I love and do research. That's what I need, though. Since stuff I've done so far - my exams and stuff - come so easy for me, I've led a lazy life till now and have never pushed myself to do more. There's so much more I have to learn and study. I am in my final year now. I am doing bachelors in information technology since I liked computer science since school; it seemed like a natural choice for doing my degree in. I do like it now, but I have no idea what discipline I like. I have learned nothing in my 3 years of college. I just always studied the morning of my exams, wrote it, and get good grades. But I have learnt zip nada zero. In my 3rd year, I had to intern somewhere as it was a requirement in my college. I just applied to something that came to my college, got selected, learnt some stuff; the work was about computer vision; I was able to easily learn how much was needed for me to get my assigned stuff done and do it well. Then, surprisingly, they liked me so much, and they offered me a job. The pay is not as much I'd like, but it's kind of the average amount people in my college get placed in. They've given me like 1.5 years to think about it and accept it or turn it down. I have until January next year. There are companies coming to my college now for placement with higher pays that I'm attending. So far, since I basically know nothing and I have done 0 projects, I didn't get selected anywhere. Looks like I have to put in some more effort if I want to get into a better company, and now I'm doing that. I'm practicing on LeetCode and other stuff and looking into doing projects. But, okay.  
My problem now is, is this what I want? Do I just want to get into a company, work for them - just learn whatever they require me to, get paid - like sort of enter the rat race? What about finding my passion - what about finding what I wanna study? What do I wanna do with life? I don't know! Now, do I apply for masters somewhere? How? What do I apply to study? What do I wanna do?  
I started thinking about all this yesterday. Initially I was freaking out like I was insane. Then I sort of became depressed. I bunked college today and spent all day sleeping because I was so scared. Now I have decided to pull myself together and start planning. Actually start figuring stuff out. My plan so far - since I don't know what I wanna study I plan on focusing on getting into a company with a good pay first. Work for sometime, gain some experience and side by side figure out what I like. So for that the first step would be learning more DSA and other stuff and do a project. I will work on that. In addition to that I have to eliminate a lot of distractions I have and focus on stuff that matter. That will be tough but it's not like I'm throwing it all away so okay. Another thing I wanna do is find a good book to read. I wanna learn about philosophy. So I need to find out which book I should start with for that. After working for some time I plan to apply for masters - hopefully I'd have figured what I am interested in by then.   
The obstacles I'm facing right now are crippling regret that I didn't get into a better college in one hand and the temptation to take the easy path of not pushing myself, continue what I've been doing so far and go where that takes me. The latter will be easier to overcome I guess since I'm petrified of the thought of looking back 10 years later when I'm 30 to find out I've accomplished nothing and have gotten nowhere and  just wanna hang myself which I already kinda wanna do.

15li8wy,Would there be any red flag or strange thing about this offer?,"Good morning everyone, first I just want to thank you for providing great, kind, and detail advices for such a social life rookie like me!

&#x200B;

So, I actually posted about accepting a new job position for entry data scientist in fully remote working yesterday, and I actually received the job offer letter via my recruiter's email.

&#x200B;

But what I felt kind of strange when looking at the letter was that, it was saying that if this letter is not accepted with my sign at the close day of 8/7/2023, which was the same day I received it, it would be expired, and I received it from my recruiter around at 2:50 PM yesterday. So I kindly asked my recruiter  if I could have extensive 2-3 days to consider and decide to accept the offer letter, and the recruiter said no problem, and so that part seems ok now.

&#x200B;

The other things that I'm still not sure if it's ok to accept this offer is that, the training time is just maximum 5 days once it started, and they said they would grant me access account for the company server to start tasks. They will pay me $60 per hour after training($25 for this), the working time is flexible for 30-40 full time hours, and send me a check to purchase necessary tools for workstation like MacBook, and other software to install before I start to work on 8/21/2023.

&#x200B;

In total, it all seems very attractive and a lot of advantages comparing my current workplace, but I also have a doubt like if I would be good enough to change from my current position as full stack web developer to data scientist at this company with one and half year work experience(these are all for web development only, not for any data science), and being related to this, have kind of this doubt like there is something not right and fishy about this letter or this company.

&#x200B;

Additionally, after a quite long thinking of it last night, I have also come to an idea that I would just like to continue my position as a developer(This doesn't mean that I want to stay long in my current company, of course.) for web applications, software, game, or anything like those as I majored and graduated from my school. Data Scientist is surely awesome opportunity, but I just wonder in what things this new company saw from me to choose to hire me who's been working only as web developer for around an year now with such a high pay rate(I'm not also sure if 5 days training would be enough, honestly.) and other looking good merits. That's why I can't help being very cautious about this decision. I would rather just keep working for my current company a little bit more until I can get the other chances for the positions that I exactly would like to accept without worrying about any possible high risk.

&#x200B;

Sorry and thank you for reading such a long post, and I would truly appreciate if you can give me any helpful advices! Have a wonderful day!!",Rj_Coder39,1,1.0,12,1691501290,2023-08-08 13:28:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15li8wy/would_there_be_any_red_flag_or_strange_thing/,8,2023

15lg5l0,Not sure if I'm heading in the right direction...,"Hi everyone,  
  
I feel as if I'm really stuck and have no clue where I'm going and what I should put at the top of my ""life list"", so I need your help 'cause there's no one who could give me sound advice. Here's my background: I'm a female, 24, Russian, single, live with my parents in a small city. In 2021, I got a bachelor's diploma in economics with distinction (I specialize in Russian banking and accounting), am currently doing my master's in foreign philology (as it's called in Russia) and majoring in literary studies - European and American literature - and ESL teaching (on top of that, I got TESOL certificate 2 years ago). In autumn 2024, I'll graduate as I'm doing a correspondence course, which means I study 2 times per year - in summer and winter (I have to fly to another city for my studies). With all this in mind, such a flexible master's allows me to work full-time and teach English to junior high and high school students in a local language centre. Luckily, I manage to save up money. I enjoy educating teenagers and working with my peers, and people older than me. I just love communication.  
  
You must be wondering why I opted for such a random (at a glance) master's programme that doesn't correspond with my prior degree. You see, I've always been passionate about literary studies and wanted to be more knowledgeable about it. When I was in my final year of school, I was really unaware of what the hell I was doing in terms of my professional choice; having added fuel to the fire, some people talked me out of pursuing my dream. I regretted 1000 times about my bachelor's crying my eyes out and blaming myself for what an idiot I was (am). That's how I ended up studying economics, yet didn't happen to work in this field. I'm into art, music, cinematography, literature (different kinds of literature - from popular science on medicine to fiction; I'm truly an avid reader who can digest huge amounts of information and love educating herself), and philosophy - you can call me an inquisitive, highly sensitive, and heartfelt person. I tend to romanticize many aspects of life. Unfortunately. Being someone like me doesn't make me happy (finding real friends or a beloved one turns out to be an uphill battle). I wonder if I'm giving a great deal of thought to everything.  
  
There's something lying at the bottom of my soul harping on the same string and telling me that I should let go of my doubts and fears about my life and career and simply go with the flow. However hard I try, I fail to follow my inner voice. Maybe it's a sign? I really cannot get my hand around my career after graduation and personal priorities. Yet there are some things I'd like to pinpoint:  
  
\- I want to go abroad,  
  
\- I want to become financially and mentally independent from my parents,  
  
\- I want to do something about my career (I'm saying no to teaching ESL for all my life).  
  
First, I'm planning to go abroad (Japan or South Korea) after my graduation 'cause I've been longing for it all my life (my parents find me a weirdo :D). I want to test the waters before deciding if I really want to live and work there. I'm willing to learn a new language. Lately, I've been thinking about working in either of the aforementioned countries but applying for EPIK or JET won't be possible in my case: 1) I'm a non-native speaker, 2) as many people say, it's not a career. To crown it all, being a gaijin will be far from easy to get a job there. I'm not sure that having degrees in economics or/and in foreign philology will come in handy.  
  
Second, I've come to the conclusion I have to certainly move out of my parents' as living with them makes me feel relaxed, cared for, and it also encourages me to remain an ""eternal child"". It would be unfair to my parents not to mention that they're very loving and supportive but unable to resolve my certain private matters (actually, they're not obliged to!).  
  
Valeriia 🕊, \[08.08.2023 14:57\]  
Third and importantly, I want to switch to another job/field in 1,5 years or less. I'm considering going for Ph.D. in literary studies/master's in psychology etc. but hesitate to do that and think to myself that I should postpone my decision. Here's another option: it's possible to relocate to the bigger city and try my hand at working in a publishing house from the very bottom. In the beginning, I won't earn too much (about 40% of my salary will be spent on rent). Also, I'd like to start blogging about art (not sure if I'm capable of attracting the masses) and write stories (there are some I've written) and monetize my blog.  
  
I feel kind of a pendulum person who cannot stick to her goals and blindly wanders around without knowing where she's going.  
  
Sorry for such a long post. I appreciate your help and send you all warm hugs! \^\^",babysbreath22,1,1.0,0,1691495978,2023-08-08 11:59:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15lg5l0/not_sure_if_im_heading_in_the_right_direction/,8,2023

Round 1 was with the recruiter himself somewhere end June. After 2.5 weeks, I had the second round with the Manager. In my opinion, it went well and the Manager asked me to be patient with their recruitment process as they’re hiring quite a few people and the entire process would take time. He also said that he’d give a positive feedback to HR both professionally and personally. The catch is that at the end of the interview the manager said that he thinks I’ll be better suited for one of the other position he’s currently drafting the JD for. On asking the timeline for it, he said it’s expected to be posted in August. Now, idk what’s happening at the back end but I haven’t heard anything from the company.

15lfn9v,Ex HOD could potentially sabotage my application in a new company.,"I (31,F) recently interviewed for a dream role in company D. It was going great, the HR was impressed with my resume and experience and selling the role to me. I was a little shaken when I found the role was actually replacing an ex- HOD (late 40s, M) in previous company (company X) that I did not get along with.

Backstory of my ex-HOD:
He started at company X as a junior and build his entire 20 something year career in the same company. He joined the department when company X terminated the previous HOD unceremoniously and without warning when a whistle-blower complaint was made to our HQ. I was in a junior role when he joined the department.

Early in his tenure within the department, I passed some feedback of the team's opinions and suggestions in his direction for our department. I told him in the spirit of avoiding the scenario with our previous HOD, I decided to share these feedback I have heard with him. It backfired on me instead, and he placed a target on my back. I got promotions denied, despite the results and initiative shown in taking additional responsibilities outside my scope. He told another manager (not my direct) who tried to fight for me that he saw no incentive to promote me when I was already doing the extra work anyways.

I knew about his dislike, and once or twice got into disagreements with him, but I stayed clean and transferred to another unit, without burning bridges with him. Eventually left company X to gain more experience in the industry through other companies and roles. When I applied for this role in company D, I was in a senior role looking to make the next leap to a leadership role.

He was forced out of the department and company X 3 years ago for poor performance, and moved into company D 2 years ago. In conversation with the HR, she mentioned the role opened up as the current person (my ex HOD) tendered, and they would be expected to handover everything to me. 

I do have several questions:

1. I have concerns that company D would use him as an informal reference check, seeing as my resume listed a common department and location. And knowing his behaviour, he would try to smear my reputation. My logical side is telling me that if they choose to listen to him, that it is their loss. If they do ask me about it, I would just state that the person I am when I worked with my ex HOD and the person I am now is different, I've grown up. And I'm sure they also have had differences with supervisors and managers before as well? Are my worries unfounded?

2. I would be grateful if anyone can provide advice or share their experiences if they also have experienced and went through a similar situation? 

Thank you!

TL,DR: Interested in a dream role that is open because an ex-HOD from a previous company is leaving that role. Said ex-HOD is petty, and I'm worried he may paint a negative picture of me in the new company I am looking to join.

15ler6x,What does a software developer who has lost his passion do?,"Hello y’all!

Lately I'm struggling to find my way in life. I'm 21 years old, from Germany, Munich. I graduated from secondary school and successfully completed my 3-year training as a software developer (programmer, IHK certified). Over a month ago I started my first full time job where I earn about 40k, but I have been unhappy for several months now, to the point that I have to force myself to get the work done every day. I've been programming since I was 12 and I'm good at the job, I just kind of lost my passion for it.

I started doing graphic design as a hobby 2 years ago, but couldn't make much money at it due to the advent of AI tools and an oversaturated market. On the other hand, I really enjoy it.

I don't want to work in software development anymore. Just doesn't seem to be my true passion. I want to do something that has real purpose, like helping people or making a real impact on the world. Programming a *million* other microservices for some billion dollar company that uses them to exploit its own customers is nothing I want to do anymore. But I also don't want to end up broke.

Right now I don't really know what to do with my life and I'm afraid I won't figure it out (soon). I see some colleagues my age at my workplace who have made huge trips around the world and studied in several countries. I feel like I'm falling behind.

Some of the many things I tried: Photography, woodworking, journalism, writing books, getting into finance (mostly for personal use but also to get some insight), fixing PCs for all my friends...., but nothing really convinced me. Everything just got kind of boring, I guess.

I have **many small(er) skills** that I don't know how to put to good use:

* I'm insanely good with Excel, graphing complex tables and visualizing relationships between data.
* Same with any tool related to designing (Photoshop, Indesign, Illustrator, Premiere, all the Adobe stuff, Figma, you name it)
* Organizing and managing things (appointments, data, storage, my life, people, tasks, etc.) comes very easily to me and I've been told I'm good at it.
* I can easily work into new things, easily understand new concepts and work with them without knowing much about the in-dept mechanisms. I can make stuff work that I have no clue about whatsoever.
* I can think on my feet and make fast decicions in high-pressure situations. Came in really handy in the past (managing overlapping hotfixes and making a product work minutes before going live).

...I just don’t know how to put any of these skills to a better use.

&#x200B;

Recently I’ve been thinking about getting my vocational baccalaureate (you call it Fachabitur in Germany). I could do it in only one year of additional schooling and then study. Maybe something like personnel management or tourism management? I think I would enjoy working more if I used my management skills.

However, that would mean I wouldn't get paid for the next 4 to 5 years (dual studying would be an option). AND I would also *""lose""* 5 years of work experience (after which I would earn at least 70 to 80k in my current field).

**Other things that catch my interest:**

* I find **medical technology** very interesting (Brainlab, Siemens Healthcare, ada, etc.) because I would actually be helping people with it (would still be SE, I would definitely need new certifications)
* Another option would be to become a **researcher (R&D)** to bring new technologies into a company. I think that would at least be more fun than my current job, and from what I've heard, it pays decently. I'm good at doing research, but not sure how to advance my carrer in this field
* I could also become an **OpenShift consultant** pretty easily. Not very purposeful either. I would basically be a well paid Yaml configurator... but I have the option.
* Going in a different direction, a job as a **team leader or product owner** might be promising. Only thing I worry about is the frequent burnouts I hear about and that no team leader I know ever recommended becoming one
* Alternatively, I could try working full time in a design studio as a **graphic designer**. I don't know the corporate industry (only the freelancing one), just heard it's also pretty competitive. I'm really good at it so I'll probably manage

Any ideas about what I should do or feedback some of you may have for me is very welcome.

Yesterday morning he seemed to be quite happy and we had a good talk about different things.

15ld9lu,Best degree to transition to remote work?,"What type of degree should I get for remote work?

Quick background: I'm 30 years old, just got out of the military last year after 10 years of service. I worked mainly in intelligence/security management while I was in. I managed to obtain my Associates degree, plus a few intelligence related certifications while I was in (CCMP-F and CDASA for those who know or care).

Now I work in industrial security for a large defense contractor, making $100k/year in a city I like. However, while my job is fine and pretty chill, I would like to get away from the defense sector and get a job I can comfortably work from home making at least what I make now. More would obviously be great 😃. 

I know it's worth a lot of money, but I would rather not have to just rely on my security clearance for my job either.

Luckily, I have my GI Bill, plus I qualify for the VA Vocational rehab program. For those who don't know, this just means I have a lot of free schooling I can utilize.

I am looking to go back to school here to complete an online bachelor's degree while I continue to work. I don't really have a huge preference towards anything, but I'm not really math or science inclined. That being said, I feel like I need to learn something in order to be  valuable, so something like web development or software engineering, or cyber security seems like a good move. I'm just a bit nervous to start learning to code I guess.

Luckily, I have plenty of time and free school.

15lc4e8,Stuck between working for someone else or start again my online business,"Stuck between working for someone else or start a business

I (23F) just graduated last September, I am now on my 2nd full time work in Food and Beverage industry. At first, I was ecstatic and full of passion since it’s a start-up with a lot of potential. I work along with the owner, I share ideas and he fully supports everything. At first 3 months, I focused on establishing a brand and resulted in an increased of sales up to 30-40%. We also successfully opened a new branch.

However, as he started to attend marketing seminars (not entirely focused on restaurants more on vlogging and e-commerce) he tried to incorporate everything he learned, not thinking of the branding nor the market. He even said that it’s okay if it’s controversial, invoke negative emotions as long as we gain audience.

As the marketer, I ofcourse told him the pros and cons but he won’t budge and just want to see us implement it. As a result, the sales decrease. Now, he keeps pressuring us to fix it but still with his ideal marketing. He can also see that I don’t fully support it and now he only talks to me when needed and sometimes guilt trip me that his business is going down and he’s going to die if that happens. Also saying that I should think of my colleagues’ family and kids.

I can’t deal with all of these negativity and really considering resigning. I thought of trying out my online business once again, and see if it will be a success with a deadline of 3-6 months, and if it fails I’ll try corporate again.

My last job I quit mid shift due to a mental health crisis, so my boss from there isn’t an option. I was 18 when I quit. Though that boss is a family friend and has since forgiven me, I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to list her. My first job I was often late to and calling out sick, also for mental health reasons cause I was 15 going through a lot of shit on top of highschool and truancy issues. I worked at a university for an internship last year, but I was often missing hours, coming in late, and ended up missing the last 3 weeks of the program due to appendicitis and severe complications following the appendectomy. And that’s literally my whole work history. I’m too embarrassed to ask any of my former college professors because it’s just a crystal store in a mall. I’m not doing anything prestigious or related to the things they teach so it just feels wrong to ask especially now that I’ve graduated as of May this year with my associates. The reason I’m doing part time work in retail is because 1. I have no idea what I can do with an associates in general studies that I would be willing to work, 2. I like the things they sell already, and 3. The hours and location are good, it’s a 15 minute drive and they’re only open 11-7 and 12-6 on sundays. It’s kind of a perfect schedule for me with my fucked up sleep patterns (which is a huge part of my history of lateness). I’m also dealing with newly acquired chronic pain in the form of trigeminal neuralgia following botched wisdom teeth extractions, so I can’t work late into the night because that’s when my pain is at it’s worst and I take pain meds that I can’t drive on. But anyway, I feel like there’s really no appropriate professional references I can put down. Family isn’t allowed either and even if it was it would also not work out. I just want to leave it blank and hope for the best but I don’t know how good of an idea that is, but I also don’t see another alternative so what do I do?

I'm still only a junior but all junior positions I'm finding are paying up to $20-30k less than my current salary, which would be the market rate for a junior. With rent rises and high cost of living, my current salary is enough for me to get by, and I don't spend a lot of money on materialistic things.

I interviewed for a company I absolutely love the sound of and have progressed to the next round, but it's a $20k salary decrease and it's also a salary package so it includes super. I'm trying so hard to leave my workplace, and graphic design is ridiculously competitive, and this was my first interview after close to 80 rejected applications!!

Should I be going for jobs that are market rate but pay significantly less than what I'm on currently, or on aim for similar salaries?

Sadly, supervisors seem to be involved.  They don't really have much to say.  I feel these types of 'mistakes' are caused by supervisors not knowing how to lead and do simple metric validation, and then the manager not validating the supervisors work.

I have done my research and out of 36 different areas of politics I do find all of them meaningful and I am passionate about them.

However their is only one of those areas which is an issue for me which is judging victims of crimes that I do not know or have never met and I would like to know how I can stop doing this?When I only look at the crime that has taken place and the number of victims. I am passionate and I find it meaningful to make sure that the proper punishment is given whether that is a life sentence or the death penalty.

However when I start to think about each of the victims in these situations more deeply I start to doubt myself and think that maybe some of the victims were actually bad people. Once I start to judge the victims then my passion and meaning fade away because I start to feel like I might be helping someone who I would consider a bad person.

An example of someone to me who would be a bad victim to me would be a guy who goes out to the bar with his girlfriend every week. He is delusional and paranoid anytime another guy even gets close to his girlfriend. If a guy gets close to her he intentionally instigates a fight with that person. He ends up seriously hurting multiple people at different times with the fights he starts.

15l5fj9,"Looking for a change but don't know where to go, what job should I get based on my experience?","First post here, hoping this is okay, I'd just like some advice from folks outside my bubble.

I (M30) have been working in college ministry, going on 8 years. I've loved my time in ministry but it's getting time for a change (lots of reasons, not important atm). Burner account because I'm still in the early days of thinking about a change.

I graduated college with a degree in public health and another in film, had a couple internships during school but haven't worked outside of ministry since I graduated.

In ministry, I've had a lot of different responsibilities from mentorship, counseling, advertising/marketing, content creation, writing, public speaking in sermons, leading Bible studies and group discussions, mediating conflict, planning/organizing/leading international trips, fundraising (in my organization, I have to raise my own salary via monthly financial commitments), limited photography and video creation, etc.

Currently, I'm directing a ministry reaching about 40 students after rebuilding it from the covid years.

I'm pretty useless at anything related to math or coding.

 I'm not really sure where to go next. I'd love a job that felt meaningful, but I'm open to something more practical for a while. My job is pretty high-stress and requires a lot of long hours. I don't really know what I'd be qualified for. I'm open to any advice y'all have!

I hate this field.  I burnt out 3 years ago.  I stayed for the security, benefits, and because I didn't know what else to do.  

I'm hitting a point where I really don't give a shit anymore and I hate showing up there.  Between my home and work life, I'm very unhappy and I have been for a long time.  

I'm starting my master's degree in accounting.  I want to be an accountant, eventually to get my CPA.  The masters is 5 semesters long.  

I must stay at my job through November because when I make 5 years, they match my retirement savings 50% if I roll it into a new plan or refund it.  If I refund it I'd get about $30,000 USD, which I'm heavily considering.  

I know this isn't a bad job, but I'm reaching a point where I can't do it anymore.  I hate this job.  

There are a bunch of entry level accounting jobs around me and in the next town.  Accounts payable/receivable clerks, jobs like that which require no degree.  I'm considering getting into a job like this while I finish my accounting degree, then I'll move up to another accounting job which requires a degree.  

I was going to wait until I was further along in my masters in accounting before looking for jobs, but I can't wait any longer.  I just can't.  

Would I be okay doing this?  Do you think I should wait?

15l4d5w,Denied internal role—hiring manager followed up?,"Hi All,

I feel so silly writing this but I have been trying to decode this email for HOURS! 

I spent the last three months interviewing for an internal role at my company. I’m currently in a post-grad “pipeline” position that often leads to people working on different teams. 

I was super excited to work for this specific team and had an amazing interview process. Truthfully, the final interview I had with who would have been my manager, was the best interview I have ever had. 

I found out Friday I did not get the role through my HR Team. It was instead offered to a candidate with 3+ years experience and a Masters degree…which makes sense considering I don’t even quite have a year yet! 

The senior management who would have been my direct report emailed me today with essentially the following: 
“Hi X,
I heard you found out about the decision the team took. I want to make sure you know you were a very competitive candidate, and I thoroughly enjoyed meeting you. If you have any questions about how the decision was made, I’m happy to answer them. Please keep up your search for your next role. I’m confident you’ll find it.” 

I followed up and thanked them, as well. I let them know that while disappointed, I’m still happy they found someone so awesome for this role! That I don’t need any sort of explanation, but I’m happy for any feedback so I can grow and improve for next time. I re-expressed my interest in this specific team and offered my help on a project-basis if ever needed (pretty common in my role).

I feel a little silly, especially if their email wasn’t intended as a way to keep in touch, but more so as a “sorry, try a different team!”

15l3itw,How do I build my new position from the ground up?,"Hello! 

Today was my first day as the Environmental Horticulturalist at a University. This is a brand new position at my University, and after today I’m realizing that my superiors really don’t have any input or guidance for where to go from here. For example I expected this week to be filled with onboarding tasks and meetings with relevant employees… but outside of the barest onboarding tasks absolutely nothing has been scheduled for me, and I’m supposed to just… get to work?

I do have a job description that I can use to set goals and desired outcomes, and my job description really centers around getting a couple of sustainability based certifications for the University. So there’s a somewhat abstract direction I’m supposed to go from here. But I’m kind of at a loss for what to do in this face of almost absolute ambiguity. Like, today was Monday, and the rest of my week is completely blank. 

How would y’all recommend that I get started building this position? I already plan on contacting other universities that have the aforementioned certifications to see what their processes were like, and also people with similar job descriptions to mine, and I’m pretty well connected in our community with professionals who do some similar work off-campus. But outside of that - how do I build a workflow for day-to-day operations? How do I convince administration that this was a worthy position to fund? How have y’all built up a position when you’re given free reign and no guidance?

15l36zi,Need advice.,"I'm in my mid-thirties and I have been running my own wedding photography business for the last 8 years. At first it was so exciting, got to travel the world, felt successful, and overall loved my job. But I noticed a few years in I was definitely starting to feel the burnout. After the pandemic, like most freelancers and entrepreneurs, I was thrown into a tumultuous time of uncertainty and financial hardship.

While the last two years have been much better in terms of consistent work I can't deny any longer that my heart is just not in it like it used to be. I've also suffered health issues that make stamina on a wedding day difficult and I've been having near constant neck and back pain from hauling my gear around. Not to mention with the hotter summer days I really do not want to be working 8 hours completely outside on 106F degree days (it has happened before). I am so burnt out and the amount that I work just isn't matching the income I take home after expenses, health insurance, taxes, etc. Basically, I'm severely unhappy with my line of work these days and to make matters even worse, I'm poor in spite of the long hours.

So here's where I am now. I drastically cut back the amount of weddings I booked this year and once the season is done I would like to move into a new field and do a complete career overhaul and get a new job. The problem being... I've been working for myself and operating this business for 8 years, I've been out of the loop in terms of a ""regular job"" and I'm at a complete loss at what to look for or even what I'm qualified for. I'm suffering feelings of major imposter syndrome as I try to figure out my next steps. I just know I can't keep living like this and I desperately need a feeling of stability and not worrying where/when my next paycheck is coming from. Some health insurance and benefits would be damn great too.

More of my background: I have a BA in Psychology, have been a photographer 16 years, operated every aspect of my business from: social media management, copywriting, branding, website design, customer relations, photo editing, etc. I just completed the Google Project Management Certification course because I felt like maybe I needed to add something else to my resume for padding?

I have been at my current job for a little less than a year and a half and really enjoy where I'm at. The people I work with are great, my field feels fufilling and my position is fully remote. This is also my first job right out of college and I feel very lucky to have it.

Once in a while I'll scroll through job postings on LinkedIn and today I've come across a couple posts that I believe I fit with my current experience. I feel conflicted because some of my family are telling me to stick in my current position for maybe another year or so before applying to different jobs so that I can keep consistent experience and continue learning and growing in my current company.

Apart of me also wants to apply to these job postings because the pay jump from what I'm currently receiving is at least 20k more. Additionally, I'm worried that I won't have the same opportunity with these specific companies that have peeked my interest in a year.

I still live at home with my parents and don't pay them much in rent, but I do pay my own car insurance, phone bill and any other expenses that are mine.

15l2w91,Leaving Defense Contracting…?,"Leaving Cleared Government Work ?

Hi everyone - 

Im not in a terrible position but I’m currently in a bit of a confused place with my career and I would really appreciate some outside perspective. I’ve been working for the government as a defense contractor since roughly 2016, I was military prior to that. 

I’m a Systems Engineer and I’m currently in the space industry of the federal government. I feel like positions really only want to hire me for my clearance and not necessarily the skills I’ve accumulated throughout the years. I’ve found this to be quite frustrating and I’m desperately trying to leave government work to go to a remote position at a commercial company as a Systems Engineer. I’ve applied to at least 300 positions these past few months, have scored a few interviews with startups and one interview with a large company but there really isn’t anything out there matching what I’m looking for (remote, uncleared) 

I no longer want to work in a SCIF, I want nothing to do with cleared work anymore. It’s slow work, painful. I question how people do this for 20+ years. 

1)Are System Engineers even in demand in the commercial/private sector? 
2)Is scoring a remote position like this even possible?
3) What would you do? Am I approaching this the wrong way? Is there something I’m missing? 

I’m not currently a developer, I’d prefer not to become one but I’m not ruling it out. I have a masters degree and a pretty solid resume. Regardless, I’m getting countless rejection letters and it’s a terrible feeling, also motivating. I’m contemplating on doing a full career change for what it’s worth. I don’t have a preference as to whether or not I remain in the space industry.

After being in the industry for three full years and having been a part of a handful of projects, I’m starting to realize that construction is not a huge passion of mine, particularly the hours and volume of responsibility. Does anyone on here have a success story of starting on this same path and transitioning to a different career/field? Ideally I want a job that is less hours and honestly less stress, and ideally without a pay cut.

I initially chose to go into construction because it seemed cool. I still enjoy seeing the tangible progress of a building going up. Through various internships the type of work was a nice juxtaposition to the endless calculations, numbers, and computer screens of engineering school. But now, the hours suck, especially being salaried. The low bid model that the whole industry uses discourages any sort of quality both on my end and that of the  subcontractors I manage. Now, I feel like I’m swinging toward the opposite end of the pendulum and I feel like I want to do something more technical.

I have a bachelors in Civil Engineering and a masters in Engineering Management.

15l09fd,I’ve been working as a chef/cook for 6 years. Should I go back to school?,"I’m a 26 year old male currently working as a private chef in a large city in the Southwest. I started cooking professionally when I was 20 and have worked at a variety of different restaurants.

For the last year, I’ve been working as a private chef through a small catering business and I am making more than I ever did working in restaurants. Right now I make about 50k/year. I enjoy my work most of the time and I think I’m pretty good at it, but I am concerned that there isn’t much growth potential and I will burn out if I keep cooking for another 5 or 10 years. 

Before I was a cook, I was enrolled in a highly regarded public university in the Midwest and I actually completely around 90 credits towards a biology degree. My first two years in college, I really excelled and thought I was on a good path but then I ran into some mental health problems that eventually led me to withdraw from school. 

In school, I was always good at math and science and had hopes of going to medical school but later realized that that path wasn’t for me. As I look back now, I may have been better suited studying data science, engineering, or even finance/accounting based on my math skills and interests.

So here I am as private chef with 6 years cooking experience and 90 college credits not knowing what my next move should be. 

Should I go back to school and finish my B.S. in biology? What jobs would that qualify me for? Grad school?

Or go back and change my major to something else entirely?

What is a good career/job in a growing industry that I may not have even considered?

Should I explore a career in the trades?

If you were in my position what would you do?

Honestly, it was exhausting and extremely repetitive (I got the whats a setback you faced question in almost every interview). Anyways, I got an email today saying that I didn’t move forward because they felt that I wasn’t enthusiastic enough. To be fair, I wasn’t super enthusiastic about the position because it is a very extrovert-oriented role but I’ve done the exact role before (sales). But I was genuinely interested in the company so I tried my best to fake it and have confidence, but I think they also were dissapointed in my lack of enthusiasm in general not just specifically towards this position. I’ve gotten this feedback a lot both in my personal and professional relationships that I just “don’t seem excited” about many things—but I don’t think that’s the case, I think I just don’t express my excitement in the same way as others and I also just tend to be more awkward. I understand why this position didn’t work out, but I’m now scared I’m still not going to be able to express my enthusiasm when applying to other positions that I am much more interested in because of my demeanor.

15ky0p6,I don't know what to do.,"Hello everyone hope you are all well.

I recently graduated university with a Degree in Interactive Design. My passion is game making.

A year ago I participated in a 4 week Game Design workshop and won a 35% scholarship to study game design in Canada. Going to study in Canada has been my goal for my entire university education and it felt very surreal to earn it. I decided to leave for Canada in January of 2024.
 In the meantime I had to finish my education and find a job to earn experience.

Couple months go by and I finish University and I've been applying for work as a game designer Jr. but as it is expected, no one wants to hire without experience. It's even worse give that in my country the gaming industry is in diapers. 

I was feeling frustrated because I felt like my time was running out to find a job before I left when suddenly I found a QA game tester job. 

I applied and I got it.

For the past 3 months I've been working in this company and I love it. This company just arrived in my country and when I started the branch was only 2 weeks old. 

From the start our project manager informed us that promotions were inbound since the industry us so new here there isn't talent to hire. 

I took this as an opportunity to grow out of my comfort zone and work as hard as I can. It it has been paying off.

My lead has told me that he recommended me to my manager for a senior QA tester position and I will happily take it...

Thing is, I am now torn between staying and getting more experience in the industry or just going. I will lose my scholarship and im not sure if I can earn another one. I also don't want to throw away this opportunity, 4 months to become senior tester and who knows maybe even higher according to our manager.

I've talked to my family about this and they all tell me I should stay and earn the experience but a part of me is worried that leaving my country is going to be really difficult in the future without a scholarship. The original idea was to study game design and apply for work while I'm there...

How likely is that to happen and do I have a better shot with experience in the industry?

Sorry if it doesn't make much sense I have a lot on my mind and I just want to know what is objectively my best course of action...I am 23M

15kx9ni,Switching careers from geology to data science,"Hi, I'm really interested in changing careers to data science or data analytics and I'm curious if anyone has a recommendation for the best way to get there. My degree is a Geology B.S., and I've worked as a Hydrologist for about 10 years for a government research agency. Over the past 5 years or so, I've become a lot more involved in data and databases more than actual science. I spend much of my time writing code in R, doing R package development, working on database/ API integrations, writing simple web apps and making visualizations in Tableau. I even teach an Introduction to R course in my organization. I really enjoy this work and I'd like to do more of it. I have some pretty good work experience that could help me pivot careers. However, I think my Geology degree and Hydrologist title are off-putting when applying to data-based jobs. I've been thinking about getting some kind of certificate or education or boot camp, most importantly to fill in blind spots in my own knowledge, but also to show potential recruiters that I'm serious and knowledgeable.

So I'm wondering if anyone has recommendations about how best to make this shift? My local community college is very affordable and has associate degrees and undergraduate certificates in computer science or data analytics. The college I went to would be much more expensive but offers graduate degrees and certificates along the same lines. I know there are also many online offerings that are more affordable and flexible but don't feel as legit.

15kx63p,Struggling with rolling up to a new hire,"Some context - I'm at a company for a year now. I was reporting to a C-level even though i never had any feedback from her throughout the year.
Throughout this year i managed to create a good relationship with most of my peers, but not with all of the stakeholders on my line of work, namely Sales.
I'm a hard working professional, i brought a lot of new processes to the team and overall i think of myself as a high performing professional. I'm now managing a team of 4, since first joining in July last year.

Last week i was told i was going to report to a new hire with a Director role (the previous one was fired because of the bad relationship with the same stakeholders i'm struggling with).
The reason given was that my team needed the new hire's help to get aligned with said stakeholders.

This caught me completely off guard. I was actually going to ask for a promotion as i was thinking of all that i've done for the company since i got here. How many projects i lead. How i built a team. How i worked late at night...
I did get credit for all of this and i did get some very positive feedback on my last year with the company, after the announcement.

Now it feels like i'm being demoted. It feels like i wasn't good at something. And most of all, it feels like i will never roll up to a C-level, which was something that i thouroughly enjoyed, because of how much i was learning at that level.

Almost everyone that rolls up to the same C-level that i do do not perform as good as i do, in my opinion. So it will be strange because of that as well.

15kwj6m,"High flyer - shot myself down, how to back out without to much attention?","I've mistakenly signed up for a course at work needing an enhanced background check that I know I'll fail.

Sorry for length but I really need advice: 

So for some background I had a troubled few years as a teenager ending up in a few terrible police charges. Serious assaults with bad injuries involved and the like. I joined the military, turned my life around and got into consulting and business years later. I've not been in trouble bar a speeding ticket for just under 15 years. I also left school very young and this was just a horrible period in my life. I regret so much of it I can't begin to describe it. 

Fast forward to today and I'm a family man, I've been with my current company for between a year and a year and a half. Doing very well, great company, world renowned as being industry leaders in their field. I'm learning every day, it's fun, exciting and I've been told my potential is excellent. Promotion to management this year, skies the limit, real help with career planning etc. I actually love my job. Financial services IB for anyone interested.

I was asked to be a mentor and signed up to the course. Because most people on the mentor side are relatively senior, my boss had to vouch for me to get a place, which there was no problem with because of my good conduct and excellent performance this year.

Anyway so I find out it's not for new junior starts but teenagers doing internships and transitioning into the role over a number of years. Due to this it requires an enhanced background check over and above the basic one you do when you get onboarded.

I did not lie during onboarding and disclosed everything I needed to legally. No problems. But if this enhanced check comes back with my past I am simply fucked to put it lightly. The trust I've gained will be gone and everything I've worked for all these years will evaporate. I'll probably be fired. Even if I am not, HR will likely just say I can't do the course and it'll leave everyone thinking I'm some kind of pervert or something.

Now, when I realised this I tried to back out of the scheme. I spoke with my manager and gave a generic ""I didn't quite realise the time commitment required and I'm just not sure I can pick this up right now."" Type speech. However, my manager being the greatest manager ever; was very supportive and took the approach of "" don't worry this will be good for your career we will make it work, find out the time they need and I'll make sure you have it free.""  

So I did find out and I tried to frame it like it was a big requirement / commitment. Thing is this ' I'm to busy' excuse is bad for two reasons:
1. I've spent the last 18 months taking on as much as possible to prove I can handle any workload which I can so far. So this doesn't seem believable to anyone.
2. It means they may reconsider my promotion if I really push it.. 'if he's too busy for this how can he pick up this extra scope?'

I tried to voice my time commitment concern today in a last ditch attempt to get out of the course, but my manager brushed it off explaining they'll support me and we can make it work. 

I can't come up with a new excuse now that doesn't seem like I'm just making stuff up to get out of it, which will lead to them asking why. I don't think I can come clean without my manager's view of me being tarnished and then having to potentially report it to the company. 

My boss and job are awesome and I really just want to keep working and leave the past in the past.

What do I do? Please help me.",Low_Mango5568,0,0.5,1,1691441154,2023-08-07 20:45:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15kwj6m/high_flyer_shot_myself_down_how_to_back_out/,8,2023

15ktpxb,Self Respect,"Self respect is something we all want, yet it can be hard to achieve. It’s an essential part of our identity and happiness that enables us to feel confident in ourselves and content with life. But what exactly is self-respect? And how do you go about cultivating it? In this article, we will explore the meaning of self-respect and offer tips on ways to boost your own sense of self-worth.  
  
At its core, self-respect is a recognition and appreciation for oneself; understanding one’s strengths as well as weaknesses, being honest with yourself, taking responsibility for your actions and living up to your values and beliefs – no matter what society or other people expect from you. Self-respect helps us make decisions in alignment with our personal needs and goals rather than those imposed by external forces or expectations. When we practice self-respect, not only are we more likely to reach our full potential but also become better equipped to handle challenges that come our way.  
  
Cultivating self-respect can take time and effort however there are many simple steps that can help us get started on the path toward increased inner confidence. We invite you to read on for advice on building healthy levels of self-esteem through developing positive habits such as practising gratitude, setting realistic expectations for ourselves, and treating ourselves kindly.

15ksffi,Thinking about my next step - please leave your 2cents,"Hi! It might be a somewhat peculiar choice to write a post in this sub, but I'm genuinely curious about your opinions.  
Here's some background to set the stage for my query:  
I'm a 25-year-old Italian. Last September, I made my first move abroad, settling in a city in Galicia, Spain. While there, I tried to launch two projects alongside a friend/partner and have been working as a waiter on the side. One of these projects is still ongoing, but it doesn't sustain my living expenses.  
Over the years, I've primarily worked in sales: I began as a supermarket clerk, then transitioned to an insurance consultant role, and later worked as a sales hunter for a prominent IT company in Italy (which I consider my most significant professional experience). I also briefly joined a startup, where, despite being a complete newbie, I dabbled in strategy, evangelism, market research, customer relations, and numerous pitch attempts. I also worked as an assistant to a greengrocer and had a lot of fun. Here, I believe I understood the kind of professional I want to be: precise, sincere, informed, and polite.  
I also have a strong passion for working on projects, i feel good when i do that. I think i’m not so bad at ideation, crafting narratives, and rallying people behind projects. While part of me thrives on such ventures, I currently feel a bit overwhelmed thinking about starting something anew.  
Now, I'm contemplating my next move.  
I aim to find a job where I can hone my skills, especially in sales. I try to approach life with an entrepreneurial mindset, and now I am inclined to believe that joining an existing company and dedicating my efforts there might be the right step for now.  
So, I'm on the hunt for a compelling product to champion or at least a dynamic company with a clear mission and a strong team to learn from and commit myself to.  
My choice of the next city will largely depend on the job opportunities that present themselves.  
I sometimes wonder if I'm casting my net wide enough during my job search. For instance, when considering industries or sectors, I'm often at a loss.

15ks1h7,"Interviewed for internal position, they chose someone else, but silence from hiring team.","Just trying to gauge if I'm right to feel insulted and figure out how to proceed. I've interviewed internally at another place and while there was similar office politics involved, they at least called me to tell me they were not choosing me.  
  
The Monday before last, I interviewed for the position. I was told they should reach their decision by the end of the week, but not to be alarmed if it took a bit longer. With that being said, I didn't think too much as last week progressed without a response, but then Thursday I heard the first ""rumor"" from my direct supervisor. I think when she realized I hadn't been given a response, she backtracked that it wasn't official, so I decided I would see if I got a response Friday then reach out Monday if not.  
  
On Friday, we had a lull around lunch time from some colleagues going out, and my other boss took the chance to bring up the position and say that he assumed I would be staying in his office. I told him I hadn't been given a decision, and that's when he told me his assumption was based on seeing the other role's desk being moved to its new area with a nameplate that wasn't mine. At the end of the day I finally decided to check the directory, thinking there was no way they took the time to update that but not send me an automated rejection email. Sure enough, the version was dated Thursday with the name my boss mentioned in the slot for that position.  
  
I'm especially irritated because my boss's boss, ""X"" approached me to encourage me to apply, and the way they did so caused issues for me in my current role (as you can see my bosses knew I applied because discreetness was disregarded from the very start). Knowing that the position is vacant due to the predecessor facing sexual harassment and a subsequently hostile work environment after attempting to report it, I was not thrilled for this opportunity but still kept an open mind and interviewed in good faith, trying to focus on the positive side of being approached for a promotion. If I hadn't been approached, I likely would not have applied, so my disappointment truly isn't about the position itself.  
  
Since it was impossible to keep the ordeal private as I would have preferred, I have been fielding interpersonal issues about it from the moment I showed interest. People now think I am insincere in my disdain for the harasser and betraying the predecessor, and my bosses are questioning my loyalty to the point of wondering if it's worth it to continue training me/getting me access to systems I need to fully execute processes I'm responsible for (well, now that they know I didn't get the position they are happy I am staying). When I arrived early for my interview, which was down the hall from my current office, I was greeted with my current boss sitting with his bosses and forced to take the one open seat while I waited to be let in by the HR manager who could see this all going down. It really put me in a great headspace for the interview--which started 5 mins late--to dodge half-jokes from my boss about leaving him and joining the dark side, and to have the hiring team see my flustered responses to him about how I do like my current role. Before that point I had no idea that boss knew I applied, and I was keeping it quiet on purpose because I worried about such tactlessness interfering with my chances.  
  
I have interviewed here enough to know that they do typically send automated (or at least canned) rejection emails. In that email they also let you know if they put you on the list to be considered for other positions, and this list was mentioned in my recent interview. While I can plainly see their decision now, I would at least like to hear something officially and to know if I'm on the list. I'm just not sure if it's best to let this go and pretend it never happened as they seem to be doing, or if I should follow up and get it on the record that I never got a response.  
  
TL;DR: I was encouraged to apply for an internal position that would have been a promotion, but the hiring team never reached out to give me a decision and let me find out through the grapevine that someone else was chosen. I found out when other people came to me assuming I turned it down. Not sure if I should follow up at this point or how to proceed, feels like I was just a pawn in some office politics.",No_Advertising5369,1,1.0,0,1691431263,2023-08-07 18:01:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15ks1h7/interviewed_for_internal_position_they_chose/,8,2023

15krjw3,Manager in Different Department Smearing Me,"I've been at my company for 7 years, aside from some brief time as a contractor this was my first job after college. In my time here I've gotten several promotions and generally good reviews from my coworkers. Currently, I am the sole person responsible for the oversight of a qualification activity necessary for launching new projects. This process was well-established for years (even before I started) and there are copious work instructions concerning it.

Recently the company has not been doing well, and in an attempt to resolve the issue they actually made the situation more dire. As a result, timelines have shrunk and my activity typically takes a while (there are a lot of approvals and we need a lot of paperwork). I've been following the established policy, but have recently run afoul of the manager for the department that submits said documents and samples.

I've been told by multiple people (including my boss and his boss) that this manager has said I'm hard to work with and am the reason this process takes a long time. She's scheduled meetings with my boss whenever I've reached out to request required documents from her department and claim I'm being rude. She has never said it to me directly, but she has implied that this process is ""broken"" to people very very high above me and said I am not working with them to fix it.

I met with my boss and his boss to talk about this, but they told me there really wasn't much to be done about it and trust that they would defend me. They've said I'm doing everything right and that they're defending me. When I've asked if we could meet with the other manager to talk through the process and the inefficiencies she's concerned about they discouraged the idea, saying that she is just trying to throw me under the bus and doesn't have any actual critiques.

Is there more I can do? Would my previously good reputation act as a shield against some of this? Should I just find a new job? I was on track for a promotion, but I fear this will derail it.",No_Establishment1649,1,1.0,8,1691430179,2023-08-07 17:42:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15krjw3/manager_in_different_department_smearing_me/,8,2023
15kr3y7,How to figure out what you want to do when aimless and losing hope?,"I am 30. I live in Japan. I have been here for 9 years. I have anxiety and depression. I'm in therapy, but it's not doing anything.  
Some other relevant info (TLDR at the bottom) :  
I quit my job recently and have half-heartedly been looking for a new one. My resume is spotty by Japanese standards and has been cited as the reason why regular (as opposed to ""black"" or unethical) companies won't hire me. This last job was supposed to be the filler that would help me fix my resume until continued abuse from my boss forced me to quit. On my visa, I can't work part time or just get a job in retail or food service. There are no legal work restrictions (aside from the obvious) if I move back to my home country, but I wouldn't be able to survive on anything close to minimum wage. I don't know anybody there anyway.  
I considered going to grad school, but I don't know what to study. I don't have any interests or passions. I've grown to hate the work I've done up until now and I don't have very much to show for it anyway. If I went to school in Japan, I would need to find work between now and then anyway, as the school year starts in April. I can't afford to study in my home country without going into debt.  
I've considered trying to start my own company, but I would need about $40,000 in capital to qualify for the visa here, which I do not have. More importantly, I'm not interested in anything, so I don't know what I would do.  
I don't have any hobbies. I don't have any dependents. I have to work to stay alive, but I don't really want to.  
**TLDR and question -** I have a shoddy resume, no interests or hobbies, very few skills and no portfolio, a history of ending up at abusive companies, no connections in my home country, inability to work part time/simple service jobs, and essentially no reason to work anyway.  
Regardless of whether I stay in Japan or go back to my home country, I will still need to figure out what to do. But being this aimless is making it impossible to look for work or education possibilities in any productive way. When your requirements are ""Pays a living wage and isn't abusive,"" everything looks pretty much the same.  
How do I go about either 1) making the job search more intentional and less ""doom scroll""-like, or 2) narrow down potential interests for study?

Thank you in advance.

15kpx4j,Seeking Career Change Advice - Mid 20's,"Hey all. I've honestly been having a tough time figuring out what I want to do with my life professionally. For the past 4 years, I've been working in account management for a business bank, and most recently as a key account executive for a healthcare firm. In that time, my soft skills have developed considerably and in smaller group settings, I find it very easy to connect with people both personally and professionally. 

As of the past few months, I've been having some serious doubts about what I'm working toward. Not only did my department go through a reorg, but they casually ""enhanced"" our compensation structure, which coincidentally cut my OTE by \~**15%**. Not cool... On top of this, as I've settled into my role, I realize my career growth is going to be extremely slow (4+ years between promotions early on). 

I've always been drawn toward something slightly more technical or ""big picture"", i.e. Product, Project Management, or even Cyber. I have some experience as a stand-in PMO, but I can't decide where I want to go professionally. My priorities in order are to ***find a career path where growth/experience is prioritized, I can make good money (six figures - I live in a large city on the west coast, and I'm mobile), and where I enjoy the challenges of the work I do.*** 

I'm posting about this with an open mind and I'm happy to hear feedback. I know I'm still young and have a lot to learn, but I also know that finding the right path early on can have a significant impact on the rest of my life. Honestly, I don't have a passion for what I've been doing and I'm looking for somewhere to grow.

15kpq7w,Am I screwing myself by not going directly into my desired career?,"I graduated in December in Industrial Engineering. I’m not sold on what I want to do yet, so I’ve kind of been in limbo for a while. 

In college I had a internship that lasted 2 years and they verbally offered me a job that went from Engineering>Technician>No job. They couldn’t hire me due to budget and need (wanted to hire now, I still had 2 months of school left). My plan was to use that job as a bounce off point and go from there like my brother, who went from them to Boeing.

So I got screwed and became heavily unmotivated. I’d apply to a few jobs but never got anything because not many jobs were “industrial engineering” and were more broad. I got imposter syndrome and dicked around instead of applying. I worked part time with my girlfriend for a few months until April when I got hired on at a chemical plant as a timekeeper. 

This job has me doing a lot more than just timekeeping and I consider it good experience. I relabeled the role as Superintendents Assistant since thats more or less what I am. I do payroll, budget estimates and maintaining, quotes, and help search through databases for work orders. They hired me under the assumption I’d find a job, but verbally offered a position after the job finishes. 

The higherups keep hinting at a role in either purchasing or estimating. I wouldn’t mind doing this but I’m not sure if I’ll get stuck in non-engineering jobs. I really would like design or data analysis jobs but I’m not sure if the experience I’m getting is valid for those roles.

15kpodp,Would there be any legal problem or penalty if I inform current company I will quit within a week?,"I received an email from a recruiter that the company I applied for a position as data scientist chose to hire me this morning, and so I replied the recruiter back with the required information of mine to process for the next step.

15kpff1,Level 2 Network Tech suggestion for career next steps with focus on automation,"Hi All,

First time posting here but long time reader.  
I do not really know what I am expecting to get from this post but my ideas now are quite confused  and other prospective or experiences could be very helpful to clear up ideas.  
I am sorry if I sound unclear but that's my mind's state now.

TLDR: I'm have been proposed to advance in my tech career after 5 year as a Network Specialist (level 2 tech), I would like to focus on scripting day to day task as I am doing recently but do not know how to position myself as it could collide with other departments and also scripting day to day tasks is still not popular in this company.

I do work in a company that work in many aspect of IT, from selling/renting hardware to Helpdesk and including MSP for Servers/Infrastructure and Networking.  
This is my first job and I have been working here for 5 years as a Network Specialist (could be interpreted as a level 2 tech), the Managed Services department manager and my Team Leader recently told me that it's time for me to make some step forward in my career but they want me to propose where in the company and how.  
The ""obvious"" step would be to go in what is called ""Competence Center"" that department is composed similarly to the MSP department but do not work on support and maintenance but rather projects like migrations, new installations and also on-boarding customers to the MSP.  
In the past year or so I got a lot into scripting with API and such to simplify or automating day to day task that us in the MSP do, we do have a department which is dedicated to that (along other things like implementing monitoring and internal CMDB) but they do focus only on activity that are required for many customers and are quite common (Server patching for example) and quire rarely on day to day tasks.

My initial idea would be to ""create"" a new role for me that will only focus on automating these day to day tasks and help out my MSP colleague but I am quite worried that this will create internal issues as the other department should be doing that but is only focusing on bigger tasks, also automation for small tasks is not yet very popular in this company and I am worried that the idea could not be liked by my managers.

The safest bet could be to move to the Competence Center as the natural technical progression  while trying to keep scripting for the day to day tasks but I am worried that not doing the day to day tasks anymore will make me the scripting part much harder.

Has someone had a similar experience? What have you done?  
From your experience do you believe that automation on the day by day tasks is important or that should be reserved for larger tasks only?

Sorry again if this sound unclear but I am quite confused too and honestly were not expecting this situation coming up.  
Also my company uses a lot of made up names and roles and so it's quite difficult to relate to other situations and companies.

Many thanks to everyone who will spend some minutes of their time replying to this post,

15klgve,How long do I wait?,"At the beginning of July my manager told me that he'd work on getting me a promotion (out of cycle, we usually do performance reviews after the New Year) but I haven't heard anything from him since.

His motivation was partially due to a restructure we have coming up which means he may not be my manager for the next review cycle, so he wanted to reward my good work before that option was taken away.

He has gone on two different week long vacations, so he's only had 2-3 weeks in the office since he told me he'd work on it.

15kl5nk,Career Advice for Senior Management Level/Experienced Folks,"I hope to engage in a constructive discussion with this community, and I kindly request that we maintain a respectful tone throughout our conversation. While I acknowledge the privileges of my current position in the American job market, I find myself at a crossroads regarding my career growth within my current job.  
  
Over the past two years, I have been working diligently in my role as a principal consultant, earning a salary of $200,000+. Despite receiving commendable feedback from the client on my performance, I have not been promoted like my colleagues. Instead, I am functioning as an individual contributor, without any leadership responsibilities. The business partner leading this initiative has explicitly stated their preference for their firm to occupy the leadership positions, a stance I find disheartening considering other partner firms have been granted such opportunities.  
  
I cannot overlook the fact that my compensation is significantly higher than my teammates, nearly $60,000 more on average. However, this financial advantage does not mitigate my feeling of underutilization and a lack of appropriate recognition or advancement opportunities. Additionally, my initial compensation package placed me higher than two levels above my current position, which adds further complexity to the situation.  
  
Furthermore, I raised the question of incentives for contributing to the award fees, only to be informed that such practices are not followed within the company. I expressed my belief that such an approach may hinder motivation and fail to reward high performers adequately, but it appears this perspective was not embraced.  
  
At one point, there was a request for me to generate more business, to which I responded positively but suggested a commission-based structure for such efforts. However, the proposal was not accepted, and the matter was dropped.  
  
I am now grappling with the realization that my potential might not be maximized, and there could be discrepancies in the recognition and compensation systems. I am seeking guidance from this esteemed community on how to navigate this situation and explore avenues for career growth in a fair and fulfilling manner.

15kl3a4,Undertaking to start at a later date?,"Hi Reddit, first time using this forum so hopefully my question is correctly placed! 

A prospective employer has asked whether I would consider an undertaking to state my intent to accept a (potential) new job contract from next year.

For context I'm not in a position to leave my current job yet as I'm part way through a house purchase, and a change of employment details before funds are released would require our lender to revise their offer. Obviously given the sh*itshow that is mortgage rates at the moment, I simply can't afford to lose the rate we were offered 9 weeks ago.

We're close to completing likely in the next 3 weeks but for my own personal mental wellbeing it would be too disruptive to start a new position this side of 2023. I want some settling in time moving to a new area of the UK but also to feel comfortable enough in taking a new role at the start of a 25 year commitment. The prospective employer is appreciatively understanding of this.

However as a sign of good faith they'd potentially ask me to undertake my intent to start later, as the title suggests. From my point of view this only seeks to serve the employer and has little benefit to me from what I can initially think.

It's not been said whether they'll get me to sign something formal but my assumption is they would. (Otherwise what's the point I guess?). 

What are the pros and cons of something like this? 
Is it legally enforceable if I change my mind later?",TheGenericSurveyor,1,1.0,0,1691415695,2023-08-07 13:41:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15kl3a4/undertaking_to_start_at_a_later_date/,8,2023
15kkmd3,How to handle personal/professional identity crisis?,"As the title states, I feel that I am experiencing a personal/professional identity crisis. I am not sure whether I should continue my current career path, or change course. I’ve boiled my thoughts down into a few options below, and hoping to hear from anyone who has been in a similar dilemma. Apologies for the long post; if there’s a better sub for this please let me know.
 
Background info:
30M, Manager at a F500 company in USA, 6 years on the job, TC ~$100K. Corporate strategy/business manager type role.
 
Pros of the job: I love the product I work with. The company is prestigious. Good mix of left and right-sided brainwork. I like my coworkers. OK work/life balance.
 
Cons: unstable industry. Company is slow to promote. compensation is inadequate for a VHCOL area. The glamor of the job is wearing off and I am finding the work less and less meaningful as time goes on.
 
My 5 year goal: have a job that aligns with my interests and skill set with a salary of $250K/yr.
 
Three options I am considering: A) Get an MBA, become a management consultant. B) go to law school, become a lawyer. C) keep chugging along in my current career.
 
A)    Consultant path: It is not uncommon for people in my role/industry to get an MBA and work in consulting or IB, and then some move back to the industry side in executive roles. I love the idea of consulting. I love the problem-solving aspect, and I really do not mind making powerpoints and excel models; that is mainly what I do already. However, while studying for the GMAT, I realized my quant skills are poor. REALLY poor. So much so, that I question whether I have what it takes to be competitive in an MBA program or a post-MBA job. In addition, I have spoken with many folks in IB and consulting about their jobs, and I am worried about a personality mismatch. Outside of work, I am a highly creative type (was a professional musician from ages 14-21) with unusual passions for linguistics, ornithology, food and wine (I have certifications for both). I’m not sure whether these are detriments to my profile or make me unique.


B)    Lawyer path: My family has been asking me to consider a career in law, which more closely aligns with my university degree and my interests/innate skill set but has nothing to do with my last 6 years professionally. The thought of going through school for 3 years with no income is also extremely daunting if I were to pursue a law school full time. However, my instincts tell me that I would enjoy it, and might even be good at it.


C)    Current path: keep chugging along. I’m pretty good at my job, but I am worried about the quant issue. More senior positions in my organization are more quant/finance focused. However, if all goes well, I could expect to be making 250K in ~10 years. As I mentioned earlier, my interest in the type of work is slowly waning, which could make my job eventually unbearable. 

As a side note, I am the only person among my family and close friends who has a ‘normal’ corporate job, so I have not been able to confide in anyone who has gone through similar situations/dilemmas. I’m hoping someone might be able to give me their view on my situation, or even how to structure these questions in a better way so that the answers/options are clearer. Also, if anyone knows where to find a good professional mentor that might be able to go more in depth with me on this, please let me know!

And if you made it this far in my post, I appreciate you!!!",Affectionate_Diet_54,1,1.0,1,1691414533,2023-08-07 13:22:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15kkmd3/how_to_handle_personalprofessional_identity_crisis/,8,2023
15kkk2x,Changing to a clearly worse job for a loved one,"Hi together. I (M28) am an italian engineer currently living and working in Austria for two years. Previously I have worked for some time in Italy as a consultant for a big automotive OEM, but then I was offered a way better position in Austria for pretty much double the salary a way more interesting job in a way less stressful and toxic work environment. Things are going pretty well at work, generally speaking, I realized that the job market is extremely more advantageous for the employee in Austria / Germany compared to Italy: careers are much faster and better paid whereas in Italy you would take decades to have the same advancement which you could have here in two years. Nonetheless, I am starting to think that work is taking too much of me and that this is not the life I want: I have a girlfriend in Italy, with whom I have been now for almost six years, who is currently doing her PhD there and does not have any intention to move abroad and yes we still meet reasonably enough (I am in Italy about 1 weekend per month and she comes here about 1 weekend every two months + we spend all of our holidays together), but this is clearly not a long term solution.

15kkait,How To Communicate Clearly,"University teaches you to communicate the wrong way.  


**You are told that the best way to communicate new information is to:**  
  
\- Recount all the context (introduction)  
\- Describe the analyses that you've done (methodology)  
\- Explain the findings (results)  
\- Highlight the implications of those findings (discussion).  


This is a very bottom-up / process-oriented approach to communication. But it's the wrong way to communicate in a business context.  
  
**Why?**  


Because executives are busy, rarely care about the detail, and only care about the answer.  
  
**So start with the answer first.**  
  
When an executive asks them ""what should we do?"", they are expected to respond crisply with ""you should do X"".  
  
And then they follow with a short summary of the 3 main arguments and the data that support them.  


**So it looks something like this:**  
  
\- Start with the answer  
\- Describe argument 1 with supporting data  
\- Describe argument 2 with supporting data  
\- Describe argument 3 with supporting data

**So how's that sound?**

Clear. Authoritative. Persuasive.  
  
The implication of top-down communication is that it forces you to have already synthesized and summarized the information into one simple recommendation and three supporting arguments.",CareerScienceco,0,0.5,1,1691413744,2023-08-07 13:09:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15kkait/how_to_communicate_clearly/,8,2023

15kimog,My boss is a bully towards others but amazing towards me. What do I do?,"TL;DR: **My boss is bullying other colleagues, causing fights and drama in department and is asshole to people, but he is amazing towards me. I like him a lot but I really do not like the bullying. How do I communicate this to him? Some of the pople he bullies are my friends.**

Hello, I need a bit of advice.I have been working in this company for little over 2 years. I really like the job, I like the company, I like the pople a work with and I like my manager. However.... my manager is a real bully towards other people in the company. He is not shy to nitpick on people, especially women on meetigns with 40+ people where also high management is present, undermine their efforts, nitpick on stupid, unimportant things and in general make them look ""small"". He is often writing me or talking to me how other colleagues are really ""stupid"", how they lack expertise in their fields, how lazy they are etc. I know these people personally, I work with them on projects and none of what he says it's true. All of them are very capable, very responsible and really focused on delivering results.

I have been directly or inderctly asked by couple of people from our company and also outside of our company (!) if I am okay, and if I am happy to work with him. But I genuinely have nothing to complain about, because he behaves in complete opposite manner towards me. He encourages me, supports me, allows me to take trainings and educations, works on my carreer progress plan, negotiates my salary increase, allowed me to work from home for almost two months after a family member got really sick and needed my assistance. Yes, sometimes he can be really demanding, annoying etc. but that's normal from managers when they want you to deliver stuff and I do not take it personally. I enjoy working with him.

However, his bullying of others really bothers me. Especially because some of these people I also consider my ""work friends"". I feel bad to have an ""alliance"" with him when he is being very awfull to others and creates fights and drama inside of the department. I really want to talk to him about it, because I have a feeling he'd take my feedback, but I am not sure how to bring it up to him? I also think he is one of these people that you do not want to get on the wrong side of. So I am also being coward here.

Anyone experienced something similiar? What did you do?

Jobs I'm curious about: foley artist, interior designer, advertisement, lyricist, doula (I know this one is more medical), UI/UX (aware this is oversaturated, still might give it a go), and museum guide. 

Things I want out of a creative career: travel optional, working with people, sometimes remote but not a big deal if it isn't, no crunch time like gaming companies, paid for continuing education because I may want a bachelor's degree, and to do something that makes a difference in the world.

Things I don't want out of a career: mandatory overtime, unpaid internship, unpaid training, just criticism and hardly recognition, super fast paced, oversaturated, don't want a career that isn't meaningful or helpful in some way to society (retail is still helpful, but I'd like to do something more meaningful), and I especially don't want a career where you are undervalued yet expected to over preform.

Skills I have: soft skills, great attention to detail, quick learner, creative problems solving, creative ideas, singer/songwriter, play piano, analyzing options, decent at drawing, working on critical thinking and deep thinking.

Now, after working and traveling for 4 years I want to go ahead with a Master's Degree.
I worked as a  language teacher,  ONGs with indigenous communities, Also in Migration offices and International Refugees... I'm a certified Qigong and Meditation instructor... So options are there.


I don't know f I should go with academia and more Linguistics focused career (easy for me, hopefully get a PhD anywhere and teach at University level so I make decent money and do research about stuff that is like play to me). 
Or going into Diplomatic path. I don't know the hours here but I know there's maybe more options for earning more...

If I have a good amount of free time I can also work on the side as a Meditation and Qigong teacher (which is also fun). Build a small business etc.

The doubt here is: which path to follow?

In the first 6 months this has resulted in ~$2k in memberships that could have potentially never occurred if not for the ease of joining online.

Personally, I don't think this was a big deal and it was really easy for me because I am a bit techie and web savvy, but obviously this place didn't have it setup before for whatever reason. I don't know if this is worthwhile including on my resume... to the more technical out there, they would just scoff at basically just enabling a feature and $2k, which to some is chump change.

15kcx4c,Career change out of engineering - need advice,"I (28M) am currently working as a consultant nuclear engineer (less than 2 years experience, this is my first job). My background is fairly technical - bachelors and master's in chemical engineering and a PhD in computational chemistry. Overall quite R&D based with coding experience.

During my PhD, I was miserable because I realized that I hated solving complex math problems and coding. I lack intuition on these things. I worked hard, dealt with difficult codes and eventually did well after 3 years, publishing several papers. When I completed my PhD, I presumed that maybe I didnt hate math and coding - it could just be PhD culture of wanting to publish quick made me hate it.

After my PhD, I became consultant nuclear engineer because I wanted to give STEM another chance. I still use complex math to problem solve and build models, but the work still feels like a pain. I'm considering to resign but am conflicted because the job pays fairly well (I am UK-based). But doing a job that I don't enjoy is miserable too.

Despite my technical background, I've always loved managing, public speaking, coaching, relationship building/maintenance, proposal writing. My close friends and colleagues agree that I would do well in sales/marketing because of my friendly personality and I am good at selling ideas/products to people. I love learning about finance too. All in all, I feel like I am more of a business person than engineering.

At the moment, I'm stuck and not sure what to do next. Both money and job satisfaction are important to me.

1. Can anyone offer an advice on what to do next, or share what you've done when you were in a similar position?

2. What other career paths should I try given my technical background and interests (managing, public speaking, coaching, relationship building/maintenance, proposal writing).

15k86l1,Late job offer after company acquisition,"The company that I have worked with for the last five years sold their business to company A. At the time of the announcement I wasn't offered a position at A because they are a larger company and my role would of been redundant. Due to regulatory rules the closing of this sale was delayed by many months. I was very disappointed that I was not offered a position at A because I felt that my role was overlooked. I had ample time to job search and interviewed with there other companies. Due to retention bonuses at my current company I wasn't willing to leave befoere the closing date. So, the timing didn't work out except company Z was willing to wait 1-2 months for me to join their team. Company Z is much smaller and said that there wasn't anyone else who applied that was qualified so I basically got the job by default. I received an offer over the phone but nothing in writing yet as they wait for me to become available. I was very grateful and appreciative of this knowing that I could continue my career in the same industry without having to relocate.
Well last week less than 10 days from closing company A wanted to talk to me and offered me a job in writing the next day. Company A claimed they were barely getting by before and now need extra help. I think company A legitimately would have more work for me but I want to throw up at the thought of telling company Z something else came up while they were waiting.
 
I wouldn't have to move for either. Both know my current salary and have offered/spoken about the same compensation. Company A is a large public company. Company Z is a small private company. I've never worked for a large public company. 

I have been so stressed about the entire situation. If I had know from the beginning company A had some interest in me I never would have applied for other jobs. I was however very upset that I wasn't offered a job earlier on along with many of my other coworkers and I instead suffered mentally from feeling not good enough and having to aggressively job search and go through interviews.

15k7wej,Should I muscle myself into a job offer because of another offer?,"Is it unprofessional to let one employer know I have a job offer from another company but would rather go with them as my first choice over the other job? Which is truly the case if it comes to that.  

I’m interviewing for 2 jobs next week, a day apart from each other. Both are remote. One in the Midwest that pays a bit more and one in the East coast. I really want the East coast job because it’s more in my field of interest and the experience I want to advance my career but they are pretty slow. I applied in late June and just getting a second interview next week. I had a great first interview with the hiring manager. But my guess it’s slow because of her. She is pretty busy and HR noted they are traveling lately as well.

The Midwest job is in a rush to fill the position. If I happen to get offers from both employers my guess is I will hear from the Midwest job first and sit waiting for the east coast offer much later. 

In a worst case scenario I don’t want to ruin my chances by letting the Midwest job slip away by not giving them an answer in a reasonable amount of time and also find out I’m not getting an offer for the east coast one waiting for their answer later. 

So my question is if I get an offer from the Midwest first can I mention that to the East coast job as a way to find out an answer sooner if they want to ultimately hire me? They can also assume I’m making it up and call my bluff but wanted to know if this is a way to find out and not leave myself without accepting any offers.

I work in a niche industry making ~90k WFH (tech-adjacent). I recently turned 28 and while happy I make this, am looking towards other avenues because it doesn't provide generic 401k or education opportunities, it provides a form of education opportunities, but specific to it's industry, and since it's so niche, don't think I'll have much to go for after I'm done.

Question is, does this seem smart? I understand some ppl dont think 90k is much, and there is this whole over employed movement, I just never had this growing up and they've kept me through so many layoffs (due to economy) and treat me well (it's reciprocated by my work ethic, so I'm not being taken advantage of).

I need some guidance. My question for this page is if anyone has experienced what I have and how did you get back on your feet?

  
My career was derailed b/c of COVID-19. I work in staffing and COVID was brutal. During COVID I started drinking and that didn't help anything. I've now been bouncing around for the last year. 

  
I am literally applying as part-time bar back just to try and keep the bills paid and I feel so down on-myself. Like I don't understand how I went from being in what society calls the marquee echelon of success, to nothing.

Admittedly, I was terrible with my money. That is my fault and I accept that.

15k1tfn,Am I in the wrong? I tried handling it as best I could.,"I work as an in-house marketing coordinator for my full time job (in the automotive industry). I’m pretty much the only person in the “content” department and helped build the whole marketing strategy from scratch. I handle video editing, social media management, website updates, and the designing of print materials. The owner of the company and myself have had a fantastic relationship for the two years that I’ve been there and I have nothing against the company. But I am underpaid and there’s not many benefits as it is a small company. But it’s been a good job and an enjoyable environment so overall I’ve been happy

At the same time, there’s a whole list of reasons why the job often gets under my skin and why I’m often annoyed with the company. But hey, there’s no workplace Garden of Eden so I grin and bear it. 

At the same time, I’ve been burning the midnight oil on my own digital marketing company for a while now (obviously, the companies are in different industries so there’s no noncompete violation here). It’s grown quite a bit and has created an unsustainable work/life balance for me in the past month or so. But recently, there’s been a change with my company where it would actually make sense for me to pursue doing it full time. Or at least to try. I’m only 24 and I know if I don’t give this a shot I’d regret it for the rest of my life.

Anyway, my plan was to turn in my two weeks at my full time job and do everything the “right” way. I also wanted to offer my services to them because I really do like them and don’t want to screw them over and would enjoy the opportunity to continue working with them in some way. I was hopefully that the owner of the company would see the fact that this is an opportunity for professional development for myself and be at least somewhat okay with it. The conversation couldn’t have gone more poorly, however.

After I explained the situation and handed in my two weeks notice, the owner scoffed at me and shamed me for doing such a thing to the company. Said I was screwing him over and trying to get as much money out of him as possible with a proposal. Said I owed them way more than two weeks notice. Started asking about if I even have clients of my own then demanded to know who my clients were. After I didn’t tell him because I felt it wasn’t appropriate he made an odd threat-like statement, “if you don’t tell me, I’m going to find out.” Accused me of never being loyal to him. He verbally scoffed when I handed him my proposal and made me feel like I was quite literally the scum of the earth. Essentially his whole rant was all about how I’m hurting him and being selfish and screwing over his company and there’s no acknowledgement of the fact that I’m entrepreneurial minded and have a once in a lifetime chance to build something myself.

15k1rv3,Updated advice on how to go about applying for jobs out of state?,"Hello! I’ve seen some old posts, but I wanted to get some more current advice on how to apply to jobs out of state. Namely which is the best option:

a) Put your current city, state on applications, and include “willing to relocate by expected start date” on your resume and cover letters

b) Put the city, state you want to relocate to on your resume / applications. If you are asked when you can start, ask for a start date with enough time to move, and/or ask if possibly can start remote for the first few weeks, then relocate. 

If anyone has any other recommendations please let me know! Additionally, with the current job market, what is the recommendation of how early to start applying to jobs before your ideal start date? Right now I am considering starting 4 months beforehand.

15k1mfj,Feel ashamed about quitting a job I feel is toxic?,"I am 30F. To start off, this past year I feel like I’ve made some poor decisions.

Over a year ago I adopted a puppy but quickly realized it was way too much work and stress and rehomed her. A couple months ago I was really strapped for cash after being hit with a big tax bill, so I picked up a part time grocery store job that really really sucked, I’m overweight and standing so long really hurt my feet, the manager there was crazy and would scream and yell a ton, there was tons of theft and crime in the area and a coworker even had their car stolen while working. So I worked there a few days and then just didn’t show up for the next shift and stopped. I’ve never done that before, but I actually started a new full time job (the grocery store was my second job and I also worked full time remote, but then also got a new full time in office job and quit the remote job) the week after starting the grocery store job with no break in between my old remote and new in office job, I was so overwhelmed with two new job and working 12 days in a row, so I just didn’t show up for the grocery store which I was supposed to go to after work.

So right now I am living alone and working basically a full time CSR role in office, but I feel like this company is toxic. There are many poor reviews of this company online citing overwhelmed with work, not enough workers, toxic management, yelling in the workplace, gossip, favoritism. And I’ve seen all of that. 

I am getting paid relatively well for the title I have, 52k, but every day at work I feel like I’m going to have a panic attack because I’m so overwhelmed with the amount of work I have to do. I have many orders to process and enter, dozens of emails to reply to, account managers on my back asking me things, everything is “urgent” and everyone (customers and account managers) seems to think I should respond to them right away when I’m still like 1-2 days behind on “urgent” emails! I have like 15 different urgent things to do at once along with deadlines, reports to check, everyone at my work just says “it’s a lot”. And my one coworker is the one other person in my unit has taken 2 4 day vacations in the last month, leaving me to shoulder double the work, when even a single persons work is unreasonable. 

I also didn’t receive very good training, as my senior coworker stated I’m learning on the fly. Management I feel has yelled at me and talked really disrespectfully to me when I ask questions sometimes. Everyone is so busy and overtime is necessary, but we can only have 2 hours, and it’s not enough. I feel like I’m doing the work of two people.

Every quarter this global company sends an email listing all the people who got fired, titles no names) and why, including some crazy reasons like hiring a prostitute on a business trip and lying about it, to sending  an email to their personal address, sleeping on the job, etc. I found this odd, and felt it seemed morbid and that the company was trying to scare people.

Last week, my coworker who was also new got fired. He apparently was behind on work and didn’t tell anyone and lied about it. A couple hours after he got fired they held a department meeting telling us he was fired and all about why, and told us if we aren’t responding to emails or orders within 48 hours we’re fired. Then a week later they had us sign a long document about expectations and how if we don’t respond within 24 hours that’s not meeting expectations. 

So I feel really stressed at my job and want to find a new one. But I feel like such a quitter and with all the other things I quit on this year, it makes me feel awful. Maybe I’m just a negative person? I’ve made some bad decisions I feel, gone against my gut each time, and im tired of making bad decisions. 

Should I find a new job?

TLDR: I feel my new workplace is toxic because they don’t have enough staff and overburden employees with too much work and not enough time. I have almost had a panic attack every day and want to find a new job but feel like a quitter, and wonder if my negative outlook is the problem?",RealAd1811,14,0.8199999928474426,8,1691358337,2023-08-06 21:45:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15k1mfj/feel_ashamed_about_quitting_a_job_i_feel_is_toxic/,8,2023

15k0n2p,Stay in high paying fortune 50 job or pivot to new field?,"Hello!  
I am about 1 year post undergrad, working at a large company doing a cross-disclipline of Business & IT. I landed a great job on paper, a very comfortable salary & benefits with access to a skilled professional network. Nearing $90K salary this year before taxes.  
Here's the thing. The work-life balance is terrible, I don't feel like the best fit for the company culture, and my mental health has significantly declined since starting this job. I work 50+ hours per week at minimum (which is fine, I'm kind of a workaholic by nature, except I don't particularly enjoy or see the purpose in the work I'm doing). The role is more technical than my background, and though I've tried to learn on the job, complete additional trainings, adapt as best as I can, my plate keeps filling with new tasks and I am slower at the work than my peers. To be fair, all of them have more experience, but at 1 year in, I should be better at my job than I am. I have spoken to management about the workload and was told that I can and should ask teammates for help, but at the end of the day, I am responsible (OK, fair). I'm onboarding a new person to our team and though I'm grateful for the learning experience of training someone, I realized I was not well-trained myself and don't have the right answers all the time. My teammates have a significant amount of work as well, and while some of them ARE helpful, they don't have the capacity for new tasks either.  
All of this aside, I've considered pivoting to a different field for a while, even before starting this job. I don't want to be too specific but it's slightly more creative & less profit-focused. This field would definitely require some self-taught training, though I would prefer to get a Master's Degree in addition to self-teaching. I am passionate about this work, I get excited researching it, I took a few classes in undergrad related to it which I excelled in, and I think I would be happier. It would be a smooth transition in that my current background makes (enough) sense for this field. BUT - is it worth leaving a ""prestigious"" high-paying job? I do have debt from undergrad & monthly car, cell, & insurance payments. I want the answer to be yes for the purpose of my own happiness and fulfillment in life, but would appreciate rational reasoning here.  
There is potential to transition to this field at current company, though it is not promised, and would be 3 years from now (rotational program).  
TL;DR - Landed competitive high-paying job out of college with benefits & access to skilled professional network. Terrible work life balance, declining mental health, role isn't good fit for skillset. Interested in pivoting to a different field (more creative, less profit-focused) either through self-taught training or Master's Degree. Has a bit of experience in this field from undergrad, would excel at it and is passionate about it. Would it be worth the short-term financial insecurity & potential loss of long-term growth within the current company/business career? Or stick it out in current job as I am only 1 year in?",Ok-Minimum3610,6,1.0,1,1691355928,2023-08-06 21:05:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15k0n2p/stay_in_high_paying_fortune_50_job_or_pivot_to/,8,2023

15jy4kh,I’m so worried about my future in my job field.,"So I’m an entry level web developer (33 years)that graduated with Bachelor’s degree in web app development major in my state’s institute of technology college last year and have been working at a small laboratory company for PHP Full Stack Developer since last September. I also used to do an remote internship as Python Django Web Developer before working here. For free time, I also keep coding for more practice and try to get new development skills and project work knowledges with the tools and languages that I’m not familiar like google cloud platform, web scraping, various  web templates design, and so on.

I’m continuing my new job search and applying for about 2-3 months via LinkedIn and Indeed with so many times of applications as web developer, software developer and other related IT positions, but still got no luck for an offer and feel more worried about my future than being frustrated now.

I understand there are too many competitors in this field now and the job market is not in a good status, but I make only $50k which is pretty low considering the average web developers’ salary even with short experience year like mine, and that was not even what they suggested on their online job posting. It was $60k.

Besides, all the company’s workers except myself, my only coworker in the same dev team and our boss who’s been managing the database and server for 7 years in this company, have absolutely no idea or appreciation about any of the IT works we take care of, and not even the very basic computer knowledges like how to connect double monitor for one desktop and that they can’t play Candy Crush on the work computer and complain their computer is working slowly.

First I’ m upset in the thought that I didn’t finish my degree and learn all the development work so hard at college to happen to be working with being mistreated like this as a programmer(this happens to my coworker as well, though.).

Secondly I’m worried much more in the fear if I would ever be able to get a new position for these technology fields(not necessarily for web dev only) at way better salary and work environment sooner than later, especially because I have to take care of my mother since she’s gotten her disk injured badly lately and unable to work for a long tome period, and also have to start paying for my student loan next month as well as all the other mandatory expenses.

I’m also worried if there might be even a small possibility that I would be stuck in this company like my boss. He’s good with Microsoft access, excel and VBA codes and fixing hardware, but has no other new skills like what I and my coworker have and use, which could be the reason he’s just continuing his work in this company even if things like day offs for holiday and the others are not reasonable

I don’t say I would like to work at such a giant IT company like Google or Microsoft, but I really wish I could get hired by a really great company as web app and software developer that I can delightfully do my coding works before I get too old to do so. Would I surely get the chance if it seems and feels not so well for now, only if I keep working and practicing hard like this and never give up?",Rj_Coder39,1,1.0,1,1691349915,2023-08-06 19:25:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15jy4kh/im_so_worried_about_my_future_in_my_job_field/,8,2023
15jxy2r,negotiate/relocate/ or find a new job,"As a foreign executive who moved to the US several years ago, I initially received an offer of 140k plus bonus when I relocated here. At the begging I was exited but, I soon realized that the cost of living in California was too high for my family and me. I spoke to my employer about this, and they granted a raise of 20k, bringing my total compensation to 160k plus bonus, totaling around 200k.

During the pandemic, I requested permission to move to a different state, and my boss approved the request. My wife also found a job, resulting in a combined total compensation of around 260k per year for both of us. We decided to buy a house and have another child.

Now, my boss, who is also a foreign executive living in Europe, is hinting that they want me to move back to California due to the impressive growth of the company's business lines there. The relationship between us is like a rollercoaster. The European style of management sometimes is very difficult. 

To add more context, I traveled a couple weeks ago to the company in CA, and because of the hybrid work policy, the building was empty most of the time. However, my boss wants to show to the other managers that my team and I are present (all my team work remotely, lol).

Giving the circumstances, I am concerned about the high cost of living, the potential loss of my wife's job, and the increased taxes that would significantly reduce my paycheck.

I am unsure how to approach this situation with my boss, especially since their communication style is not as straightforward as it is in the US. He has not directly mentioned the topic again, but I fear they might bring it up at the worst moment, as usual. 

Considering my wife's potential unemployment, the impact on my finances, most of employees are working from home, and the unlikely chance of negotiating another raise, I am seeking advice on how to handle this negotiation and express my concerns about not moving back to California due to its high expenses.

I've been actively searching for jobs, but the situation is not looking promising at all. It's incredibly slow, and opportunities seem scarce.

15jwj9c,Make Plans of 10 Years And Try To Achieve It In 3 Years,"**Introduction**  
Make yourself in such a way that you can achieve your dreams for the next 10 years in 3 years. This question will come to your mind: what else can I do like this. So today we will talk about this.   
A critical component of both personal and professional development is establishing long-term goals. Making future plans enables us to visualize the life we want and take steps to make it a reality. While it may sound ambitious to try to accomplish ten years' worth of goals in just three, it is not altogether impossible. This article addresses the idea of setting long-term goals that can be accomplished in a shorter amount of time by compressing the timeline. We can release our entire potential and perform amazing achievements in a short amount of time by using strategic planning, commitment, and adaptability.

  
**I. The Power of Vision**  
The initial phase in starting this difficult road is to create a compelling vision for the upcoming ten years. This vision acts as a lighthouse, directing our actions in the direction of the ultimate objective. It requires reflection on our motivations, attributes, and guiding principles. We can determine the turning points that will get us there by imagining the ideal life we want to live in ten years. A clearly defined vision establishes the direction for the remarkable adventure ahead, whether it be for personal or professional objectives.

  
**II. Strategic Goal Setting**  
The next task is to turn the ten-year ambition into a set of precise, doable objectives. These objectives ought to be SMART, which stands for clear, quantifiable, achievable, pertinent, and Time-bound. Divide the ten-year plan into smaller, three-year chunks, each with challenging but doable goals. It's important to be honest when establishing these goals about the time and work needed to reach each milestone. Adopt a growth mentality, which encourages ongoing learning and adaptability as you advance.

  
**III. Mindset Shift: Embrace the 'Now'**  
Your mindset should be very clear that I have to complete all the plans of 10 years in 3 years. Time is the most valuable resource we have, thus we must change our outlook from ""someday"" to ""today"" if we want to do the impossible. We must consistently move closer to our goals every day, not put off taking action. Looking for the ""perfect moment"" and delays simply slow down our development. By accepting the 'present,' we create energy and a feeling of purpose that helps us go forward. Every little step counts, and over time, they add up to produce meaningful outcomes.

  
**IV. The Importance of Planning and Discipline**  
It is the most crucial element. A ten-year plan must be condensed into three years with rigorous planning and unrelenting discipline. For every phase, create a thorough roadmap defining the required steps, materials, and deadlines. Divide the distance into smaller portions while appreciating success along the way. Maintaining discipline is equally important since it enables us to stay devoted and focused over obstacles or diverts.

  
**V. Harnessing the Power of Support**  
It takes a lot of effort to try to accomplish a decade's worth of goals in just three years. It is critical to understand that we can't do this on our own. Make sure you have a solid network of partners, friends, and mentors who can encourage you when things become tough. Keep in mind, you should always have 1 person who can give you advice if needed. Ask for advice from individuals who achieved similar things and take what you can from their wisdom. Additionally, to maximize your efficiency, delegate work when you can.

  
**VI. Eliminating Distractions**  
It is common for too many distractions to get in the way of achievement. Distractions in today's hyperconnected surroundings can easily keep us from achieving our objectives. It's critical to recognize and stop time-wasting activities that fail to reach your goals. Spend your time carefully on tasks that advance your goals and are in line with your vision. During this intensive period of rapid achievement, social media, excessive entertainment, and unneeded commitments may need to be put on hold.

  
**VII. Monitoring Development and Modifying Plan**  
See, if the work is going well, then let it go, if you feel that the work is being done in a wrong way, then modify it a little bit, so that things remain under control. To make sure you are on track to reaching your goals, frequent evaluation of your progress is imperative. If you find that you are falling short of or exceeding expectations, compare your achievements to the established milestones and make the required adjustments. Be prepared to change your plan if new opportunities arise or if any of your original aims become obsolete.

  
**Conclusion**  
The prospect of completing a ten-year plan in three years may seem impossible, but it is unquestionably feasible with the correct strategy, commitment, and resiliency. Time can be compressed and amazing results can be attained by developing a clear vision, defining strategic goals, practicing discipline, and utilizing support. Eliminate distractions, live in the present, and be flexible to overcome the obstacles that will definitely appear along the route. Never forget that the purpose of this journey is to pursue our dreams with effort and attention rather than by taking quick cuts. We can realize our full potential and experience a life transformation beyond our wildest dreams with perseverance and strategic planning.

If you can control all these things then definitely you will achieve all your plans within 3 years instead of 10 years.

15jw4z1,"Decent careers where folks work to live, not live to work?","Question first, context second, then some more questions and more context:

What are the fields/careers that have some combination of the following:

-not totally saturated job market 
-potential for remote or partially remote 
-emphasis on meeting the productivity goals in however many hours it takes, *not* on being seen sitting at your desk/online for the number of hours a week (40+) that makes bossman feel like he got his money’s worth out of you
-related to previous point, emphasis on work/life balance 

Context: I’m 35, based in the southeast US, no degree, minimal college credits from 15 years ago. I’m young enough to start over, but old enough and behind enough to be at a huge disadvantage without a degree, even arguably once I do have one.  This is the first time in my adult life that this all feels like a massive bummer and I’m ready to do something about it. 

I currently have the major privilege of an opportunity to start school again, fully paid, while maintaining a flexible level of part time work w/ great benefits at my organic foods co-op job. My partner and I are happily DINK homeowners with minimal expenses, I can get away with working part time for the foreseeable future, but will need to get back to saving/planning for retirement etc eventually. These are not things I take for granted.  

Trying to pivot from 2 literal decades of dead-end service industry jobs to something I can do at least partly from home, ideally with some flexibility of hours/scheduling based on productivity, not on hours wasted looking busy. 

What are these mythical jobs people have where the company doesn’t care how many/which hours they’re at their desk/online as long as the productivity goals are met? I’ve seen evidence that I could find something like this in accounting/payroll and cybersecurity, any others come to mind for y’all? Any anecdotal evidence for or against those claims? 

I know the job market is insane right now, and I know I won’t get my unicorn company/boss/job off the bat or maybe ever, but there must be fields where this is more possible than others.

I also plan to look into the possibility of tapping my medium sized co-op company (4 stores) for training/experience in accounting, admin, etc to get a foot in while in school. I could easily stick it out with this company in my current role or in admin for however long it takes to transition to a new career, and my superiors would be supportive of school needs etc. I also have a great personal connect higher up in the company, which is how I got the job mid-pandemic in the first place, he basically got me hired sight unseen. 

It seems that for some people, finding a job they’re passionate about is important, for some people it’s hustling to make tons of money no matter the cost in the rest of their life. For these folks work is a big part of their identity - I don’t want that. 

I want my job to ultimately be the least important part of my life, but I’m beyond ready to be done with the service industry, and I’ll put in the work of schooling/training/entry level jobs to get to a point where I have a decent job in five to ten years that won’t swallow up my life, but also won’t eventually destroy my body/soul, as service jobs do. 

Please help me y’all, I can’t spend the next 30 years hauling ass all day with a bunch of bratty 25 year olds and deluding myself  that getting promoted to assistant department manager/department manager/even store manager will be the answer.",External_Guitar_6484,285,0.9200000166893005,397,1691345034,2023-08-06 18:03:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15jw4z1/decent_careers_where_folks_work_to_live_not_live/,8,2023
15jvz8j,Graphic Designer seeking career advice,"  
Hi - I’m a mid-senior level graphic designer seeking some career advice and thought to post   
here for input. Thank you in advance for reading my post, and I will do my best to be concise.   
TLDR at the end.   
**About me:**  
I (30M) have 9 years of graphic design experience, holding four positions in both small and global businesses as an in-house designer. While my 9 years of experience lean towards senior-level, my primarily in-house background.  
I’ve done freelance design here and there over the years, but only sparingly in my free time.   
I have been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD (this will be relevant later).  
My primary design skills are branding, print, digital, motion graphics, and image compositing/editing.  
Tool-wise, I’m proficient in the big 3 (Photoshop, Illustrator, inDesign), along with After Effects, and XD.   
**My situation:**  
Currently employed as the sole graphic designer at a chaotic start-up (3 months)  
By chaotic I mean:   
no design process, everything is reactive, the drama between upper management and stakeholders.  
Everything is a high priority, these priorities shift nearly daily, with no processes in place to complete any before beginning another.  
Stakeholders cut budgets and forced company owner to lay people off and remove remote work in an attempt to meet revenue goals  
My team (marketing) is always ‘frantic’ because they feel their jobs are on the line if they don’t please stakeholders  
None of the above was an issue when I was first hired - this all began to transpire a few weeks after my employment - bad timing.   
I’m having trouble thriving. The work conditions are often overstimulating, and overwhelming, and make it difficult to regulate myself (remember, the ADHD I mentioned?) - you never know what sort of fire the day will hold leading to tons of pre-work and post-work anxiety.  
I have weekly bouts of evening depression, and sometimes panic attacks that come about for seemingly no reason.   
Feel trapped - the pay is good, and the benefits are very good for a person like me who has mental health issues. I take medication for ADHD and anxiety, and I consider it integral for me to function properly.   
**My Solution(s)**  
Strongly considering quitting.   
Despite having 7-8 months of savings, the consensus is that it's risky. Leaving without a new job could mean swapping job frustration for the anxiety of dwindling savings during the job search.   
Not only that but, no job = no insurance = no medication = which I need.  
No idea how the design industry is for job prospects currently. I’ve been applying with an occasional lead or two, but I feel I’m behind - there’s always some requested skill that I have not developed (usually UX/UI, HTML/CSS, 3D)  
**The 3 paths I know of to pursue and the (perceived) pros/cons of each:**  
In-House Designer -  
 All I’ve ever done, usually working for corporations. Usually more stable. Endure my chaotic job until I find another.  
Always worked on a marketing team, with my direct report being someone in marketing who doesn’t understand the process.   
I want to work with a team of other designers with an established process and a creative director/art director  
My ADHD brain does not mesh well with corporate environments - I have to mask continuously and go against the grain of my brain chemistry constantly. But I’ve been making do. Though by the day's end, I'm always drained.  
Design Agency -  
Considering I’d like to work with other creatives, this seems like the best route to achieve that.  
My goal is better mental health, peace, and work-life balance, and I’ve heard many nightmare stories about agency work requiring a lot of (unpaid) overtime to keep clients happy and meet deadlines (this is my biggest hang with pursuing this path)  
But I know agencies usually have designers with highly specific skill sets, meaning I’d get exposed to more skills/collaboration/cross-over  
More project variety as opposed to In-House  
Freelance -  
I'd be on my own and I don’t know what that would mean for me considering that even medicated, I struggle with executive function (getting started/doing/motivated), due to the dopamine deficiency in my brain from ADHD.   
Continuously finding leads yourself, marketing yourself, doing the admin work, invoices, taxes, clerical work - that all sounds exhausting to my brain - even just typing it out. Probably because of it being continual.  
 I know it will take some business acumen to succeed, and I’d want a mentor as I’d need guidance to understand what I’m getting into. No idea where to find one.   
Realistically, I’d probably have to do this in tandem with my chaotic job if I wanted to sustain my income - which goes against my ultimate goal of work-life balance and peace.  
Questions for you  
I feel directionless and unsure of where to go from here. If you've been at a similar crossroads in your career, what did you do to overcome it?  
I feel I’m lacking skills that are now becoming “standard” - UI/UX experience, 3D Design, HTML, etc - how would you go about broadening a skillset, while also working a full-time job that leaves you exhausted by the day’s end?   
What design skills/tools would you say are most desirable, and that I definitely need to have? I know our industry continuously changes, and all we can do is keep learning and adapt.   
Aside from Job Boards, are there other places I can go to seek employment - places that are designer-specific? I’ve considered job-placement services for creatives, but I’ve heard mostly negative or unhelpful outcomes.   
In conclusion, I’ll say, I have no desire to get rich or climb a corporate ladder. I just want to go to work, do my duties as a creative, and then leave - to focus on my loved ones, hobbies, and bettering my mental resolve. I love design, but I’m finding that my job(s) leave me feeling overworked or mismanaged, and this is stress I carry around and affects me outside of work. (I realize it’s me that allows that, and I take responsibility for it and all that I’ve written here).   
This career is a third of my life. And life is too short.    
Thanks for taking the time to read this, and even more so if you left a comment or direct message.   
TL;DR:

  
I’m a graphic designer with ADHD, working in a chaotic position that’s taxing on their mental health. I want to find another creative avenue - one that’s more peaceful, and allows for better work-life balance - but am unsure which path of design (in-house, agency, freelance, etc.) to pursue and what new skills would be good/integral to acquire. I’d appreciate any insight you have. Thank you.

15jvdgf,What job titles should I be searching for?,"Southeast Michigan. I am about to graduate with a BBA in management (Aug 15th!), concentration (basically a minor) in human resources.

15ju3mb,Do you think having a degree is a necessity to future financial success in life?," People who have never went to university, do you ever regret it? Was it limiting your opportunities in life?  
Do you wish you could go back in time and get your bachelor's, or even master's? 

  
F23 here, sorry for my English. I always had good grades at school, being A+ student for most years, but hated it to my guts. Felt like a prisoner. Forced to learn about things I didn't care about, having to sit at my desk being silent and not allowed to move. Wanted to drop out of school actually, but managed to finish somehow. Had tried university at 18, dropped out right after first semester. When there's no need to study for grades,  I find myself being interested in stuff, listening to scientific podcasts, lectures, reading books, trying to learn languages etc. But when it's being a thing that I ""have to do"", then my motivation levels shrink to zero. Basically, I can't find any willpower to force myself to go get a degree. At the same time I'm a little worried for my future as having a degree sounds safe. Although i don't even know what i would wanna study, as all the jobs that i would ever want to try out in my life do not require one. (real estate, photography, event organization, anything creative). Maybe business administration degree would be an option that i could handle, but still the thought of having to write stupid essays and all that stuff makes me physically cringe. As of now i work as accountant.  How do you know if you're just being a lazy undisciplined ass or if university is just not for you? Thank you all for your replies in advance ♥

15jt8lz,I have a new job but should I consider staying at my existing job?,"I have secured a new job as a Senior Data Engineer for a company, which will pay me 35% more than my current job - but the downside is that it will be a 90 minute commute each way (in office two days a week). I could move but that would mean leaving behind some very good friends and I find starting again in new areas particularly challenging/draining. 

When I informed my current employer that I will be leaving they jumped into action. I'm not the biggest fan of where I work - for a long time I have felt underappreciated and underpaid (don't we all feel this?). The last two weeks they have been going to great lengths to try and convince me to stay but the money is proving a stumbling block (i.e they won't go anywhere near my new offer). But they will:

* give me a retention bonus (of 10% of my current salary) - but if I was to leave in the next 10 months I'd have to pay it back
* increase my base pay by 11% (this is obviously still massively short of my new offer)
* and look at promoting me at the end of the calendar year which would lead to increase in my base pay by about 20% (again still very short). 

I have tried to be collaborative in negotiating - offering alternative suggestions - but I still feel a lot of the risk is with me if I stay. For example, if I stay, take the retention bonus, and do not get promoted I am massively short on my income, compared to my new offer. Equally I would be short even if I get promoted. Personally I think the offer and conditions is quite heavily skewed against me - i.e all the risk sits with me financially - namely if I do not get promoted - and there is no downside for them, because if I don't I still have to see out the remaining time to avoid having to payback the retention bonus. The person I have been negotiating with is not the ultimate decision maker (they have to ask HR naturally) but they are like if you work with me for the next year and a half I can help you make that money. If I was to stay put I keep my friends and a very reasonable commute of 40 mins - though I rarely have to go to the office/I try hard not to haha. 

It comes down guaranteed money and long long commute vs. modest increase, promise of more, keeping my existing social life. 

I'd welcome thoughts, opinions and suggestions. If someone's got some negotiating suggests I'll listen to those too.

Equally, any advice for dealing with impostor syndrome would be great too in event I take the role I've been offered. It will be my first time operating in a senior capacity and I'm utterly terrified I will feel hugely out of my depth.

- Worked for 3.5 years as Account Manager at an awesome Fintech in Canada
- Moved to Portugal during the pandemic to take a 6 month break
- Worked for a startup for 9 months as an Account Manager in Portugal
- Moved back to Canada due to sick family members and poor job fit (pay is low in Portugal and the job was essentially customer service work)

I’m really not enjoying the job and the stress it brings as the company has changed their name and a customers are unhappy.

My question: I’m planning on moving back to Europe in the new year. Should I tough it out for the next 4-6 months or look for another opportunity? I have little expenses at the moment due to staying with my family. I also am aware how short term employments look on a resume for reference sake.

15jpt21,"Balancing Master's Studies, Toxic Work Environment, and Personal Projects","Hi everyone,  
  
I'm a 21-year-old recent graduate from Colombia, with a degree in Systems Engineering (a mix of Computer Science and Software Engineering in my country). Over the past two years, I've been part of a signal research group where I completed my thesis, and I've been working with them since April. They offered me the opportunity to pursue a Master's in Applied Math starting in January, and while money isn't an issue, I'm unsure whether I should accept this offer.  
  
The work environment in the research group is toxic, with the center's director being quite authoritarian. However, my immediate supervisors, including my thesis director, are great people, and I'd love to continue researching in my thesis area, potentially improving and expanding on it for my Master's thesis.  
  
But there are some concerns. Two brilliant friends who were also part of the research group just left and advised me to gain work experience first and then decide about pursuing the Master's later. They believe that having an advanced degree might make it harder to find entry-level jobs. They also suggested considering the time I could dedicate to my passion for music, which I've had to put on hold due to my commitments.  
  
On top of that, my friends and I got accepted into a machine learning/data science bootcamp with a low acceptance rate. However, participating in this program means I won't be able to work in the industry simultaneously, which could cause conflicts with my current job. The bootcamp starts next week, and this could further strain my already packed schedule, potentially affecting the quality of my current project work.  
  
Adding to the pressure, I'm studying an additional language, but my performance has declined recently due to feeling burned out. I've also faced minor health issues related to stress, which I don't want to escalate.  
  
Deep down, I have a strong desire to pursue the Master's, especially with the opportunities available to me, but it feels like it would be practically exploitative to stay in this toxic work environment. I value my thesis director, but I also understand the reasons for leaving this place.  
  
At this point, I truly don't know what the best decision is for the long term, especially considering my desire to pursue a postgraduate degree someday. The prospect of further education excites me, but I also want to prioritize my well-being, personal projects, and future job prospects.  
  
I'm at a loss, and I'd appreciate any advice or insights you all might have. Thank you for taking the time to read this and help me with my dilemma.

Over the past two years, I've been part of a signal research group where I completed my thesis, and I've been working with them since April. They offered me the opportunity to pursue a Master's in Applied Math starting in January, and while money isn't an issue, I'm unsure whether I should accept this offer.  
The work environment in the research group is toxic, with the center's director being quite authoritarian. However, my immediate supervisors, including my thesis director, are great people, and I'd love to continue researching in my thesis area, potentially improving and expanding on it for my Master's thesis.  
But there are some concerns. Two brilliant friends who were also part of the research group just left and advised me to gain work experience first and then decide about pursuing the Master's later. They believe that having an advanced degree might make it harder to find entry-level jobs. They also suggested considering the time I could dedicate to my passion for music, which I've had to put on hold due to my commitments.  
On top of that, my friends and I got accepted into a machine learning/data science bootcamp with a low acceptance rate. However, participating in this program means I won't be able to work in the industry simultaneously, which could cause conflicts with my current job. The bootcamp starts next week, and this could further strain my already packed schedule, potentially affecting the quality of my current project work.  
Adding to the pressure, I'm studying an additional language, but my performance has declined recently due to feeling burned out. I've also faced minor health issues related to stress, which I don't want to escalate.  
Deep down, I have a strong desire to pursue the Master's, especially with the opportunities available to me, but it feels like it would be practically exploitative to stay in this toxic work environment. I value my thesis director, but I also understand the reasons for leaving this place.

At this point, I truly don't know what the best decision is for the long term, especially considering my desire to pursue a postgraduate degree someday. The prospect of further education excites me, but I also want to prioritize my well-being, personal projects, and future job prospects.

I'm at a loss, and I'd appreciate any advice or insights you all might have. Thank you for taking the time to read this and help me with my dilemma.",andr1729,1,1.0,0,1691328648,2023-08-06 13:30:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15jppy7/balancing_masters_studies_toxic_work_environment/,8,2023
15jpiq6,What kind of new job opportunities can help me in achieving exponential career growth?,"Hello, I'm a mid-career professional having gained strong business experience in the tech sector. But i feel saturated in my job and now looking to explore new avenues that can potentially catapult my career to an executive level position. I would greatly appreciate any advice and insights from those who have successfully made similar transitions or have knowledge about these career moves.

I have often thought about changing jobs but I don't want a similar job with some bump in salary. I do have aspirations to take up a C-level management role.

My problem is less of getting a job right now but more of getting a job that can help me with bigger aspirations. 

I'm eager to learn from your experiences and insights. Any advice, success stories, or lessons learned will be highly valuable in shaping my career path.

So far i did some Project based on LWC from the course i enrolled in udemy. I wouldn't say i m very good at it. But i m willing to learn, improve and now i m frustrated that i ll be completing 1 year and i still have no experience to put in my resume to search for a job and I don't even know whether i should continue with salesforce or try to switch to other domain but even if i want to switch to other domain how to is the question.

15jm0ck,Second thoughts about my major. Should I change it?,"18m, I’m an incoming freshmen pursuing an AS digital media production degree with a focus in digital photography. After I get my associates I’m planning on transferring to a 4-year university for a BA in Creative media. I’m super into the art field and I’m interested in a career like being a creative director, graphic designer, & photographer but I’m also interested in being a pilot. That’s why I will also be participating in Air Force ROTC, hoping to commission as a pilot after I graduate. 
The whole point in getting this bachelors is so I can commission in the Air Force because it requires a 4 year degree. This degree will basically be my fall back in case my Air Force pathway doesn’t work out. 

I’m having second thoughts about my current major. Is a BA in Creative media worth it?

I’m also interested in other degrees like
-BA in Public administration (Disaster and emergency management)
-BA in Business Administration (Marketing)
-BA Cybersecurity 
-BS Information Technology

Would I be better off with these degrees instead?

15jjfvg,When and how should I request an internal transfer?,"Hello,

Let me preface this by saying I like working where I am employed. The workplace is nice, they pay well and I just like it there.

I applied to my current workplace as a Content Writer but they bumped me up to a Junior Editor and put me to work under a manager. I was supposed to assist him and work was good with the company for about 8 months. Fast forward to the present day, I was recently promoted to a team leader and I'm having A LOT of trouble keeping up with the workload and the role. I have had to work overtime up to 12 hours a day (unpaid) just to get close to finishing targets and such and even then I have been unable to do so.

At first, I thought I was just incompetent and imposter syndrome kicked in. But after about 3 breakdowns and a session with my therapist later, I figured it wasn't the case because I have been good at some things at work, even if it may not be my current role.

I was looking for articles and such online for help and saw something that suggested requesting an internal transfer. Like moving to a different role/position at work. Because I'm really struggling and my mental health is utter shite. I would quit but I don't have anything else lined up and I like the company.

Would I need to wait a certain duration before requesting it? How should I approach it with my boss so it doesn't devolve into him shouting at me and firing me?",FabulousFuckboy,1,1.0,0,1691307251,2023-08-06 07:34:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15jjfvg/when_and_how_should_i_request_an_internal_transfer/,8,2023

15jd82e,"Stick it out, Master's Program, or Self Teach?","Hello! 

I am about 1 year post undergrad, working at a large company doing Ad Tech. I landed a great job on paper, a very comfortable salary & benefits with access to a skilled professional network. I'm nearing $80-95K before taxes this year with a bachelor's degree in business. 

Here's the thing. The TL;DR version of this is, work-life balance is terrible, I don't feel like the best fit for the company culture, and my mental health has significantly declined since starting this job. I work 50+ hours per week at minimum (which is fine, I'm kind of a workaholic by nature, except I don't particularly enjoy or see the purpose in the work I'm doing). The role is more technical than my background, and though I've tried to learn on the job, complete additional trainings, adapt as best as I can, my plate keeps filling with new tasks. I have spoken to management about this and was told that I can and should ask teammates for help, but at the end of the day, I am responsible. I'm onboarding a   
new person to our team and though I'm grateful for the learning experience of training someone, I realized I was horribly trained myself and don't have the right answers all the time. My teammates have a significant amount of work as well, and while some of them ARE helpful, they don't have the capacity for new tasks either. 

All of this aside, I've considered pivoting to a different field for a while, even before starting this job. I don't want to be too specific but it's slightly more creative & less profit-focused. This field would definitely require some self-taught training, though I would prefer to get a Master's Degree in addition to self-teaching. I am passionate about this work, I get excited researching it, I took a few classes in undergrad related to it which I excelled in, and I think I would be happier. It would be a smooth transition in that my current background makes (enough) sense for this field. BUT - is it worth leaving a cushiony high-paying job with long-term career growth? I do have debt from undergrad & monthly car, cell, & insurance payments. I want the answer to be yes for the purpose of my own happiness and fulfillment in life, but would appreciate rational reasoning here. 

TL;DR - Landed competitive high-paying job out of college with benefits & access to skilled professional network. Terrible work life balance, declining mental health, role isn't best fit for skillset.  Interested in pivoting to a different field either through self-taught training or Master's Degree.

15jd5mk,Should I drop out of dentistry?,"Hello everybody,

This year I was accepted into medical school and dental school in Canada after years of applying. After months of thinking about it, asking people and considering my options I went with dental school. 

I’m now having immense buyer’s remorse, and I feel like I really just fucked up my life. I didn’t factor in the physical strain of the job, considering the back pain I already have. I didn’t factor in how severely limited my options are now that I’m in dentistry. I didn’t factor in that my personality is not a good fit at all for the job. I didn’t realize how many dentists hate their jobs. I only thought about prospects of opening a clinic, being my own boss and went ahead and chose dentistry. Even that is questionable nowadays and might be significantly harder by the time I graduate. 

I’ve been agonizing with anxiety for the past month since I’ve made this decision, and no amount of talking or thinking has helped ease my anxiety. I feel like I threw my life away, and I’m not sure what to do anymore. 

I’ve been thinking of dropping out and pursing engineering, before I commit myself to a ton of student loans. Who knows if I’m gonna be happier in that, but at least it has low debt and tons of options. 

Please give me some advice on what I should do. Should I just suck it up and keep going? I will only graduate with 150k in loans so it’s not that much. 

Thank you all for your help",Competitive_Algae777,1,1.0,2,1691286566,2023-08-06 01:49:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15jd5mk/should_i_drop_out_of_dentistry/,8,2023

15jcnqf,Unprofessional Boss,"So I’ve been in this position a year and it’s been a rough one with this manager, he’s held me after hours in meetings countless times, he’s  unprofessional cursing in meetings (thought I head a “fucking idiot” under his breath once in a 1-on-1) . He curses a lot which is not a huge issue but when he’s annoyed it definitely feels uncomfortable. No one has corrected his behavior so I’m guessing nobody cares. He likes to tear into team members infront of everyone in meetings and it just feels like a public lashing in a way.

 Someone will mention a idea they had (he often says ideas are more than welcome) and he immediately cuts them off without fully hearing the idea (which usually is the source of the confusion)  and just says “No”. Zero context. Same thing with any problems your facing on a project.It’s rude and definitely not helpful. He’s often said he enjoys bullying people? The issue is he phrased it like an extremely passive aggressive joke.

Recently at a company event he made a slightly racist joke and use the phrase “you people wouldn’t like the joke but the truth is right there.”  I’ll be honest, I let out a nervous laugh and tried to change the subject. I shouldn’t have, I should have addressed it publicly. Two big reasons why I didn’t react the way I should have:

 1. I’m one of 4 minorities in the department and I’m the only one on my team. 

2. Outside of events it’s an island out here and I don’t have a back up job in the line up. I have to deal with him until I find a new job. I try to reduce my interaction with him to the bear minimum.

The thing is his antics are wearing me thin and I’m going from a job I was super excited for to someone who literally couldn’t give a fuck.

I got an offer for a 6 month contract position at a reputable company, let’s call them Company 1. Good pay and I get benefits through the recruiting agency. They want an answer by Monday. 

However, I’m also interviewing for a full time position at a company I really like. I’ve worked at Company 2 before and I’m qualified for the role. I’m about to have my third interview (1 more to go) and if all goes well, I could have an offer in the next two weeks.

I’m nervous if I accept the contract role and then shortly leave, the agency will never work with me again. They’ve been so helpful. Also the recruiter (who vouched for me) has 25 years experience with far reach in my field, so I’m scared he could make my life hell if I screw with his commission. 

However, if I turn the contract job down, I could potentially end up with no job. Also the agency still might not work with me again because I’m turning down offers.

Been this individual’s manager for 3 months but he’s been on the role since end of 2022. He moved from another function and region in the company to a role in corporate HQ that’s out of his depth and basically needs micromanagement and specific instructions to execute his role - so much so that I’m doing his job more than mine. Placed him on a 3 months PIP 2 months ago and had a recent check in with very blunt feedback that expectations are still not met. Even though continuous feedback was given in the last 2 months he did not register these as unsatisfactory performance and thinks he’s improving and became very defensive when specific examples are brought up even when HR was present.  Based on his behavior and lack of self awareness alone I have little faith that he will turn it around, functional capability aside. However he’s the sole breadwinner in his family (no kids) and his partner is in process of applying for green card via marriage.

15jaja9,"Graduating with a B.S. degree in Psychology, but I don't know what to do","So, I graduate with a B.S degree in Psychology in December, but I'm super worried about what I want to do and if I'm even qualified to do anything. I planned on becoming a therapist when I started, but I realized that I don't think I'm fit to be one. I suffer from depression and anxiety myself, and I know it would be too difficult on me to listen to other peoples' stories without it affecting myself.

My problem is that I am also incredibly socially awkward and bad at talking to people. I have always been that way no matter how hard I try (I still try today). I am not a creative person either, and I've only ever worked in retail. It's like I don't know what to do with myself unless someone tells me. I genuinely feel like my only talents lie in schoolwork, which doesn't seem like it'll translate well in the workforce. I guess I'm lost, and I honestly feel hopeless. Since I'm so socially awkward and not creative, I fear that I'm not fit to work anywhere in any position.

I guess my question is: where do I go from here? I barely even know where my interests lie anymore because college has taken its toll, and I'm worn out. I do still love psychology, and I truly believe I have a good work ethic, but it's a matter of getting into a position that I thrive in. Are there jobs that I can do that don't consistently only rely on communication with new people? Are there jobs where I can be more data-driven and less creative? Even if there aren't specific jobs that someone can list, where do I go to discover what I can do?

15j6w4z,"My Journey as a Dentist: Overcoming Struggles, Seeking Hope in Dubai","Hey Reddit community,

I wanted to share my story as a man who want to make something in his life , documenting the challenging journey I’ve been through since graduating as a dentist in March 2020. Little did I know that the world was about to change drastically due to the emergence of COVID-19. The pandemic brought about lockdowns that lasted for almost 6 months, completely altering the trajectory of my plans.

In the wake of the pandemic, I found myself facing an uphill battle. The economic crisis and inflation made it incredibly tough for me to find opportunities. Despite my qualifications, the job market (Dentistry) became increasingly difficult to navigate. 
It was disheartening to witness a shift in employment dynamics, with a preference for women due to government support encouraging women empowerment programs. 

For nearly 3 years, I persevered in my home country, trying to make ends meet amidst these challenges. Eventually, I made the difficult decision to leave my home behind and embark on a journey to Dubai. With a meager budget that would last around 15 days, I arrived in a foreign land full of dreams and uncertainties.

On the Next second of September, something quite amusing occurred: I entered my 30s without a job, any income, a girlfriend, or even familial support—almost in a state of profound solitude.


I know that : Life in Dubai hasn’t been easy. I’ve battled depression, loneliness, and a sense of being lost. The weight of frustration often made me question the value of each passing day, contemplating whether it might be the right day to give up. The reality is that job opportunities in Dubai, like anywhere else, are not handed out easily.

I am reaching out to this community, not only to share my story but also to seek guidance and assistance. I’m determined to find any job that will allow me to kickstart a new career in Dubai and build a life that offers stability and happiness. I understand the challenges ahead, but I’m willing to put in the effort.

If you have any advice, leads, or suggestions that could help me find a job or navigate life in Dubai, I would be incredibly grateful.
 I believe in the power of community and the support we can offer each other. 
Thank you for taking the time to read my story and for any assistance you can provide.

Sincerely,
Riyad",rydhz,1,1.0,0,1691269960,2023-08-05 21:12:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15j6w4z/my_journey_as_a_dentist_overcoming_struggles/,8,2023

The owner is franchising the restaurant and offered to sell it to the current GM. He’s opening a few other stores with an investor and has offered me the GM role with promises of upward mobility as he expands. 

A few things I’m being held up on.
I would only take this career shift from my degree if it meant I could make a lot more. I know the current GM makes around $70k, and he’s telling me if I became regional manager /COO of his llc id make a lot more. However, when he talked to me about it he said the GM position would pay 40k even though I know he’s making around 70 right now as the current GM. What should I do about this? How could I get him to offer me more?

He initially came to me with promises to become a partner. However, to buy the current restaurant we would need an investor. He found an investor and now it seems I’m being kicked out of the partner role and into a manager role. Due to him partnering with the investor.

I think if things went well and I became a regional/COO I would make a good amount of money; more than my degree could offer. I also really enjoyed the restaurant business. I could see myself running restaurants and enjoying that career. I’m just worried that since he went back on promises of being partner that I would be left behind as things go forward and I don’t want to be stuck making 40k a year as a GM.

I know with my degree I could make at least 60k starting and I feel like my cap would be around 100-150k if I were to stay in the programming field.

15j3vr8,Should I pursue a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design degree in 2023? Or would it be useless due to the growing increase of artificial intelligence?,"Earlier this year, I graduated from a 2-year community college and received my associate degree in general studies. Ever since I graduated high school, I've had my mind set on going into graphic design, but as AI keeps advancing, I am getting concerned on whether or not it would be beneficial.   


I've always been an artistic and creative individual; when I was a kid, I wanted to be an artist. Of course, this gradually changed as I grew to understand that this wasn't a very realistic or stable option. After discovering my love for video games, I decided on being a video game designer. This was my passion for a long time, until about midway through high school. After doing some more research and thinking, I changed my mind and decided on graphic design instead because it seemed to have a larger variety of options and opportunities, job wise.   


I've already been accepted into the 4-year university I desire, but I am still waiting until I am certain of my career path before I register. I am now reconsidering perusing game design because of how artificial intelligence has already affected the art world. The university I have chosen has a B.F.A in Graphic Design program, as well as a B.S in Game Design. I had thought about majoring in graphic design and minoring in game design, but I doubt this would be very helpful if graphic design eventually dies out in the next few decades, not to mention a game design minor is not offered at this university. On the other hand, they do offer a graphic design minor, so I could pursue a game design major with a graphic design minor. What should I do in this situation? I don't know much about majors/minors, so would it be a waste of time purposing a minor in my situation?",alex_1003,1,1.0,1,1691262540,2023-08-05 19:09:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15j3vr8/should_i_pursue_a_bachelor_of_fine_arts_in/,8,2023

The work would be interesting but I’d probably be bored more days than enthusiastic. It would be a “job” to me. I’m calling this my “working for the weekends” career path. 

-Academia: I have a connection at Stanford that is looking for a Lab Manager position. The pay is abysmal for my experience level, but that’s what Academia is like. Everything is a funnel towards the top and if money is the aim, you either get lucky or you get out. This route is medium-risk but possibly decent reward (if I get lucky). I would have to work really hard to find a way to finangle my future into something I would like and be able to live on long term. 
       Taking this job has two advantages:
 1) I LIKE Academia. I like being a mentor. I LIKE the research and the setting. I like coming up with new ideas and solving problems. I’m currently working a very similar position (but without the Stanford prestige) and I am generally happy. 2) Taking this job could give me an opportunity to further network into something better. 
         Taking this job has two disadvantages: 1) The pay is literally not something I can live on long term. It’s ABYSMAL actually. Lab Manager isn’t really a long term career, it *might* be, if the lab gets very very lucky. But generally from what I have seen lab managers in Academic labs sorta just starve alongside the Grad Students (but without the knowledge that it will lead to a PhD). 2) Work-life balance can be pretty bad and the work is high-stress. Academia is a lifestyle. I have to be very careful about setting time for myself and doing so typically has a negative effect on my future prospects. 

-Vet School: I take all my varied previous experience and use it towards a Vet School application. My current job has made me realize that I have a gift for surgery (and teaching). I am very good at it and part of the network I have built is from me being sent to labs in different departments and different universities to train their students on surgical techniques. I LOVE this aspect of my job. It feels like a calling. I’ve never found a thing that just *clicks* like surgery does for me. I can learn a new surgery in only a couple sessions and be improving it in only a few more. 
But this path is the highest risk of all. I have done very little to build a resume towards this career. And academic boards are going to be combing applications of students who have been working towards this since high school. My chances of being accepted seem very low. And if I DO get in, I have to take on $60K+ worth of debt and have NO income for the 5 years it takes to graduate. To make matters even worse, I have to RETAKE half my bachelors degree because my Pre-requisites EXPIRE. So before I can even apply to the “low chance of being accepted” career path, I have to sink in several years worth of TRYING to be accepted (and the debt that that involves). So a good part of me wonders if it’s just too late to be trying to make a change this DRASTIC this LATE in my life. 

TLDR: Mid-thirty’s do I take?

1)Low-risk-low reward. Likely Boring. Good Life-balance.
2) Medium-risk-medium-reward. Somewhat interesting, but directionless/dead end. Poorer life balance. 
3) Super high risk. Possibly greatest reward. Could be dream job, but I have to gamble years of my life and several thousand dollars on the CHANCE I MIGHT get it.",FrivolousIntern,0,0.5,2,1691262532,2023-08-05 19:08:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15j3vmi/midlife_career_crisis_long_sorry/,8,2023
15j3rx9,"Which is good to join, Air national guard or army nationals guard?","

I just turn 33 (F). I was wondering if someone that been through the National Guard what is your experience like? What are the pros and cons?

I’m interested, because I wanna do something else in my life. I just got a state job and I don’t like it and I feel like I’m wasting my life not knowing what to do. The national guard cut off is 34yr old  or 35yr old to join. 

Honestly, I feel like quitting my job and going straight to school for computer, science and hopes to transfer, but I am stuck because I have bills to pay, but I’m in a very good situation where I could do that, but I have to have a part-time job. I live with my father-in-law and we don’t have to pay anything, so I could do that. Go straight to school, but you know, I have bills and my husband situation so I am unsure. 

My husband is in Worker’s Comp for a neck and head injury that happened at work. He really can’t do much ( sort of) and he relies on my insurance, but he tells me it’s OK if we could go on medical, if I leave my state job . 

As you can see, I’m all over the place and I know there’s a cut off for national guard and my interest is all over the place and I don’t wanna lose that chance but I also do you wanna go to school and try to pursue computer science, but just curious what it’s like joining the National Guard and if my situation can be flexible with my husband’s situation.

15j3bky,Do I secretly take the job that my boss put me onto?,"So I’ve worked at my current work place for 1.5 years now, for my boss I work 2 places… at the main store then at this other place which we have a ‘partnership/ contract’ with.
My boss is going to pull out of the contract leaving a opening position- this position pays exceptionally more than what my boss pays me, plus the colleagues in the ‘partnership’ store are like my friends/ family now working here makes me feel more comfortable and at home than the main store. 

To mention my job is client based but would it been seen as stealing clients or betrayal if I was to take this opening position? It’s a fixed flat rate pay so I won’t get nothing more or less even if no clients come in that day! 
The thing I’m worried about is handing in my notice as I have to work 4 weeks notice so the plan is to hand it in as soon as I know my boss is leaving the partnership store… but it’s SUCH a coincidence and she’ll definite catch onto it for sure then I will have to face her and my other colleagues potentially talking about me behind my back if my boss doesn’t confront me.

15j36js,Change of Career,"Good day everyone

I'm a software developer for 15 years and I say there are proud things that I've done for my career, but also struggles, pain and anxiety, when I finish a project, it does not felt that It's done, or happiness that I have completed my project, I felt relieved that it's finish, though we know applications are not finish or done, as there will be updates, bugs and changes in the future.

But this is different when it comes to my side projects, which is not in software development. I edit music and also videos, and I also directed a short film once, my attention to details when it comes to this are greater than doing software development. I can stay all night editing videos until I'm satisfied with the output, while in development I always get tired at night. I'm always happy and proud when my videos are being showed and also nervous. While in soft dev I become nervous and anxious, specially when a bug shows during the presentation. In editing music or producing, my ears and mind are more active than being a developer, my first short film competition, I won as best directorm.

But still I'm in software dev because this job makes me pay my bills. But then I started to notice this traits of my when doing my side projects vs being a software dev, my heart is torn.

Should I shift my career into multimedia or should I stay as a software developer?

15j24nf,Master's Career Advice - Would I get accepted into UCL or Cambridge?,"Hi everyone, I wanted to know what are the chances I would get accepted into MSc Machine Learning at UCL or MPhil Advanced Computer Science at Cambridge. This would be for 2024 entry.

  
For some background information, my undergrad was BSc Computer Science at Cardiff University where I obtained a First Class Honours in 2020. I have been working a SWE ever since. Alongside my part-time job, I’ve been focusing a lot on self-learning, and more recently into ML the past 4 months.

  
By the time of application I would have the Coursera certs, some projects behind me etc.

  
The reason I wanted to get a general feel for my chances is that for the year of 2023 I got accepted into Cardiff University for MSc Advanced Computer Science with their scholarship. The price difference would make it 10k cheaper than UCL Machine Learning. When I applied to my Cardiff masters, I wasn’t committed to ML like I am now and I feel 2 specified degrees programs match my interest a lot more. The main benefit of Cardiff is that I would be able to supplement my learning with external learning.

  
As you can tell it’s a fairly big risk, in the sense I would lose out on my masters at Cardiff and wouldn’t be able to go the following year, due to some life obligations etc.",DNOFHF,1,1.0,2,1691258162,2023-08-05 17:56:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15j24nf/masters_career_advice_would_i_get_accepted_into/,8,2023

Around this time 2 years ago I discovered the insurance industry. I’ve been so fascinated with helping people with my P&C license and L&H license. A few months ago however I was in a rear end accident and the person who was at fault was caught. Her insurance company and mine are in communication but still nothing has happened to help me recover from the collision. Because of the insurance companies treating me like a criminal and being dismissive of my situation, it’s left a bad taste in my mouth.

A little after that I got offered my own store as a store manager with the auto parts company I’m with. As of right now I’m a little torn on which career path to use.

I originally chose the insurance career because I see that people make a living do that and also tend to make significant amounts of money.

The auto parts store I’m with offered me 60000 dollars base salary plus 20% commission off of everything the store sells and 1% commission off of everything we sell for the year.

15izes7,Do I stay or go?,"I (33F) had a technical position in person for a city government for almost 2 years. I had to quit when we relocated 3 hours away for my husband's job. I had planned on being a SAHM for a while since we have a young child and all the good daycares here have extremely long wait lists.

6 weeks after I moved they called me and offered to create a 100% remote position with a slightly different title as a contractor. It's an hourly gig, no PTO, sick time or paid holidays, but it was a decent raise from what I had been making there previously to make up for the lack of benefits/vacation. I told them about my childcare issue and they said they were cool with me setting my own hours and watching her while I worked. Figuring I would be hard pressed to find another employer willing to accommodate that and considering that my husband carries our insurance, I took the job.

It was initially a 6 month contract- I've now been doing this for almost 2 years. Recently my kid *finally* got a full time daycare spot so I can search for another job elsewhere now if I want to.

I don't love my job, but the upsides:
-it's easy
-fully remote
-I'm good at it
-My opinions carry a lot of weight
-I'm very loosely managed/supervised
-it's extremely flexible with scheduling (which is very nice considering my husband's job is not flexible at all and someone needs to be able to watch our kid if she's sick or daycare is closed)
-my boss and bosses boss are always very impressed with my minimal efforts. 

It's nice to be somewhere I carry clout while I wear PJs and play with my dogs throughout the day.

The downsides: 
-there's a lot of office politics/bureaucracy/drama 
-it's kind of a weird position that's in between managerial and technical- but not enough of either of them to really benefit me when applying for technical or managerial jobs. Staying here may actually hinder my ability to get another technical position in the future. I'm responsible for a lot of employee coaching and development, I am pulled in with other managers to make policy decisions, I am handling vendor relations, I have the word ""manager"" as part of my title etc, but as I have started a precursory job search, the managerial jobs that pay comparably or more want you to have 3-5years of having a team of direct reports. I have no direct reports, I sign no time cards. 
-this is a contract position, so while I have been given zero indicators to believe they won't renew my contract again I don't have any guarantees of that.
-I have not gotten a raise in the 2 years I've been here- since I'm a contractor I don't qualify for the citywide cost of living increases (which has been a total of 9% in the time I've been here). This is also partially on me because I haven't asked, but I've never been in a position where I've had to and I was nervous about them not wanting to continue my contract if I asked for more money when I didn't have child care lined up.

I'm trying to decide whether it's worth staying here and trying to negotiate a raise for a position that's convenient and flexible- but stagnant in terms of mobility and not necessarily guaranteed to exist forever. If my contract was not renewed next January we could afford for me to be unemployed for a while but it would be very unideal to be paying for daycare for an undetermined amount of time while I job hunted.",Maryboo247,3,1.0,5,1691251361,2023-08-05 16:02:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15izes7/do_i_stay_or_go/,8,2023
15izb1e,They hired my 2nd team member at 70% higher pay.,"
Long time lurker. You guys have been so kind and helpful to others. I appreciate your help with this crazy situation.

I work in a startup.

Very small company. 13 people.

When I got hired, it was via cold email. I lost my job at another startup and thought I could provide value.

I interviewed. They liked me. They hired me at 75% of what I asked for. I didn't ask for much because I was jobless and afraid of homelessness, bankruptcy etc. So I walked in very underpaid. A poor ask and a worse offer. I negotiated very poorly - that's what it boils down to.

I come in and provide a ton of value. I release the CEO from doing a bunch of grunt work so he can go make deals and grow the company. The company grows 25% while I'm there. I give them some insight into growth that they use to grow. I take the burden of smaller tasks of the CEO. 

They need another member on the team. My best friend wants a job and he's got the skills. He goes in negotiating without anything to lose because he has a good job. They hire him at 70% higher than my pay. Nearly double. 

I can't think clearly because I'm so angry about this. I don't have any envy for my best friend. I want him to have so much money it's coming out of his eyeballs. I feel betrayed and uncared for by my company. 

It's obvious they trust me if they hire the guy I recommend and pay him whatever he wants. I guess I just feel uncompensated and unappreciated.

This sounds like a dumb question, but I feel like trying to negotiate my way out of a deep hole of underpay will never get me back where I want to be. 

Should I stay at a job that paid me nothing and paid my new teammate 70% more and try to negotiate knowing they'll always try to undercut me? Or should I roll the dice and look for somewhere I'm appreciated?",NickPlusYou,7,0.7400000095367432,7,1691251132,2023-08-05 15:58:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15izb1e/they_hired_my_2nd_team_member_at_70_higher_pay/,8,2023
15iz24j,What are some civil engineering careers that aren't strictly CAD?,"I am an undergrad studying civil engineering student graduating in the next few years. I have had three internships to this point. One summer as a field engineer traveling to and laboring at different job sites everyday (not even going to consider that for me as a career) and two summers spending 40 hours a week on Civil3D.  
After these experiences I don't think I am fit to spend that long at a desk, staring at a screen for 8 hours a day for the majority of my life. I didn't feel at all fulfilled by the work I was doing. My full-time coworkers were great and really nice people. They did not fit the ""engineer stereotype"" which I feel I do not either. Yet still, they all seemed fine with staring at their screens, with headphones in, only talking through online chats to one another.  
I was wondering if anyone with experience could let me know what kind of careers within civil engineering don't require you to design on a computer all the time but also don't require constant travel? If travel is necessary are there avenues/what is the timeline out of it as you climb the ladder? Something maybe with client interaction, more soft-skills/collaboration/activity.

15ixsf4,Torn between staying at my current job or taking new offer,"Full disclosure: this is going to be long so I apologize in advance lol

BACKGROUND: I’m 26F and work at a full-service advertising agency as a Social Media Manager. I’ve been at this job for about 1.5 years now and for the most part, I’ve really enjoyed my time here—the work we do is something to be proud of, and we collaborate with some really cool brands. I also get along well/have great relationships with most of my colleagues. The people here are very genuine and caring. However, I’ve had several grievances lately that have made my job less enjoyable in the past several months.

Most of the grievances stem from a lack of strong management and over capacity. We’ve been taking on a lot of new business lately, which has left a lot of us overwhelmed. As the only Social Media Manager at my agency, pretty much every new account has been left to me to manage. Additionally, we hired someone to direct our team several months ago (side note: our team had little to no oversight before she came on). While she’s very experienced, I find her to be extremely overbearing at times and micromanage-y. I feel like I can’t meet her expectations and can’t do my job to the best of my ability because of the workload.

One major concern I have is my ability to grow within the agency. Even though I was promoted a few months ago, I’ve been doing the same thing since I started (but with more responsibility/workload). I really want to learn new skills and do different things, but I know we’re currently not in the position to make this happen. I just feel bored and stuck in my role.

The previous agency I interned at before this position (they’re a digital marketing agency) reached out to me few months ago and asked to interview me for an open Social Media Strategist position they had. I went through with the interview and they selected another candidate. However, they contacted me a few days ago and offered me the position. 

Obviously I was confused and asked them what the circumstances were. They explained that they let them go because they were making a ton of minor spelling/grammatical errors when communicating with clients. It got to a point where a client made a comment about it. I mostly understand their reasons for letting them go, but it does make me feel a little uneasy.

My experience with this agency was great, though. I really learned a lot during my time there, and I liked the company as a whole. They have an outstanding work culture, and most of the people there are my age (Gen-Z and Millennials). Their policies and benefits are very progressive compared to my current employer, and they’re very ahead on social media best practices, trends, and platforms. In comparison, we’re pretty behind (another concern of mine if I stay).

I do think this position will be harder and challenge me more. There are certain skills that I don’t have experience with yet that they’re willing to train me on—at least that’s what they told me. I’d also be getting more exposure to other social platforms that we don’t use at my current job that I’m dying to get work experience with. I’m just worried that if I take this position, it’ll be a lot; as of now, they only have two other people on their social team. However, I know both of them personally and they were easy to work with. 

One major downside is their client base. Digital agencies typically work with less “sexy” clients, and a lot of the brands are pretty stale/boring compared to who I’m working with now. I’ve grown a little attached to the accounts I work on and would be sad to let some of them go.

FAST FORWARD TO NOW: I spoke with my superiors about this new opportunity and addressed all of my grievances. They took what I said very seriously and are finally making immediate hiring decisions. While that is promising and I do feel like things will get better, I’m still concerned about my long-term growth with the agency. I think we still have a lot of work to do, and it’ll be awhile until we catch up to the rest of the industry.

I’m also concerned I won’t grow much in my position and they’ll pigeonhole me to one specific role. My boss expressed that it’s her mission to help us all grow in our careers, but seeing how the work is divided/how our team is structured, I’m afraid that won’t be the case. Adding new people to the team could allow this to happen in the long-run though.

They’re matching the salary the other agency offered me. I have until Monday to make a decision. A part of me wants to see things through with my current employer and be patient with them, while another part of me wants to explore this new opportunity. I have no idea what to do.

He makes us reuse towels that have been on the line touching food, use it for the floor, then put it back on the line without cleaning it or changing out for a new one. I can’t wear thick vinyl gloves when cutting food because apparently my hand size for gloves is 5 times more expensive then the big flimsy plastic gloves.

There’s so much more, but those are some of the things that make me the most uncomfortable. The thing is I’ve never made this much money before, I’m a college student and only worked fast food so when I saw I was making $2,000+ a month because of tips I couldn’t believe it. I used to only make about $1,500 or less a month before. 

I’m also trying to find another job, but it’s hard because the very few interviews I get, it gets no where. The owner also doesn’t want me to quit because he told me I’m a good worker for a girl and he tells me he’ll promise to do better. 

Not sure what to do from here so any advice? I really don’t want to quit without a job lined up.",strawberriesandboba,1,1.0,0,1691244438,2023-08-05 14:07:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15iwmnq/not_sure_if_i_want_to_continue_working_at_my_job/,8,2023

I've (33M)  been working in SaaS sales my entire career. My last role unfortunately being in a start up where things got tough in the last 6 months. 

I have been very successful in all my previous roles, this one product and industry unfortunately is proving very difficult to sell (no marketing/demand, clients impacted by inflation and locked spending)

I'm scared cause the job market isn't looking pretty but on the other hand I feel it's my chance to move away from a career I chose just for the money and doesn't excite me. 

I have programming skills (Typescript, ReactJS) I can spin a web app fairly easily and would love to break into webdev as I enjoy it a lot. Problem is that there's a bazillion people with a portfolio trying to get their first dev job. 

Is there a career where having both sales and technical skills is seen as a plus?

15iugii,I messed up at work and my boss told me he doesn't know how I can sleep at night?,"This is a long and venty post but I'm a little thrown by something at work and would love some feedback on if I'm being too sensitive. I'm six months into my second job out of college and I was wondering if I could get insight into what the normal procedure is when you mess up at work? 

I work in communications for a company that handles utilities. I made my first big mistake at work, and was expecting to get written up. My boss verbally reprimanded me instead, but one of the things he said came off to me as unprofessional. 

I didn't bring up any excuses, I just apologized and told him that it was my fault. Honestly I probably could have brought up some other departments that didn't do things perfectly either and contributed to the mistake, but I never want to play the blame game at work.

I asked a question about a way to put a band-aid on the problem, and instead of answering me his response was that I ""was the reason a toddler didn't have access to water and that he didn't know how I could sleep at night,"" and that basically this was my problem to deal with. 

It just came across as very targeted to make me feel like a bad person. I am very motivated at work and I've only received positive feedback on my attitude and quality of work. I frequently work through lunch and stay late. I'm also always on call.

I'm obviously not perfect but I always own up to my mistakes and tell my supervisor what steps I'm taking to prevent repeating the same mistake. I don't know if his goal was to try to make me take it more seriously/not repeat the mistake, but I was already apologetic.

Afterwards I wound up just crying at my desk and working through lunch to get stuff pumped out. I've never cried at work before (and I've done long retail stints) but I couldn't stop thinking about that family with no water.

Now I'm more bothered by my boss having said that. I don't know, maybe I'm just being too sensitive, but I would have completely understood being written up or even terminated. It just felt very belittling and pointless and I'm still torn up about it.

Was his response normal in a professional setting? Should I just suck it up? Should I apologize again? He is the head of the company and I don't really know what I could do about this other than quietly look for a new job.",mpdhi,1,1.0,0,1691238525,2023-08-05 12:28:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15iugii/i_messed_up_at_work_and_my_boss_told_me_he_doesnt/,8,2023

Now, in my current job there is rapid advancement, and those who achieve and present well, go up, and fast. It is my dream to run a factory as an ops manager, but after 5 years I am struggling to see how to make it happen. 

Most recently I have been placed over a very advanced line in the company. We produce R&D meals to the customers so I work through a lot of unknowns and variability. I work long hours and have a large family who will remain priority.  Though I have the line running the best it ever has.... I have a bigger problem.

My current project we are developing a new product that requires me to work closely with my manager and a quality supervisor. Let's call the quality guy Z. 

Z is about 23YO. He is talented. Very talented. Through the progression of the project I have seen him slowly take over my project. We are at the point where I am practically ignored durring corporate meetings and questions go staight to Z.  

I have no hard feeling toward Z about this, but this is my project. I am sitting on a gold mine of opportunities and I am struggling to make myself be seen which is not like me. Everyday i feel just a little bit more worn down while i see Z keep going.

15irecm,I had the interview at 11:30 am and I got a text to complete i-9 and w-4 by 2:30 but I never got the job offer,"Yesterday I had an interview that I thought went well. When the interview ended she said that it might take up to a week or so to potentially get an offer and another for background check. She didn’t say that I got the job yet as the process make take some time for higher ups to potentially approve her decision and start the potential hiring process. I got a text message from her at 2:30 pm to please complete the forms she emailed me. 
I read the forms and the first section was authorization for criminal background check , second section was I-9 and third section was w-4.
I broke the pdf up and signed the document for criminal background check and attached two forms of id but I didn’t fill out the I-9 or W-4. On the I-9 it clearly states that I am not to fill out the I-9 until my first day of employment and after I accepted the job. I stated in my email that I authorize a criminal background check for the possibility of employment and I attached two forms of ID to the document, however I cannot legally complete the I-9 and W-4 since I am not an employee as I have not been given an offer yet. 

I guess that I did well on the interview. I’m not sure about accepting the offer anyway. It’s allot of travel and potentially really bad hours. I have been unemployed for several months so I’ll take it but I’m not signing any tax or government documents until I a been officially offered the position and accepted the job offer. 

Did I do the right thing ? I’m fine doing the background check as that’s normal for a potential job but I don’t feel comfortable filling out the rest of the paperwork.

15ir14o,Student needing advice on her game art career,"Hi. I am currently in school for a Bachelor's in game art and I have been thinking a lot about my future. I would really appreciate it if anyone who currently works in the industry, or has in the past, would give me some advice. 

I am 23 years old and I started art at a very young age. The earliest I can remember is age 9 and my first drawing was a Sonic character; Rouge the bat. I've been playing video games all my life. I've a long line of game systems and handhelds under my belt. I kept drawing traditionally, and at age 16, in my Kik era, I discovered digital art. I've been doing tradigital art ever since then and i've grown, but i'm worried. 

I am a full time student and a full time worker (retail) and I rarely have motivation to draw after the day is done. I get art block frequently until i hear a song that makes me think of something or see an image, person, or environment that inspires me to draw. I want to work in the game industry as a 2D & 3D character/environment artist, but i'm scared because i don't create ""video game characters."" Because of my major and because I don't know what to expect from the industry, I often think that I need to draw characters thay could be seen in video games on a person's screen. I get nervous that if my portfolio isn't game characters or scenarios of what would be in a video game, i'll get overlooked or booted out. 

I still have a lot to learn and I won't graduate until October of 2025, but it worries me about my future because I want to be the best. I know that it requires a lot of practice, patience, dedication, and motivation to succeed in such a skill, and i'm willing to do all those things. Right now, I just draw what I want and I post it to my socials. I'm just not sure if it's the quality of the work, the story, the ambience, the characters themselves, or what. Also, i'm not sure just yet what company i want to work with, but I do know I want to make my own game in the future. 

My questions are: What should I expect in my line of work as a 2D & 3D character/environment artist? Should I be focused on solely drawing characters that can exist in a video game? Should my portfolio only include video game characters/environments? How do i know what is considered ""correct?""

Bonus question(s), but kind of off topic: Sometimes i draw provacative women, but I never post them. If I did start posting them (because I plan on starting my own shop soon that will include some merch with provacative wording/women/men like stickers, etc) would that hinder my placement in the industry? Will I be looked down on for drawing those kinds of things? 

TLDR: I'm studying for a Bachelor's in game art and i'm worried about what my portfolio should look like, if i'm only supposed to draw video game-esque things, and if sexual characters will hinder my future employment.",Realistic_Thanks_643,1,1.0,0,1691227410,2023-08-05 09:23:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15ir14o/student_needing_advice_on_her_game_art_career/,8,2023

15iqftg,Career advice - switching careers,"Howdy, as the title says, I am currently trying to map out a 3 year plan and wanted to get some advice from some seasoned professionals. 

I come from a legal background, did my undergraduate degree in law and my master's in law and then worked in a legal/compliance based role for 5 years after college. 

I then transitioned into a HR based role which was very much ops focused but gave me excellent exposure to a small team environment. I was promoted from HR senior to HR manager in under 5 months but unfortunately the company decided to move it's entire operation abroad and moving was not an option. I tried for a long period to get a similar role and unfortunately due to only having a years experience in HR, I could not land a role at a similar level. I was offered roles at a more junior level that would have required me to take a monstrous hit to my salary which was a no go with children. 

Due to the lack of available roles, I moved into a recruitment background as I felt it was at least relevant and would benefit me going forward. However, I have fallen in love with the role and will progress quickly with my current company. I should be at C suite level within 3 years all going well. 

My predicament is that I currently love recruitment but I know this isn't a long term and I would like to transition back into HR. Worth noting that I am currently building out a team and will oversee the HR functions within that team, but it's not exactly.the experience I would need.

How hard would you say a transition would be back into a HR role? Has it been done? Any tips/advice/guidance please

15im52z,A Letter to the Young Professionals,"Dear Post-Millennials,  
  
Welcome to the professional world! This is a field full of challenges and opportunities, and I would like to take this opportunity to share some insights and words of encouragement that I believe will be helpful to you on your new journey.  
  
First, let me remind you that navigating the professional world is not always easy. You may encounter obstacles, moments of uncertainty, or even failure. However, remember that these are integral to growth. Every setback is an opportunity to learn, and every failure is a stepping stone to success. As the American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald (F. Scott Fitzgerald) once said: ""Never confuse a failure with a final failure."" Keep at it, because only by overcoming challenges can we truly grow.  
  
Second, I want to encourage you to have confidence in your abilities. You are a unique generation of unparalleled innovation and limitless potential. You have the power to change the world and shape the future. So whatever you do, do it with confidence that you can achieve it. Only those who dare to venture too far have the possibility of knowing how far they can go. ""  
  
Finally, I want to emphasize that innovation is the driving force for our progress. In this fast-moving world, we cannot be complacent, stop learning, stop exploring. We have to keep innovating, keep trying new things, keep challenging ourselves. Only in this way can we maintain our competitive advantage and succeed in the professional field. Innovation distinguishes between leaders and followers.  
  
I hope these suggestions are helpful to you. I look forward to witnessing your professional performance and believe that you will excel. Remember, wherever you go and whatever you do, maintain your enthusiasm, innovative spirit and love of learning. Because these are your strengths, these are your strengths.

15ilqr7,Human Resources Career?,"Hi! I am a recent college grad and am going to get my masters this fall in Industrial/Organizational Psych. I am conflicted on what to do as my career path and want to avoid making a big mistake.

I am very interested in the field of HR, and currently have an internship offer in this field i have yet to accept. I am worried that pursuing this field will not grant me financial security one day - I have heard both ends of the spectrum. Ultimately, my question is whether HR is a field worth pursuing, as it is what I feel i would enjoy most in a career, or should I look elsewhere (business operations, etc?) I know this is ultimately preference but i am mostly concerned about the financial aspect of it. I would love opinions from people who are in the HR field or have been in a similar boat before.

I'm 23 so I'm currently trying to really crack down on what I want to do. So I have an background in working with kids and in education, I've worked for educational non profits, schools, and a daycare. I deeply enjoyed the non profits but I was stressed but I did manage to get  into a leadership position but the entire time I was making less than minimum wage/minimum wage. I have an Associates in Early Childhood Education. I LOVE working with children, it makes me happy and gives me a sense of fulfillment to help young minds learn. It has been my dream since I was a kid. 

I currently work part time at an after school program, I live with family and I'm really taking this time to realize something: my dream will make me poor. I really don't want to be 30 and still worry about paying rent or affording groceries. So, now I'm in a software engineering program, I'll theoretically make money and I sincerely think I'm making the right career move and financial move on paper. That's what everyone tells me. But I'm so worried I won't be happy. I live in California, I know the numbers say if I work in tech here I'll make more money but it's so difficult to imagine earning more than 20k a year. Do people really make that much more? For anyone working in tech do you feel job satisfaction? Does anyone have any career advice so that I can maybe combine both or alternatives? Thank you.

15ikyfg,Career growth and How to find a lifelong mentor?,"I have been working in Software engineering for 5 years now and switched from a smaller startup like company to a global MNC. I have been in this global MNC for 3 years and got a promotion to SDE-2. 

However, I want to grow my career and get into managerial roles. I see a few of my level peers becoming Director at smaller firms, SDMs at some companies and a few years ahead of me into VP and Director levels. 

Am I missing something to have my career growth? 

One thing that I do notice is people have mentors who they talk to about such things and who guide them, at least on LinkedIn thats how it looks like. I don't have any such mentor and I feel this is one of the reason I don't have an answer to my career questions and to guide my career growth. How do people get mentors? and how are people able to move up the ladder (Ik its not a simple answer) ?

15ikw3j,Burnout + Work issues has me considering quitting,"Hello good people. I will keep this as simple as I can.

I am a software engineer 5 years experience working on a scale up. It has been okay for a while but this has been changing slowly. Since I joined the team has shrunk from like 10 to 3 people with one being relatively new. So the workload has really increased.

I was working with an agency and after my one year my boss told me the company wanted to employ me directly which I eventually agreed and parted ways well with the agency(without signing the contract with company first, I know!). Fast forward three months later, I have no contract and 2 months delayed payment. HR actually had no idea I “changed” contracts. So my boss was lying to me about following up?

My boss has been passive aggressive with me this whole month and hostile, including pushing me to a project he was having issues with his superior on. I ended up being the punching bag on both ends because they did not want to communicate. They both went on vacation twice and came back while I have been working on this project. My boss ended up actually shouting at me on a call and apologized some minutes later.

I have lost weight, cannot sleep, headaches, , involuntary muscle twitches, body aches, I don’t know if I should even trust them at all. The HR is following up on a contract but I don’t know if I want to work here anymore.
I know I need rest and to chose myself and the uncertainty of it all scares me, the job market and all. A few people are telling me to stay and it shall pass but I don’t see how.

I just need some insight on people who have quit because of similar circumstances. What were your fears, what were your reassurances?
How did things work out for you?
Thanks

TL;DR: I'm a software engineer with a shrinking team and growing workload. After switching from agency to direct employment, I've been unpaid for 2 months and still don't have a contract.

15ik27q,Unemployed Software Engineer,"Hi all,
Figured I would ask here to see if anyone has some ideas. I am a 26 year old software engineer who was caught up in some layoffs in June (3 weeks after being hired, so still mad). I have been applying to a bunch of jobs but haven't heard too much from any if them and I am considering whether I should give up the the software engineer thing. The problem is, I don't know what.

I was an idiot when I first left home and dropped out of university going for computer science and have done a couple jobs since then. I was a manager of a department at an online educational company and then moved to become a title agent for four years. I married my wife while doing that and decided I needed to get my life going and went to a programming bootcamp and got a job and about 1 year of experience before switching companies and immediately being laid off.

The problem is that we recently had our first child about a month ago and my wife would really like to be a SAHM. For the immediate future, my income is the one that matters. I would like to think about options that pay alright in the immediate future and very well later. For comparison, my last job paid 90k a year. I live in a very rural area so my options are a little limited.

15ijyvy,Can I put an internship I quit on my resume?,"I was interning at a small firm on wall street. The internship was supposed to be a little over 2 months but I only stayed for a month and a half before I quit. The work was highly demanding, and high pressured and I got no guidance from any of my supervisors (most were working from home.) I also had to commute for two hours to get there which didn't make it any easier. I know I shouldn't have quit and that I should've stuck through but my mental health was taking a really heavy toll and I was starting to get suicidal thoughts. However I still did get some good experience and worked on some meaningful projects that would sound good in an interview. I'm applying for full-time work now and I know that I want to pivot to another, less pressured aspect of finance after having this experience. So if the jobs I'm applying for are in a different city and a different field of finance, is it still possible to put this on my resume or should I just leave it out?

15igz63,What should I do? Working 56 hours a day while paying off a mountain of student loans,"
I am currently working two jobs, every single day (60 hours a week) while living alone in Arkansas.  I am also paying off a large amount of student loans for a degree completely unrelated to what I do for work.  For background I am a male in his late 20s.  

Here’s how I got to where I am.  I grew up in the Bay Area and my parents wanted me to go to an expensive college (UC Berkeley). I made it clear to them that I wanted to go to a cheaper school instead but they ended up writing an admission letter behind my back and submitting it.  Suffice to say I ended up barely graduating from Berkeley with a 2.4 gpa and lots of student debt.  

My father is also mentally ill and thinks he’s a religious messiah.  He refused to work and I ended up working and all of my money went to my parents.  I had zero savings.  My stay at home dad would constantly criticize my entry level job and compare me to people working in tech (making high salaries) while simultaneously emphasizing how he’s the new Jesus Christ.  He’s made me feel unsafe numerous times and I left .  He and his wife have even tried to sue me to force me to continue paying his rent.  Simply put, i left my parents (they are my only relatives in the USA) and I think I was right to do so.   I also cut off all contact with them (they don’t know I’m living in Arkansas)

Anyway about 2 years ago I requested an internal job transfer within my company to move out of state from Arkansas to California.   I know that this sounds stupid silly but I wanted to leave California to put distance between me and my parents.  I wanted to go somewhere “my parents couldn’t easily drive to”.  Obviously Arkansas is quite far from California. Arkansas’s lower cost of living was an another factor influencing my decision as well.  My parents also prohibited me from studying abroad or out of state so I was desperate to experience life outside of the California. 

 I feel like I’m drifting in this world with no real purpose except working at my two jobs to pay off student loans.  I’m not really sure where to go from here.  The thing I miss the most about the Bay Area are the diverse food options and the walk ability (Arkansas has many areas with no sidewalks and no street lamps at night).   I toyed with the idea of moving to an exciting city like NYC or Chicago.  However I know that’s unrealistic if I’m being honest with myself.  Since I have quite a few friends in the California it would be more realistic to move there instead.

What would you do in my situation? How f**cked up is my life?  Should I keep slaving away at my two jobs in Arkansas to pay off my student loans? Should I look for a new higher paying job and work less hours? Should I move to back to the Bay Area?  How can I make myself feel more fulfilled and less aimless?

This company is pretty big (over 20,000 employees company wide). I wanted to work for this company because the pay is above average and they offer the best health insurance. No complaints there.

I applied for and accepted this position with the intent on applying for something else internally in a year. I have a BA in English with a minor in communications. I want to be an Office Manager or something else in administration at this company.

My job duties are insanely easy. I check patients in. I already have a basic understanding of the difference health insurances both government and commercial (I had this experience beforehand and this position adds to that.) I am planning on discussing with my supervisor next week if they'd be open to letting me learn medical coding and billing soon. We use Epic software but I think the name changed to something else recently.

What else should I try to learn so that I'm in a better position to apply for something higher paying internally in a year?

15ifwxz,Negotiating salary for internal hire that is a higher pay grade,"I have been a health insurance social worker (information and resources only) for almost a year. My department is now overhauling and giving everyone in my position 99% of the job duties of a RN case mamager without any change in compensation.  As such, I have applied for a lcsw case manager position thinking at least I'd get paid for the new stress and get back into Behavioral health, where my passion lies. 

The position is a higher pay grade and is in private commercial insurance instead of the current Medicare program so im assuming it should be considered an internal hire instead of a promotion.  ThebRecruiter said I'm a great fit, my experience is spot on and I'm the first and only applicant so far (only open for 4 days). Being modest but I'm perfect for the position and if I don't push too hard on salary I'm positive I have the job.

Online it says promotions range from 3 to 10%, obviously much closer to 3% but this isn't a promotion And 10% increase of curren pay  falls wayyyy below mid salary for the posted pay grade of the new position. 

As an external hire I would come in slightly higher than the mid level of the salary range and settle around middle. It's fair and I'm worth it. Is the same strategy appropriate as an internal candidate? 

I'm not trying to be greedy but I know my worth. They keep saying it's lateral move  but it is a different department, higher pay grade and it is not technicaly a lateral move or else I would have to wait until the end of my first year to apply.

15ifte1,"In my first high-paying job but have an unbearable manager, what should I do?","Hello everyone. I'm a 25M and graduated with a degree in Sociology 3 years ago. I currently work as a client engagement manager (salesperson) at a major semiconductor industry after working low-paying jobs in healthcare administration over the last couple of years.  
When my manager hired me to the job, he came off as expecting but chill/flexible. This on top of the pay of $80,000 (+ approximately $10,000 in bonuses) meant that I would be joining a job that paid me very well, I got to work from home most days, had very little supervision, was career-advancing, and with a personable manager.  


But gradually over the last year, he has become unbearable. He's aware I'm a photographer in my spare time and has accused me of letting my photography be a distraction (aka 2nd job) anytime I make an understandable one time mistake on the job. On July 4th this year, my camera bag with $2,000 worth of camera lenses and my car/apartment/mail keys were stolen as I was taking pictures of fireworks. I called him to let him know I would be working the next day (taking meetings on my phone) but that I was locked out of my apartment until noon. He called me, first feigning sympathy by sharing a time his car was stolen just to ultimately say ""that the way that event stopped getting me to care about cars, this event is an opportunity to stop focusing on photography and focus on your job."" He also implied that is showed a lack of commitment to my career that I was out taking pictures of fireworks at 10:00 instead of being home asleep. I was a victim of crime and was taking pictures of fireworks like anyone else, His response was disgusting.  


During the interview process, I told him I have a history of cancer gastrointestinal diseases that I haven't had proper treatment for due to lack of insurance/low income. This can result in unexpected needs to use the bathroom and other potentially disruptive actions. He said he understood and would be accommodating. Over the last year, I've only called out sick one time and missed a single day for a colonoscopy. However, there was a day where I missed a virtual company wide meeting because I started unexpectedly puking constantly. I told my manager about it and he said ""I'm tired of hearing about your health."" I was floored, a completely betrayal of the promises he made me.  


Some other grievances: There have been numerous instances where he has given my team and I unclear instructions, berated us for it, and didn't apologize (or even acknowledge) when we proved he was unclear. The accounts I was given t engage with were known as neglected/abandoned, I was starting from square one when it came to getting meetings and he has refused to acknowledge the unique struggles that comes from that. I'm expected to just miraculously pull meetings out of hats with potential clients that don't show up. Finally, he has recognized many times that he ""might"" be unreasonable but that I have to deal with it to prove myself at the company.  


It sucks that a job that has advanced my career and given me such financial stability (especially for someone my age) is being undercut by an unreasonable and unapproachable manager I've attempted to withstand/talk to numerous times. I'm scared to leave this job, I'm not sure I will find one that pays this much and allows me to work from home. But I'm desperate.

15ifc7r,"I feel totally stuck, so I came here","This is me thinking outloud.

I'm in the UK.

I'm 27f with a baby & a partner. 

We could have it worse.

We have a clean & structurally sound house. 

My partner has a decently waged job (he's a bartender at an upmarket venue, so decent hourly pay and good tips.)

But I feel entirely lost when it comes to my future.

I always wanted to be a journalist, novelist or writer, but I have no idea where to start. I have drafts of stuff saved on my computer, but nowhere to send them.

I worked in schools as a freelance provider of specialist education, & I had fixed term job at an art gallery which ended about a month before my baby arrived. But while I do like teaching (some of the time) & I have had good days in the arts (at other times), now I'm a mother, I don't know about staying in such an unstable sector.

I've been looking for work to go back to to help support us. But I've been turned down so many times the last 4 months, either at interview stage or even before, I can't help but feel depressed. I get that my field (the arts) is one of the most competitive there is, but still.

I've been wondering about retraining as a software engineer - I've worked in the digital arts, I've always been a major video games nerd & I'm starting to wonder why I never tried going into the industry professionally.

I've been wondering about retraining as a solicitor - I'm obsessed with reading r/LegalAdviceUK, and I worked for a claims company for a bit between art gallery jobs & really enjoyed the legal side.

I've been wondering about running away with my partner & child, and living up a mountain in Germany raising sheep - I hate most of humanity & I like speaking other languages, German being the one I'm learning now.

Ever since my baby was born, I've been diagnosed with postnatal OCD & ADHD, & I wonder if this is contributing.

15if9ev,Feel like I am getting pushed out (again?),"Pardon the burner account — a slightly career/reputation sensitive post, so I've opted for the anonymous route. 

I've worked for a early stage company for a year and was a pretty early hire in a fairly senior role. Company has really taken off. Small, tight team. 

We recently made a hire for someone more senior than me in my department, which is fine — I'm 100% for it if this person can help us 10x! But I can't help but feel that I'm slowly getting edged out. It's totally reasonable and fine for me to report to this person, but there's a vibe of ""bringing their people in"", reducing my scope of work (which actually could be okay; I've definitely felt stretched thin), reducing my frequency of interactions with senior leadership/founders, etc. 

I genuinely want this company to succeed and I'm genuinely excited about what I've achieved here. Maybe I'm paranoid (I was edged out of two companies in sorta quick succession a year or so ago as a core contractor/contributor), or maybe there's politicking happening here, or maybe I'm genuinely terrible to work with! But so far I've got on awesome with everyone at this company, and it's been a great situation up until now. 

Am I paranoid? Am I bowing too easily to ideas and adjustments that concern me? Am I the problem? At this point I'm not sure if I should speak louder about what I want and where I think my responsibilities lie, or if I should just go with the flow and get the job done. It's a tricky balance of being ambitious while also not wanting to appear like I'm threatening or challenging this person — because I genuinely do not want there to be conflict or a power struggle here.

Do I talk with my founder? Do I talk directly with this new person to set expectations and build clarity to foster more trust? And if this does keep happening, **why**? 

Situations like this definitely trigger a lot of anxiety, which I'm prone to. I'm trying to be self-reflective and not jump to conclusions here, but I feel like my emotional intelligence isn't terrible, either.

Thanks in advance for the advice, folks!

- current company is the market leader. Unbiased their tech is superior and more popular worldwide 
- I get vested in a pension at 5 years with the company 
- my understanding is benefits pretty much mirror each other 
- I get good salary and quarterly bonuses when we hit quota. The team is great and regularly hits and overachieved quota 
- i am one of the busiest people on team constantly in cases and making the company serious money 
- competitors do not do many cases at all and must have alot of downtime

15ib8bn,Would it make sense to leave my jjob in TV News given my circumstance?,"Graduated college last December with a degree in video production, have been working in TV News for the past year- this is not what I want to do as a career (I want to do commercial/advertising editing) but took the job to save money and get good experience on my resume. I don't really ..hate the job? But I really am starting to get burnt out with it.  
  
  
  
Recently my boss has been taking advantage of me (which I get, seeing as turnover in this industry is expected and I'm one of the new people)- shifting my schedule around weekly (I already work 3am morning shifts, so changing up my schedule throws me off when it goes from 3am start to 10:30am start), giving me days where I have less than 10 hours between shifts(off at 6:30, in at 3), sending me to places that are 1.5-2 hours away to film and report and then edit and drive back, which causes me to get out late. On top of this I am very underpaid- currently making a bit over $18/hr. As I said- I only took this job for the experience and the resume addition. I do get healthcare/overtime and paid vacation/sick time.  
  
  
  
I am thinking of quitting in the next 2 months and taking time off to work an easy part-time job (I already have past experience at a place walking dogs which is very low stress and very relaxed) while I job hunt, but am worried that a year of experience is too little for other places to want to hire me, especially with the current job market (although, on my resume I did list my school experience as a professional gig, because it WAS paid employment- and it was the same stuff I'm doing now, so really it looks like 3\~ish years of industry experience). However I don't really need to stress finding my next career job immediately, as I have about $17k saved up and with the SAVE act going through my payments will be no more than $60 a month- my savings accrues this monthly in a HYSA. I also live at home, so do not have bills regarding housing. My loan total amount is just over $32k.  
  
  
  
I am just wondering if I should be so worried about quitting, given my situation- or if I should do it. It would take a ton of stress off my life and allow me to have some breathing room while looking for my next job. But then I would be not knowing when my next 'real job' will come by, etc.

15ib569,How do I deal with a 3 year unemployment gap on resume even though I wasn’t technically unemployed?,"**TLDR:**  
**-Left high-paying tech job**  
**-Started videography business in Mexico with family member. I worked remotely. Not official, no business paperwork filed in Mexico or USA for it.**  
**-No job here in the USA therefore I’ve been technically “unemployed” for several yrs even though I have been working on the vid business. I've had to put ""unemployed"" in last 2 tax filings.**  
**-I have also been taking care of sickly family member during this entire time.**  
**-Trying to get a regular job again but don’t know whether to put videography business on resume even though I never filed any official paperwork in Mexico or USA for it.**  
**-If I don’t add it, I will have a 3yr unemployment gap on resume**  
**-If I do add it & potential employer runs a background check, it probably won’t show up anywhere because we had no paperwork for it. They will assume I lied on my resume.**  
**-See last paragraph for my questions as to what I should do.**  
Please bear with me as I explain this. After college I worked at a large company for 2 years from 2017-2019. After 2yrs I left for personal reasons having to do with the health of a family member & other issues. Looking back, it was a terrible decision, but I digress. I did not burn any bridges with any colleagues. I had saved up a lot of money to the point where I budgeted out being able to live off my savings for a few years while living with my parents. A few months after I left, I decided to travel to Mexico (where my fam is from) I was talking to a cousin about life and how I wanted to try doing something I loved at least before getting married or having kids.

We both love videography so we thought it would be a nice idea to start a videography business. The problem was I could not stay in Mexico so we sort of agreed that I would stay here in the US, I would put the money so he could buy equipment, he would do the actual on-site filming, and we would both share editing. We did not create an official business or file any paperwork in Mexico (or here in the US). Just started getting clients & getting paid cash. We paid no taxes (you can get away with a lot over there).

At this point (6 months after leaving my previous corporate job) I still had no official job here in the US. So I then found a part-time job working at a local computer repair shop. The pay was horrible but it was enough to pay for a few bills so my savings wouldn’t drain so fast. So, from mid 2019 to late 2020 I worked at this PC repair shop and I was also doing work for the video business with my cousin in Mexico. The video business brought in almost no money for me, but I didn’t care much because I wanted to slowly build our portfolio and most importantly, our connections.

Then in late 2020 stuff hit the fan. I had a few fam members pass away due to covid and the family member I mentioned earlier got sick once again. I left the PC repair job and focused solely on editing for the vids with my cousin in Mexico & taking care of my family member. Since nothing was official, I was technically unemployed from late 2020 up until now. I traveled to Mexico a few times to try to get the videography business going but it went nowhere, especially after covid hit. This year I completely gave up on the dream of making it with that video production business. Now I am trying to go back to the company I had left in 2019...but I don’t know how to go about it...

***I have a 3yr gap from late 2020 to now in 2023 where I have technically been unemployed in the eyes of the US gov. I have not collected any unemployment benefits at all so no, I did not commit any fraud there. I don’t know whether I should mention in my resume that I was unemployed during this time or if I should mention the videography thing? But if I put the videography work, and then they run a background check and see I was “unemployed”, what happens then? Even if they look for the business in Mexico it won’t show up because we did everything cash with no official business filings. Should I just say I was unemployed because I had to take care of a sickly family member and leave it at that? But then they’d think I have done absolutely nothing for 3 years.*** Not to mention, the PC repair job I had for about a year was nowhere near the level of work I was doing at this company that I’m almost embarrassed to put it as work experience. I went from getting an extremely good salary at this company to getting paid $13.50/hr part-time at the pc repair shop. I’m almost want to omit it from my resume but, they can find out I had it anyway right? I also haven’t been doing any “relevant” work since I left...nothing that was related to the job I previously had.

Guys I need some opinions on how to deal with my education & professional life.

I'm in my early 20s, I started with my bachelor's a little late. I don't like my batchmates.

It's not a good feel as I didn't want to choose a film school in the place and I am serious about this career. I wanted to make films on side & grow my portfolio and pursue a degree unrelated to films but beneficial to me in the long run. 

I really wanted to study PPE. Now I am considering to do the first year, so I can make connections (alumni, professors, etc) and drop out. Join another course. Should I do that? 

If I drop out, I want to study economics, English literature, or political science.

15iayp4,FASHION OR PSYCHOLOGY?,"Hi, I am an incoming second year student at UBC who is interested in fashion. Its something I have always loved but thought was too risky to follow. I thought I'll major in psychology since I really enjoyed it in high school and thought I could get into things like HR or marketing..basically I thought its more practical esp as someone who isn't inclined towards math or typical science subjects. Lately I have been thinking of either shifting my major or the institution itself but this seems risky esp as an international student.   
Moreover, UBC does not have the option to major in fashion or anything related to it but it does have media studies for which I will have to enquire. The option of visual arts is also there but that just seems smthn too difficult to get jobs in and with how much digital art is booming I can only think of choosing it as a minor instead of taking it as my entire undergrad degree.   
Jobs like art/ creative director where there isn't work like sewing but instead involves managing people and working in a creative environment seems fun! (maybe smthn like art/ creative director? even tho I know that requires a lot of experience). Which jobs within fashion should I look at given I cannot sew or do much of math? I want to be able to travel a lot, ear what I want and be surrounded with clothes and just overall all creative people..while I know this might sound stupid its what I have always thought and while I was reading I saw that there are jobs that do have these aspects, its just people have gotten them through different paths and its not much talked about, hence I would love to know more about it before making such a big decision!  
I am an international student so changing countries or institutions definitely requires time and energy and plus education is also expensive which is why if I can get done with a bachelor's and get into the industry I want then that would be really good. I do NOT want to be stuck in a job/ industry I do not like, I definitely do better in a place where I am genuinely interested. I have started taking relevant online courses such as in fashion and digital marketing (ps if there are any free courses out there with certificates pls let me know since most are paid!).  
Can someone pls suggest what my next steps should be in terms of how to go about getting a job in fashion? I am open to doing a masters also but if I can get closer to doing what I want to do later now itself then that just sounds better tbh. If there is anyone from UBC or anyone in the fashion or any other creative industry, I would love to know your suggestions!! For those with experience in the industry, how does getting a relevant degree help as opposed to getting a degree like psy or media studies or lets say political science? Is it too difficult to get good paying jobs and does it get easier once you get your foot in the door?

So now last week I got an offer from a smallish but ambitious firm. They said I was overqualified but they'd like to have me. They extended an offer of 1/3 my earlier monthly salary and suggested i stick around for a month before we lock it as permanent. 

I'm worried i should not have taken up the offer at all. I already accepted on call yesterday and i regret it. 

What should I do? Pull out of it and keep searching for relevant work or do this for now?.",DrummerAvailable,4,0.8399999737739563,3,1691180245,2023-08-04 20:17:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15ialwe/dont_like_the_job_quit_before_i_join/,8,2023
15i9brc,Currently Overqualified for my Position?,"When I first applied with the company I’m currently at, I was told my qualifications didn’t match BUT that I could interview for a position 1 level below it. I agreed, thinking with my work ethic I could easily move up in 6 months to a year. I had a full year of professional experience at a company in the finance industry along with a bachelor’s from a 4 year university (hook ‘em!).

I made the absolute best with what little opportunity I was given, and finally got the chance to truly crush it at my job a month ago. My question? The level above me I originally applied to had Basic qualifications of a high school diploma/ GED and minimum 2 years of professional experience… I was a year removed from college so at the time asked the recruiter about it and was just straight up told no. It was either bite the bullet or stay at a company with less pay and zero benefits outside of 401k matching.

15i9abm,Should I start looking for a new job?,"I (late 20’s, no kids or mortgage) just started a new job two months ago at a large corporate retailer working in the marketing analytics space. So far, I have been very unimpressed with the company’s use if analytics and innovation and I am worried I am wasting my time working here. I’ll list out some things that make me feel like I’m not gaining much by working here. 

-They have a strong habit of “do what they did last year” for pretty much every marketing campaign and analysis even if it makes no sense. Push-back on this usually results in discussions focused on vanity rather than technical details of one analysis vs another.
-Despite having a masters degree in statistics and a background in programming, I spend all of my time between Excel and Powerpoint, as the company has historically not been open to adopting new tools for advanced analytics.
-The job requires 2 days in an office and so the office is nearly completely empty for 3 days of the week. And the internal communication application is nearly dead silent as the company prefers to use email for all communication. So I feel like I’m not even able to expand my professional network, see what work others are doing or learn from other people here.
-My own boss is regularly away from his desk for multiple unexplained hours at a time and often signs off at 3 in the afternoon with no heads up.

Upside: the pay is very very good and the work is not difficult or time consuming (classic corporate facepalm). I feel like I should have an optimistic view, like, “there is so much room for growth at this company!”, but I can already sense my exhaustion and lack of motivation increasing. I sense that most other people that work here feel that way. Especially the young and ambitious people.

Jokes are welcomed but also looking for serious advice for weather I should really try to push this corporate behemoth to really using advanced analytics, put my head down and focus on some hobbies while I collect cash or hit the job market again and try to find a place that is going to challenge me and give me more opportunities to learn.",newisroutine,1,1.0,0,1691177219,2023-08-04 19:26:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15i9abm/should_i_start_looking_for_a_new_job/,8,2023
15i92j3,I can't imagine myself working anywhere without feeling miserable,"For context, Im F21 and was an excellent student in school. I come from an immigrant background (Russia) but have been born in Spain and Im pretty Spanish at this point. The last 2 years of high school I got into a very good public school in Spain and scored almost a 100% in the Spanish final exam (the one that everyone takes to get into Uni). Besides that, I managed to also be very active in my music school, where I could have pursued a career as a musician in the Netherlands. Since I was in my last year of School when COVID came, it hit me hard emotionally, I suddenly felt many fears I didnt have before about leaving my home and decided to make a decision that wouldn't surprise anyone, studying a degree in Translation (I spoke fluently 4 languages).

I am beginning my last year in Uni next month and I am looking forward to leaving Uni as soon as possible. Even though it is considered one of the best places of the country to study my degree, I hate almost everything about it. I feel no interesting ""push"" or ""drive"", I just feel that my classmates are there to finish uni and get a job, they just talk about tiktoks and influencers and to me their lifes feel kinda worthless (in the literal sense, I feel their work, energy, passion, youth is not leading to anything that would be good for anyone). I also get kinda depressed with a few of my teachers, who look like their lifes are extremely monotone and sad. Most of them are bad teachers that I know are not bad people, thay just look like they have no aspirations in life (not even to teach us well). I definitely feel quite often that everyone around me is very conformist, and accepts mediocrity as a means of life. (sidenote, my uni is private and many of my classmates are from higher social classes, which I find strange since they are the people with more means to archieve whatever they want in life).

My issue is that I have to choose what to do with my life and I simply dont know to. I know that working as a translator in front of a computer all day for the rest of my life would break my soul. And I also have doubts that this would be a possible future for me (since technology might make us switch to another working role). I know that I am capable of doing anything I set myself to, I am just completely clueless in what way to work. If I had a goal, I would know what steps to take, but I simply have no idea.

I try to imagine myself in 10 years working somewhere and having a ""normal happy day"", but I really cant. I know I would hate to have a boring job that fills my days with tasks that bring good to no one but my boss. I would like to do something that's socially valued, but this is such a broad goal that it doesn't really help me. I also don't know what skills I could learn now that would be useful in 10 years. I am pretty disenchanted with my uni experience and that also made me reluctant of educational institutions (I feel they just want your money and dont value your time nor goals). I also know I would love to be surrounded by people that have done things that I admire and that push me forward, motivate myself, and give me faith in the future (am I asking for too much?).

Honestly, I would be grateful for any advice you could give me. Both life advice and career advice. If someone knows more about my sector, I would love that kind of experiences/advices/opinions.

I also sometimes think I should send everything to hell and go to music uni to be a musician. Low on money, but high for the soul.

15i8v44,Overqualified and stagnant. How do I assuage doubt about my candidacy?,"
I’ve been in my position for about 5 years now.  It’s been widely known and commented on that I am overqualified for the position. It was meant to be a one year stepping stone, but then 2020 happened.  I took on new responsibilities and was promoted some, but it was the same position at heart.  At least I didn’t get laid off during the pandemic, right?

In looking for new opportunities now, the feedback that I receiving during my current job search is that experiences related to the field in level I am seeking are too old and that I need to find ways to showcase how I am using the skills now. I will be shifting content areas (searching for roles in L&D) and there aren’t many opportunities for me to naturally exercise what I’ve been told they’re looking for. 

How can I showcase that even with the gap I still have the skills they ask for? If I took courses or got a certification, does that actually enhance an application? I’m trying to look at how a hiring manager would see my candidacy and honestly get frustrated. I feel like I’ve stagnated in my current role but moving out has an overwhelming number of barriers. Trying to find ways to take control of what I see now as uncontrollable.

15i8age,Feeling burnout at current position due to mental health. What are my options?,"I'm 34, I currently work remotely as a business software implementation consultant.  I also do some development work in a very narrow scope.  Mostly just customizing small pieces of business logic or adding custom fields or default values within the already-existing framework.  The work is heavily client-based.  My employer is a very small firm (3 full-time consultants and a couple 1099 contractors who assist on a project-by-project basis). I'm the only person on the team with significant technical knowledge.

The problem I am having is that I have pretty extreme ADHD.  It's currently treated, but to give a sense of the magnitude: I had failed nearly every class for 2 straight semesters in college and was on the verge of being kicked out of school before I was diagnosed.  After getting diagnosed and starting treatment, I finished with a 4.0 in every semester.

Recently, even with my ADHD treatment, I am struggling with focus and motivation.  I dread every workday.  I have 10+ projects in various states of completion and I'm constantly stressing myself out trying to make sure I'm not dropping the ball anywhere.  My boss, president of the company, has some excellent qualities - he fiercely defends our work-life balance and refuses to make people work overtime. He has on multiple occasions told me to stop working and go relax, and then handled the client for me.  He is also extremely hands-off and has basically told me that he doesn't care how, when, or for how long I work, as long as the work gets done. But he is an accountant by trade and doesn't really understand most of what I do.  My workload can't really be shared because there isn't anyone else on the team with the skills to help with it.  The couple of times he's tried to have someone help me, it ends up being more work for me because I have to babysit their work.

I get weekly contact from recruiters in the industry, and I even did some initial interviews a year or two ago.  My understanding based on conversations with other consultants and from those interviews, is that I am extremely lucky to have a chill workplace.  The job is based on billable hours and the firms who are hiring want people to be billing 35-40 hours/week.  That doesn't include any administrative time, internal meetings, lunch breaks, etc, so it would most likely mean 50+ hour work weeks.  I know that I don't have the capacity for that amount of work, my brain literally won't comply.

I *cannot* lose my health insurance, it just simply isn't an option.  If I can't afford mental health treatment it will most likely end any career path for me outside of manual labor or retail.

I have a math degree from a small state school, and 5 total years of experience working with one very specific piece of software.  I have okay-to-good skills with SQL, C#, and python.  But I don't have a computer science degree and I know outright that I don't have enough experience to be hired as a developer.

I am completely at a loss as to how to move forward and find a better situation for myself.  I am *not* a career-oriented person, I have always worked so that I can pay for my life outside of work.  I currently make around 90k.  I'm not set on staying in the current industry I work in.  I'm also not set on leaving.

Any advice would be appreciated.  ",careeradvicethwy,9,0.9200000166893005,2,1691174859,2023-08-04 18:47:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15i8age/feeling_burnout_at_current_position_due_to_mental/,8,2023
15i7lx3,How to approach my employer about another job offer?,"To start, I'm located in Western Canada. I work in construction management as a coordinator, with 6 years experience. I'm a female in a heavily male dominated industry. I'm not unhappy in my current job, my direct boss is amazing and everything I could ask for in a boss. He is the one who promoted me, and asked me switch companies with him when my old company split up.  The owner of the company is not as great. He's no longer giving us days off for every Stat holiday. 

I was recently approached by another company within the same industry. They sent me a job offer with a comparable salary (slight increase with a review in 6 months), comparable flexibility, and slightly more vacation time. They have an industry reputation of being very good employers to work for.

I'm torn on whether to take this offer or not, it is marginally better, but not enough to discount my current place of work. I'm considering asking the new job to bump the pay up a bit, but I wonder if I should approach my current boss first and let him know that I have another offer. I'm open to my current work giving me a counter offer to stay, but I'm afraid that if I go in and lay it out, they'll take it as me threatening to leave if they don't pay me more, and I don't think they would take that well.

Mid-30s located in the US with BS in economics and public health and MBA. I do not have a clinical or highly technical background.

I’ve worked across Healthcare in hospital operations, corporate finance, administration, consulting, and business development my entire career. Currently an Account Executive selling to health systems. My compensation is good enough and don’t hate it. Sales is competitive and stressful but feels like any other job, just not sure if it’s my end game.

Always been an individual contributor. Not sure if I’d want to be a people manager but that’s the next step for leadership potential. Open to it.

Also open to Life Sciences and have limited pharma experience in finance and contracting. I’ve heard WLB and comp is generally better in Life Sciences. Could be open to HealthTech and startups, haven’t done that before. 

Already have a masters so don’t think more schooling is the answer, especially when I don’t have a clear goal. But open if absolutely needed for my next career.

Feels like I’m a master of none despite having good (but broad) industry experience. I can’t seem to decide on a specific vertical. I don’t need a “passion” and can find fulfillment outside work but still hope to be more satisfied with what I do long term. If sales is my final career then so be it and it earns well at least.

My comp range is minimum $120k (or equivalent in a HCOL city). That’s less than what I make now but don’t need too much to be comfortable. Open to relocation, travel, on-site or remote.

15i5q3g,How long is too long without a manager?,"I work as an analyst in a fairly small company. 5.5 weeks ago, my manager quit without notice. Our team was already understaffed, and when our COO stepped in manage us in the interim, he told us the priority would be staffing up our team. And he kept true to that and hired 2 new analysts within a couple weeks.

However, they haven’t started the hiring process for a manager yet. Early this week, the COO mentioned that they were writing a job description for the manager role and would send it to us ASAP to approve. They’ve never done anything like that before, and the manager who quit was only there for about ~6 months, so it doesn’t seem like they need to write a whole new JD. But we haven’t seen any sign of the job description yet, and it’s Friday.

The COO has been trying to manage us, but is obviously busy with other COO duties, so he’s given us a lot of self-managing tasks. Anytime I request assistance I would normally ask of my manager, he basically tells me to handle it myself (like making sure the new hires have the right software and account access). And he keeps giving me tasks that are outside the analyst scope. I’ve tried pushing back, but COO is starting to get annoyed at me.

Am I wrong in thinking it’s unfair to have not even started the search for a new manager, 6 weeks after the last one left?

Tldr: My current employer and coworkers seem to like me but my job performance is not up to par in some way. I was put on a 2 month PIP (and it’s not looking good for me) 

Red flags: 
1. The original PIP document as well as the discussion I had with Boss + PM lacked QUANTITATIVE metrics or goals just things like “be more independent in your work but also ask more questions if you want to grow” and my personal fav “employ adaptability between multiple projects” 

So no… there’s no grading scale, no percentages, nothing that can be used to prove I am “improving” in a 2 month period 

2. I have had ZERO (0) billable hours this week I typically spend 20-30 hours a week on client projects but I’ve been getting no work  (happy Friday y’all!)

3. A coworker on Wednesday emailed me to ask about the project I was on because he’s now doing it (and needs my help because I wrote all of the instructions and did ALL of the tasks associated with it up to this week) 

Green flags 

1. PM (in separate 1on1 meeting) says I should start looking for jobs and to make it very clear I am not quitting or resigning.

2. Pm is planning to have me work with another director for “career advancement” (not the boss in the previous meeting but same status and this director likes me too as I’ve worked with them prior) pm again says to make sure I don’t resign and to just do the work assigned for the next 2 months. I’ve literally been applying for jobs on company time because what else can I do? 

Bright red and flashing flag!!

1. I asked pm in our 1on1 about why the metrics for the pip were all qualitative tive and subjective when we work in research (a quantitative data focused field) and all they could say was “idk boss and HR put it together but I can ask what metrics they are requiring you to hit to pass”

So it looks like I’m getting canned for sure, also looks like there’s some benefit to staying and being terminated as opposed to resigning or quitting (not that I planned to, but if I got a new job I would definitely leave the current one)

Bonus question: how do I ask pm/boss/coworkers to reach out to their contacts on my behalf while making it sound like I still want to keep my job lol?

Also double bonus: to rub in the pain even more a coworker just announced their promotion on LinkedIn (yesterday).

The below is for Company A which I am most interested in as the work seems appealing and team/culture as well.

He took that opportunity to pitch me for the job and talk me up. They reached out to me and luckily enough I had another friend from years ago currently working in that company so that helped as well. Now after a few rounds of interviews I’m pretty confident that I will be receiving a job offer. Before my last round of interviews, the recruiter also asked me if I was okay with accepting 90k for this offer because the team “likes me and definitely want to move forward”. I said yes because I have been laid off, I haven’t told that company I’ve been laid off. Also, at this time, company B hadn’t reached out to me so this was the only company I was speaking with. Now, company B is willing to give me up to 105k or more. I wasn’t too interested which is why I kinda said 105k would be my asking price and they were happy to accommodate. So now my question is how do I negotiate with Company A who I told I’m willing to accept 90k? Is it too late for me to ask for 105k or even more?

15i4boq,How long do I need to stay?,"I started a new job July 1st. I realized quickly that it’s not a good fit for me. I’m used to working in the city, and took this job for more money in the suburbs.

The employees here frequently use slurs (R word, F word). I’m one of the only women, and found out that a group of men were going around telling rape jokes. I had a coworker that I barely know come up and go on a lengthy rant against trans people, completely out of the blue.

I’ve worked in corporate environments long enough to know that going to HR isn’t going to change the entire culture of a place. I want out. Problem is, this is only my second job in this role. I’m great at it and want to find another job in this position.

Is there a specific timeframe I need to stay here, so it doesn’t raise red flags on my resume?

15i3hyt,"Racist, homophobic and ableist boss","Hi I’ve posted on here before regarding my boss who is a maniac… since then we have had a meeting with higher ups to address his behavior toward me. All was fine for about a week. This week started and he was immediately doing the same behavior he was before. On top of that, he stated some pretty homophobic and racist opinions that made me extremely uncomfortable.

He uses the R word very frequently in casual and business conversation, none of which is appropriate. But this week he added to the list of fucked up shit.

We had been out on field work and were in his vehicle when he brought up a church he had gone to for Christmas one year with his wife. (I’ve known he was a Christian and Republican so it wasn’t shocking to me…) He mentioned how the pastor was gay and there were multiple gay people in the congregation. He mentioned feeling uncomfortable and needing to leave. I said something along the lines of “well at least they were there,” and he started to protest but stopped. He then left the truck and then came back starting the conversation back up with “the Bible has three verses that discuss that (homosexuality) and they’ve very clear, so that’s what I go by. I have gay friends and they know how I feel so I tell them you probably shouldn’t be friends with me.” 

I just didn’t say anything (sorry for not being a better allay).

Then today, we were again doing field work and then he wanted to stop at Chickfila when we were done. I didn’t want anything, I’m a veggie. We were in drive thru line and someone started playing their bass loudly in their car. He then stated “this is why people are racist,” without knowing the persona skin color. Once he realized it was a black man he stated it again “yep, this is why people are racist.” He then went on to talk about how if this wasn’t a civilized society a bunch of white people would shoot him, that he was too far from the ghetto to be doing that, and how he has a bunch of black cousins (he’s white), that are respectable and don’t act like that. He also mentioned that they hired a black man one time and he always dressed nice but he got fired after 6 weeks because he cussed out a customer, and didn’t understand why he though that was acceptable to do. Blah blah.

Anyway, obviously I need to report this right? This isn’t acceptable behavior from a supervisor/colleague. It’s extremely inappropriate.",unicornug,0,0.5,0,1691163798,2023-08-04 15:43:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15i3hyt/racist_homophobic_and_ableist_boss/,8,2023

I have just completed my Bachelor of Laws degree and I am preparing to study a Masters degree in International Corporate and Commercial Law, starting in September.  
  
As the corporate and commercial law sectors are the sectors I have the most interest in pursuing a career in, I would like to ask for any advice for deciding between whether to become a barrister or a solicitor in these areas.  
  
I do have work experience in solicitor firms and experience from frequent mooting, and although this experience is not entirely reflective of the career, I am comfortable and confident with the basic functions of both roles.  
  
I do feel like I would prefer to take the barrister route, but I am conscious that the corporate/commercial areas may generally be more suited to the role of a solicitor.

They seemed to like me from a personality standpoint and indicated that my past experience they think would make me a good fit. 

I asked about pay. One interviewer said good question but it seemed like they weren't fully prepared to discuss it. They asked my price and I gave it. They said that would be a stretch for new people but again the discussion came back around to my experience and *hopefully* that they like the cut of my job (which is definitely a consideration and while I can't be sure, I do believe I am their only candidate.

They mentioned a lower number.

We are still talking though. They said they'd have to talk to one of the higher up people.

Question is, do I wait to see if they make a counter offer or should I tell them ""I would entertain a counter offer if we can make the numbers work""?

TLDR. I went first with my price, overshot. They didn't outright say no but shot me a lower number. Might they counter offer or should I indicate that I would entertain a counter.

15i19f0,Identifying Career Stagnation and Getting Ahead,"👋 In our career trajectories, there often comes a point where we find ourselves on a plateau, staring at 'Career Stagnation.' 🚧 It's not a pleasant phase to be in, and can be a result of numerous factors such as a poor career decision, unsupportive work culture, lack of learning opportunities, or simply an industry downturn. 

✨Let's explore this further:  
1️⃣ **Recognize the signs** 🧐: Are you learning something new every day? Are you still excited about your projects? Is your work rewarding? If your answer is 'No', then you might be experiencing career stagnation.  
2️⃣ **Open Conversations** 🗣️: If you're feeling stuck, don't hesitate to have an open conversation with your manager or mentor about your career progression and aspirations.  
3️⃣ **Self-reflection** 🪞: Ask yourself - Are you really interested in what you're doing, or are you just going with the flow? Identifying your interests can help you decide the direction of your career.  
4️⃣ **Learning and Development** 📚: Never stop learning. Online courses, workshops, or even reading relevant books can help you acquire new skills and knowledge.  
5️⃣ **Networking** 🤝: Build relationships with people in your field, not just in your company. They can provide new perspectives and opportunities.  
6️⃣ **Step out of comfort zone** 💪: Challenge yourself by taking on tasks that are outside your current skillset. It not only helps you grow professionally, but also gives a sense of fulfillment.  
7️⃣ **Set Goals** 🎯: Having clear, achievable career goals can guide you through your career path and keep you motivated.  
Remember, career growth is a journey 🚀, not a destination. Stagnation doesn't mean the end, but an opportunity to recalibrate and accelerate 💨.",doodlingo,2,1.0,1,1691158519,2023-08-04 14:15:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15i19f0/identifying_career_stagnation_and_getting_ahead/,8,2023

15i0y56,Ethical Issue for Gov't License,"This is a burner account just in case. USA

TLDR: Working two jobs at the same time and will have an in-depth interview for a Gov't license and I'm not sure if the ethical issue will come up.

I work in Logistics, specifically ocean imports.  I do Customs brokerage where I prepare entries for customers on shipments entering America.  I work fro two companies at the moment without either's knowledge.  This is because at company A I make less than I'm worth but have tenure and a substantial bonus. At company B I make 60k allowing me to have 100k.

I am training to pass the Customs Broker License Exam. If you've never heard of it, it's very difficult and this will be my fourth time trying to pass it. If you do pass you are eligible to become a Customs Broker, but part you also have an extensive 3-6 month background check and series of interviews. 

This is an ethical issue, which is supposed to be a big part of the interview, to make sure you won't approve goods made with slavery or be bribable.  

If anyone knows or has experience with this I'd appreciate the advice.  I've added a few details for reference below.

Job A:

Tenure

40k salary

Annually increasing bonus that exceeds inflation

100% WFH

Large company

Insulated from internal politics

Job B:

New Hire

60k salary

Small company

Hybrid, 3 in 2 out

Being marked as lead of Customs

Much more stressful due to being a 'smaller' business

Pay is $1xx,xxx. By all accounts it should be a dream job but I do feel that I got low balled by about 30k, but I also understand that it’s because I don’t have background in this particular industry (healthcare). 

Now, here is where the challenge is. I had another recruiter reach out to me about the same time as I started interviewing for the job i accepted. Recruiter went radio silent and reached out to me yesterday. Set up a meeting for today. Same title, $200k+, better benefits, in the city i really want to be in. 

They said the recruitment process will take about 3 weeks and the company is estimating a start date of 9/15-9/30. Recruiter feels really strongly that it’s a good fit and that my background should make me a shoe-in for the role. 

I honestly thought I’d be more excited about the role I accepted, but tbh I just kind of feel that it’s something I HAVE to do for my career. I work in consulting and have a lot of various industry experience and it would be nice to check healthcare off the list.

I got an offer for one that will pay the same salary I am making now but it is completely unrelated to what I have done in the past. The commute is still 40 mins by train but the fare is much cheaper. It is also an industry I enjoy (video games) but I am left wondering about my long term career prospects not only switching jobs but industries. 

Would I be dumb to take this job over my current position? Or should I just stay essentially where I am?",sasol1234,2,1.0,5,1691138490,2023-08-04 08:41:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15hueqa/should_i_switch_jobs_for_the_same_salary/,8,2023
15hu0lv,How to let go?,"I have recently been promoted to a management role with little to no experience.
My boss is lovely, but they've been no help in guiding me in the transition other than pointing out occasionally that I'm not ""acting like a leader""; I think I fundamentally disagree with our definition of leadership, I would like to promote open communication and honesty (which are qualities I admired in an old manager), rather than an us Vs them mentality.
I think they are coming from a place of not wanting to look bad to the rest of the department, whereas I feel like the times my old boss was open and honest were the times we functioned best as a team, really rallying together and acting as a unit (him included).

On top of that, one of my peers who has been in the role longer is one of those extremely competitive people that would rather make a project fail than include anyone that is going to make them look less capable - they hoard information, freeze people out (including myself) and act all smug whenever me or my team are criticised.

The company culture is very non-confrontational and when I attempted some constructive criticism I was met with defensiveness; I suggested we hold regular information share meetings and more often than not they start with ""what are we doing? Ah yes we HAVE to share what's going on"".

I think an open conversation with my boss would not help, so I'm looking for advice on how to address my own attitude to this situation. I don't want to quit, I have dreamed to do this job for this company for years, but I can't go to work angry all the time. I am struggling to avoid snapping at that coworker all the time and I can see I am becoming less objective (as in, I can't avoid criticising them out of spite).

The HR questioned my expected salary because to her it is too high, even though the salary I gave was what was stated in the posting.

15ht895,Next steps from agency recruitment,"Hi guys, 

I have been doing agency recruitment for about 5 years. I have done pretty well out of it. I’m based in Leeds and I joined my business starting out a new market and in the last 2 and a half years have billed c600k. So although this might not seem a great bunch to London based recruiters, it’s pretty comfortable up here. I have been paid very well for this. 

But I feel as though I’m burning out in agency. In an environment where I used to thrive with KPIs, pushing myself to do as many deals as possible, working tirelessly long hours, being somewhere where the culture can be quite toxic if the company isn’t performing well, even though I always have. It’s started to take its toll on my mental health.

I don’t want to move from one agency to another. I feel like that could be moving from the frying pit into the fire. But I don’t know where else to go from here. Ideally I would like to move to an internal TA role and then move into HR by doing CIPD. I am happy to take a pay cut to some extent to do this because I just don’t need the money I’m earning at the moment.

I know you can never have too much money, but I’m quite a simple person. As long as I have enough money to pay my mortgage, pay the bills, go on a few holidays per year and spend time with my family then that’s all I want. I just feel like my time is up in agency. I have saved a silly amount in such a short space of time because I just don’t really spend it. I’ve been investing, paying off my mortgage early and putting money in high interest rates savers and I still have a lot of money sat around doing nothing. What I’m trying to say is the toll on my mental health and lack of family time just isn’t worth the money now. My partner has also qualified as an accountant in the last year so there is less pressure on me to earn as much. I’ve just lost my enjoyment of my job, which I’m sure seems alien to a lot of people given I have consistently been one of the top billers in my entire company over the last 3 years.

The problem is I hear the TA market is going through a troubling period. But I don’t know what else I could do? I was just wondering if someone had made the transition and how they went about it. A lot of rec2recs I speak to just do agency to agency. I feel like if I am going to stay in agency I may as well stay where I am as I’m established now and i grafted a lot to get here. I don’t want to do that all over again. 

I’ve always enjoyed the consultancy side of recruitment but the sales element is something which, whilst I’m good at, it’s not really something I enjoy. I have friends in TA and their roles sound more fulfilling, helping a singular business grow, coaching hiring managers, providing market intel and getting involved in wider business wide projects. This all sounds really appealing to me. 

Aside from that, I could try a career change but that would be an even bigger hit to my salary which given the whole mortgage situation at the moment I just can’t afford. But I’d be keen to know what other areas I could move into and any advice into moving TA roles. 

Any advice is appreciated.

I’m currently on a break and thinking of what to do next. Initially I was sure I’d go back to Product but lately I’ve been thinking if there are other career paths I can explore. 

Some background about me:
- I became a Product Manager straight out of college, have never done anything else in my professional career
- I have a background in Computer Science (Bachelors and Masters)
- worked at a variety of companies, from bigger firms to smaller startups 

I don’t have the skills or interests to be something more specific like an analyst / developer / designer/ etc. 

I have good people skills, I like being knee deep in product/business strategy, thrive in fast paced environments and generally am a quick learner. 

Lately, I’ve been reading about Consulting roles and from what I can see, mostly people with MBA backgrounds get into management consulting. But wondering if with my Product experience I can break into it? And also, is it recommended? 

Can people help shed light on pros and cons, and what all I should look into / think through before deciding one way or the other?

15hry42,How to get out of audit -> best pivots,"Hi guys  
  
Have been in audit for 5 years at Big 4 in Aus and am now an Assistant Manager. Probably want to leave now before I get boxed in much further (ie. long punishing hours, clients hate you etc). Also would ideally like the switch to also be overseas to London/Dublin/Amsterdam for 18 months:  
  
From my research seems like 3 main pivots which appeal to me:  
  
Consulting Senior/AM at Big 4 -> have to go backwards a bit before i go forward to retrain i guess but if i found something i really liked i'd be open to it as it may suit my natural skills best out of the 3. May find the big4 partner grind a bit soulless though.  
  
FP & A Analyst/ Management Accountant at Private-> like the idea of getting into a company this way and going on the business partner channel, ideally for a sports company.  
  
Senior Analyst at Bank -> think there are some switches where i could go across as manager but not as familiar with work culture/how rewarding the work is.  
  
Not interested in Financial Accountant/Manager grind or internal audit/ accounting advisory/ M& A/ Sales role and am probably better at writing then numbers. Not extremely ambitious would like to get good work life balance within 5/7 years and hopefully $180-200k salary.

And If I have to go back to college, i'm wondering if there's any careers that love to hire ex chefs. Cause I would rather do something with a leg up than start completely at the bottom.   
I love the project management side of my job (creating menus, budgeting & sourcing ingredients, the rush of organizing & timing events) but I hate the schmoozing part of my job & trying to get people to sign up for our service.

Hi everyone just wanting to vent.

Now the thing that makes me confused is how have I been doing plagiarism when the companies are telling us how they want their designs and what knot, so I tried defending myself and my coworkers defended me saying the same thing but they told us that it was in their best interest to let me go so they wouldn’t get sued.

15hq2hm,How to handle this situation with a direct report? Can’t afford commuting,"The situation: work at a company (in a large city) that has always said we would eventually come back to office more days of the week than not. We have had a lot of flexibility and for the past year have been going in 2 days a week. In the very near future we will be going to 3 days. 

One direct report moved during Covid to a location that’s probably 2 hour commute door to door (via train). They ended up getting hired at the company around the same time they moved there (they used to live in the city where we work). They have been hinting for a bit in our 1x1s that they cannot afford the commute. Sometimes they will even use a vacation day to not have to come in one of the mandatory two days. They are also at a point where they are  overdue for a promotion. The promotion is most likely coming at the end of this year. However - the most recent convo on the topic they said something of the following: “it is not feasibly possible to come in three days a week, I actually can’t afford it or do it. Maybe I can come three days twice a month. Then said once I get the promotion I can do 3 days. But until then I really can’t.”

Very ballsy move and a threat of sorts. I am struggling with how to handle. I would like to go to my boss (who I really like and look up to) for advice- BUT I know she will NOT handle this well in that it will make her think very negatively about this employee, possibly jeopardizing said promotion that she does really deserve. I just know this is not going to put my direct report in a good spot making this known to upper management, but at the end of the day they chose to live there, and our company is not obligated to make special accommodations for them-  someone who wants to be promoted to a more senior position.

15hpluj,Am I overthinking things or am I being undervalued?,"Hello all, sorry in advance for the novel,

  
I’ve been in my current job coming up to four years now and finding it hard to see myself continuing on. I make wiring harnesses/ looms typically for the mining industry, I am the most experienced assembler they have on the floor (11 people doing the same job I do) next closest is 1.5–2 years behind me and chances are that the new employees starting today won’t ever get the experience level I’m at because there isn’t a need for more than 2-3 assemblers doing 50+ hour jobs with over 1500m of cable in it when finished is 4m long. I have been an outstanding performer as been told by my bosses and owner of the business that my quality is “unmatched” and “A1” as they often check over our work, at the and of the day that is what I pride myself on because its something that has my name on. 

  
The issue I’m having is 6 months ago I personally called a meeting between the owner, his 2IC and my direct manager to ask for a pay raise and for more responsibilities. When I started I was paid $26.70 almost 4 years later I’m on $27.50 that was a government mandatory pay raise. During the meeting they made very sure to tell me how appreciative and constantly impressed they are with my work, attitude towards work, how well I get on with everyone and my attendance (8/11 assemblers  have a sick day a fortnight or more). Saying that I was met with deaf ears, telling me it is better for them if I continue making harnesses and keeping me at my desk instead of training people who need it, I have previously trained new people when we were desperate for workers and the usual trainer had been absent, plus they were impressed what I could teach them in the amount of time I had. When it came to the pay discussion they told me it had to be discussed in private and that I already get paid above the award then the meeting concluded. About 2 hours later the 2IC came over with a list of rubbish “goals” that they told me had to be reached, I’m not saying they are rubbish because they were unrealistic but it was almost exactly what I did month to month, So I played along knowing that I would smash it. So on the first of September is asked for the review sheet that they had agreed to make up on the past months work. This shows how my times went per job as well as mistakes if any (keep in mind a harness with over 1000+ pinout points you can on average expect 1-10 being incorrect, it only takes a minute to fix if they are next to each other so no big deal). As expected it was all green except for the new harnesses we haven’t built before due to labour proving impossible to quote (also no big deal). I was hit with “there is still room for improvement” for 6 months in a row now. I am the only one in the shed who asks for the review sheet at the start of the month because it seems like I’m the only one who wants a pay raise which is fine, I have let some of my family with their own business in on my situation and they say its bull shit and there are companies that would pay through the teeth for employees like me. 

  
I genuinely get on really well with all my colleagues both on the floor and the office while also having a real passion for the finished products I produce. I would personally hate to see the knowledge and skills I have go to waste but I have been looking into other carers because I’m feeling left behind when it comes to my friends and their careers. I can’t afford to go on the holidays with them or the nice flashy cars and 4x4s or the house deposits. I’m 24 so I know its I know I have plenty of time to change my mind about work places but I feel like the last 4 years would be a waste of time if I leave. Am I overreacting or am I being pushed around?

Today I had my first meeting with the hiring manager over Teams and he told me he already emailed my manager to get some info about me, since he ""knew"" him. I mentioned that I have not notified my manager yet and had hoped that I would be the first one to tell him, and there's a bit of awkwardness and he apologized and we kinda brushed it off. The hiring manager and I talked for close to 2 hrs when the meeting is only scheduled for 30 min, so I think he is interested in me. He tried to ""sell"" the role to me. I think I did well in the ""interview"" aside from that bit of awkwardness.

Well, I'm going to my next 1:1 with my manager tomorrow and it's going to be so awkward. How should I approach this situation? To be fair, my manager is aware that I'm not content at my role and my skill is not being fully utilized. Even though I report to him, I'm being mostly funded by another manager who he agrees is incompetent and my work mostly involves around that other manage. Also, I did not officially apply so it's not like I'm trying to go around anyone's back. My intention was to notify him after I find out more about the other role.

The thing is, due to some restructuring, I will be no longer working for that other manager and will be doing work for him (my manager). But this is so new not even he is clear on what exactly I'll be working on, and to frank, the kind of things he has in store for me are not my passion. 

Please advise.

Thanks

15hpdi2,How do you respond to feedback you don't agree with at work?,"My manager and I do not get along. She's not the best leader and not always the most helpful (giving incorrect information, waiting too long to hand me assignments and then expecting me to turn things around with unrealistic deadlines, making mistakes, having me follow incorrect processes, not being open to new ways of working, etc.) So that we can work better together I've tried to have some 1 on 1 conversations about this. I really tried to keep it as professional and positive as I could while still getting my issues and examples across. I even practiced with my therapist prior to make sure, lol. She seems to have taken my feedback to her personally though which has only made it worse and she has made it clear through her actions that she doesn't want to work with me anymore  has started getting senior management - who she is very friendly with- and HR involved (which in hindsight is what I should have done).  
I used to try to ignore her, keep my head down and do my job but noticed she was start to emailing me very nit picky feedback - I believed to create a paper trail for HR and I was right. First, it was stuff like you could've spoken louder in that meeting, and then it escalated to like, ""I had to do this because you didn't do it. You're not meeting job expectations. "" The problem is most of the things she is saying I'm not doing I am and can prove it. Example: ""You didn't include this in your email recap, so I had to add it. Your role is to manage this. "" I literally have screenshots showing that I did. Or ""you're struggling to hit goals"" when I can show where I've not only hit but exceeded goals each quarter.  
I don't want to come off as defensive or like I can't take feedback or even like I'm taking things personal but at the same time I do want to stand up for myself because at this point my job is on the line.

15hotxx,Wfh IT Support vs WFO Developer job,"Hi guys, I need another opinion. I got another job offer for 

-30% increase from basic at my current job. 
-WFH
-MNC company with all the common benefits.

But comes with
- little increment in future (3-6%)
- small bonus (1m) 
- little to none career growth. 

I already ask current worker of the MNC about this to confirm.

With my current company
Basic 30% less than MNC but the boss had been giving 3-6 months bonus to staff been here more than one year… depends on performance. Increament also quite a lot 10-20%. I got 10% just for being with the company less than a year.

Im concern if i jump ship to MNC company i will miss out on the big bonuses/increament and being stuck with support job with no growth.

15hotlo,How do I ensure a future job?,"I (24m) recently got promoted to a role that I had been working twords for a few years. The good news is that I love work my job entails. The bad news is that there isn't much work to do. Normally this would be amazing as it would mean I had time to work on any project I would like. However, my company is a sinking ship. I know for relative certainty that it has about 10 years left before everything goes under. Furthermore, said company has a habit of cutting 5-10% of the workforce every year. Given that I am newest to this position, if my team needs to cut someone, I am first to go. My saving gace is that my boss has no idea how I do my job, or the amount of work required, just that the results we produce are business critical. That hopefully means they might be willing to defend my team so we don't lose anyone for quite a while. 

While I worked really hard to get here, I honestly got really lucky when I applied. I am only barley qualified.  This field (data analytics) is super completive. As stated before, I have a ton of free time. I have an associates degree in an unrelated field (psychology), and am thinking that maybe I should go for a regular degree like business administration.

So I guess my question is, how do I make sure that if I am cut I am able to get another job at this level?",Alucard2051,1,1.0,1,1691119745,2023-08-04 03:29:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15hotlo/how_do_i_ensure_a_future_job/,8,2023

15hllrm,'Soft rejected' from internal position as only applicant,"Looking for a bit of advice on how to deal with this situation. Late 20s m in Aus if that matters.

In the organisation I'm in, one of their policies is they have to go through an internal hiring round before going external. I've been in the organisation for 1.5 years now (approx 100 employees, climate change research org). I get a lot of praise for my work, both from my manager/team but also from other people in the organisation; I'm a proactive employee and have managed successful projects. That said my role is pretty boring and I definitely don't have enough work to do and it's been that way for most of this year, so I've been quite restless.

A position opened up for an internal hiring round -- newly created position which is a step up from my current role, but in the same field (though different team). I spoke to the hiring manager before applying to understand the role, he said my experience is a good fit for the role, so I applied for it. I ended up being the only internal applicant for the role.

I had my panel interview yesterday with the hiring manager, my potential skip manager, and a manager from another team who I hadn't worked with. One thing that struck me as odd in the interview is for the second question I gave an example from my previous job, and for the next question panel interviewer #3 said ""using an example ideally from your current role"" so I was like oh okay and then only spoke about my current role for the rest of the interview. 

Anyway, the hiring manager spoke to me a couple hours after the interview and said that the panel have decided that it was difficult to assess me as the only applicant, so they've decided to 1) go to market to see who else applies externally, but 2) keep me as a potential candidate. He said I have clear strengths but also some feedback areas that he'll share next week. 

On the one hand I'm like okay cool, fair enough, play the field and see who you get. 

But on the other hand I'm kind of taking this as a soft rejection -- if all my work and success in this field in the org can't speak for itself as the only applicant then yeah that's not a good feeling lol. I kind of get the feeling that they want to reject me but want to let me down gently, so they're going to go external so in the end they can say someone external was better, even if they had no intention of giving me the promotion. But regardless this just means I'm going to be in limbo for at least a month until those external interviews end. 

It's left me in a really awkward spot. I told my current manager I was applying for the role, and she said she had no doubt I'd be successful given all I've delivered for the team and my good reputation in the org, and had even asked me to start collating documents and resources to make my handover smooth. There's not really the potential for me to take a more senior role in my current team unfortunately, based on current project pipeline and funding.

It's also just left me feeling pretty shitty. Like I'm a high achiever in general, want to push myself, but I'm bored in my current role; I try to apply for a more senior position based on all the good work I've done, get asked to only speak about experiences in my current role, and now they're going to market (where applicants won't have the limitation of only speaking about their current role lol). 

Not sure how to take it -- if I should just stick it out and wait another month in limbo while they kinda fuck with my emotions, or if I should just start looking elsewhere. I kind of feel like my relationship with the org is kind of burned now.

My LinkedIn bio is UX centered, but I am applying to customer service type roles at various companies. I would be interested in moving internally should something come up. 

Do I need to rework my LinkedIn bio so it’s not so UX centered? How should I rework my bio so I can continue to apply to tech roles? I worry the bio could be a red flag to potential employers due to being so UX centric.

15hkswl,SWE vs. Attorney (long-term career advice),"Hi Reddit!

I am currently a rising junior studying CS at an Ivy in the US. I am reaching out to this subreddit for advice about some long-term career choices of mine-- I obviously discuss this with my parents etc but they also can be close-minded and very traditional so wanted to see what random people on the internet might have to say (lol).

Basically, my dilemma is whether to go into software engineering or law long-term. I by no means have to make this decision right now, and currently intend to go into SWE/tech immediately after graduation. It's just a question of whether I attend law school after 2+ gap years from undergrad. 

Some unique circumstances that might inform the discussion are

1.  I would only go to a T14 or even T7 law school, and would really only take a high-paying law job (big law or nice in-house gig).
2. I most likely will not have a lot of law school debt (family has money saved up). 
3. I think I have somewhat more of a natural inclination/interest in law than in computer programming, especially in the long-term. I really love debate, persuasion, argumentation, reading, and writing, and a lawyer obviously does more of this than a typical SWE.

Some questions that are relevant and that I hope yall could help out with for my decision:

1. Are there any SWEs that make close to big law salary (especially as it progresses to 500k+ and partner salary)? If so, how unique/rare are these circumstances? 
2. What even is the career progression of a SWE long-term? I presume most people leave it at some point for something different, but what is that? project management? 
3. I know big law WLB is really shitted on (because it is terrible), but can you really make similar comp in tech with a better WLB? or is that to make that salary you have to grind no matter what exact job you're in? 

Thanks in advance, looking forward to hearing your answers!! <3

15hkg87,Career change - worth a $10k+ pay cut?,"
Hello! 

I have been a high school teacher in Canada for over 7 years. I am not married, no kids and in my early 30s. While I enjoy working with my students and love the school I am currently at, I have always been curious about trying other careers. Teaching is the only career I’ve had so far.

Over the last couple of months, I have been lucky enough to have been selected to go through the hiring process for a curriculum development position at my local police department. I am expecting an offer very soon. I am extremely excited for this opportunity but I am hesitant because it will be a significant pay cut. 

At most, this position will offer me a salary $10k CAD less than my teaching salary. This position is on a compressed schedule, which means only 4 days of work and work from home on one of those days. It is a unionized, permanent position. 

I would’ve happily taken the leap if the opportunity came up last year, but I am hesitant because I have a mortgage that has been screwed up due to interest hikes. The pay cut is the only thing that makes me hesitate about this job… 

What would you do? Any advice or insight would be helpful. Thank you in advance!",idonnowattodo,2,1.0,2,1691107410,2023-08-04 00:03:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15hkg87/career_change_worth_a_10k_pay_cut/,8,2023

Could you please help me out with this situation?

\- I have a staff member (direct report), who is a great performer (great technical skills and works hard to deliver on projects). But he very dismissive of everyone's views. He wouldn't let me finish, talk over me, tell me how I can't/shouldn't do certain things, judges peoples based on their technical skills. Everytime he gets an answer he doesn't like; he likes to escalate things to my supervisor. He tells me things like - ""Do you even know what I am doing"", which I feel is very disrespectful. And I assure you, I am not a total noob, have done the job before. Yes he is doing more complex work than before, but he has a very over-inflated sense of what he is doing. 

I am trying to be as honest as possible here (without any bias).

So, here it goes:

For the past 10+ years I've worked in the tech industry, the vast majority of that was spent in business roles at a FANG. I've switched jobs a handful of times starting in enterprise  sales, then moving into product strategy, and finally I landed as a team lead for a startup within this bigger company.

Earlier this year, around April, I was part of some widespread layoffs. On the one hand, this was actually a blessing. I had decided that I wanted to leave this very structured corporate environment and had taken some unpaid time off in the back half of the previous year to think about what to do next.

Since the layoffs I've been making some money and gaining experience in a few ways:

* Volunteering at an incubator to work with startups
* Doing some paid advisory and consulting work
* Contributing to a couple of startups on an at-risk contract basis

I know that I am privileged to have done these things during a bit of a turbulent time in my career, but on the other hand I am looking for some more stability.

Here's where I get stuck - I've applied to many full time roles at both large tech companies (ex. Discord) and medium sized startups. I either get to the final round and lose out because they go with someone with vastly different experience than myself (sometimes much more senior, other times more junior and executional) OR I don't even seem to get beyond one conversation or the application process.

I don't really know what to do because my two most recent roles at the FANG company either do not exist or exist between orgs at other companies (think a combination of GTM, product marketing, and product strategy/management). Recruiters do not reach out, ever.

I don't really have a specific question other than ""how do I even start to find a new role given my unique situation and experience""? What would you do?",rarecowchungus,1,1.0,1,1691099993,2023-08-03 21:59:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15hhfg3/feel_like_i_hit_a_ceiling_and_dont_know_where_to/,8,2023

They literally increased their contract because of the support and workflows I’ve implemented. On top of that they’re increasing their lines of business with the company platform. Again, primarily with just my support.

I know this is the wake-up call that I needed but it’s the sheer audacity from my current company for me. Instead of hiring more people to support the increased contracts, or I don’t know….giving people raises that beat inflation, they announced additional layoffs.

15he2os,Need help deciding between Master's or promotional exams,"English is not my first language and there will be cultural differences in my post. I'm 25F, turning 26 this year.

I completed my BS in Psychology last year and a very traumatic event in the family forced me to ignore my Master's admission and become the sole breadwinner for my family.

The job pays alright. It's a government job and people in my country literally bribe, steal and cheat to get into the government. The environment is kinda conservative and a little toxic but hey, the pay is alright.

Now here's my trouble. I'm allowed to appear in an extremely difficult promotional exam that would basically just set me up for life. Only 1% from the country pass and you need to be under 30 to apply.

But I really want to start (and finish) my Master's too. My heart really longs for a chance to join academics. And AFTER I'm done with master's, I'd simply spend the rest of my life in the job I have (apparently I'll never find anything better and I'm an emotional silly girl for exploring my options)

So reddit, I need you to please help me analyze my options. How can I make the best for myself before I turn 30? I worry that after I'm 30, I'd probably have a husband or kids to worry about alongside my job.

15hdrw5,Seeking guidance from a Marine/Environmental Science Researcher.,"Hello I (24m) having trouble deciding what I should be doing to get into the career field I feel would be best suited for me. 

I have a bachelors of science in ocean engineering and currently have a job as an Analyst in a cruise industry project management office. I'm feeling fairly unfulfilled with what I'm doing and would like to make a shift into a more hands-on career. The areas I'm looking to move into are environmental research or underwater vehicles(which would hopefully allow me to be close to the environmental career path).

The issue I'm now facing is when looking at job postings I feel very underqualified for these career paths. It seems most engineer postings are looking for electrical engineers, software engineers, civil engineers or mechanical engineers. And any roles directly related to the research are asking for a more extenisive background in chemistry and biology that my degree did not give me. 

I feel that my degree should have prepared me for at least the entry level engineering positions (minus the software ones) but with how little luck i'm having in my job search i'm almost wondering if my degree name is scaring recruiters away.

Ive thought about going back to school for a masters in environmental science, getting a second bachelors or even going to a trade shool to get more techincal experience, but i'm terrified of accruing more student loans when i'm already struggling to pay the ones I have and I'm not even sure if it's necessary. If anyone is willing to provide general guidance on how I can make myself stand out a bit more or whether or not going back to school is my best bet, id greatly appreciate it.",tyski88,2,1.0,0,1691091687,2023-08-03 19:41:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15hdrw5/seeking_guidance_from_a_marineenvironmental/,8,2023

15hcqhz,"I need advice on the which of the two options to move forward with, especially considering the immediate actions required for the first option. What should I do?","
I just graduated from in March 2023 with a bba degree, I have no work experience yet. I am Indian and I was born and brought up in Dubai for 18 years after which I went to India to complete my undergrad

Initially I only had option A, that was the plan when I started my undergrad, however now ,at the more important/ closer to finalizing stage, 
****this isn’t important but It’s why I am not immediately going with option B****
my parents have put Option B on the table and are slightly pushing me to choose that, while I am open for both, I do wonder if they put this option up because my parents are scared/overprotective and don’t want me to go abroad (dubai isn’t considered abroad for us after all they both lived and worked here for 20+ years as well) . The reason I think this is because I had a undergrad offer to study in UK but they made me choose India as they were worried and over protective.
Anyway that’s not important , moving on

I have 2 options to move forward with 

OPTION A
Work for 6 months then 
Go study abroad to obtain a masters degree related to management/business fields( Like MiM - masters in management, or Msc in Finance, Supply chain etc)
The countries I shortlisted are 
Germany, France, and Italy
Germany is good because of its free tuition , I won’t have to burden myself with a big student loan
France is good due to high ranked programs but will involve me taking a big student loan , which idm as long as the roi is positive 
Italy is cheaper than France and has some good programs too

Post masters degree I plan to work in that country and 5-6 years later get a MBA from top European Universities like INSEAD, Hec, WHU etc
I do plan on settling in that country

Pros of this option
• i can travel and study when I am 22
• once I am done with masters i don’t need to go back and study (only if I decide not to do an mba)

Cons 
• Lack of work experience post masters
• Masters + MBA will be a big financial burden especially if the masters is not from a public university in Germany 
• Idk how valuable the masters degree will be
• what if I don’t like the career field I chose ( however this can be negated with a general management degree like a MiM)

OPTION B
Go back home to Dubai 
Work there for 3/4 years then pursue an MBA at one of the top top ranked universities in the world( US or Europe , mainly inclined towards Europe)
Then work and settle in the country where I am employed post mba

Pros
• I can buy my dream car within a year (having your dream car at 21 would be nice)(without any debt)
• I’ll gain work experience 
• I’ll be able to fixate on a career field/role
• less financial burden due to the money earned during the 3 years and doing only an MBA

Cons
• I cant travel around much while I m 22 or so , due to having to work
• Lower starting pay when compared to starting with a masters
• recession?

There may be pros or cons to both options which I may have failed to consider

Now onto Immediate decisions 
However depending on options I have to make some more immediate decisions for Gmat and Ilets : if I am going for option A , I’ll have to write Gmat and ilets soon . I cant write ilets and then decide to go with option B as 2 years later I’ll have to write it again.
Similarly with GMAT, while not as bad,I’ll have to write gmat within 2-3 months for applying and going through with option A, while it’s not a problem if I write it immediately and then change to option B (due to the 5 year validity) I m missing out on having a much better score (750+) if would study during the 3 or so years I work",thedude00007,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1691089316,2023-08-03 19:01:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15hcqhz/i_need_advice_on_the_which_of_the_two_options_to/,8,2023

The title pretty much spells it out, I'm an undergraduate at the University of Pittsburgh in the United States, pursuing a double major in Psychology and Neuroscience, as well as a Mandarin Chinese minor. My Chinese is coming along very well, and the neuroscience stem classes are significantly harder than my psychology classes, but I am extremely interested in my studies and am choosing to endure the challenge even though deciding to undertake the double major has hit my GPA. I have work experience at Starbucks and some small businesses, a decent bit for my age (freshly 20), and some limited volunteer work. However, I've recently decided that I may want to pursue alternatives to my original pre-med path as I'm not sure about the temporal and financial commitments medical school entails. I've been increasingly interested in ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks). However, I don't have much of a tech background.

15hc255,Should I have not sent my bosses an appreciation note?,"Hi everyone! Hoping for some perspective/advice on something I did yesterday. Yesterday was my one year anniversary at work, and I decided I wanted to do something thoughtful for my two direct managers. For context, I work in an office environment, government, and we are a small (25 ish) department. It's a great group of people who are smart, kind and actually care about their jobs and we tend to be really collegial and laid back, even compared to my previous work experience in government and the private sector. 

Anyhow, I was reflecting on the past year and decided I would send a quick note to my two managers to express my appreciation for their mentorship, continued constructive feedback and encouragement, and support over my tenure. I kept things professional and brief, ending off by saying I was looking forward to continuing to mature my portfolio and to working with the rest of the team. I was careful not to lay my appreciation on too thick so that it did not come off as disingenuous - I really meant what I wrote. 

However, it has now been about 24 hours and neither managers has acknowledged my note in any way. I have had meetings today with both of them, including a private touchpoint with one of them that did not include anyone else at all. 

I am now wondering if I messed up in sending that note? I had a good relationship with both of them and I really love working here so I'm hoping not. I don't want to bring it up and make things awkward just in case if they actually aren't upset about my note, so I came to Reddit seeking advice.

Lastly, it is also worth mentioning that sending a brief note of appreciation is not unheard of in my workplace. Both managers have done so in the past, both privately and with the team as a whole. Other teammates have sent me notes or have praised or expressed appreciation in both team and private settings. I do not think I did anything inappropriate or anything that should make my managers uncomfortable but I just want some perspective here just in case. If I did do something wrong, I would also appreciate some advice on next steps I should take.",MulberryParsnip,2,0.6700000166893005,11,1691087739,2023-08-03 18:35:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15hc255/should_i_have_not_sent_my_bosses_an_appreciation/,8,2023

I've been at this position for 5 years but it feels stgnant. I've never gotten a promotion, it's a small organization, and I don't anticipate that I'll have any opportunity to ""move up the ladder.""

I want to leave, but our organization doesn't fo a lot of industry-standard things like code reviews or testing, so I feel it hasn't done a great job of expanding my skills to be a better developer.

I've been told by our more senior developer that I do good work and that I have a great attention to detail, but I feel so lost. I can't tell anymore if I'm unhappy because I don't actually like development, or if it's just because of the organization. I do sometimes like coding but so much of what we do is also support, or project management, or other soft skills that ate not coding.

I am taking some training online in off hours for some more contemporary skills (no Uni / accredited) but I'm conflicted about if I should formally go back to school and get a Computer Science degree this late in my career.

15h99zi,Ready to quit with no notice,"I have been at the company for 2 years.  At the 1 year mark, I had asked for a promotion because a senior team member who I was hired to work under had quit and I took on all of her work.  My manager said it's company policy to be at the company for 3 years before I'm eligible, although, that was no where in the employee handbook that I've read multiple times.   I've gotten great reviews on the last 2 yearly reviews from both of my managers and have continued to work on the areas they felt I could improve on. 

I kind of dealt with the extra work load because I was going through a break up and selling my house/ moving so I needed the stability, but now that dust has settled and being at this place even just 1 more day fills me with dread. And to make it worse, there was a string of at least 7 promotions of ppl who had gotten an increase in work load when their senior team member left and it's been a hit to my morale.  I have voiced when I have too much on my plate and since we are so short staffed anyway, the answer is usually to just focus on tasks that are ""more important or pressing"" 

The problem is, I don't have anything lined up. I was applying to a few jobs for the past 3 months, but I was doing so at a reduced capacity.  I have been more active in reaching out and applying for the past month, but I know that job searches can sometimes take a while and because of my history working at non profits, my savings can only really cover me for maybe 3-4 months.  

All my past resignations, I've given 2+ weeks notice. My current company is an at will company, so the 2 week thing is only to stay in good standing if I want to be rehired by them (which I really dont).  They have already gotten a year worth of my underpaid labor and at this point, I feel like my mental health is really taking a hard hit. I wake up every day ready to cry knowing I have to get up and come to work. Just trying to get all the angles of how bad this would be. I tend to be more of a people pleaser, so I am also worried about ""what everyone will think of me"" rather than how much relief I'd feel. 

Also any tips on how to get a job quicker would be helpful.  I work in the Healthcare/ science field",alee03072,7,1.0,7,1691081214,2023-08-03 16:46:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15h99zi/ready_to_quit_with_no_notice/,8,2023

15h8izs,Electrician or Anesthesiologist,"I wanted input from both of these trades for which would be the best choice for me. I understand that as an electrician I can make money right off the bat and get better pay as I get a masters license. I have a cousin 2 years older than me currently in it. He’s telling me to become an electrician and later in life start a business with him. He says that I’ll be able to become a millionaire with him, if all goes well, way sooner than as an Anesthesiologist. I myself don’t want to wait until being 40 or something to be at that level. However, I also plan on doing side hustles and trying new things like investing.

The other side is my family and a couple of other people. One of those people is a multimillionaire pharmacy owner. He says that really college is the best way to go and some other generic things. I like the idea of being a doctor but the schooling makes me sort of hesitant. I am willing to go through it though if I know that it’s the better choice.

I want to know from Anesthesiologists if they regret their path and what they think. Do you regret not being younger and having that money? Do you perhaps even think you yourself would have become an electrician? What are some of the downsides? The pros?

For electricians, is the idea of starting a business and becoming a millionaire really feasible? If it isn’t, would I still be able to reach that millionaire point working for someone? Downsides? Pros?

15h77lk,Do you agree with the way my coworker corrects me at work?,"From my point of view my coworker seems extremely picky. However, maybe I'm wrong though. Here are the examples of what she's corrected:

1. There's a guy who drops of discs at my desk to verify who sits about 20 feet away. When I finish verifying the discs I leave them in my desk drawer for the guy to pick them up. I asked the guy if thats ok with him and he it is. When I'm finished, I send the guy a message to pick them up since he's usually not at his desk. My coworker said it's really rude that I don't take the discs back to him on my own. Like, she says I'm making a big mistake at my job.


2. I sent a guy an email saying a sentence like ""can you please let me know if you have any updates on the report"". Then my coworker said that's bad/rude and I should rephrase my sentence like this ""can you please let me know if you have any plans for the report"". Since, she says the guy might not make updates to the report and might just be verifying information on the report.


3. She thinks if you ever send an email to anyone twice because of a typo that it's really bad. Like, she believes it's really unprofessional and that someone is making a big mistake at their job if they do that.

15h7077,Should I leave this startup? Drama warning,"Hi reddit, please give me some advice in this little work drama I'm a part of. I lead one of the key teams at a well-funded deep tech startup (raised Series A about a year ago, I joined a little bit earlier). We have great staff, great investors, some big names in both groups and generally, I would say, a good chance of success or at least it looks so on the outside. I'm happy with my compensation (salary and stock options) and yet... I felt really horrible and submitted my notice of resignation one month ago.

I had some serious concerns about the poor leadership in the company and the effect this is having on my work, my team and now my overall wellbeing. I tried to be a nice team player and communicate my concerns in a collaborative tone but that was effectively ignored. So once I just said enough is enough and filed my resignation notice to the CEO (to whom I report).And then it appeared that the leadership and the board don't want me to leave and they are willing to make some serious changes to how we work. Based on the early signs of these changes I wasn't convinced enough and re-confirmed my decision to leave (my notice period is 3 months so I’m still working at the company). 

The CEO doesn’t want me to leave and is now saying they will do almost literally everything so that I stay. They are apologising for all the struggles I had to went through and being even somewhat self-humiliating in trying to make me stay for at least some number of months so that I can truly see the change I once wanted and they are confident after I see it I wouldn’t want to leave. 

I’m very confused about the situation and not sure what to do. Over this month I already went through the grief phase, made some connections and generally produced a plan of whom I will interview with or even what kind of contracts I could take to stay afloat financially. But now I’m having second thoughts, maybe I should make a good deal and indeed stay for some time? Maybe I’m being too weak person and/or have unrealistic expectations about what startup life is like (we can assume it’s my first real job at a startup)? Maybe I’m missing a great opportunity simply because of that? Maybe I’m letting down people who trusted in me and offered me this job? Isn’t it true that all startups are broken at some point (who said that, Sam Altman?)? All sorts of questions like these are brewing inside my head at the moment. 

One thing that adds to my confusion is that why no one really listened to me when I was modest and asking nicely to make the changes? And now, suddenly, whatever seemed impossible can just magically be done so that I can stay. I think me leaving the company will do some damage but, honestly, the company can survive that and if they get their things together they can hire even a better person than I am. There is even a quite good person currently under my management who held pretty high positions in large and successful organisations and is probably intellectually competitive with me. The only real difference in my favour compared to this person is that I have 1.5 more years of experience in this particular industry. And my departure may not look great but the company can survive that I think (and it’s not that I’m going to spread the bad word around). I have a feeling that the CEO (they are somewhat inexperienced in this role) is perhaps not seeing this situation very clearly which doesn’t increase my confidence in them. 

I previously worked at an R&D department of a large corporation where things were not ideal but at least I could “just work” and get some intellectual satisfaction. Overall no one cared about my work there, and that’s why I decided to leave that job and join this startup. I think I would be looking for something in between these two data points: a job that is maybe more demanding than my last one due to more autonomy and potential for real-world impact but something that has more stability and clarity than this one. Maybe that doesn’t exist and I just fundamentally have to make a hard choice. 

Financially, I think I will be ok regardless if leave the startup or stay. I have a pretty good stock option vested by a third which is already ok at the current valuation and if the company improves and ultimately exits it might be worth some serious money (I negotiated well on this front). But it's not impossible for me to get a corporate job like my previous one and earn a salary that won't make me feel bad at all. 

I would really appreciate some advice and any relevant experience that can help me decide what to do. I have never been in a situation like this and just can’t compare this to anything I know of.

15h6f8v,How To Get Any Job Interview,"I am a hiring manager. And when I post a role on LinkedIn, I get at least 300 applicants.  
  
That's crazy! Imagine how many applicants top firms like McKinsey, Goldman Sachs or Google get.  
  
Sadly, for any role, only 5-10 people ever get an interview.  
  
So in today's highly competitive job market, you really need a way to stand out from the crowd.  
  
The best way to do that isn't by writing a great resume or cover letter (although that's important too) -- it's by building a relationship with the hiring manager.  
  
Having a relationship with the hiring manager not only gives you ""name recognition"", but you can also sneakily fish for a better understanding of what the company is looking for.  
  
Here's how you do it...

**LinkedIn is your weapon of choice...**  
  
Most hiring managers want the best candidate for their role, so they actively promote the open position on LinkedIn.  
  
They'll do this by posting, liking, or sharing the job ad on their personal LinkedIn profile.  
  
**Here's how you find them:**  
  
\- Search for: \[Job title\] hiring  
\- Click on ""Posts""  
\- Click on ""All filters""  
\- Find ""Author company"" and type the company name  
\- Click ""Show results""  
  
Hopefully, you'll find a post that is advertising the role. Give it a quick sense-check to see whether it looks like the hiring manager.  
  
If the person posting the job ad says something like ""I'm hiring"" or their job title looks like a more senior role in the same function, then you've hit the bullseye!  
  
If you can't find the hiring manager, you might be able to find somebody else from the company who has liked or shared the job ad. Reach out to them and ask who the hiring manager is.  
  
**Now the hard part... building a relationship**  
  
My advice here is to avoid saying something like ""I applied for the job, please consider me for an interview.""  
  
Instead, you should pretend that you already have the role.  
  
Tell them that you applied for the role and would love to share some thoughts about what you'd if you were to get it.  
  
For example, if it's a Product Manager role, then share some observations about their product, their competitors' products, and your recommendations or hypotheses about what to do.  
  
In other words, you want to show them that you can already do the job.  
  
Close it out by offering to share more observations and chat about the role they are advertising, and suggest catching up in the next few days.  
  
Some hiring managers are paranoid about maintaining objectivity, so they won't want to chat during the hiring process -- but at the very least they'll be looking for your name when selecting who gets an interview 😉",CareerScienceco,0,0.14000000059604645,4,1691074388,2023-08-03 14:53:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15h6f8v/how_to_get_any_job_interview/,8,2023

Everyone seems to be seeking candidates who knows many tools and expects tasks that i feel incapable of doing (this is about graphic design, I couldn't find industrial design internships). And i just feel so helpless and lost. My point is to learn and explore the field. But it always seems like what they need is someone already learned. I've heard from people how one should go ahead and apply, how the company will teach me along the way, that the requirements always looks too much. But i guess because I'm a perfectionist i feel so scared to take that step. Unless i know I'm perfect for the role and feel like i can contribute something of value, i feel frozen.

15h3e96,Focus on pursuing a masters in CS or getting a new SWE Job?,"Hello Reddit,  
  
I am a Software Engineer (SWE) at a Big Four consulting firm, working in applied AI. I graduated in 2022 and have been working for a year now. The work is interesting, but the pay could be better. I know I could potentially earn almost double at tech companies/startups. My educational background includes a bachelor's degree in Data Science with a concentration in Computer Science from an average state school, where I achieved a good GPA of 3.8.  
  
My goal is to enter either Quant Trading or ML engineering. Both of these fields generally require or prefer candidates with an advanced degree from a top school. I am determined to pursue a Master's in Computer Science, regardless of the time frame, as it is something I am passionate about.  
  
However, I find myself conflicted about the best approach. On one hand, I want to try and pursue a higher-paying SWE job first and then, perhaps after a year, focus on getting into a Master's program. On the other hand, I am considering focusing on preparing for the GRE and other requirements to secure a spot in a top CS Master's program while maintaining my current job or casually applying to positions.  
  
Currently, I am trying to juggle both paths, and it has become personally unsustainable. My time is stretched thin as I am studying for the GRE, researching schools, practicing Leetcode, working on personal projects, networking, applying to jobs, preparing for interviews, and conducting interviews. On top of all that, I am working 40 hours a week and dedicating an additional 5 hours to firm initiatives. It has become overwhelming.  
  
My main question is: What is everyone's opinion or advice on my situation? Should I focus on getting a new SWE job, or should I prioritize getting into graduate school?

Now my internship will end at the end of August, then i'll be with no income, unless i was recruited by October or even after, or maybe the project won't start at all.
Should I wait ? Or just look elsewhere for another company, this is the only company available for me in my city, and close to my family, if I go elsewhere I have to deal with rent and food, and staying away from family...

My boss told me that they will recruite me immediately if the project starts or a new project starts even if I went elsewhere.

**Some background**

I've been in my role (content strategy/ux writing) for a while now and if I look up average salary for the kinds of roles I work in, I think I'm not likely to get my income  to increase much more.   


I know the typical move is to work your way into management or some kind of supervisor role, but I'm not sure that's for me. I enjoy mentoring people new to the field, but I also enjoy doing the work and learning new things. I have been frustrated that when I get somewhere new that it's a fight to establish that I do more than writing and I can do strategy and planning for projects and teams too. 

I've toyed with the idea of consulting/freelance, but I'm worried that it would just end up being a string of clients who misunderstand that I'm a writer because the word ""content"" appears in my role title. Granted, I could probably re-brand what I do as a consultant, but I'm not sure if I would do well locating new clients and gigs to keep myself self-employed.

i got a note from my doctor and showed the positive result to my boss. its really infectious and also makes you really miserable. ive been coughing so hard im vomiting, i cant breathe for minutes at a time, and i honestly look terrible. the coughing has hurt my throat so much ill go hours without being able to speak. whooping cough is so rare that my local health department was notified of my case and they've been in contact with me. and i think they mightve also called my work.

ive missed like 2½ weeks of work over it. ive gotten coverage for most of all days besides maybe 1 or 2. i really like this job and dont want to lose it- its a barista job so obviously vomiting and coughing is not allowed while working lol.

Hey I’ve been working as a contract (6 month) data analyst for a small company and working alone with the data team being just me which is coming to an end in 1 month, but have mentioned they want to keep me on permanently. 

At first in the job spec it was supposed to just be SQL and creating Reports but it’s now taken on a few more roles which include reverse engineering 2 software application in VB.NET and make compatible within the company and also creating a mobile app in Java.

I’m happy with the workload but feel under compensated for my work as I believe I’m doing the role of a data analyst, software engineer and mobile dev all under 1.

15h12ca,I feel shortchanged at work and need advice,"
I was given a project to work on when a male colleague went out on paternity leave/vacation. He was the lead of the project for about 2 years prior, but nothing ever worked and the project just kept dragging with no progress. When I took over, another colleague suggested an approach that might help the project. Of course I jumped right in on the idea, developed it, and it started working like a charm. It’s a high visibility project and I got a lot of pressure from above to keep working on it, which I’ve been more than happy to do. I’ve spent a lot of overtime and effort because I’m so happy that it’s
finally working and the project can finally wrap up. I’m also pregnant, so by the time I deliver, I’ll have finished the project because I have a plan outlined. Now, the problem is that my male colleague is coming back and our manager decided to give him back the lead on the project and all the credit for my work. He’ll be asked to present my work to the higher-ups even though he has no idea what’s going on and has done none of it. I’m very upset because under his direction the project didn’t work and now that it’s working, he’d get all the primary credit and I’ll get a secondary “thanks, you did a great job” I’ve been told that this is happening as the manager doesn’t want the guy to feel robbed just because he went out on paternity. The thing is I’m feeling robbed because I did all the progress on this project and I feel it’s my project now. Appreciate any advice!

FWWM: I’ve worked with this person before and he always grabs all the credit even if he’s not his work. Other colleagues have worked with him too and have had identical experiences.

15h092f,Law to software engineering - salary prospects,"Hi

I’m a 35 year old in-house lawyer working in London and considering a career change into software engineering. I’m a bit disillusioned with the law and really like the creativity that coding involves, having taught myself some basic skills in my free time. I’m considering doing a bootcamp before looking for work. 

However, having looked into the software engineering salaries in London, I’m a bit concerned. Entry level seems to be around £35k. Ok, I’d have to take a massive hit to drop back to entry level after being an 11 year qualified lawyer - unavoidable. But even at senior engineer level, salaries look like they’re around 70-80k. Still good money obviously, but well behind what a senior lawyer would make even in-house, which I guess surprised me given the reputation of tech for being very lucrative. 

I know it probably varies a lot by company (and obviously how good you are) but is anyone able to give an idea of what kind of salary trajectory I should expect over a career in web/software development? Where does it typically plateau, and how realistic would it be to catch-up to say £150k over the long term? 

Thanks a lot.",Weather__Wizard,1,1.0,0,1691058154,2023-08-03 10:22:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15h092f/law_to_software_engineering_salary_prospects/,8,2023

Hey guys, 

I internally interviewed for an promotion to supervisor last Tuesday. I know the Hiring Manager has stopped interviewing for that role and are now interviewing for different roles under that supervisor position. My floor is also rearranging offices which I believe is in anticipation for this new supervisor role. 

My question is how long do you think is appropriate to hear back on this? It’s now been 8 working days and I figured I would’ve heard by now considering the department is actively being built.

I should add I just want to know, good or bad, so I can stop being anxious about it. Also, my company is notorious for being slow on these matters. I believe I waited three weeks to hear when I was first hired in 2021.

I don't know if anyone is going to see this but I studied law in school and I hate it, I absolutely hated the 5 years as an undergrad, I was depressed all the time, and it only got worse over time. I graduated awhile ago and I had to wait at home for a year for something unrelated but during that time I've been so happy I got a job, it's not a good job but it's not too bad, realized I have a passion for data and I have been taking classing online to become a data analyst but the problem now is that my family wants me to go to law school, that is something I don't want at all. I've spoken to them but they said it's better I do it now and focus on what I want later, but an entire year another entire year doing something that makes me misrable and I don't like at all, I have no intention of using the degree. But the issue is that if I do next go to law school I'm taking a huge risk, if I don't get a job I'll be on my own. That's a huge risk to take. 
I don't know what to do, honestly 
I'm so tired, everytime I hear that there is progress in the law school thing and I'll have to resume soon, I get so sad, distracted and I can't focus on anything .
What should I do? I really need help.
Or I just needed to vent.

15guwyk,Advice to break into IB after a late start,"Hey everyone, this is my first Reddit post so bare with me. 

So, I am a rising junior at a semi-target school in the South. I’ve got a 3.98 gpa, I’m the president of a very organized club, and I have worked as a teaching assistant and student instructor for business classes. There’s some other good stuff on my resume such as awards, job experience, conference speaking, etc, but I have 0 internship experience. 

This past summer (after sophomore year) I tried applying to around 100 postings, to no avail.  1000% my fault, I networked wayyy too little and late thinking gpa and school’s regional rep would get me interviews. 

So, this summer I’ve tried to learn from my mistakes. I’ve been networking extensively, joined 2 networking groups, I am doing a research project (presenting to one of the networking groups and maybe posting on site), and I’m teaching myself SQL and getting Bloomberg market concepts certification (even though I know most of that stuff already). 

So, here’s my problem. I found out about IB late in my sophomore year, but I really see myself there. Corporate transactions and advisory seems like genuinely interesting work, I’m obsessed with modeling in excel, and the rate at which you learn things in that field is unlike anything else. IB teaches and prepares for everything I want to do later in my career.

So, while I may be able to express genuine interest, I  am very aware that I missed recruitment for next summer (2024). I’m completely stuck with what I should do. I can try to cold call my way into the backdoor of a small boutique firm, I could try to do AM, corporate finance, or maybe something else. I’ve applied to some stuff that I could leverage referrals from, nothing IB related yet. 

All I know is I want to position myself to get into IB, whether that be when I graduate in 2025 (unlikely) or through some other means like a lateral hire or a masters in finance or maybe something else that I haven’t heard of.

I’ve looked at MSF and I could definitely see myself doing that. I genuinely like school and I can leverage some solid letters of rec from profs I’ve worked with and for. I would also have to keep my grades up. 

I just have a ton of questions like: If I do go down the MSF route does that affect what I should apply for now?  How much of an uphill battle am I really fighting? Are other internships (not even IB) going to be harder for me because of my lack of formal experience? I’m just stuck as to how I should approach this coming summer. Anything is appreciated: comments, criticism, advice. Just looking to get some fresh perspectives.

15guk3r,My field has become lackluster to me. Where should I go?,"I currently work for a large global medical device company that hired me just prior to the pandemic because business was booming and they needed a bio engineer to help develop new methods for vetting their new products. 

Fast forward to today. Said company suffered from gross financial mismanagement through the pandemic and found itself in need of layoffs. Several thousand were laid off, and the management board executed a significant restructuring of the whole global R&D organization. My group and position remained intact since all of the other groups need us for method development and product prototype testing. But, as time went on, all of our innovative projects that were focused on reducing patient mortality and helping the patient to be healthier were cancelled. Now all of our innovation is geared towards...drum roll...cost savings. Using less material in the product, making it smaller, thinner, faster, cheaper, etc.

I recently gave a presentation to several higher-ups and the medical office to propose an innovation that would significantly improve patient health and reduce mortality both in the short and long term. Even filed a patent with the company. I provided plenty of financial projections and estimates with all the evidence I provided, and showed that this would be an inexpensive addition to our current product lineup, and would increase profit by 5-8% per treatment. The first thing out of the higher-ups' mouths? ""I don't know if this will give us as much money as we would like. This isn't saving us any money."" Uh, yeah. It's a new addition. It won't save us money, it's going to EARN us money.

I've seen this trend growing in the medical field. The focus has shifted from helping the patient to filling the shareholder's pockets, and I no longer feel the sense of motivation that I got from helping people with my job, and the pay has increased very slowly compared to inflation. I worry that if I get let go, (which may happen soon to ""save more money""), that I will find myself in the same situation at any medical company where I might apply. I don't know where to go, and I find myself unsure of my skills in any other field that might provide good job security and comparable pay since most would have me starting from square one.

15gs0dj,"Young Adult Experiencing Career Struggles, What's New?","I am currently working as a Supply Chain Business Analytics Co-Op for a corporate job. I was never a social butterfly; I prefer being alone or with my close friends. Communication could be better; I even feel awkward in conversations with my family. I'm a good communicator but struggle in discussions because I overthink what I will say next rather than listen and react. I interviewed for this job in March and got an offer the next day. I felt confident throughout the interview and my first day but became anxious once I started. I lacked communication with my colleagues and self-confidence, making it hard to showcase my abilities, form connections, and expand my social and professional network.  
I often felt under-appreciated from a work standpoint and a personal standpoint. My company has TV's that hang around the building with necessary information like events and new hires that flip through the screen. On my first day, five others joined the team in different departments. They all have pictures rotating on the TVs; I didn't for some reason. Now this doesn't bother me, but it's something to note. My work has been relatively easy, and a few times, my boss has acknowledged my work and let me know he's been genuinely impressed with what I've done. Which should boost my confidence, but... it doesn't. I often find myself needing something to do. I want to ask my boss for more work, but I am hesitant due to my lack of self-confidence and communication skills. My boss and colleagues are much older than me (by 20-30 years), making it a challenge to have meaningful conversations, as we have different interests due to the generation gap. As my time at this job ends, I need to work on my self-confidence and stop overthinking things to achieve my goals. If anyone has experienced similar struggles or has tips for boosting self-confidence in the workplace, I would greatly appreciate it. What are some of the things you do to overcome these difficult situations?",No-Plant-4393,2,1.0,2,1691031046,2023-08-03 02:50:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15gs0dj/young_adult_experiencing_career_struggles_whats/,8,2023

15gr3d0,Don't let your depression cost you money,"Thanks to a lot of hard work, I pushed through my depression and I'm now making 42% more at my current job than I was this time last year. That depression cost me more than $50k over the past 3 years, because I was too afraid to advocate for myself.

So I want **YOU** to listen up. Yes you, standing in the back of the room hoping no one will notice of you. I'm guessing that you were relieved when your work anniversary came and passed because you didn't have to sit through a review. You survived another year and still have a job. Of course you are probably a little angry and extra depressed too, because you didn't get a raise this year (or the last 3 come to think of it...) and you could really use the money. Well it's time to get yourself that raise. Hold up! Don't run and don't panic.

**I know what your thinking, because I have been there many times myself. Let me reassure you, that you are not about to get fired any day now...**

Has your boss brought you in for a harsh chat recently? No? Well then you are probably in the clear and it's time to talk money. 

**Thanks to inflation, every year that you don't get a pay raise you are essentially taking a pay cut.** I did that 3 years in a row took a virtual pay cut of 9%. While I did eventually negotiate a cost of living increase, I missed out on at least $12k in additional income by getting 3% more each year instead of a one time 9% bump later. That's just the bare minimum and not the end goal. Eventually I got to a place where I could leverage a potential job offer into 32% salary increase bringing me significantly closer to industry standard pay for my position. If this raise had been split over 3 years however, I would have earned an extra $50k. 

I also negotiated a clear roadmap for my future within the company which includes additional responsibilities in exchange for bonus incentives. I'm now, for the first time in a 25 year career genuinely optimistic. A few pills from my doctor helped me take the first steps, but taking control of my career has been the best anti-depressant ever. I can't guarantee you the same outcome, but it's probably worth a shot.",redshadow310,11,1.0,1,1691028453,2023-08-03 02:07:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15gr3d0/dont_let_your_depression_cost_you_money/,8,2023
15gr1d3,How might I study / pursue a career in both Architecture and Interior Design?,"Hi all, my bad if this isn't the correct community to post this in. I am about to be in my last year of high school in the U.S. and am currently interested in pursuing Architecture and Interior Design in post-secondary school. I am highly interested in both of these fields. I don't have much to any knowledge on studying or pursuing a career in these fields, but at the moment the idea of obtaining a master's/bachelor's in both of these areas sounds much more fulfilling to me than only one.

  
Is it possible to double major in both architecture and interior design? If so, what schools (in the U.S. or Europe) offer the ability to double major in these fields?

  
Is it a better idea to major in architecture and to minor in interior design, or to follow a course of study of something of the like?

  
I've done a bit of research on schools in the U.S. that I think might be compatible with these plans (offer programs of study in both fields and offer either double majoring or a minor in one field) and was wondering if they would be a good fit for what I want to do?:

  
\- Pratt Institute  
\- SCAD  
\- Syracuse University  
\- Drexel University

  
I am having a hard time however finding other schools that offer both architecture and interior design. Please let me know of any other schools that would be compatible with these plans (and if these are sound plans in the first place.)

15gqg9i,I like my work but not my coworkers,"Brief background:

I work at a bank. 

I started as a teller from a different company and eventually got offered a better and full time position at my current company.

Even though I have previous banking experience as a teller, it took me awhile to learn and get familiarize with my new role. I hardly have any training and I basically learn things as I deal with my clients and they ask me questions then I will ask my manager or my senior financial advisor.

Recently, work has been really stressful. The amount of work load I have was from having one financial advisor going on a leave, new hire to cover that position to quit in less than a month, and teller manager going on vacation.

I like my work, and I’m proud of what I have accomplished and where I am right now, but I hate coming to work knowing I’d work with a bunch of people who doesn’t support one another. I hate that I take pride of what I do yet I look around and I feel like people are just abusing me taking the workload that I was given.

What would you do if you were in my position? I live in a small town and there’s not a whole lot of opportunities. I also don’t have any degree. Pay is decent and they are matching our retirement savings too.
But Jesus, I feel like I wanna hang myself as soon as I leave home for work.",blueblink77,1,1.0,0,1691026668,2023-08-03 01:37:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15gqg9i/i_like_my_work_but_not_my_coworkers/,8,2023
15gq6wd,Any other Data Managers have such bad meetings?,"So, I'm a data manager for a relatively large CRO (a company that's hired by Pharma companies to run their clinical trials studies). 

I, along with a small handful of colleagues, was flown half way around the country to meet face to face with the client and discuss the study we're working on. 

My portion was the centerpiece of the meeting; timelines for reviewing the data we get from sites and vendors (labs).

I was scheduled to give a 2 hour presentation. 

I spent the last several weeks creating about 80 slides going over every aspect of our process, along with timelines for how long it'd take to accomplish certain things. 

In total, I was only able to *actually* show about 8 different slides (someone else, joining virtually, was in control of the slide deck, so I couldn't even switch to a slide relevant to the rapidly changing conversation without explicit request). 

The ENTIRE time, the client's project lead was interrupting and telling me I had to look into our review timelines so as to bring the timeline down to about a month.

I estimated a timeline for delivery of clean data of around 2 months or so; the vast majority of which had nothing to do with reviewing data, but rather waiting to get data from the vendors the client hired.

One of the labs literally requires 6 weeks to do their testing; 2 weeks of review and reconciliation afterwards was an absolute *best* case scenario. There was no shortening of the time line available, aside from just flat our lying. 

A lot of people on her team recognized and understood the necessity of the timeline I put together. But she, the head hancho of the project, would not let up on me, and was extraordinarily patronizing.

In total, I was at the podium for about 4 hours. Being grilled constantly about things that are completely outside of my control or scope of work. Most of it was stuff *they* needed to decide, but haven't yet. 

I left the meeting feeling terrible. I know I looked bad to the client; I looked unprepared and like I didn't know what I was talking about, but they never actually let me present any of the info I had prepared and often just straight up ignored the answers I gave them to their questions. 

Has anyone else had meetings like this? 

Should I be worried about my job, even though the bad presentation was kind of out of my control?

It felt like an absolute living nightmare, I feel like a failure, and I'm not sure what else to even think at this point.",mathnstats,2,1.0,3,1691025957,2023-08-03 01:25:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15gq6wd/any_other_data_managers_have_such_bad_meetings/,8,2023

Well, that hasn’t happened yet because there are more pressing things at the moment—like taking the GMAT and applying to MBA programs—and to be fair I nearly forgot about the certificate plan due to all of these other pressing matters.
Today I got a call from a friend, who said that they are looking for a science teacher at their middle school. Apparently my name was mentioned, so I guess that’s why I was even considered. It sounds promising, but it poses a bunch of issues. If I were to apply and take the job if offered, I would have to drop out of school because it would be full time and therefore I would no longer be able to go to classes. What do you think?

15gpxn5,Should I proceed with caution on this?,"
I’ve been looking for jobs and this place I applied to responded. The first one seemed fine, if a little stilted and the signature was off. I censored it but it had the recruiter’s name on the first line and then the company name on the second with a misplaced comma like this:

Name
, company 

I figured it was a formatting typo. Then I got the second email confirming my interview and it just seemed more off. The company name (which I’ve censored) in the body of the email was in all caps, which is weird. And then other little things like the misplaced comma again and just general typos. 

I applied on LinkedIn and it came from a smart recruiter email (which is what their internal application uses according to the URL). The recruiter name is someone who does exist on LinkedIn and does talent acquisition for the company. This feels weird to say, but she is Indian and has work history in India, so maybe that would account for typos? Idk I really hope it’s legit. Like I said, it’s a job I really have applied for and is legit (people on the company team have shared the job)

15gniml,Advice on leaving my job,"I am currently a senior in school and I work at the university. I needed the job for experience as i wasn’t able to get an internship. However, I worry about if I want to leave the team. I work with a student who graduated in may and is looking for a new job somewhat actively. I ask him here and there about his search and he is always unsure, so none of us have an idea of when he might leave. 

It stresses me out because once he does, a lot of responsibility will fall on me. I am a capable person, but this guy takes this job super seriously and is very smart and I won’t be able to fill his shoes. 

I worry if he leaves, and i feel too much pressure and I want to leave, I won’t be able to have the professor who runs the team as a reference. This isn’t a huge deal but I would like to amicably leave if it comes to it. I also want to possibly leave because I get grants for school that should cover rent and I can focus on my last year of school.

So here are my main questions.. Should I push them to hire another person? Would they be suspicious? If I do want to quit should I give them two weeks or a months notice? I’ve been there half a year now, is that a valid enough time to put them as experience for my resume?   Is it awful to leave them after the other guy leaves?

15gn5bl,Should I tell the Financial Controller he was rude to me?,"
 I am fairly new at my job where I work in internal accounting at a law firm. As you can imagine there are a lot of things to do and remember. I am 23F and this is my first time working in a full time position in accounting, my previous roles were all interns. I started on May 15 and I have been in training ever since I have made a few mistakes here and there but overall my feedback has been that I am a very fast learner and produce good work. 

The computer program that we work in is fairly new to me. There are a lot of rules that I am not aware of and the financial controller who is a middle-aged man that works remotely is in charge of the back-end I guess. During my training, I was told that we have to be out of the program by 5 PM during month-end. Last month I got an email saying that we had to be out at 4:45 PM and this month we got an email saying that we had to be out at 4:40 PM. The changes were not communicated to us at all, I was out by 440 on the dot but I guess it wasn’t good enough. I then got an email from the financial controller was a screenshot that I was confused about saying “ This is what I was trying to AVOID!!!! As everyone knows, all caps and exclamation marks can be shown can be seen as screaming via text or email my blood started to instantly boil because I think that that was very inappropriate to send, worse if it was done in person. 

This is not the first time that he has sent me emails, kind of expecting me to know things when I am in training, the last two times he told me that I have to close my sessions or else he cannot proceed, which I was never told during training. 

 I drafted an email instantly CCing my manager, his boss and my supervisor telling him that I was confused because I was out of the program at 4:40 and that during training I was told that it was 5 PM and that they should let us know well in advance If the rules we’re going to be changed going forward. I also wanted to add that it was inappropriate for him to be screaming at me via email. 

I chose not to send it just in case I was acting on emotion and that it would be inappropriate. However, now that I’ve cooled off, I still think that it was inappropriate for him to scream at me via email and that I should establish boundaries. 

My other coworkers have joked in the past that they don’t want to be “screamed at” whenever something happens, but I always thought that they were speaking figuratively. I was not I was never expecting to be screamed out by email.

15glyin,"I have been feeling unmotivated in my job, but can't figure out what to do about it.","As the title says, I've been in a bit of a rut at work.

For context, I've been at my job for 4 years. I'm currently a manager with a team of 2 reporting to me. I started as an individual contributor in a unique marketing position. In the first 2 years, I proved out the position and was given raises and praised over and over for my work.

In year 2, I asked for a promotion and I also asked to hire an additional team member to work under me as I was feeling burnt out with all the work I was doing by myself. My boss dragged their feet and I ended up getting a job offer at a different company that paid me much more than I was making at the time. My boss was able to match the offer, give me the promotion, and got me to stay. I hired the new employee, and recently hired a second employee to my team. We are now a team of 3. 

By all measures, my team and I are successful. We've built new programs and initiatives that really make a difference. I have an amazing team and they are great at what they do.

What I'm struggling with now is feeling fulfilled and inspired like I used to when I was an individual contributor. I battle with this because I've always wanted to be a leader and very much enjoy being in leadership. However, I have a lot less work to do now. My days vary from many meetings all day, to sometimes a handful of meetings and a little bit of work. For the most part, by the time the afternoon hits, I either don't have much (meaningful) work to do, nor do I want to look for meaningful work within the org.

My manager constantly praises me and my team, and I even won award at the beginning of the year. I am part of cross-functional projects outside of my team that sort of ""shake things up"" and give me some different things to do. I know how to make my team and me look great even though internally, I feel so uninspired and indifferent about work.

I don't want to leave my company, I love my employer and my teammates. I have looked at other jobs and even interviewed at some, but it would just mean rebuilding the programs and initiatives that I built at my current job at a new company and having to build a team all over again. 

I see this as having a few options:

* Ride it out, wait for more inspiring work/projects to come around and be part of them.
* Find a new job, start my role from scratch and be paid more money
* Gun for a Director or Senior Manager position now, but I don't even feel the energy to do so.

I'd appreciate any thoughts or advice from folks reading this from the outside in. I've been stuck in my head about this and my partner thinks maybe I just need to be doing the same job I do now for a different industry. However, even thinking of start over new somewhere else sounds exhausting to me.

**TL;DR:** Succeeding at my job by all measures, working on important work, but I have been feeling unmotivated and inspired for about 9 months now.",Decent_Potential_151,2,1.0,5,1691015012,2023-08-02 22:23:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15glyin/i_have_been_feeling_unmotivated_in_my_job_but/,8,2023

15glco6,Stay in stable but toxic job or take new offer,"Been in current employment for 8 years. Annual leave is 35 days, sick pay is 6 weeks full pay and the work is not massively stressful but line management is extremely ignorant to the point of frequent discrimination of various kinds. 

We have a high staff turnover, many colleagues frustrated with the way things are managed but job market isn't great so many stay but morale is low. I see my length of service, as a disabled person, as insurance almost. I have more rights and protection past the 2 year mark & a couple days extra annual leave per year. 

I've been unhappy for a while, sometimes seriously depressed because of things that have happened e.g my medical information being shared inappropriately, being told I'm disabled for spiritual crimes and all sorts. If I wasn't dealing with raising my kids and managing my health I might have had the energy to go to tribunal but alas!

Was headhunted last week by a much smaller charity, they offered me a job which I declined and they came back again with an offer for a job tailored to my interests and skills. It's part time (I'd get to take my kids to school and save £350pm in childcare), same salary pro rata, 7 days less annual leave, less paid sick leave but they do have an additional policy for paid time off related to disability. They have a stable staff team, who seem happy & I've done projects with them in the past that were really positive. They are probably less financially secure than my current place due to being a smaller group and charity funding dependent. 

Manager told me I was getting a promotion a couple months back and backed out offering it to someone else. I was asked to apply for a different internal role but no interview for this until the end of the month. Full time, 2k more per year, flexible working, keep accrued benefits but still working with ignorant people. Not guaranteed I'd get it as its all promise at this stage, much like before. if I wait til end of month, I will lose the offer from other charity. Current employer doesn't know I've had interviews or been offered a job.

Part of me is really scared by the prospect of losing job security by moving on but the other part wants to jump at the chance of working with people who value me and understand disability. Cost of living crisis makes me feel even more hesitant to take a risk.

15gl933,"Worried about my job, getting fired","Hi. I have been in a new job for a few months- I work in a newsroom as a producer. 

Anyways, it’s very fast-paced, high-stress for a lot of people. I knew this going in, I worked at another station. And things were shitty there, but that was mostly based on pay. I had friends there and somewhat of a work-life balance then. 

Fast forward to now, I initially loved being here. I had good prospects. Though I am overnights some or most of the week, I felt hopeful and like I was able to have a balance. 

As time has gone on, a lot of people have left the station. Maybe 4-5 since I’ve been here- not just producers though. So a lot of us are picking up a greater workload. I think one more producer is about to come on board. Still, we are seriously understaffed and it’s definitely starting to show on quality and people’s attitudes, including my own. 

Now, I’ve recently started experiencing health issues due to this sleep schedule. Ps- sometimes the schedule changes from where I’ll work a early mornings one week then do overnights the next. At my old station, even on the same schedule, this wasn’t an issue. I’m not sure if it’s just because I’m older now or if it’s the schedule, but it’s becoming hard. It’s inconsistent, I guess. I always had mental health issues but recently have become severely depressed, anxious, insomniac, and paranoid. I also have moderate stomach issues and need to see a cardiologist now. (Ps in my late 20s so I’m not that old also I have two therapists right now if anyone is wondering)

More on that, it’s come into some coworker conflict. I already had to talk with another coworker with my managers. Mostly, this was because they had come at me, and others saw it, but I definitely could’ve been nicer. Now my mental health issues have also turned into me snapping at coworkers. Many of them are very kind and fun, but a handful of them ruin it for me. They gossip about each other, pick on each other- it’s actually made me almost cry to their face a few times. I even told someone to shut up the other day. I quickly and sincerely apologized, I did feel really bad about it, but I don’t think it sat well with everyone (3 other people) in the room. 

I’ve also been talked to about using my phone when I shouldn’t once by my boss, a few other times by coworkers. Everyone’s on their phone at times, but it’s affected my work at times too. Though It’s an anxiety coping mechanism for me, I know it’s an issue. Currently, I’m dealing with some serious family issues outside of work where I’ve needed to be on standby, but I don’t want to tell my coworkers too much on that. 

I’ve talked to my bosses about changing my schedule- and all of my health issues without extreme detail.  They sounded supportive and gracious. I am thankful they heard me out. This was a few weeks ago.  They followed up twice to say they’d get back to me on a solution. While I trust them, I still feel on edge about what’s coming next. The environment isn’t that great, I had too stifle a crying panic attack before I left today. 

Because of all of the above, I fear being fired. Which , I hate. Even though this hasn’t been the best experience lately, I love what I do. And if I were to ever leave, I’d want it on good terms. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel a little hopeless. The only people I get to see now are my therapist and my boyfriend. Let it be known my “weekend” starts when I leave early morning, I only have one full day off, then the next night I go back to work. I don’t have much of a work life balance but I don’t want to quit- especially not be fired.

15gk1mz,Is it wrong to have career goals?,"I currently have a stable job where I get a decent pay and my workload is very light. My current partner was trying very hard to recruit me from a competitor firm and promised several items, which I took with a grain of salt as interviews are always promising. Since my interview and day 1, I have requested I get an exposure to a different type of project. This was “promised” by the managing partner and studio partner. I was willing to take on more work and downgrade my tasks as needed if I can help out. In addition, I was also “promised” to grow as a manager and he would support me to grow.

After 1 year during my evaluation, I have re-emphasized that I would like that exposure still but I understand that it takes time. I let them know it was part of my career goal (which they ask during the evaluation) and I am more than willing to take on more work if I can have that opportunity. 

It is now 2 years and I am where I started, or even less. I was managing my own projects before but here I am in the backseat, but I don’t mind that since I have less responsibilities. I do not have that exposure still and I did not grow as a manager at all, I am doing minor tasks because there are too many senior staffs here. I couldn’t leave my career in their hands so after discussing these items with the studio partner didn’t get me anywhere, I went to our managing partner. I initially went to talk to him for another subject matter and he remembered that I still wanted to assist in another project. He mentioned he will talk to my studio partner and make it happen as he said “If we don’t give you this opportunity, someone else will and we don’t want that.”

Few days later, studio manager came to me and he was not happy at all. He is offended that I went to go talk to my managing partner (who I am technically supposed to report to). He clearly expressed his frustration and confirmed he will not give me that opportunity as his studio is the priority. 

I feel like I am stuck. I made my studio partner “upset” and I can’t grow in my career here with him intervening due to office politics. I don’t hate the company and I’d hate to leave but to what extent can I sit on my goals and be happy with a paycheck? I don’t think I can go talk to the bossboss again.

15ghm3v,Am I unreasonable to tell my company that I’m quitting if I’m not promoted?,"I’m going to be fairly vague due to the industry I work in still being relatively new and small. 

I started with my new company roughly three months ago. I decided to apply because my previous company was extremely toxic, unorganized and the executives were all brought on due to being friends with someone else on the executive team. Terrible recipe for a multi-hundred million industry. Regardless of all that, I started at the bottom and worked my way up to running an entire location 6x larger than the current location I work at now. My mental health was deteriorating with my previous employer, they didn’t care about employees only living their pockets, I was more stressed than I ever had been, working 16 hour days for months straight as a salary employee. I made good money but overall I lost a lot of time with my wife and child and I grew to resent the company. I took a $30k pay cut and way lower position with my new employer because I’ve followed them heavily and it seemed like a great place to work, which it absolutely is, but I gambled on myself because of my experience and knowledge/skills in this industry so I took a position that’s basically a shift supervisor. 

Fast forward to being here for a short period of time, I’ve increased the standards at our location significantly but honestly the work bores me because I’m used to far more responsibilities. I’ve had nothing but glowing reviews being told I’ve driven significant performance, my communication is top tier. My knowledge and experience far exceeds the others here in similar positions and I’ve made suggestions to my supervisor that have been implemented across the location that has had positive impacts to our production. During meetings I’ve been told by superiors that they “have plans” for me which was extremely encouraging. Recently a new position was created which IS a promotion and I was strongly urged to apply. This position however, after my first interview with my direct supervisor is basically described as an assistant and is a glorified job of what I’m already doing. But nonetheless it is a pay increase. However I’m extremely driven in my career because one, I have a family to take care, and two I was basically at rock bottom 5 years and have worked for everything in my career after finally finding my niche in this field. I have multiple years experience and leadership in this field alone. I feel like it’s a bit of a slap in the face after being told they have plans for me and if this is their plans, I strongly disagree with it given my experience and knowledge. I was the fastest promoted employee with my previous company and will be again with the new company. I feel like i should be doing far more than being assistant manager due to experience and knowledge but I’m still young, I started this industry when I was 26 and I’ve just turned 29 and look far younger and feel that I’ve been overlooked quite bit here and in the past because of my youth. 

I’m going on a tangent now but I have my second interview coming up for this “promotion” and I’m extremely loyal and believe in complete open and honest communication. Am I in the wrong for telling my operations director that if I’m passed up for this position that I’ll be exploring other opportunities that I feel are more of a fit for my capabilities? The company is great, again, but I am someone who essentially has to continue learn and I’ve done all of this that I am currently and will be doing with the promotion.  I’m constantly looking at expanding my knowledge base and do educational courses in my free time such as working on my project management certification now, along with software engineering classes, and lastly leadership courses(this is just my current courses I’m working on).

15ggkro,Wronged by my internship. What can I do?,"See the post I made two weeks prior for a backstory. In short, my manager has not only pressured me to go against safety protocols, she has also deliberately treated another intern, whose father holds a deputy director position, with favoritism. I've been yelled at, berated in front of others, and ignored by this manager when asking for instructions.

&#x200B;

Someone called HR on my behalf. After investigation, HR removed me from this manager. I had less than 3 weeks remaining, so no other manager would take me in. My status switched to ""remote"" for the remainder of the term. The problem is that this docks my pay, as I was originally entitled to a weekly housing stipend. This is ridiculous because I've paid my landlord in full for the term, and no one could've foreseen this conflict.

&#x200B;

What's more, it's not just my manager that ruined this experience. HR failed to process my onboarding documents on time and incorrectly entered my information, so I spent a whopping 4 weeks out of the 10 week period doing nothing but training and shadowing, because working at the facility requires the completion of onboarding. After that, I could only work under my manager for 3 weeks before the investigation.

&#x200B;

HR gave me a verbal (not even written) ""we're sorry,"" and said that they've never faced such an unusual situation. They said that this manager should not have had two interns simultaneously working for her, and that they'll enforce this rule more strictly in the future. I don't buy it. I believe that they knew, but turned a blind eye because the other intern's father is the deputy director. This is a rather large facility in the public sector.

&#x200B;

HR told me about the ""improvements"" they'll make for the interns of next year. They'll provide more training for diversity, equity, and inclusion. They'll direct interns to sources of contact in case there's a conflict with one's manager. Ok, great. But this doesn't help my situation at all.

&#x200B;

I'm baffled. At minimum, I want a written apology and to be compensated for the housing stipend that I've been deprived of. 

&#x200B;

Is there any legal action I can take against this? Here's where it gets confusing. This happened in the state of California, where interns have the same rights as full time employees. However, I'm neither a California resident, nor am I directly hired by this facility. I'm hired by an external organization which matched me to this facility. This external organization is located in Tennessee, but I'm not a Tennessee resident either.

I've been struggling for awhile to get a job related to my degree and I haven't been successful.

I made a post on a different account recently on a college subreddit. And I got tons and tons of hate on it. Not trying to excuse what I've said but I made the statement that ""I didn't even major on something people consider worthless like liberal arts degrees"" and got the shit kicked outta me. I live in an area thats very STEM heavy and jobs outside of those don't do very well. In the post I made I got a ton of hate and told I was ignorant because business degrees are just as worthless if not more than liberal arts degrees. I had taken 7 years to finish my degree and most people derided me for being an idiot and said I shouldn't be dunking on liberal arts if it took me 7 years to finish my degree. I was super indecisive about my major and it took me a lot of changes in those 7 years in order to settle on my major. And with the recent posts I made and all the hate I got from it has made me feel even worse about my life.

15gf9q3,Feeling miserable and burnt out,"Im kinda venting here but I need some advice…

I don’t know how to not feel like this all the goddamn time I'm so tired of everything and I feel like I've lost all of my motivation and momentum. 

During high school, I was the best among my peers, scored high on every national test, and got 100s on every school test. When senior year started, I started to study hard, I literally studied for like 12 hours straight without getting bored or tired. But surprisingly, I really LOVED it. Studying for long periods of time was the only thing that brought me comfort.

By the end of the year, I managed to get into every school I applied to in my home country.
I chose to attend this scholarship program I got into, it's basically a foundation year in my home country, and then four years to study abroad. 
I just finished the foundation year and I’m traveling to the US in a month or so.

But the thing is, I feel like this past year has f****d me up in so many ways!!!! Everyone said to me that I wouldn’t “survive” this year since it’s extremely challenging and hard but I knew that I’d be capable of going through it with an open heart and high grades like I usually do. 

I moved to a different city since the classes are held there and I was surrounded by SO MANY intelligent brains to the point where I felt awful about myself. Although we scored nearly the same, there was always this voice in my head that told me that I could’ve done better. I started to push myself to study more, but I couldn't. More to say, forcing myself to study felt like pure torture, not that the material was hard, no, but my brain just couldn't process any information like it used to do. I felt like it was just ‘floating’ inside my head. Idk if it's a lack of vitamins or smth, but while I'm studying or during any test, I go through this complete blackout and I feel like I'm not aware of my surroundings or the questions in front of me. My brain literally goes numb. Keep in mind I didn't have any of these blackouts back in high school. 

I was living alone and things started to get worse and worse. My mental health started to go downhill. My days were merging together forming this non-ending loop of tiredness and exhaustion. I was barely getting enough sleep. Classes were 40 hours a week so I didn't have any time to study or just LIVE. I go back to my dorm and the sun is already down. I couldn’t manage my time and the overwhelming amount of workload. My room was so messy and I just couldn't keep up with all the chores. 

Not to mention that when I first got there I made so many friends to the point where I felt so uncomfortable, but I couldn't cut them off bc I was afraid to hurt their feelings. They literally drain me so so much when I hang out w them PLUS I feel like they kinda distract me from my studies. However, a few friends were making this ride worthwhile and I’m so grateful to have them.

During weekends I take the 4 hours train back to my family and it's just so freaking exhausting to travel 8 hours every goddamn weekend, yet if I stayed away from my family my mental health will get even worse. 

I felt exhausted, overwhelmed, and unmotivated. I just wanted to stay in bed all day. I was so burnt out to the point where I couldn’t physically function. 

My life is literally on the run and I can't process everything all at once, everything is happening so fast.
I'm very dedicated to my studies. Blood, sweat, and tears were shed into where I’m at today. It's just so heartbreaking to feel that someday my hard work and effort might go down the drain for nothing.

I'm heading off to college in late August and I chose a challenging degree. I don't want to mess up since I'm starting with a new GPA. I'll be in a new country with a whole new environment, and I don’t know if I should socialize like I did or just mind my own business. 

I felt that this year made me more vulnerable, as i was exposed to my weakness and went through so many ups and downs. I want to learn how to be more stronger in handling various situations. Independence is really HARD. 

I need some help on how to deal with these blackouts, tips on how to manage my time, social life, and emotions, or just your general advice.

I'm so sorry for this long rant and all the typos :))",RevolutionaryCry45,1,1.0,0,1690997753,2023-08-02 17:35:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15gf9q3/feeling_miserable_and_burnt_out/,8,2023

I have saved and invested just above 20k. About 60% of this is in etfs and the rest is mostly in individual stocks. I am an extremely ambitious individual and it just gets the best of me. I feel so behind for some reason and i feel like it will never be enough.

They vary. Typically I get 3 bonuses (a sales bonus - which everyone gets and it is 500 for every million the company makes, a hazard bonus from my boss which is 5k for all the extra shit I do around the office, and another project bonus which is 8% of our large project for the year... this varies and is between 5-20k). Typically my year ends around 75-85k after bonuses. Sounds great, but I get no other benefits besides PTO (which is 14 days), and 401k with a 4% match. 

&#x200B;

I love my job, but it is getting out of control. I am a glorified babysitter for grown men. The only work I do not do is the payroll and taxes, but I assist the CFO and office manager with EVERYTHING. From auditing the company vehicles, and managing the install team, I also manage 5 states that have their reps, so I also do whatever they don't do when they are golfing or dicking off. I don't get anything in commission from those quotes or sales, but I have to do it. Communicating with customers because the reps are busy, managing inventory, managing the interns, ordering supplies, making sure the office is clean and stocked... everything. 

&#x200B;

So, I've been here for 5 years and I am exhausted. I want to actively look for another position to start in January (after my bonus checks clear the bank), but I know my boss is going to take it REAL hard when I resign. I am sure he is going to want to counter-offer. However, I also know that nothing will change in the company. There have been rumors of him offering me a position in ownership but with the ""CFO"" they have, he is as shady as they come and IDK if that's something I want to dive into. 

&#x200B;

I love the industry, and I love some of the people I work with... but I also know I can do less work for more money and just do my job and go home. Is it worth it? Some of the perks are... my boss takes us out for lunch 2-4x a month, he pays for mani/pedis about twice a year.... we get 2 weeks off at Christmas ...

However, I have been self employed as a wedding photographer for the last 7 years. Now I would like to return to the workforce. I am nervous about how to return after a prolonged absence.

The actual job is great sort of. The job is unique and the management is nice and flexible to work with my kids schedule.

I still want to quit but I am not sure its the right decision.  While the job does not work well for me right now - in a different season - it may be a better fit and I may want to return. The problem is its been only 90 days. What scenario can I create that would allow me to exit but without looking like I am flaky or unreliable.

I have 10 years of experience in the electrical engineering industry and made a jump to a software engineer position 8 months ago (I’ve always programmed and my position in the industry dealt heavily on code, so the skills were there to do the jump)

Boss is super happy with my performance, and I expect a salary increase this year.

However, my family’s business is dealing with a digital transformation plan that went bad due to insufficient technical knowledge inside the company. 

I’m thinking of quitting my current job and start working in my family’s company as a tech lead, helping with building the skills the company needs. I would like to leave with a solid team behind and return to the market looking for a tech lead position. 

My family would match my current salary and increase it if I choose to return.

Do you guys think that having that in my resume would work against me? Even without mentioning it is my family’s business, the jump from swe to tech lead would look weird in the resume (not to mention me moving locations back to my hometown)

But as much as I love what I do, I’ve learned that the pay isn’t the best when working for another person in the beauty industry (I’m currently commission based). My long term goal is to eventually open my own skin care business, but I have basically nothing in my savings and I’m struggling to pay bills at the moment, so I‘ve decided to quit esthetics for awhile in search of a decent paying hourly job to try to get my finances in order.

At his point I’ve applied to probably 75 ish jobs in the past 3 weeks and haven’t really received any responses. I have experience obviously with skincare/makeup, applied to Sephora and ulta since they usually pay their licensed employees more, and both companies reached out saying I was under qualified for the position (lmao what?). I’ve applied to some decent looking hourly positions at local restaurants, and all I’ve received is radio silence. I also have receptionist and animal care experience so I’ve applied to every job listed in those areas that I can.

So does anyone have any other ideas of places/jobs I should try to apply for?? I’m open to basically anything at this point. I just really need something with decent hourly pay so that I can at least know how much I’m making every week and be able to pay my bills. Benefits would be a plus, but I pay my own health insurance as of right now anyways so it wouldn’t be the end of the world if I wasn’t able to get them.

15gb751,Hiring Company is asking for an example of my work from when I worked at another company. How do I tell them I can not share? Or should I share?,"So a company I'm interested in is asking for a tracker that I made at my previous job. The tracker includes researched information (contact information, document requirements, forecasted timelines). I decided to send them the excel sheet tracker with just the headers of the tracker and deleted all the information. 

I figure that it is proprietary/confidential information from my old company and feel like it would be wrong to share. At this point, I don't even have the information aside from the headers for the tracker.   


There are two ways I can think of going forward:   


1. Tell them that I just no longer have the information and only have the headers from the tracker now. 
2. Explain to them that the information is proprietary/confidential and am unwilling to share.

15g9t4d,I’m feeling jaded training my teammate for a big promotion,"A year ago I joined my organization. About six months in one of my teammates that I manage asked me about their raise and promotion. I was blindsided. 

My boss hired them. I found out that my boss had verbally promised them a raise and promotion in title at six months in to get them to accept the position. 

My boss never informed me of this and the person was 100% not ready for a promotion. So they have them a 10% raise to keep them happy and told them I would be training them for six months. 

So here we are now. I’m a manager with exceptional credentials and 15 years experience that has now trained a person with 2 years experience and given them a title change and another 10% bump in one year of service with the company. 

Is it wrong to feel jaded? As a manager I am thrilled for my employee. As a few low coworker I’m feeling jaded as my review yielded me a 3% raise and this person got 20% and a title change. 

I spoke with my boss and they said nothing would be done for me as unless it’s warranted and it’s not as I just merely performed my duty of managing my employee well and my day to day work has stayed consistent.",CherryManhattan,3,1.0,1,1690985106,2023-08-02 14:05:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15g9t4d/im_feeling_jaded_training_my_teammate_for_a_big/,8,2023
15g9ja1,How to get recruiters to find you on LinkedIn,"Almost every recruiter in the world searches for candidates on LinkedIn.  


And the more recruiters that find you, the more job opportunities that come your way.  
  
**How do recruiters search for candidates using LinkedIn?**  
  
To start, we need to talk about how recruiters use LinkedIn.  
  
Most recruiters use a product called LinkedIn Recruiter, which gives them advanced search tools and expanded reach.  
  
Most commonly, recruiters will search using keywords related to the role that they are trying to fill.  
  
Therefore, to get in front of more recruiters, you need to have the right keywords in your LinkedIn profiles.  
  
**How do you know which keywords to include on your profile?**  
  
Fortunately, there's a simple hack that takes the guessing out of choosing the right keywords for your LinkedIn profile.  
  
**This is how you do it:**  
  
1. On your profile page, click ""More""  
2. Select ""Build a resume""  
3. Select ""Create from profile""  
4. Type in the job title that you want keywords for  
  
Now LinkedIn will generate a resume based on your profile. But you're not going to use this resume.  
  
Instead, on the right-hand side of the page, you'll see a keyword checker.  
  
LinkedIn has generated a list of keywords from millions of job openings and profiles of people with the same job title.  
  
There will be green checkmarks against the keywords that already exist in your profile. Plus a bunch of suggested keywords.  
  
These are the same keywords that recruiters are searching for when they're trying to fill these roles, so you'll want these keywords on your profile to increase discoverability.  
  
**Where should you put the keywords?**  
  
The short answer is: put the keywords wherever they fit most naturally.  
  
LinkedIn will recognize them wherever they are.  
  
This could be in your headline, your summary, in a position description, or listed as skills on your profile.  
  
Once you do that, you should see a significant increase in the number of recruiters viewing your profile and reaching out with job opportunities!",CareerScienceco,0,0.5,1,1690984425,2023-08-02 13:53:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15g9ja1/how_to_get_recruiters_to_find_you_on_linkedin/,8,2023

15g9gz8,"I have expert knowledge of a legacy system in my company, that no one else has. How do I leverage this in my performance/salary review?","I work in IT. I'm in the company over 10 years. We have a legacy system where all our developers have left. While I'm not a developer, I know the system pretty much inside out, particularly on the database side. I can answer any tech questions on it. My manager has similar knowledge but is nowhere near as technical nor has the database skills. Along with this knowledge and skillset, I work in my usual database role which is vital to projects and ensuring our systems are backed up and running.

How do I use this to my advantage in my upcoming reviews? I am overdue a raise, and would like to factor this knowledge into my review. I wanna say something like this but it comes across too blunt I think :

""I have over 10 years experience in X and no one else in the company has this level of experience or knowledge. I can answer questions immediately whereas it might take others days to figure out. If I were to leave the company, there would be no-one to answer/fix/investigate these issues as quick as me, and in some cases they might not be able to answer/fix them at all. Additionally, all questions/queries would be directed solely to you (my manager) as there is no one else to direct them to. This would be a massive load for you to bare, and it would leave our clients with many issues and would take much longer to answer/fix these issues"".

15g7xje,My bf 42m of 2 years just told me if I want to get married then I need to stop stripping. Is asking him to propose first and to cover all my bills until I find a high paying career a fair compromise ?,"TLDR: bf of 2 years knew I stripped when we became exclusive and we both wanted marriage in future. Now he’s asking me to quit my job if I want to get married. Would rather be rich and without marriage and love (in case I get divorced as divorce rates are high ) than be without love and broke. Should I tell my boyfriend he needs to compromise on this or get over my job? 

When I met my boyfriend he knew that I was working at a stripclub two months into us dating after we had decided to become exclusive. I don’t tell men or people my job since it can create issues for me in the past . If I tell the wrong person they could be a bad guy and treat me differently because of what I do. I have been sexually harassed, stalked, treated as if men can use me for sex etc. for my own personal safety I wait until things are moving towards exclusivity as well as being able to trust the guy before telling him. Now the economy has slowed down and I am not making as much but I’m sure it will eventually pick up again. I am 34 years old and still making more money than the average person in America . There are women who look good into their 50s if they take care of themselves and still make good money. I think that’s quite possible for me as people mistake me for being in my early twenties a lot.  My plan was to quit when I could no longer make money stripping and once I found a stable alternative career that pays as much . I am starting a small business and it’s in its infancy so it’s not 100 percent reliable to fall back on. I have never had an issue finding long term relationships and women working in my job are often married with families. Their husbands understand it’s just a job and men can look at  them but they can’t touch them. It is like being an actress . Their husbands don’t like it but I guess they tolerate it as there is a lot of pros ( the women make good money and able to have savings when most people these days can’t afford even an emergency fund, they only have to work a few days a week, and can retire early if they make proper investments). I think possibly men are becoming more tolerant of jobs like this become of the economy , also dating has been bad for men in general it seems and I constantly see posts on Reddit of guys not even getting dates at all . The views on this type of job is changing. Back in the 70s I heard stories of women losing their children in court because they were found out to be working as strippers. It just isn’t viewed as harshly anymore, however some people view it badly still. 

 now my boyfriend is telling me that he doesn’t want to get married unless I stop stripping. He has not proposed to me. I think it’s fair that I tell him that unless I have a proposal I am not going to give up my source of income especially since the guy I’m dating is not making enough to provide solely on his income alone. I also think that it’s only fair to expect that he fully supports me until I find a job to replace my income if he really wants to tell me he won’t marry me if I don’t stop stripping.

 He has a good pension but his income is not great. I have bills to pay and have some health issues with medical expenses . I think this is a fair compromise . Either that or I tell him that I’m going to continue stripping and he can leave the relationship if he wants to, as I was doing this when we met and I actually find it offensive that he thinks he can ask me to change my job now at this time. He says that my job is not good for my mental health . And I totally agree, a lot of the men have to be asked to leave for saying inappropriate things or trying to touch the dancers. However, there are a lot of jobs where people don’t feel great about what they do for a living and they keep going because they have bills to pay . I leave my job with a good conscience knowing I haven’t fucked anyone over. How many people working in other fields can say that ? Can a lawyer, doctor ,
People in different sales job, finance , say that usually ? I don’t really think so. How many people are able to have saved over 100 k in a few short years like me? The average person has under 1k in savings these days I  read .  I am also preparing to make an exit but not until I am financially secure with another job or business .Also divorce rates are high. I would rather be miserable and rich than miserable AND broke.

 I would say half of the women I work with are in marriages and married to successful men to boot. I tell this to my boyfriend and I think he finds it insulting when I tell him that I could be dating a guy who has no issue with me stripping and would also provide for me if necessary. But I think he should put things in perspective. He probably thinks if I love him and respect his feelings I should quit stripping . I see it as if he actually cared about me and my future he would tolerate me stripping , especially if he can’t guarantee he can financially provide for me . I do not want to marry someone who can’t compromise logically and out their emotions aside , and I don’t want to resent someone for asking me to do something that isn’t good for me in the long run.

 I also want to mention that I do the majority of cooking and cleaning in our relationship because my boyfriend just isn’t good at it , so I already feel like I am living in the role of a housewife AND working. My boyfriend says he doesn’t expect me to cook five days a week but then he is really incompetent at doing these things . I wouldn’t say completely incompetent but I find most men don’t clean up to my standards and I like to cook things like chateau brione, Korean food, Italian food, whereas my boyfriend is like happy eating bar pizza . I don’t want to be a broke housewife on top of things . What woman would want that ? I feel like he is living in a fantasy world about how the world works . I like alot of other qualities about him and have never felt this way about a guy since  maybe 15 years ago, but asking me to give up like 70 k in savings a year is inane on his part.  Is what I am asking a fair compromise , or should I just move on ? I know Reddit loves to tell people to break up too, so if you think I should move on please say why. I do believe relationships are about compromise and there is no “the one “ out there.",Odd_Match2206,0,0.28999999165534973,52,1690980130,2023-08-02 12:42:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15g7xje/my_bf_42m_of_2_years_just_told_me_if_i_want_to/,8,2023

15g7vao,Current company is great - but should I look for other opportunities?,"Hi all

I hope you are doing well

I have always believed in benchmarking to the market every few years and have done so throughout my career. But I have a really great job at the moment - and I worry that a sense of loyalty is keeping me from looking for other opportunities and that this may ultimately cost me.

I have been at my current company for around 5 years now - in which time the company has grown from 5 to 30 people.  I have my complaints - mostly the result of our growth - but overall I am very happy. I have a great relationship with my boss, and I have quite a bit of freedom and flexibility in how I approach my work.  For example, I remote work from another country several times a year without issue. And while our company is quite small , so there is little place for formal promotion,  my pay increases have also always been above inflation.

This has led me to have quite a sense of loyalty towards my boss. I have an in demand skillset, and I have been contacted by recruiters several times over the last few years, which I have always turned down. But, taking stock now that I am about to hit my mid 30s, I worry that not actively looking for other opportunities will or has cost me in terms of either professional or financial growth. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? I think perhaps the most pragmatic thing to do is to look to the market now to benchmark my pay and opportunities.

Off every weekend to spend with my little girl who is 9  as I'm on my own with her.  It just makes my life less stressful now and suits me perfect with childminders etc. But the other job is working with animals which is My dream Job for years and years. Starting money not much less  but because its less hours ( but more hours available later they said )I will be taking a pay cut but working more days/mornings , driving further so more petrol money needed, mon-fri perfect for school runs as il be able to drop and collect every day but its most Saturdays aswel leaving me finishing at 1 everyday going from two of their buildings, one is 20min drive away and the other is a 5mins drive from my home which would also be ideal.  but the hours they are offering at the moment are  really only leaving me have one full day off a week which is sunday. I did ask that for future months, child's summer holidays etc could I get some Saturdays off and maybe more hours in less days, they said it could be looked at.and I could end up with more hours  to the closer company.  I know I would enjoy this job much more.  But the other job  is just so handy being so close to home and having 4 full days off and every Saturday and sunday off. Somw weeks having 5 days together the way my 3 days start. But I'm thinking long term later on in my life what I'd like to do when I eventually do have to do full time work. Should I take the animal care job now and stick it out and just hope the hours will change sooner rather then later and do the animal care course also  , should I ask for change of hours if possible before I decide ? or should I just take the chemist one for an easier life at the moment have that experience on my cv also as it is a very good course with good career and money and do the animal care course on the side also. I am in my late 30s so I just want to make the right decision now and stop waisting time and do what's best for my further and being less stressed and happy in a Job. I know I'd be happier working with animals but the hours I chemist are just so much more accommodating for me .

So, although the EUR appreciated by 45%, I e-mailed the HR if there will be a salary increase this month (I'll start the job in the next month). Because we all know that the real inflation is more than 40% and some other consulting companies made salary increases by 10% in USD.

Well, the problem is, the company answered me with huge anger. One of the managers said ""it's a shame that you sent an email like this!!"" but I really don't think this was a ""shameful"" thing. I'm looking for a house around the office and I wanted to know if there'll be a raise or not to manage my budget, so I just asked, not requested a salary increase.

I am in a quandary whether to join the university next year or pursue these passions. I worry that failure could leave me with naught if I decide to drop out, making matters worse.

I've been struggling for awhile to get a job related to my degree and I haven't been successful. I really hated retail and I wanted to do everything I can to avoid having to do it but it seems like retail jobs are the only jobs I can get right now. I made a post on a different account recently on a college subreddit. And I got tons and tons of hate on it. Not trying to excuse what I've said but I made the statement that ""I didn't even major on something people consider worthless like liberal arts degrees"" and got the shit kicked outta me. I live in an area thats very STEM heavy and jobs outside of those don't do very well. In the post I made I got a ton of hate and told I was ignorant because business degrees are just as worthless if not more than liberal arts degrees. I had taken 7 years to finish my degree and most people derided me for being an idiot and said I shouldn't be dunking on liberal arts if it took me 7 years to finish my degree. I was super indecisive about my major and it took me a lot of changes in those 7 years in order to settle on my major. And with the recent posts I made and all the hate I got from it has made me feel even worse about my life.

I'm blazingly well in my current job that I got handed over more work to do because I finish my tasks early. Unfortunately, the additional work are not related to my niche. I'm also not paid more. I'd like to have more growth and at the same time I feel like I deserve a better pay with my performance. I feel like a second class software engineer in my role. My manager does not let me join planning and meetings of engineers that interface with stakeholders. I understand that stakeholder visibility increases chances of promotion. I've expressed my concern to my manager but they say I should just be in my lane because I'm not gonna benefit from those sprint plannings. It frustrates me knowing I can offer more but I'm just stuck in where I am doing the same thing. During the 1:1s, I felt gaslighted when I raised my concerns. It didn't feel right. I felt invalidated and he made me feel like I was wrong to feel that way. I was raising concerns on high turnover rate in our department(other teams' engineers are resigning) and was told to get over it and focus on my tasks instead. 

I've asked advice from friends in the same field and they told me to upskill myself, get cloud certifications,   and secure a better offer from another company. That way I'd have leverage to make them give what I'm asking for; better growth and better pay. 

My teammate who happened to feel the same way as I do, stood up for himself and went straight to the skip manager to ask for what he needs(growth and better pay).

15fyd30,Switch Departments or No?,"Hi all,

I'm in serious need of advice regarding my career at present.

So I recently came across an opportunity to interview for a different position in the organization that I already work in, in a different department.  However, this other position is Part-Time, so I inquired if I could do my current Full-Time position PT to do both, and was told that I could.

Here's the deal.  I quite like my current job, and I really love my supervisors and coworkers.  I just recently got a promotion and my supervisor said if HR lets her open another higher position in our Department, then it's mine.  

But, I really want to buy a house, and to do that, I need more money.  So this position that opened in the other Department would be more money and would utilize my degree more on top of it.  I actually job shadowed for this position a few months ago, so know I get along with the employees in the other department, as well.

So here is the issue.  Cutting back my hours in my current department will leave my current supervisors in a tough spot, and also they have some bigger projects planned that they said they won't be able to have me on if I'm only working with them Part-Time.  It also sounds like it will be tough to do both jobs Part-Time as both require a lot of focus in completely different areas.

I'm scheduled to do a second interview now with the other department, and I'm struggling to decide if I should continue with the hiring process or just bow out now and stay in my current position Full-Time.  I'm feeling terrible about the whole situation, but I don't know if that's my intuition telling me this is wrong or if I'm just afraid of change.",dancer15,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1690949337,2023-08-02 04:08:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15fyd30/switch_departments_or_no/,8,2023
15fxzcm,Need help deciding on which teaching job!!!,"I took over a year off working as a Special Rd Teacher Aid/Tutor to travel, and refocus on career. The lead teacher I worked with was not qualified, micro managed, there was little support. 

I started working as a middleschool ESL teacher for a summer program, and I’m glad to be back working with kids! I do enjoy aspects of having my own classroom.

I have two job offers : one at the previous school I worked at as an aid with kindergarten class . I have worked with the kindergarten teacher  before, we work really well together, it would be a relatively low stress yet fulfilling position.  It would not be a shit show like previous role, we would be removed from the chaos that is the upper grades. There is also a new principal… which could improve things from what they were but who knows lol. I love the community, I overall feel supported by the union and fellow teachers. The commute is only 10 minutes.

The other is at a different district in same community I currently work in for summer program. It would be as an ESL teacher, this district hire people without masters… they seem desperate for teachers. I would mostly be working with small groups. I would make 10k more a year this position. But the commute is 30-40 minutes, I have enjoyed working with the community but who knows what actual school year job would be like. I

I think I may prefer working as an aid, I like how there is more support and I don’t have to lesson plan. I’m not great with time management and enjoy not bringing work home with me. But I have enjoyed working as an ESL teacher. But I could see burn out happening if it were to be a full year position.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated ! Part of me would enjoy the autonomy that comes with lead teaching but I know it is exhausting. Also lesson planning.

I have Project Manager qualifications and was at some point thinking of getting full-time into that. (I am a people person, I don't particularly enjoy budgeting, but I have done that in most of my roles anyway).  
  
Due to life circumstances, I landed a job (not in IT field) that I love (I probably love it more than any other job I have ever had). I love the place where I work and could probably stay in it for many years to come. The pay is not bad either. I am fairly independent in my role as well.  
  
But... there is this nagging feeling that the job I am doing now is not really 'future proof'. I feel like I should strive to make myself more employable when/if I move cities/countries. I kept up to date in the IT/Digital Transformation and PM sphere throughout. Now, I have a chance to get a PM job in the same company. I haven't done the PM job since 2018.  
  
I feel like this is my chance (also, I am getting there in age and can't keep changing careers).  
  
Now, I worry that I won't love it as much as I love this job, but also I feel like this is the one chance I will have. I like the company, I know the people.. Is being a PM as 'future proof' as I think it is?  
  
The pay will be about the same to begin with but will get higher.

15fw77v,Desperately need some guidance..,"34yo, pretty solid working background. (No degree)

-Managed a team of 14-30 direct reports years ago. 

After that opened my own limo business, Covid killed it but still was able to generate some income in other ways. (Generating leads for other small limo companies) 

This lead me to sales, got a sales job for a cyber security company and I picked up everything fast just wasn’t producing. I was also mislead by them in a way of how successful they were and ready to expand. I found out all the success wasn’t even US based customers so I was legit at ground zero. They decided to hire more senior and experienced sales people, before I left my last week I still generated 5 meetings for them, 4 attended. I feel like they let me go a little too soon as I was just getting in the groove. 

After that got into logistics/freight agent. 
Was able to get a bunch of customers but I couldn’t compete at the lower rates the bigger companies were offering. I did fall in love with logistics in fright though. Was hoping to find a home in this industry that’s not an agent or broker position. 

Had an interview and had 3 great interview calls, with the director and my potential manager. We hit it off incredible and I can tell he felt the same and wanted to give me the green light. After a few days I followed up with him and was told the HR team would contact me. Couple days go by and I get the email from HR that they chose to go another directions…. Completely shocked since I clicked tremendously with everyone I spoke with. 

So that’s the back story, the guidance I need and want is I just don’t know what to do. I’m thinking my age and not having a degree is a negative for me with potential jobs. I’ve been really interested in getting my P&C and get into the insurance agent business. Other than that I don’t know where my career is headed, looking for a job is a crap shoot and it’s just a mess. 

Any suggestions on what career path I can take? Maybe get some certificates and hit that career path? I don’t care for remote or on-site just want a career I can make solid money to start and grow from there. 

Any help appreciated, would be willing to go over my resume with someone if that’s your thing to see if I did anything wrong there.

1. , is to worth it to go to school for computer science
2. Work life balance, I can take a week off of work and go to japan last minute if I want to as is and not suffer financially or if I want to go to a last minute concert I can take the next day off and work a Saturday

I should mention, I never received formal training. It was more “hey, watch me do this and take notes randomly and read our website”",RareProfessional617,1,1.0,1,1690942046,2023-08-02 02:07:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15fvvhj/negative_performance_review/,8,2023

15fvmqw,Regretting leaving college... Should I go back?,"Hey everyone, sorry in advance for the long read. I'm just going to describe my whole career trajectory up to this point and hope for good advice. 

&#x200B;

I was majoring in finance, but i never cared for it. I barely tried and learned nothing. In my fourth year I anticipated that I would be graduating, but my counselor told me it would be an extra year and basically killed off any motivation I had left. 

&#x200B;

I made the stupid decision to stop attending my classes or do any work. I failed everything. It dropped my gpa to a 1.8 or something. 

&#x200B;

The next semester I landed a job in tech sales, so I didn't register and took a semester off. It's been 6 months at my job now and things have been going alright, but the last few days I've been having a personal crisis. I'm starting to regret not taking advantage of college. I could've gotten involved on campus, had fun, met new people, but instead I barely paid attention and screwed up my chances of graduating on time. I don't even think I want to stay in sales. 

&#x200B;

All my life I've tried avoiding college, when I'm now 22 and should've had my bachelor's by now. I had a state given scholarship that paid for all my school (unique to Florida) but I've definitely lost it now. I'm not going to take out student loans. 

&#x200B;

I feel like I need to go back to college but I have no idea what to do now. I've left out a lot of detail but any advice would help. I'll try to fill the gaps by answering questions in the comments.

However, due to a quirk of our agency's pay structure, I am currently on the same pay scale as my boss. So if I were to take the position, I would not receive a pay raise. 

Also complicating the matter is that I currently work from home full time. In the new position, I would have to go into the office 3x per week. My current schedule us pretty relaxed, and I am generally pretty much left to do my work. It's really nice. 

Work-wise, I think the new position would be good for me and is generally the direction I want my career to go.

I (25 M) graduated college about 3 years ago with a non-technical degree (majored in Business Management). After graduating from college, I fell into the Corporate Recruitment/Talent Acquisition field and have been working in that industry ever since.

Fast forward to today and I am now looking to pivot/transition out of Recruitment. I now have my eyes set on a career path within IT. I am particularly interested in Service Desk/Support as not only an entry-level position to kick start my career, but also eventually going into Support Management. 

For someone in my position, what is the best way to break into the IT field and restarting my career? What certifications (such as CompTIA A+, AWS Solutions Architect) would I need to get before I start tailoring my resume and start applying to as many entry-level positions as possible?

15funwb,"Corporate Finance & Analytics- Copy, Paste, Then Delete Happiness","I recently made the jump from billing to corporate finance as an analyst. I have my Bachelor's but majored in business administration. On the plus side, the company I just started with seems open to taking my skills and offering more in-depth ""training"". However, that and other things should have been my sign that there might be issues.

I've been largely self-training, which I'm ok with and used to.... I like learning new things. But instead of doing a lot of analysis, I'm paid to basically copy, paste, and generate monthly and quarterly reports in excel. 

I get that this is probably the norm with finance. But couple this with the feeling of  being micromanaged (boss literally stands over me or is constantly stalking me if I work remotely)... And feeling unheard (hello? Tableau or Power BI anyone?) I just feel frustrated and bored to tears. I like improving things, making connections, researching and being listened to. I'm one of those people that can have a variety of interests. I also go crazy if I do the exact same thing over and over.

In college, the part I enjoyed about finance was researching various companies or investments. In my previous role it required a lot of research in operations, systems, communications, collections, etc. Overall, I just want to feel useful and hate being just a cog in the machine. 

Add to this that I'm the breadwinner but really could use more of a salary already since rent is ridiculous. Are all finance roles copy and paste work with no in-depth research? What other things should be on my radar? What type of roles migrate towards the 6-figure range?",indigo_shadows,2,1.0,7,1690938666,2023-08-02 01:11:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15funwb/corporate_finance_analytics_copy_paste_then/,8,2023
15fubzk,changing jobs within a company right before a promotion?,"In our large company, we have different ""levels"" (1,2,3, etc) for employees and when you get promoted, you go to the next level with a different pay range. I've been in my role (level 1) for 2 years and I delivered a few solid projects, with great performance review last year. I'm planning to ask my manager for a promotion soon to level 2.

But I've seen a couple of other job postings within the company that are already for level 2. And they are things that I actually want to do, whereas right now I'm not very happy with my current role and responsibilities. I reached out to the hiring manager and was told that they'd consider candidates at my level too, with the potential to be promoted to the next level. 

But I don't want to wait for another 1 or 2 years to get promoted in a next role, and I feel if I stayed at my current role, I can get promoted relatively quickly if I asked, since I already have a track record.

Should I wait till I get promoted to level 2 at my current role before applying elsewhere? Or ask the hiring manager if they can start me off at the next level given my current performance, since the role is for a level 2 anyway (it's to replace an experienced level 2 person leaving)?

Please advise. Again, aside from monetary compensation, I feel I'm not growing at my role and it's not something I feel would help my long term career.

15fu65z,Too negative or toxic positivity? How would you respond to this teams feedback?,"Background:
 I work at a small pr agency - 20 employees. Moral is LOW. Most people are looking for jobs and just feeling bad about work. I’m mid level - two peers, 9 above me, 8 below me. 

Our clients are what I’d consider abusive. They send requests with unreasonable deadlines, are unkind, scope creep, the works. We have to be scrappy to get things done but rarely ever say no. 

——

Me: 
I’ve historically been a golden retriever / “personality hire”. I’m head of the culture team that puts on company events, am on the team that does the company marketing and post very positively on LinkedIn. I recruit candidates etc. I work above my pay grade and have legitimately never ever complained. 

But I’m tired. I’m tired for myself, for my direct reports and my colleagues. I’m burnt out. When I share this with my boss or my boss’s boss, I get “I’d see this as a growing opportunity” or “yeah the client is just stressed” or sometimes just silence. Zero validation. Zero “yeah the 6am texts would be stressful for me too - can I help you set a boundary” or “I could see how the client constantly tearing apart your work is defeating” or “I can see how this internal person being mean to you would be frustrating” overall it’s really upsetting. 

—-
Lately: 
At the office last week, it was just a small group of us - all young women younger than me. They were having a hard time with work and with the male clients. As a woman older than them I was saying “yeah that’s crazy that he said that to you. I’d be upset too” and things like that. I also shared with them a funny story about how a client called our ceo to say she prefers zoom to teams and how sometimes clients are just wild. Apparently someone reported to my boss that I’m spreading negativity to junior staff and he gave me the feedback to vent up and stay out of the negatively. 

I was taken aback. I said I hear you but it’s hard for me because I didn’t feel like I was negative about work just validating and relating. I said I didn’t say I hate the company or our work. I didn’t say anything personally mean about the client.  He said yeah it’s hard but just opt to stay quiet when in doubt. I was pretty annoyed. 

If it were me and my direct report was typically positive and suddenly “negative”, I’d ask what changed and how I can help or support them. 

—-

Today, a client sent a very late request at 4pm for something due to her at 10am. She didn’t ask if we could she just said “I need you to xyz. I need it in my inbox by 11am”. She knew we were working all day on another deliverable for her due at 5pm. In the team group chat comprised of 4 of us total (as we were actively stressed talking about the 5pm deliverable) I sent a gif of someone passing out and said “me at the urgent email”. For context, we have a very fun, jokey office and team. We send gifs all the time. 

My boss (in the group) messaged me privately and said “gentle reminder to only vent frustrations up to me instead of in a group setting.” 

How should I respond? I’ll obviously be bringing this up in our weekly one on one and take the opportunity to let him know that I’m having a hard time and I don’t feel validated and so I don’t really have an outlet for my frustrations because I don’t get the validation or support. I need when I share it upwards. (I’ll say it nicer than this, I am in PR after all). 

 
but that’s not until Thursday and I don’t really want to leave this message unanswered. But I also don’t want to say sorry I’ll never do it again because I don’t feel like I was that wrong. I agree that negativity is toxic but I’m not a negative person. I think people deserve validation and when a client is being silly we need to be able to be like hey this is crazy right. Laugh. And then get to work. Especially in a remote setting.

15fsnff,How do you deal with a micromanager boss?,"My boss is great in many ways but can be an extreme micromanager. My boss tends to want to control all that I do, even down to extremely trivial tasks. She has an opinion about how I type emails, for example, and how I convene meetings and how I dress for my job. She basically doesn’t give me any autonomy and instead makes me always run her gameplan on all that we do. And I’m in a relatively mid-level position, so I have some experience and expertise that I rarely get to show. 

She recognizes this about herself to a degree but always defaults to this behavior. She basically makes comments about things I do (and others too) and puts the breaks on any initiatives that I do independently. 

I don’t want to leave this position for another year or so, but I find myself frustrated by it. I can live with the micromanagement when it improves my work and indicates things that could be improved.

15fsjzp,Which uni for master in international development,"I wanna start my master in international development and I'm having a hard time deciding on a program. 

My top three at the moment are

1. SOAS (ONLINE master in int. Dev) online studies would give me the opportunity to work/intern while studying. SOAS is renowned for development studies, but in overall rankings it's pretty low. My biggest fear is that potential employers will reject me, cause its online/ not a ""regular"" program? I can rarely find information about the quality of the online program. Some reviews say it's shitty and doesn't even include live/video lectures. (the in-person version is out of budget for me, london is expensive) 

2. Nottingham University Malaysia (in-person, Master in International development management) 
The biggest perk would be studying abroad, gaining int. experience. Nottingham is also usually under the top 100 unis, therefore highest in the rankings, but not particularly known for development studies. Its a short program and I would probably not have time for work/internships. 

3. Master in germany (my home country) 
Perks: extremely low costs. Also, it's 120 credits instead of 60. Work and internships would be possible, but most likely in germany. 
Disadvantages : no international exposure, the uni (bayreuth) is not prestigious, nor renowned internationally. 

I wanna go into policy research/advocacy. Particularly for development and security politics, with a focus on north africa/horn of africa and the middle east. Also thought about studying int. Relations.

I hope this message finds you well. Today, I come to you seeking advice and guidance on how to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of our careers, especially in the post-pandemic world. Like many of you, I have been facing uncertainties and anxiety about the future of my career, especially considering the challenges brought about by recent events.  
Allow me to share my background with you. I began my journey in the professional realm as a customer support specialist at a reputable tech company. Over time, I have been fortunate enough to climb the ranks, now functioning as a Business Operations Specialist. While I am grateful for this progress, I can't help but feel a nagging worry that perhaps luck played a significant role in getting me where I am today. I also don't feel like I make enough money and I feel stuck in my role.  
I acknowledge that I currently lack specific technical skills, such as programming or specialized expertise. My educational qualifications include an associate degree in General Studies from a community college, and though obtaining a bachelor's degree seems like a logical step, I must admit that it appears daunting and financially challenging at this moment.What I aspire to achieve are not just financial goals but also a sense of job security and the opportunity to explore diverse career options.

15fqteu,I feel stuck in my career and I don't know where to begin to look,"Dear fellow professionals,  
I hope this message finds you well. Today, I come to you seeking advice and guidance on how to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of our careers, especially in the post-pandemic world. Like many of you, I have been facing uncertainties and anxiety about the future of my career, especially considering the challenges brought about by recent events.  
Allow me to share my background with you. I began my journey in the professional realm as a customer support specialist at a reputable tech company. Over time, I have been fortunate enough to climb the ranks, now functioning as a Business Operations Specialist. While I am grateful for this progress, I can't help but feel a nagging worry that perhaps luck played a significant role in getting me where I am today. I also don't feel like I make enough money and I feel stuck in my role.   
I acknowledge that I currently lack specific technical skills, such as programming or specialized expertise. My educational qualifications include an associate degree in General Studies from a community college, and though obtaining a bachelor's degree seems like a logical step, I must admit that it appears daunting and financially challenging at this moment.  
What I aspire to achieve are not just financial goals but also a sense of job security and the opportunity to explore diverse career options. While my current position has provided stability, I am growing weary of the customer support domain and yearn to venture into new paths.

                                         Pros 

 I've done well at cross-training on different teams and making myself available to attend meetings, workshops, and conferences. I also show enthusiasm and bring new perspectives to help the team.

15fpkly,Internal Transfer - Petty Previous Supervisor,"I’ve worked at my current organization for 2 years. It was my first job out of college. At the end of May, I applied for an internal opening in a different department. At the time, my current position helped me discover what I wanted my career to look like going forward and it just wasn’t exactly lining up with that path. The position I was in was so niche to our industry that competitors don’t even have the position I was in. Our department did a little bit of everything so the skill set was was also going to be difficult to change industries in the future. 

I was offered the job at the beginning of June and immediately accepted. My supervisor at the time did not know about any of this prior to me telling her I’d accepted the position. So she was shocked, understandably so. But all of her actions and attitude after is what’s bothered me. She made it very personal and it was obvious. Our organization is pretty relaxed about department transfer timelines so my new supervisor agreed to 4 weeks. For those 4 weeks, it was just awkward. And when it wasn’t awkward, she would make passive aggressive comments about me leaving. She attempted to create a new position and offered it to me and said the pay “should” be the same as what my new position would be but that was up to HR. I declined. Once the job was posted internally, it was at the same pay level I was previously at. 

What’s bothering me now; my old coworker and I are friends outside of work. We worked great together. So we still talk all the time and she has asked me to explain some things that I used to do and I have with no problem. She told me my old supervisor is confused about some of my task and that if they couldn’t figure out, she would have to call me and she’s sure I wouldn’t want that. My old coworker of course defending me. 

It’s just starting to get aggravating cause I can’t even imagine what she’s told other employees about me. It’s like she’s painting me as the bitter one in this situation and that is not the case. I’m just not sure if I should let her continue and ignore it or say something to someone or her.

15fpbcr,Is being asked to be your own manager reasonable?,"My company has had a lot of change recently. About 4 months ago, 2 of the 5 members of my small team were let go back-to-back. One of the two fired members of my team was the only other person working on my specific project, so by default I absorbed all of her tasks and work. 

We had a new manager and new leadership, so the firing wasn’t super surprising, and they quickly jumped right into trying to hire replacements for the two analysts. They had us sit in on (and actually I had to lead like 90% of) the group interviews for the new analysts. After like 10 different interviews, they were no closer to new actually having an offer accepted for any new analyst. Then the new manager quit without notice, like a month ago

I tend to work really well in a crisis, so for the first few weeks of this situation I just shrugged my shoulders and worked my butt off to take on the workload of two people. They kept promising me they were getting me help ASAP.

In the past month, senior leadership stepped in and managed to get 2 new employees hired, and they’ve just started. However, they haven’t replaced the manager who left. Senior leadership has been empathetic to it being a really heavy workload the past few months for me, and their response has been “tell us when you’re overwhelmed and where you need help”, but my problem is that anytime I bring up stuff that I need help with, it just gets turned around into a new task for me. These tasks are things that previously my manager would have handled and seem like a managers job:

-a task another manager had promised to get done for me to finish a project weeks ago. After weeks of telling me he was going to get it back to me soon, he turned around at the last second and said “oh actually I don’t have time, you’ll have to figure out how to do it yourself”. I asked senior manager about this and she sent me on a hunt to find who else might know how to do this task, and when no one did, wants me to set up time with this guy who bailed to train me on how to do it. This project is now weeks and weeks later than I promised it and there is no recourse for the guy who bailed and I either have to turn in my current work late, or push this off even later.
-senior manager wants us to start using a new project management platform (3rd platform in 2 years). She had given the task of setting this up to the former manager who quit. He never set it up. She wants us to each set it up for ourselves and put our entire work plan/load in by Thursday. Hours of pointless management work when I have time-sensitive deliverables due this week.
-I got put on a project I knew nothing about. When I asked senior leader if she could help/reassign/connect me to what needed to get done, she said she would talk to someone for me. Turns out they took me off the project, but my boss didn’t even tell me, and I was pointlessly attending meetings I contractually had no reason to be at.

Does it seem like I’m being asked to manage myself? Is it unreasonable?

For some background info:

I graduated in Dec 2022 with a BA in a social science. I have a research background, worked @ my school's best and pretty competitive research center, also helped doing research work for a professor. This was all mostly working with qualitative data.

I originally thought I wanted to go into project management or research work... but no one will hire me! It makes me super anxious because I feel like I had the best resume coming out of college—internships before the pandemic at doing marketing at a startup, then my research job on campus...! I speak another language too! My resume is also solid. 

I'm thinking maybe I need to learn SQL because I'm seeing that on a lot of data science data analysis jobs they prefer that.... I'm just worried that even with the added skill, i still won't get hired!!!! I don't understand why I'm not—any advice on that? 

Btw: i got an internship at a real estate brokerage  firm learning the ins-and- outs, and was wondering will SQL fit in with this opportunity? I was going to do an excel bootcamp also to help myself with functions

TLDR: I'm not getting hired even though i feel like I have good experiences (2 internships), I want to learn SQL but worried this isn't the right move. I got an opportunity to work at a real estate brokerage firm, will SQL help in that realm?

Whenever people I am close to ask about how I’m enjoying the job, I tell the truth “I am great at it. I don’t enjoy it at all. But I’m great at it.”. For once I would just like to enjoy my job. I get that there are downsides to every job. In fact, I already worked my dream job and it wasn’t always perfect. Did it for about 12 years and was planning on quitting but COVID did that for me. The job was VERY physical and while I was able to handle that in my younger years, it got more brutal on my body the closer I got the 30. Ever since I left that job behind, I’ve been clueless about what to do career wise. So jobs I have tried are actor(I was a performer at my dream job), barista, retail, grocery clerk, swim instructor, receptionist, and now preschool asst teacher. My high school diploma is the highest education I currently have and would love to go back to school. Growing up I was a child actor. I’ve always loved acting but as I got older, I became less cute and the work dried up. I’m a very friendly and welcoming person, I love kids and animals, I’m an efficient worker when given a task. These are my hirable qualities. My weaknesses are that I am short (under 5’), I can get overwhelmed easily, getting yelled at makes me cry in all honesty, I have a lot of health issues that have me in and out of doctor appointments and can’t do heavy lifting, I also have mental health issues such as depression OCD and HIGH anxiety, I’m on the spectrum and I struggle with hearing people and need them to repeat often, I’m also absolutely downright horrible with math.

Throughout University I contemplated switching from engineering multiple times, but every time I was told not to by counselors and as a 18 to 20 year old kid I just listened which has come to bite me in the ass. MY current degree is Business Analytics and Information Systems. I genuinely want nothing to do with business, so I am trying to leverage the degree for Data Analyst or Data Scientist positions, but the degree is simply not technical enough. I learned almost no coding and only had to do business calc 1. So, I thought that I would just do a masters in Business Analytics and Information Systems, but upon looking at the courses offered it is also not a very technical degree, mostly focuses on business. Also, this field is extremely competitive at the moment, most jobs are being taken by those with masters in C.S. I have a 4.0 and could not even get an interview for an internship this summer. At the end of my 3rd-year the University said that they are going to restructure the Business Analytics and Information Systems major because it does not meet the standards of the current workforce. I genuinely do not know what to do. I also can not go back to school for an entire new bachelors because I currently live with my parents and they want me out of the house by the time I graduate as they are already planning to move. The chance of getting a job with my current major is negligible and the chance of getting into a masters is negligible. Please, if you have any, any advice at all let me know, thank you.",ColorfulWay,2,1.0,1,1690919104,2023-08-01 19:45:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15fmnjt/4thyear_in_borderline_useless_major_i_dont_enjoy/,8,2023
15fmbap,New offer after accepting job,"I've been working at Company A for 6 years. The work has been good, I've gotten raises, and it is based on a city that I love.

 A few months ago, a friend at Company B recommended me for a  senior leadership position that would be a big career jump in title and pay. The catch is the job is across the country in a city I'm not super fond of. Also, when they made their official offer, they demoted the position, but the pay was still a big jump. 

I told my boss I had an offer and he started to work with HR for a counter offer. It was a drawn out process that took a long time. In the meantime Company B asked for an answer by the end of the week. 

With the pressure of a deadline, and without an offer in hand from Company A, I accepted Company B's offer. Not 2 days later, Company A has their counter offer, which beats Company B. 

Ultimately both are fortunate situations, but I'm conflicted: should I honor my signature and move across the country for Company B? Or should I burn the bridge with Company B and stay at Company A?",ta6991,2,1.0,1,1690918328,2023-08-01 19:32:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15fmbap/new_offer_after_accepting_job/,8,2023
15fm2s0,"Internship feedback made me feel worse, where to go from now?","Hi, so currently I am a 20 year old girl doing my internship at my country's (mexico) biggest national company at m&a (corp development), I've been here for two months.

 Before this job I was doing an internship at KPMG but I was fired because my boss was crazy, and made us work 12 hours a day and I couldn't because I had college to attend.
Thus, I started this internship with high hopes that I wouldn't be as exploited as my last job and would enjoy it.

Upfront I said that my major is econ, and didn't have much knowledge about finance, yet they were fine with it and was hired.
With all honesty, I was excited but it was hard because I hadn't used excel for ""hard""  finance or had any practical knowledge of it, yet I still worked really hard and tried my best to do what I was asked. Most of the time I received a ""good job"", so I was happy that I was finally doing a great job and although I was learning I enjoyed it. Also would like to add, that I am the only girl in a 12 men team, I am not shy, but in an environment surrounded by only men who seemed to be much older.than me and had.much more knowledge I couldn't help but feel intimidated and was quite shy and on most meeting I could only laugh as my participation, and that case literally always saying to me ""Why are your so serious?""


Fast forward to last week, one of my.managers asked to had a feedback session with my, I was pretty.confident because all I'd gotten were good jobs. 

Sadly, I was given a pretty tough feedback. 
First of all I was told that most.of the jibs I turned in were badly done and not up to par with what was expected of me, that shocked me so much because I had never received negative feedback on it, and it made.me thoroughly sad because I was confident con the hours I invested and yet.everyrhing turned out to be useless.

He also added that they felt I was lacking presence, given that I rarely.participated and had to stop being shy and talk more.

Finally they said that I lacked interest and inniciative when I dedicated so much time and asked around so much for help.

I know that some of the feedback is right, but it saddens me that I received it two months later and not at the time of my mistakes.
I feel extremely sad and humiliated because I really enjoy my job and want to do it good, but my anxiety is so much worse at meetings and I feel even more self conscious at participating and could.only just keep laughing at their jokes.


I know my teammates are really capable and nice to me and would support me if I asked for help. And I did ask for some additional support on finance resources and have been studying up on it. But I don't know where to go from this, I am kind of discouraged but I really want to do better in my next revision and not get fired lol.
Any advice? I really want to do better but I don't know how. Thank you in advance :)",strawberrymilkky,0,0.5,1,1690917797,2023-08-01 19:23:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15fm2s0/internship_feedback_made_me_feel_worse_where_to/,8,2023
15flm3z,PIP happened earlier… what’s my next move?,"WELP I had the dreaded PIP! And need some advice.

I (24M) have been working in R&D for about 2 years and I work from home. Instead of a performance review which are standard every 6 months in my position… I had a PIP discussion so OOF. 

The meeting had me and 2 other figured let’s just says “boss” (medical director) and “PM” Project manager. It’s also fair to note this is my first job out of college I double majored in biology and anthropology.

Meeting breakdown 

BOSS:
-Loves me, all my coworkers love me (their words not mine) outside of my packing performance im described as charasmatic, willing to learn, and generally liked by old and new employees alike. 

-my performance is not as consistent as expected for my experience level 

-boss is not convinced this company or working from home is ideal for me due to my personality (but says I have 2 months to prove them wrong)

- I am costing the company more than a higher performer in my position

PM 

Also loves me, damn near offered to write me a letter of recommendation.

-explain the inconstancies in my work (these were all fair criticisms it’s not like they blindsided me or made stuff up) 

—-basically certain months like feb-June and sept-Dec my work quality is a lot higher than around summer or the holidays (my birthday is in January as well)
—-my communication skills are better suited for an in-person work environment 

-says I’m a great worker and thinks I can improve but also thinks that this job isn’t the best fit. (I somewhat agree, I have no passion or motivation for my work. The only things I like about this job is the salary/benefits and the ability to work from home)

-just outright in front of the boss said they have contacts in related fields and wants to see me succeed regardless of what I decide to do

INTERESTINGLY…

They offered to let me spend my next 2 months basically trying new things and doing more “career advancement” work which is something I’d never have expected. They both agree I should work with people and have great leadership potential and maybe it’s just the wrong career for me.

I am applying to new jobs as we speak but I don’t like the uncertainty, I live in a large city and make around 60k with performance based bonuses included(I’ve been getting them quarterly since September last year) 

Should I try my best during the next 2 months or take advantage of the fact that my boss and coworkers are more than happy to help me find a new job that I might like.

Also are PIPs really a death sentence? It’s nice to have 2 months notice, I also have a friend in a similar field making about 80k bonuses included and he graduated college the same time as me so I’m hoping whatever happens I don’t take a paycheck.


TLDR: Boss and PM LOVE ME, but they don’t think I’m in the right career. They are more than willing to set me up in other careers. But I can’t afford to make less money, and this job felt secure until today.",Daveediswhatitis,1,1.0,11,1690916743,2023-08-01 19:05:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15flm3z/pip_happened_earlier_whats_my_next_move/,8,2023

15fku3m,Dentistry or Computer Science?,"Hello, 

I hope I can get some advice from some of you on what would be the best course of action in my case. 

I am somewhat unhappy with the degree I am currently doing(life science degree) for different reasons(I think I could find something with a better work conditions, more employability, and not many of the job options interest me. I am only interested in few job options. I don't know how long I would be in this field if I countinued my degree, because I dont see myself working in this field for a life time.)   
I am considering a degree in densitry or computer science. I am in the EU so no tuition and study finances are therefore not important in my case as they would be in e.g. the US. 

My interest in dentistry only really started last year, because I realised that the work-life balance would be great for me, I actually like going to the dentist, I have an interest in science and health, and I thought working in at a communal clinic or working as a part of another dentist's clinic would be a great job, helping those in poor socioeconomic circumstances or working with children . My ideal scenario would be that I could get to a point where I work part-time, a few days a week. I grew up being taught how important oral hygiene is(although no dentists in my family), so I think I would be happy to see patients and advising them in how to take care of their teeth. I am not really interested in opening my own clinic because business doesn't interest me(but who knows). 

I never considered dentistry before because it is so specific(you work with teeth and the mouth) and so I am scared that I would get bored of teeth, you need dexterity(I dont think I have it but I could probably get better), and I didnt like the idea that I would need to open a clinic(even though I know you dont HAVE to) as financing and business are not my type of stuff at all. Also, I didnt really like how 'mechanic'-ish it sounded. 

Dexterity, having to open a clinic, and the focus on teeth were the things that really put me off from dentistry, despite being told by acquantinces how good the work-life balance is, the work conditions(part-time) and the pay is. I was actually considering medicine much more, because it takes into account the whole body and I could choose a specialty where I can used my head instead of my hands. 

The focus on teeth and being sort of like a 'mechanic' are still things that to some degree are off-putting to me, but the #1 thing that actually puts me off is dental school. I know that dental school is tough because of the amount of mandatory clinical classes, labs, and also the classes where you have to 'make stuff'(excuse my ignorance - I dont know the full terms. What I mean is you make impressions of the patient's teeth and create a set of teeth for them, stuff like that, and fillings). I am not that big of a fan the 'creating/building' side of dentistry. Checking the overall oral health of the patient is more my thing I think. From what I understand though you can pick and choose what you want to do and refer what you wont to another dentist. 

CS I have been considering for much longer than dentistry. I initially wanted to do CS because I liked computers growing up as well as video games, even though I knew that CS wasnt how I imagined(you learn problem solving and maths/logic). I know that is know that is not what CS is like. 

I am definetly considering it because of the (apparent) job security and the pay, and because it would be interesting to be a part of tech while it grows during my lifetime.

Tech and AI are very interesting to me, and I always thought that I wanted to combine tech and health in my career somehow. If I studied CS, I wanted to use it to create health gadgets or use AI to create solutions to treat patients. 

I dreamt of working at Google, Microsoft, or any of the other tech giants. That's where I wanted to work if I studied CS, but I know that might not be very feasable, especially depending on my location. A few years ago I thought that I wouldnt study CS if I didnt get to work at those places. Now Im a bit more flexible in my thinking, and my opinion is that I should work somewhere that I think is in line with what I would want to work with (health, AI, search engines), which would be in something that is for the greater good of people. 

The good thing about CS in comparison to dentistry is how broad it is. You can work in so many industries. 

The downsides of CS for me is how technically-focused it is - what I mean by that is I make something that works, but it may be difficult for me to see the effect of my work especially if Im working on a server for example. I also think that I need to use some 'soft' skills(more emotional, people-focused) from time to time and not so much logic/rational thinking. Im not sure if something like UX/UI would be something that fulfills that role? 

Another downside is that I don't know which specific job I am going to get(just like my current problem), but I can try to work towards a specifc job, if I find something that entices me.

&#x200B;

From anyone who has studied either of these degrees(or both), what advice would you give me to make the best choice?",throwaway9218311,1,1.0,0,1690914997,2023-08-01 18:36:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15fku3m/dentistry_or_computer_science/,8,2023

15fk0ud,"Accepted a Job Offer, but Dream Company Wants an Interview - What to Do?","Hello everyone,
I find myself in a tough situation and could really use some advice from those who have experienced something similar. Two weeks ago, I accepted a job offer with a company that has been incredibly supportive throughout the entire process. They even helped me find a house near the workplace, and I genuinely appreciate their efforts and kindness.
The problem is, just yesterday, I received an unexpected email from my dream company, the one I've always wanted to work for, expressing interest in having an interview with me. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can't deny how thrilled I am about the possibility of landing my dream job.
I'm now facing a moral dilemma: Should I inform the dream company about accepting another job offer, or should I stay silent about it? I don't want to jeopardize the current offer because the company has been so helpful, and I genuinely believe it's a great opportunity. On the other hand, I don't want to miss out on the chance of working for my dream company either.

Has anyone been in a similar situation before? How did you handle it? Is it unprofessional or bad to refuse a job after already accepting it, or should I consider taking the risk to pursue the dream job?
I'm looking for some guidance and insights from others who may have navigated similar waters before.

15fjpo5,Should I leave my current job for a better learning opportunity but less pay?,"I'm a 22 year old fresh Structural Engineer that graduated 6 months ago, I took my internship in the same company I'm working with.

Overall the company is decent, there is times where there is excessive overtime because of very bad time management.

But I have 2 main problems, the first one is that no one really teaches me anything, I have to basically figure everything on my own, and as a fresh graduate Engineer, all my work gets checked before submittal, but I am never told what mistakes I made or what can be improved, how can I learn from my mistakes if I don't even know what mistakes I have made, with this comes my 2nd problem as well. The company is not run well at all, there is no order for anything everything is a mess and sometimes they skip some important checks just so they can submit in time.

The new job I found is better in every way except the salary ,  the senior engineer will check everything with you in detail and give you tips on how to learn from these mistakes, they teach all new engineers a lot about design codes and softwares, as well as giving out some ""research"" tasks that have you search for the information yourself so you can get used to finding information from building codes and stuff like that. The design process is much more detailed and advanced than the methods used in my current job , as my current job focuses much more on the drawing details rather than the design itself. My current job only works on concrete structures, while the new job works on concrete and steel structures, as well as using a more up to date softwares ,like Revit instead of AutoCAD 

Sorry if I gave some extra unnecessary information,but my current situation is that I got a pay raise today, where I was thinking of leaving for the other job, will it be disrespectful to quit after the pay raise? And is it worth it to go to the new job for a better job but less pay?( Let's say my current salary is 500 euros, new salary will probably be 400 euros)",MediocreReading2673,2,1.0,1,1690912491,2023-08-01 17:54:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15fjpo5/should_i_leave_my_current_job_for_a_better/,8,2023

I thought about starting the route of a CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) or Cyber Security Architect ""where both are the highest in salaries after some research"".  
  
During the research, I watched some videos about a day in the life of a Cyber Security, and I found out that they literally have no time for anything but their job, and the free time is about 3\~4 hours and is spent on family and other stuff. And no time for market research to start a side business.

15fim28,My sister said I shouldn’t use this job title… is she right?,"I am currently working a contract role in commercial insurance that I have seen be called several different titles: data entry 2, data entry operator, data operator, data entry analyst, and my recruiter said data analyst. I am confused as to what to put on my LinkedIn/resume and need some advice. Data analyst is probably the most high paying title of them all, and the type of role I guess I would transition into, but I’m not quite sure if that is exactly compatible with my role. My recruiter advised me to use data analyst, but my manager said my title is (probably) data entry analyst. My manager not my recruiter we’re 100%. Does the job title really impact that much? I have all the skills and experience written down in the description, so they can see if my skills match up. Am I thinking into this too far or is it bad/wrong for me to use data analyst as a title? It’s kind of clickbait, because a lot of industries are hiring for data analysts, I just want to ensure I have the best opportunities possible. Can any advice be provided?

My sister has always hated me and her immediate response to my conviction on the issue/title was that I shouldn’t advertise that because I might get into the role and them see that I don’t have the skills. Don’t you think the hiring manager would look at my resume and skills and especially ASK me in the interview to find out if I’m a full fit?

She basically lives her life through her career, and holds onto it like a baby with a blankie.. I think she hides her alcohol abuse as well.

15fi2pl,"Where should I go from here (SE, SW, ST, PM)?","I (33m, Southern Maryland. Near DC, but not close enough to easily commute) was a software tester for 6-7 years (beginning in Sept 2014) on a Navy contract. Within the company, I shifted to be a Mission Systems Engineer in October. Since beginning this position, I realized that I don't have much work to do and I'm not as committed to my company as I thought. Benefits are pretty good in my opinion. 

My first degree was an Associates in culinary management (2010), then a BA in Computer Science (I can read and review object oriented code well, but I have a hard time writing elaborate code) in 2014. I've since gotten my MBA and an MS in Information Technology/Systems Engineering (it was focused on Systems, but I think it was considered IT because it wasn't explicitly an Engineering program) (2019-ish). I just got a graduate certificate in Project Management and a PMP certification. 

I had been working and studying for the PMP for a while, but I've come to realize that I enjoy more hands on work, rather than discussion about contracts or financing. In fact, I find that I have a really hard time understanding financing from a numbers perspective (I understand the concepts, but the numbers make me uncomfortable for some reason).

 I currently make $119k/year. I would like to stay in Systems Engineering. I currently work (at a high level) with Navy and Air Force planes and previously worked with premission planning for the F-18. 

I really enjoyed software testing, but I felt like I was hitting a ceiling, in both my job and my salary, which is why I made a change. I enjoy low level requirements, but hate trying to determine the value of requirements. I have ADHD and suspected ASD. 

My main motivators are money, stability, a flexible schedule, an easy commute (i.e. I am willing to drive, but I cannot stand even a little bit of traffic), etc. I find I am more productive when I have an in person job, but am willing to consider remote. I don't mind traveling a little bit (I even enjoy it), but I want to be home on the weekends. I would really like it if I had an environment that would let me workout and shower in the middle of the day, but that's gold plating. I would prefer to not have to move or to move to either the Ann Arbor Michigan, or Toledo/Cleveland, Ohio areas.

I would like to try something new or join a more interesting team.

I am so hungry for knowledge with money and at the same time LPN is where I am comfortable because I have been to school for RN before but since that year was particularly COVID, it really slammed me down and I ended up dropping out. 

Now, I am so confused and stressed out.. I'm bout to start school on September and I don't wanna make another mistake again because that is time and money right there.

15fhmfi,To be [a lawyer] or not to be [a lawyer]?,"A  year ago I landed a Senior Data Analyst role at a fortune 500 company  after graduating. A serious data career is not what I had planned as my  next step, but the $85,000 offer and senior title was compelling as a  broke entry level paying back student loans. While in school I worked  part-time as a paralegal at a small solo firm and planned on going to  law school right after graduating. I am trying to do a cost benefit  analysis of the option I have in the next few years.

To provide some context, this is my work situation.

* Work from home, go into the office once a month.
* Work 7am to 3pm.
* Depending on the week, I have a few hours of down time during work to theoretically study.

Let's  make the assumptions that 1.) I sincerely want to be a lawyer, 2.) I  cannot rely on my fiance or family for financial support, and 3.) I  cannot work part-time at my current job.

As I see it, these are my options.

* Quit my career and become a full-time law student surviving on student loans. Finish in 3 years.
* Keep my career and do law school in the normal cadence. Finish in 3 years.
* Keep my career and do law school part-time. Finish in 4-5 years.
* Focus on my career in data and advancing at my company, abandon law school dreams.

The new team I'm on is exploring ways to use ai to replace much of what I've been doing. It will generate templates and the structure, then our strategists will go in and make tweaks before sending to the client. 

They are trying really hard to find a place for me, but I know a layoff is coming. Everything I do can be done much cheaper and faster by ai, and the personalization and level of expertise I can add is no longer valuable.

As a manager, my goal is to support my team to do their job autonomously and to a high standard.  
  
Whenever I review the performance of my team members, I'm always thinking ""can they think and work independently?"".  
  
This is a really important pre-requisite skill to progress into management.  
  
Most team members go through the same journey, which is:  
  
1. Tell me what to do...  
2. I think that...  
3. I recommend that...  
4. I am about to...  
5. I just did...  
6. I've been doing...  
  
As a team member, it's fine to start by asking what to do but you should set a personal goal to move up to levels 5 and 6 as fast as possible.  
  
There are two main attributes that you need in order to get there:  
  
\- **Competence:** You need to understand your role, organization, and function.  
\- **Confidence:** You need to be self-assured enough to make recommendations and decisions.

15fg6sj,What should be next steps for an early professional aiming for fullstack developer role in current AI scenario?,"My current designation is Associate Engineer, not Fullstack developer. That is my goal

Hi, I'm an early professional with 1 year of experience in Java and Spring Boot. Although not deeply, but I have worked Angular, Flutter, Python, React.js and all those things along with some intermediate SQL and MongoDB. I did all this because I wanted to become a full stack engineer. I also did a fair bit of work in machine learning.

My current company is service based and I feel like I'm drifting away from my goal. All this AI will take all jobs stuff has me question my end goals. I was learning all these frameworks and exploring things to find what would excite me as a full stack down the line (that's why my skills may seem all over the place)

Now ChatGPT strikes and I find myself going back into AI and Python. I even started associate cloud engineering course from Google, which is really boring TBH.

The thing is, during this whole AI overlord phase, I lost all my momentum and focus. I want to get back to it, so I started with what I know and currently training myself on Microservices. But whenever I am watching any video on YT, AI topic pops up and I think to myself, ""maybe I should pick up AI/ML again, don't wanna be left out and regret it later"".

Apologies if the post is too long. I'm just confused what to do now.

I had a quarterly ""coaching session""  recently -- which fell on my one year anniversary -- I've got nothing but praise for doing my job well and being an overall pleasant colleague. My boss wasn't present at this session so I emailed her after to talk -- she ignored my request and at the end of the day I went over to her and asked to speak about my salary. (I make 17/hr) I brought up the fact that I have worked there for a year and would like a pay bump. She couldn't look me in the eye and was clearly hostile. I was direct and polite but the answer was that ""annual raises happen in ""August or October or something""   
I said she needs to find out when I can expect this raise and she didn't seem to recieve this well. This boss is toxic and passive aggressive -- I even went over this script with my therapist and still was met with hostility. She couldn't look my in the eye or give me an answer.

I (28m) from India started my career as a support engineer (contractor) paid in pennies 9k INR pm in a MNC, became a SME after half a year. After a year asked my manager to make permanent, they couldn't so they moved me to a different project on the promise of making a direct employee of the company. Then covid struck, my managers were fired for their misbehavior, my hiring was paused. This was an hellish project wouldn't have time get of the system. Anger build up in me exploded after six months, during the peak hours I just said I wouldn't continue my work untill I am hired as direct employee. Then I was hired in couple of days and had a better salary (4LPA).
 Days passed learnt everything in the project, as seniors left I was made SME here, accepted it hoping it would be easier to my current role. I was totally wrong, all the people in the team started pinging me from shift start to end, I was given work by the higher ups, had to present performance of the team befor clients. I would work for 10hrs with no breaks. All work came to me because my managers didn't understand the product, absolutely no knowledge on it. I was baffled when my managers presented my ideas and views with the same words I used and no credits where given to me. These were the absolute worst I have seen or heard, not just not knowing the product, they have no management skills. People were denied leaves when family members were dead and asked to work as they had no backup planned. I became numb of this stuff and started learning data science after my after hellish 10hrs.
Took course after course was not able to crack interview, later landed a FS data science course. Mid way through the course I got an offer as a software engineer as I know to work with airflow.  I wanted leave this project so I made the switch without hesitation. After me  and my senior peers leaving the company, that project has gotten worse and would be ram downed in couple of months.

Now with 4yrs of experience in support background, I don't have the confidence to program though understand their code, I am rarely asked to work. 
Only given small tasks. Almost doing nothing. I am utilizing this time to learn and looking forward to make switch into data analysis or data science field.


My skills : python, aws, gcp, data viz, sql, nosql, ML, DL(learning), I would say intermediate level with all the skills

TLDR: support engineer hired as a software engineer after 4yrs doesn't have the confidence to code. Need advice to build confidence and switch into data analyst / data science field. 
Let me know what to focus and what to learn and how to gain experience in data analyst / data science field to add in my CV.",aboorahman,1,1.0,0,1690895301,2023-08-01 13:08:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15fc5ge/need_guidance_story_is_basically_a_rant/,8,2023

However, I did have unofficial mentors who I worked with during my internship and helped me with projects.

15fasg1,Trying to decide on degree,"So I qualify to get a free associates degree through my local community College. I'm 25, soon to be 26. I did 4 years of college, but some unfortunate stuff happened and I didn't end up with a degree (personal stuff that affected my schooling). 

I'm wondering what's worth it to get an associates degree in. My main goal is to increase my earning potential. I make 21/hour now so I want to leave school making more than that at my first job hopefully. 

I also would largely prefer jobs that have a lot of work from home opportunity. I have multiple medical issues that can make going into work difficult. Not just mental health issues, but I have a skin condition thing too that sucks so it would be really nice to be at home. 

With that said, I'm looking into Accounting and Programming. My college before was for math and I'm good at calculus and stats. I'm just not sure about how easy it is to get a job in either of those or what the future of the job market is looking like especially with AI. I have experience with taking a couple classes in both of those already and liked them each alright.

I am a Communication/PR major working in the field of Customer Service and have recently been interviewing for a position in Marketing in the same city. Now I’ve been working at this job for a year now and I can honestly say I don’t see myself do this for the next 40 years in part because I don’t like the job and also because of the work environment (there is a lady here that takes pleasure in lightly bullying me daily with snide remarks). The good part is that I have a salary and a Plan B, + I have been interviewing and have almost landed a job in marketing which is closer to what I have studied. The downside of the marketing job is that they require a lot of travelling which I am not willing to do due to the fact that I see no interest in travelling for work, it seems like a burden tbh, and also I have done so far 10 interviews with them yet they still didn’t present an offer so I have no idea about type of contract/salary.
Now my ideal plan is to switch to teaching in a few years, which would allow me to do something less time consuming and more fun, but I have to get qualifications that require money. In the meantime, i don’t know if I should keep this job or go for the marketing job. What do you all think?

15f7r0l,Thinking about quitting Job 1 due to pay cut,"
I'm a product designer in South Africa. I work as a junior in company A and a junior in company B. Both remote and these are my first ever ux jobs.

Company B salary is very low but it's very chill and only required to work 4hrs. Sometimes I work even less.

Company A is almost double of company B but the work is hectic, there is literally no organization and our workflow is incredibly slow. The senior designer here even resigned 1 month before I started.  I began working there as contractor but in 2 months they offered me a role as a junior designer and pushed me to their new agency they just founded.

Now, 4 months later company A tell me I'm getting a 50% cut in salary due to how bad economy is and they dont want to lay anyone off. The salary will now be slightly higher than company B, but no reduction in work time.

I want to quit company A to have time to work on my portfolio and resume job search but the issue is, at company A I have no work to show. The work I did, I was shoved away. Never even made it to development.

Now I have another project I'm working on with company A. It's likely not to get shoved since it came directly from our boss, completing it, see it get launched and looking at the results will mean I have something to show in my portfolio but it also means I have to stick by the company for a longer time.",Sandy_hook_lemy,1,1.0,3,1690883081,2023-08-01 09:44:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15f7r0l/thinking_about_quitting_job_1_due_to_pay_cut/,8,2023

i don’t care about living lavishly. i just want to have an apartment (roommates are fine) and be able to pay for what i have to, and whatever else to live comfortably. basically i don’t want to barely scrape by my entire life, yaknow. also if this helps i live in southern california which i know is expensive, but farthest i would be willing to go is like somewhere pacific northwest. i don’t want to be forced to move to like wyoming or something. i know inflation keeps getting crazier and it probably sounds stupid for me to want to stay in the “more expensive” parts of the US, but i got family i wanna see yaknow.

15f448s,How to Handle a Challenging Manager in my Career?,"Hey Reddit community! I'm currently facing a difficult situation in my career, and I'd love to get your insights and advice on how to navigate it effectively. Here's a summary of my background and the issue I'm encountering:  
Background:  
I have 12 years of experience in my role, having worked with big companies like Amazon and Zendesk before joining my current company in Europe.  
Prior to joining this company, I held a senior position as the head of products, overseeing eight product managers. However, due to burnout, I decided to step back and work as an individual contributor.  
I've been with my current company for 1.5 years and have been successfully handling projects with autonomy and delivering results.  
Current Situation:  
Over the past 1.5 years, I've reported to four different managers, with my most recent manager being the director of marketing, who reports to the product organization.  
My current manager has a problematic leadership style. She's obsessed with asserting her authority, always claiming to know everything and being the smartest person in the room. She tends to jump into situations without fully understanding them and relies heavily on politics to handle various teams and stakeholders.  
The manager is not fulfilling her promises. After a recent evaluation, I received a 3% raise, which I objected to, believing I deserved more. I requested a reassessment and asked for a clear plan to improve and become a top performer. However, she hasn't taken any concrete actions to provide such a plan.  
Our professional relationship is based on artificial trust. I have to manage her ego by making her feel smart and letting her review my work, even though her input is often not significant.  
Seeking Advice:  
I'm feeling stuck in this situation, and I'm not sure how to move forward. I'd greatly appreciate any advice on how to deal with my manager and explore potential options to improve my career trajectory. Here are some questions I have:  
How can I effectively communicate my concerns about the lack of concrete feedback and growth opportunities from my manager? I want to have an open dialogue about my career development without causing conflict.  
Should I consider exploring other opportunities within the company, such as moving to another team? What are the pros and cons of such a move?  
If staying in the current company is not viable, what are the potential benefits and risks of looking for another job externally?  
Is there any way to handle the ego-driven behavior of my manager without compromising my own principles and well-being? I want to maintain my professionalism while addressing the issue.  
Thank you all for taking the time to read about my situation. Your advice and experiences are highly valued, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts on how I can navigate this challenging phase in my career.",ak_223b,1,1.0,0,1690870755,2023-08-01 06:19:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15f448s/how_to_handle_a_challenging_manager_in_my_career/,8,2023

2. Move laterally to a technical role today and then get promoted to a senior technical role (3-4 years)

Both end up in the same position (senior technical role) but approach 1 is faster to get there. Approach 2 will take longer but the immediate lateral move is more money today, and will continue to be more money for the next ~12 months till the senior role would catch up to the technical role.

15f1417,A manager has threatened to fire me.,So basically I work in a warehouse on night shifts and the past week or so I haven’t been hitting performance due to have a root canal  and dealing with a lot at home. My mum is suffering with cancer and I have a younger brother with special needs. As it’s the summer I’m running my brother around all day to keep him entertained as well as helping my mother. By the time I get to work I’m tired and barely eaten. Tonight a manger followed me to the toilet then waited for me outside to pull me straight into a meeting. Saying I’m shit and that he’s going to do everything in his power to get rid of me. I then went to explain why I’m not performing as I was struggling at home. For him to say I don’t care. He then told me to get back to work without hearing my reasoning behind what’s happening. Am I wrong to think that he can’t speak to me that way? And that he has a obligation to hear the reason as it’s to do with my health?,Exact-Professional18,14,0.7900000214576721,17,1690861098,2023-08-01 03:38:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15f1417/a_manager_has_threatened_to_fire_me/,8,2023

15f097m,Should I quit or should I stay a little longer?,"I gratuated on finances more than a year ago now, and by some miracle managed to land a position as a Financial Analyst... except, it was a data entry position in disguise to get job seekers attention. And it worked. Every month they get around 6-7 new people to cover up for the other 6-7 people that left a month later after realizing this was not what they had originally thought.

I've been here for almost six months now, haven't learn any useful skill, the salary its a joke, micromanaged, stressing, no growth inside the company, but at least co-workers are nice, and the schedule is 8hr in comparison to the 10 -12 hrs in other places (which in my country it's the standard). Oh! and they offer a WFH month for those who have a good performance. (which I haven't gotten yet and doubt I'll take cuz the program we use is not supported in my laptop)

Now, obviously I'm not staying there for the rest of my days, in fact, I was thinking on quitting since day 1, but given that I have no experience in my field and that I want to get into Data Analysis in the future, I thought I could use this position as a trampoline for that, except that I despise this job and I'm not getting any skills for that future to happen.

I don't have enough time to study so I can at least build a portfoil. I live in the countryside and make around 5 hours total in commute. I have no energy afterwards + no opportunity to move cuz everything its too expensive.

And I know someone would say to look for another job while still employed but in this place, it's hard to sneak away to an interview cuz... micromanagment, but also because if they find out, they terminate you in two weeks cuz for them its pretty normal to see people go, they already have your replacement in line anyway.

So yeah, awful place, but here is the question: Is it worth it to stay here a little longer just so I can get a better job in the future? Or is it a waste of time cuz I'm not even learning anything?

I have no financial problems now cuz I still live with my parents, but really wanna know if it would be a good move to leave so I can get a job that allows me to study  and research or should I wait at least until I make a year so I have better chances despite not having the skills?",dennycraf,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1690858608,2023-08-01 02:56:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15f097m/should_i_quit_or_should_i_stay_a_little_longer/,8,2023
15ezeip,Should I quit my career path due to mental health?,"First, thank you for taking the time to read and help me with my situation. 

I (27F) work a corporate office job, at a very large Fortune 500 company for a little over a year in a mid level associate position with tons of pressure. I have always been the one to stress over work, deadlines, and metrics. 

Lately, my numbers have begun to drop due to things out of my control (extremely strict employer and how they judge us).

I have always been the type of study for 12 hours, overwork myself, and be at the top, but right now it’s disheartening to say I can’t raise my numbers no matter how hard I try.

My numbers are seriously starting to affect my mental health. I used to self harm from 14-25 (I’ve had 30+ stitches in my arms and legs) depression and anxiety and had that under control for 2 years leading up to this job from 25-27.  Sad to say that my anxiety and depression are starting to spiral and I’m not sure how to stop it. I decided today to just say fuck it and take 6 days off. 

Should I quit my job? I’m scared, i’ve only been at this for a little over a year and this *is* the career path that I want and the pay is decent but at the same time my mental health is starting to crumble from all the gains I made from 25-27 in therapy.",URSA_VA,3,0.6399999856948853,3,1690856144,2023-08-01 02:15:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15ezeip/should_i_quit_my_career_path_due_to_mental_health/,8,2023

15ez161,Any advice on how to navigate potential promotion?,"I started my job at the end of 2021 and was told that I would get a promotion by the end of 2022 if I kept up the good work. At the end of the  year I received an 11% raise but no change in role (reasoning: restructuring). Was told I would have it at the end of Q1 and to think of the raise as the raise I’d get with the promotion but the promotion title would just come later . So essentially, I’m just getting paid earlier. I also was told they “fought and negotiated for this raise since I couldn’t have the promotion” Well Q1 turned into end of Q2 and Q2 turned into mid year review. Currently we’re in mid year reviews and I honestly don’t think I’ll get the title change but it also has me thinking about things. I don’t think I want the “promotion” if there’s no additional raise. 

Reasoning: I genuinely believe I was being underpaid before and the raise was to balance it out. No one else on my team received a raise and they haven’t gotten one within the time they’ve worked here. Not to say I don’t deserve a raise but I think it’s kinda odd. Also there was no paperwork saying that this raise WAS for my future promotion so it technically wasn’t promised. I’m still doing more work than I was before the raise so I think it’s fair.

Any recommendations on how to navigate this? The promotion would include more work + responsibility so I feel like it should come with additional dollars. Should I attempt to negotiate this if offered? Or just simply decline the opportunity if they don’t mention more money?

 Not sure if it helps but I know if the role is not offered at all, I’ll be rn route to look for another job by the end of the year. I already feel undervalued and that there’s no room for growth so if it’s not offered at all, I know where I stand.",notlaurynhill,1,1.0,1,1690855128,2023-08-01 01:58:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15ez161/any_advice_on_how_to_navigate_potential_promotion/,8,2023
15eypzx,Seeking advice for salary negotiation!,"I’m a new grad who has been applying for my first full-time job. On Friday I received a job offer by email and was told I have to accept or decline the offer by Tuesday (tomorrow). The offer was decent but definitely not competitive. Over the weekend, I sent an email to HR with a counteroffer. I followed up on that email today and still have not received a response. I am debating calling the HR department on the phone if I still do not receive a response by tomorrow at around midday. But I am worried that I will come across negatively or make a bad impression. Does anyone have advice or thoughts on what I should do? Should I just take the lack of response as a “no” and accept the offer?

15eyo9o,6years experience in business and growing to loathe the business world… where to go from here?,"Studied finance and accounting at uni, got my CPA out of school, and have now worked 6 years in the business world (3yrs in big4 accounting, 3 years in operations at a small company).

I’ve just grown to loathe the day to day. I don’t get any satisfaction out of anything I do. I’m currently looking for my next job and just can’t get excited about anything. Accounting, audit, fp&a, finance analyst, etc. 

I have no idea what to do. In undergrad I switched from pre med to business and feel like I made the wrong choice. I’m not a ‘businessman.’ I’m a laid back guy and am the guy that everyone gets along with, not the boss who is solely focused on metrics and production. I wish I could go back because medicine sounds a whole lot more fulfilling than working at some manufacturing company. I just can’t get myself to care and can’t understand how people get so passionate about it.

15ewref,Leave a job for better money but less work/life balance? Or accept new title at current job?,"Hey y’all! I’m a 24F and I was just offered a title change and pay increase at my current job. I’ve been working at this organization for 3 1/2 years and 2 in my current role. My current pay is 55k but with the new senior title, it is looking to be around 60k. It is essentially the same work but with more oversight. 

The problem is, I am in the final round of interviews with another job that I’m pretty sure I’m going to land. This job will pay anywhere from 65k-70k. The title does not include “senior” in it but the work seems to be a lot more than my current role. I would be expected to do work at night and on the weekends from time to time. 

My current job already let me know there is no room to negotiate for a higher salary right now, but will come with an increase at the end of the year.
