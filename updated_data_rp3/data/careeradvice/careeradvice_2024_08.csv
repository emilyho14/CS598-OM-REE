1f613g7,Am I required to be socially interactive with my coworkers?,"At the start I wanted to be part of the clique, but they excluded me, gossipped and there's drama.

I don't want to. Colleagues got pretty mad at me for skipping the social event in my free time.

1f5zpbu,Is it good signs ?? (help me) ,"I got interviewed for a job in a fast food yesterday !
Well it wasn‚Äôt really an interview. 
just to clarify, It‚Äôs my first job. No previous experience. 
The manager was so nice, she literally explained to me what I would do , talked about the uniforms, the shift I would like to do , talked about customer service. She asked me when I could start, so I said Monday. She asked for my phone number and my email. And then she said ‚Äúwe will call you back‚Äù.
i mean, does it mean it‚Äôs a good sign that i would get the job ?

1f5zceu,writing or production degree?,"I know these kinda questions are probably asked a lot. For a quick summary I‚Äôm an ‚Äòaspiring singersongwriter‚Äô type who‚Äôs in community college right now, for a writing degree. The college I‚Äôm at does offer a music degree, but as much as I love the idea of taking all music classes I don‚Äôt personally want an official music degree and would rather have a degree in something else for my resume and more diverse skills. Hence the writing degree, i‚Äôve always loved the idea of travel writing/journalism. I‚Äôm also aware that isn‚Äôt the easiest field today to get work but it blends with my creative interests and passions. Now that I‚Äôve started college, I‚Äôm taking an elective audio production course and I‚Äôm really interested in the telecommunications department with film and audio. It also crosses over with music equipment and recording more depending what concentration you do.

So obviously I know the final choice is up to me, but I wanted some outside advice. Assuming I don‚Äôt become a one in a million music star and will need to work non musician jobs in my future, what field is ‚Äòbetter‚Äô? Easier to get in? Will more employers respect a writing degree or a media/film/audio production degree? what‚Äôs the best investment in your opinion. I honestly love the idea of writing journalism and film journalism/documentary work equally.

1f5yhyz,Should I stay or go?,"Long story short:

I‚Äôll be 25 in two months, and have worked in banking for almost 2 years. I now have the chance to relocate to North Jersey/NYC with roommates (the area I want to spend the rest if my life in)

I am bored, living at home, dating life sucks, and home life is somewhat toxic, sadly. HOWEVER, my boss at the bank that I am at has become a mentor, and is the coolest fucking boss you could ask for. Not only has he propelled my career already, but he‚Äôll continue to do so IF I stay working at his location. 

I feel extremely lucky, and feel like the risk of giving this up could mess up my career growth, especially if I relocate near NYC, and have a boss that sucks.

I have an interview in NY/NJ area on Wed. Not sure what to do. 

A mentor is very hard to find. My current boss makes my life at work very easy, and I feel like giving that up could be a huge mistake.

1f5ycz1,"I got fired from my first job, will this affect my next one?","I got fired from my first ever job, I had it for almost two years now, and it's completely my fault I'm just surprised. Will this affect my next job? This is the main question, I'm going to blab about the reasoning now.


I made a reddit account for this sole reason, to hear from other people. The reason I was fired was because I called off too much. I understand it, but I'm still sad. I was beginning to search for a new job and had previously told them I plan on leaving a few months prior. Maybe it's because I have no work ethic or it's the ""gen-z mindset"" or however you wanna call it, but I typically missed once a month, (98% of it was for legitimate reasons) I didn't think it was bad because the job offers zero benefits and also didn't pay anything, Ive been wanting to quit for months because of it, but because I felt bad I couldn't. I started out at 7.50 (25¬¢ above minimum wage). Which I didn't realize before I started (a friend recommended me) and I didn't think to ask during the interview, because again it was my first ever job as a fresh 17 year old, and I felt guilty asking. They don't pay a lot in general and most of the workers are also underage (excluding the waitresses). I mean, I have a new job lined up and planned on giving my two weeks in another week, but it still sucks because I have yet to know if I have the new job 100%. I know calling off once a month sounds crazy to most people, but if you have nothing to offer benefit wise, you should at least pay good to keep workers interested. Idk am I wrong for thinking like that?? üò≠üò≠. With my next job I'll try to limit it to like maybe once every three months or so...I just get sick easily and I refuse to work if I'm not feeling well. (Who wants to work with a miserable sick person anyway üò≠) But idk, am I wrong? Do I just  need to suck it up and deal with it? I mean, I already got fired so there's no point in being upset, but it still stings. My boss sounded really angry with me when he told me the news. I told all my other coworkers and friends after I left and they think it's stupid that I was. But I also get it from a management standpoint, like you can't just be missing work, but also nothing about the establishment makes me want to work there besides the friendly staff.


Basically, do you think this will affect me landing my new job? I'm meeting with a career counselor already, and before I got fired she said the new place seems to really like me and are interested in hiring me. Sorry it's kind of a long post, thanks for reading ü´∂üèª I hope my post fits the category, I've never had reddit before so idk how this works üíÄ",Xo_Via_Bella_oX,0,0.5,25,1725140575,2024-08-31 21:42:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f5ycz1/i_got_fired_from_my_first_job_will_this_affect_my/,8,2024

1f5wfnk,I don't think my boss's boss likes me.  Should I look for a new job?,"I thought me and my boss's boss (bob) were okay.  Recently he said something rude about me in a department-wide meeting.  It weighed on me for a weekend before I decided to bring it to my boss.  I delivered it in a ""feedback sandwich"" kind of a way:

""Hey, you know what I loved that the old manager used to do? skip-level meetings.  I think it'd be really great for our team.  Bob has a lot of experience.  I think it'd be important for us to get to know each-other better""

\*also he is supposed to be doing skip-levels - most people do including the guy 3 levels above me

""I'm bringing this up because Bob said \*rude thing\* in the department meeting and it kinda threw me off! It made me realize that maybe we don't know each other too well"" \*also explained what I thought he was insinuating about me in the meeting

\*boss unfortunately backed up bob more than listening - said ""I don't think bob would say something like that""

Me: ""didn't think he would either, which is why it threw me off when he did! It concerned me because I would want my boss and my boss's boss to be people who would advocate for me"" - then i reinforced the solution of Bob doing skip-level meetings with us and why I thought it'd be a good idea for Bob to do them not just with me, but with other people at my level.  Generally thought it was received well.  

My boss got back to me a couple weeks ago saying that he made the suggestion to Bob.  And that he told Bob that he thinks it'd be a good idea to have skip-levels. He said Bob forgot about them and that Bob agreed it was a good idea and that Bob would schedule them with us.  Bob has not scheduled a 1 on 1 with me though.  I'm not sure if my boss told bob that he offended me.  

I'm concerned that I've lost trust with bob and my boss and that I may have put a target on my back.  If I were to get a redo, I'd just go to Bob directly and give him the feedback.  I'm worried I embarrassed both of us.  I personally think constructive feedback is always better on the individual level.  The less amount of people involved the better.  

I can't go back and get a redo though! What should I do? Reach out to Bob and tell him I'd genuinely like a 1 on 1 with him? Should I look for a new job?

Note: I'm a good employee, been there 4+ years, usually get satisfactory review, but this the last quarter of 23 I got my first ""outstanding"" review.  I like this job and my boss's and up til now I've felt neutral about Bob.  I get along with everyone else.  This is the first issue I've raised.  Also wanted to say something as to not make myself appear as a ""pawn"".  Having the ability to set boundaries and give constructive feedback effectively I thought should be seen as an asset, but IDK if Bob is gonna see it that way since he's being called out",throwaaway20222022,1,0.6700000166893005,6,1725135399,2024-08-31 20:16:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f5wfnk/i_dont_think_my_bosss_boss_likes_me_should_i_look/,8,2024

In 2022, I was approached by a colleague who wanted me to know that my JDQ was messed up and that I should approach leadership to make the necessary changes. I, of course, then took it to my direct supervisor, who was 100% on board for making these revisions. Fast forward eight months, I prepared a new one and gave it to my boss and department head. I was told, ‚ÄúI am not the next domino,‚Äù but they would see what they could do next year. In the meantime, my husband has been offered a promotion by his company, but we must move. I immediately started preparing a proposal to work remotely and shared it with my direct supervisor. She is 100% on board, as we have seen the success of remote work during the pandemic years. It gets pushed to our department head, who sits on my proposal for six months. They finally approved my proposal but added that there would be a six-month trial period. Still no updated JDQ, even with me continuing to press them that it hasn't been updated for 4 or 5 years and my job has changed A LOT. 

I am a month and a half into this trial period and received a request from my department head to meet on Zoom. I accepted, and during that meeting, I was informed that they were getting rid of all their remote employees and that I would have a few months before my position was done. They even started job searching for me and sent me information on jobs they found that might work out. 

I was absolutely heartbroken after that meeting and confused at how all this came about, so I set up a meeting with HR to air out my frustration. After I explained everything and shared all my documentation, I was notified that they were upholding my contract and that JDQ updates would happen immediately.

I don't trust my leadership at this point and feel like their actions are only to cover their butts. I have no guarantee that they won't just let me go after my trial, and their actions have already shown me that they don't care about me as an individual. 

I just celebrated my 10-year work anniversary with them and am completely blindsided by this whole thing. I also am a top performer and have always had a great performance review, so none of this is related to my work ethic.

Saying this, I‚Äôve been planning on going to PA school and have set to complete my prereqs. Right now, I am taking classes to boost my GPA and apply. However, it is incredibly competitive and people say it may take a few cycles to get in.

Saying this, for the last few years, I‚Äôve been ignoring the little voice in my head that wants to be a therapist‚Ä¶ but been recently been thinking about it more. Therapy has significantly altered my life and I am so passionate about mental health and ending the stigma. Working in the medical field, I‚Äôve noticed that I hate how much I have to rush my patients and I enjoy talking to them the most. Everyone has a story to tell and it hurts my heart to have to rush my patients so that the doctor I work for isn‚Äôt on my ass about being slow. Perhaps, it‚Äôs just an unhealthy work environment but I‚Äôm worried that all medicine is going to be like this. Also, I considered being a Psych PA but you don‚Äôt really get to know your patients as in depth as you would as a therapist.

Also, I feel like being a therapist is one of the most rewarding career choices because you get to know your clients on such a personal level. However, I still can‚Äôt shake the feeling out of myself that I‚Äôm just lazy and I‚Äôm taking the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù route and not living up to my full career potential.

I want to bring this up to my therapist when I see her but I‚Äôm worried about it coming across as pretentious or offensive.
I‚Äôm certain that I would find being a PA rewarding as well because you get to make a difference in people‚Äôs life, but I really enjoy being to listen to people and their stories.",Alarming-Technology7,0,0.5,0,1725122500,2024-08-31 16:41:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f5rkxz/im_23_and_im_at_a_crossroad/,8,2024

1f5qwhh,Is it too late to start a career in consulting?,"I graduated in May 2023 with a BS in information systems and business analytics from a top 20 business school. I was unemployed until January because I didn't do much career research during my degree and honestly didn't even begin looking for jobs until I graduated (I know, dumb mistake). I also was way too focused on tech jobs at a time when they were not hiring.

I ended up going for my masters in cybersecurity in January just to secure a good high paying job. My specific program is funded by the government, so they are covering all of my costs in return for 2 years of cybersecurity work once I graduate. I also know once I have my security clearance, contractors will love to get me (but I'm unsure of their pay for cybersecurity).

If I could make $100k/year right now, I think I'd rather drop out and start my career, however I'm worried as to how companies will view my period of unemployment. I'm also starting my second semester of four total for my grad program so there would be a sunk cost there, and the scholarship would need paying back.

I didn't even know what consulting really was until last year, and only applied for 3 tech consulting jobs. Now that I'm a starving grad student, I'm questioning whether this degree is really worth it and if I can still get a good job in consulting.

This seems to be the only high paying field I am qualified for right now. I'm kicking myself in the leg for not looking into it sooner, but the past is the past.

Should I finish out my masters or try to get a job consulting?",KoiTheNomad,1,1.0,1,1725120723,2024-08-31 16:12:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f5qwhh/is_it_too_late_to_start_a_career_in_consulting/,8,2024

1f5qaeb,Made a mess of my career. Completely lost at 25.,"Hi, I guess I'll start at the beginning - I was always a bright student, finished high school with amazing grades and got into a really good college to get my bachelors in business. Right after getting my degree, I got a corporate job in marketing but really hated it so I ended up quitting after 6 months. Then I decided to become a freelance marketer and after a lot of hustle I ended up making it a stable source of income. After about 2 years of freelancing, I got  a long-term contract opportunity to work remotely for a fortune 500 company (also a marketing related role). This was when I was making an insane amount of money but it was also the saddest time of my life because I didn't like the work and hours were terrible. So I decided to get back into my side-hustle of music-artist management (this is also something I did for fun when I was in college). As luck would have it, one of my artists really blew up and I was able to make some decent money from this as well. Seeing this as a ""sign"" to switch careers I decided to terminate my contract with the f-500 company and got fully into launching my own artist management agency. Slowly scaled this company over the last year, generated decent amount of revenue (not as good as f-500 contract money) but soon realized my business model for this work was a bit flawed and revenue drastically started slowing down. 

  
This brings us to today, I have a failing artist management agency and 3 years of random marketing projects experience and I'm 25. While financially I'm very much secure, I feel completely lost in terms of career trajectory. I have no clue what my next step should be and I feel like an idiot for jumping back and forth between these jobs and projects instead of sticking to 1 thing and getting better at it.

Where do I go from here? ",throwawayacccc20,0,0.46000000834465027,13,1725119106,2024-08-31 15:45:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f5qaeb/made_a_mess_of_my_career_completely_lost_at_25/,8,2024

Offered a job after interviewing with a not 100% truthful cv 

Basically I completed around 5 months or so agency work between jobs.

Reason I never mentioned it on my cv is completely due to key word searches on online platforms. The agency work was a low level role which the reason of my cv is completely different, in the past I‚Äôve had numerous recruiters emailing / calling to fill that type of role so it got annoying. After making it disappear from my cv the calls stopped so I just kept it that way. 

I told my future employer during this time in question I was studying (which is truthful)‚Ä¶ stupid I know‚Ä¶

Now I‚Äôve found out that 3-4 people I used to work with at the agency role are at the current place. Bear in mind it was 6 years ago or so, but they will definitely remember me.

Brush it off and say I can‚Äôt remember how long I was there, give a random ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure a month maybe, so I didn‚Äôt think it was relevant‚Äù

Current situation:

* Been at my current engineering job for 7 months
* Relocated for this job, paid all expenses myself
* Was counting on a 10% bonus to help cover relocation costs
* Company just announced no bonuses due to negative reviews
* My team wasn't affected by recent layoffs (10% of workforce), but there's a feeling of instability
* Manager is great, but one teammate is very rigid/old-school
* I enjoy the work itself

New opportunity:

* Offer from a more stable, profitable company
* Slightly higher pay than current job
* Seems like a more secure environment

1. I like my current work and manager
2. The new company seems more stable long-term
3. I'm worried about how a 7-month tenure will look on my resume

for context: i am 37 years old, i am a mid-level software dev in europe and dont make big bucks

I am mildy unhappy with my current occupation. Theres better and worse days but I cannot see myself doing this job for the next 30 years. Theres of course things I like about my job but also plenty i dislike.

One of my biggest frustrations is the sense that I am nothing more than a cog in a machine. My work feels rather devoid of meaningful impact, reduced to more routine tasks that do not contribute to any broader strategic goals or knowledge generation beyond my immediate field. Instead of feeling a sense of accomplishment, the reward for my efforts seems to be just more tasks of the same kind. No matter how fast or hard I push myself, I'm stuck in the same place, with no real progress or fulfillment.

On top of that i‚Äôm requiered to learn and keep updated with current trends and developments all the time. Thats fine and I can do it when its my own project but I have absolutley never had any passion for the projects i've worked on mainly because the outcome of a work project has nothing to do with my life. The best thing that can happen is that i get a pat on the back.

I dont want this to actually turn this into a rant but rather i‚Äôd like to hear ideas about where i should orient myself medium-term to reach a conjuction between passion, skills and money. So i want to point out what i like about the job and where my interests lie:

* Programming is really enjoyable when i get to work on my own projects which align with my interests
* I like to work with the computer and I like knowing more about it
* In my free time I read alot about finance, companies and investing. I im interested in the strategic decisions that companies make, rather than the day to day business.
* I love researching stuff and reading and i like to look at the bigger picture
* My last side project was taking data and evaluating it via sql queries in a finance related field
* I do not think im a great communicator, i am ok, but im introverted and dealing with people rather drains my energy, so I like that I dont have to deal with people all the time/ prefer working with a smaller team.

So i guess my question is: What other fields, areas, occupations do you think could or would be a fit for me or has anyone been in a similar situation and changed their job for the better?",useless_machinist,1,1.0,0,1725111564,2024-08-31 13:39:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f5ni1m/swdev_that_wants_a_career_change_whats_the_right/,8,2024

1f5meby,Seeking Career Guidance: Path to Becoming a 15+ LPA Instructional Designer,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm 29y/o, looking for guidance on advancing my career as an instructional designer and achieving a salary of 15+ LPA. 

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of my background:

I completed my Bachelor‚Äôs in Mechanical Engineering in 2016 and initially focused on UPSC ESE. Despite four attempts until 2020, I couldn't clear the mains, so I shifted my focus to PSUs. However, due to COVID-19, PSU exams were postponed indefinitely.

During this period, I worked as an SME at a local coaching institute to cover my expenses. But by mid-2021, facing uncertainty about my future and age limits for PSUs, I felt depressed and desperate for a stable job. 

I eventually secured a role as a content reviewer in an EdTech company. I worked hard, received awards, and was recognized for my performance. However, during my first appraisal in 2023, I faced a pay cut rather than a raise due to financial issues within the company.

In mid-2023, I moved to my current role as an Instructional Designer (through vendor - contract) at 5 LPA, with the promise of conversion to a full-time employee (FTC) after a six-month probation. The probation was extended to a year, and I was converted to a full-time employee with a salary of 7 LPA. I have received three awards (bronze, silver, and gold) from the client side, but I‚Äôm concerned that this path may not lead to the 15 LPA goal anytime soon.

I‚Äôm skilled in Articulate Storyline, Articulate Rise, adult learning theories, Camtasia, Snagit, and familiar with Workday and Sabacloud LMS. 

I‚Äôm considering exploring Digital Adoption Platforms (DAPs) as they seem relevant to my current role, but I‚Äôm also contemplating AR/VR technologies due to my engineering background.

I‚Äôd appreciate any suggestions or guidance on additional hard/soft skills or certifications that could help me achieve my salary goal. 
Should I focus on DAPs, AR/VR, or another area? How can I effectively position myself for higher-paying roles, possibly with international organizations? 

Any advice on how to navigate/enhance my career prospects would be greatly appreciated!

 Is there anything I could bring up that would strengthen my case for this, what I believe to be warranted, pay raise?

1f5km5c,Should I make the job switch? ,"A little advice please!

I have been at my job for going on 10 years now. It‚Äôs the second place I have worked in my 20 year career in this field. Which is almost unheard of. 

I have been pretty unhappy for the last 2 years. I feel under appreciated and underpaid. I have voiced my concerns to my boss and nothing has changed. I see people doing significantly less than me getting paid a lot more. 

The positives at this job are that I can bring my dog to work with me and I work from home Saturdays.  

The new place I would have to put my dog in daycare full time and go into the office on Saturdays. 

The new store seems to want me pretty bad. They have offered pay already higher than what I have at their first offer, it‚Äôs a smaller store so the workload should be smaller as well.  It‚Äôs maybe a 20 min longer commute each way.

1f5k2q6,"I've suddenly had my probation extended at a job I started two months ago and I have essentially been put on a performance review plan?
","I am from England and two months ago I started a new job after having left my previous one for better pay, perks and prospects. Things were initially going well with no hiccups or concerns, that was until today. I had a random unexpected meeting towards the end of the day with my supervisor and manager who were basically saying that my probation is being extended because I wasn't fulfilling certain responsibilities and or not doing what was required of me. I was quite surprised because until then there were no issues brought up until now, so my probation which is meant to be 3 months has now turned into 4 months.

I would love to think that they only want the best for me and for me to be the best I can but unfortunately I have had my probation extended / put on a performance view plan two years ago with a different company where it seemed like they wanted to help me then right as I thought I had really improved and did what was asked of me, they completely through me under the bus and dismissed me on the spot.

I have heard many horror stories of probation extensions and performance review plans so am I justified in thinking they're getting ready to dismiss me and I should start looking for new jobs ASAP? To be honest I am not really enjoying this job even before today as it's not really what I had in mind and I dislike the routine. Yes truth be told my manager could genuinely be trying to help me and there isn't anything suspicious but I would also rather not be naive just in case as I have been blindsided before.

When I first joined I disclosed to HR that I had social anxiety which may in fact be myself being on the spectrum. Should I disclose this info to my manager & supervisor in order to protect myself just in case? That way if I do get dismissed I could technically class it as discrimination based on a protected characteristic?

1f5jq00,"How should I navigate my career with 5+ years of experience in Finance and IT, given that my current role in content management lacks growth and skill development opportunities? ","Hi folks,

I hope you all are doing well.

I have over 5 years of industry experience, with 3 years in Finance and 2 years in the IT domain. After completing my bachelor's degree in management with a specialization in Finance, I worked in that field for 3 years. However, I realized that the IT domain is more lucrative, so I decided to switch careers by leaving Finance Domain. In November 2022, I enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development program, which lasted 8 months. After completing the course, I secured a position as a CMS (Content Management System) professional at a reputed MNC, though on a third-party payroll.

Now, after 2 years in this role, I‚Äôve come to realize that the work I‚Äôve been doing lacks demand in the current market scenario. My job primarily involves content management, with much of the work being simple COPY-PASTE tasks. Despite completing a comprehensive Full Stack Web Development program, I haven‚Äôt been able to apply more than 30% of what I learned. While I‚Äôm getting paid on time, my skills and knowledge are not improving, and I haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to learn new frameworks like React due to time management challenges.

I‚Äôm at a crossroads where I‚Äôm considering two options:

1. Continue with my current organization: This would provide financial stability, but would likely limit my growth, as my skills are not improving, and I‚Äôm stuck in repetitive and mundane tasks.

2. Leave the organization to focus on self-improvement: I could dedicate a few months to learning new technologies and skills through platforms like Udemy, and then search for job opportunities where actual web development takes place. However, this option carries financial risk, and I‚Äôm concerned about the high expectations in potential internships or new roles.

Moreover, in my current MNC, if there is no work in my project or deal, I‚Äôm moved to another project, which resets my progress to zero‚Äîa very frustrating experience. I‚Äôve been job hunting for the last 6 months, but I‚Äôm facing rejection, often struggling to clear technical rounds, possibly due to gaps in my knowledge.

I‚Äôm really in a dilemma. Should I continue in my current role and settle for minimal growth, or should I take a leap of faith, focus on upskilling, and aim for a role that aligns with my career aspirations?

I humbly request your advice and suggestions so that I can make an informed and efficient decision about my web development career.

Thank you in advance for your valuable insights!

1f5jbpt,Advice for a coach ,"Hello everyone,

So I started working at an F45 studio one and a half years ago. It was the first studio I ever worked at, it was a part time job because they were not making money so they could not offer me a full time job, because I loved the concept I agreed to work as a part time. However it was the only job I had so I would have a lot of free time and would do extra work for the studio, attend all the meetings and cover classes for other coaches last minute.

My manager at the time was very shady about finances, I soon realized that he has been stealing money from the studio, when the higher management informed us that the studio might close down, I decided to let the management know what‚Äôs really happening as I really did not want the members to suffer. The manager was fired and a new one was brought in.

All this time coaches came and left, but I have stayed because I am reallyyyyy attached to my studio and especially the members, I feel like it‚Äôs my comfort zone, however the management has constantly been cutting my hours, I am paid hourly. I do all the social media and also try to do admin work, I also attend every meeting. I have never been appreciated by the management for anything I have done. 

Now since no one is stealing any money, and the team has worked really hard together, the studio is really busy and we are making money and hitting targets, my hours are still low, in my contract it says I should have 50 hours minimum in a month but I only get 30 hours. It‚Äôs been affecting me mentally a lot, because I gave up several opportunities to stay. It‚Äôs weird because they bring a new coach when they could just be asking me to do the classes.

Anyway recently I got offered a full time position at another f45 studio, it‚Äôs a good offer but I can‚Äôt convince myself to leave in the hope that maybe the studio I am at has picked up and they might give me a full time job, should I ask the manager about this? Or just give my resignation? ",Ok_Nefariousness3357,1,1.0,0,1725096340,2024-08-31 09:25:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f5jbpt/advice_for_a_coach/,8,2024

during the core of my career life and my continuous race to grab something of value in a world of scarcity and lack of opportunities, and also due to the multiple attempts of back and forth between school and work, I have experienced a lot of domains like automotive mechanics repairing, telemarketing at call centers, English teacher in private schools, and seven years of correctional services at two of correction facilities in Morocco, dealing with detainees and criminals of all kinds that were not those lucky to be given the luxury chance to survive and change their destinies.

In December of 2023, fate was on my side again when I succeeded my first interview for an oversees job offer as a rapid response officer in a forensic psychiatric medical corporation in the Gulf region, the work is risky and stressful but somewhat better then my previous experience in corrections and more paying, but I always have that feeling of ambition and perseverance that drives me to perform more and achieve more, especially when security related jobs in general does not need that much of desired critical thinking and creativity that I was able to develop through all of the ups and downs of this journey, also because I am becoming to feel more at ease like a bird just being freed from the constant stress cage, after had been forced to work in corrections field just to survive financially and didn't have the alternative.

I can feel the increasing whispers of my brain calling for boom change all that shit sooner in my life, a big career transition that would put me back in school again, anywhere in the word, for the pursuit of something more creative and originative in which I can use my critical thinking and problem solving skills with more motivation and pride.

1f5hm9k,Being treated as a lead without title or pay,"I am having two different issues at work that I am struggling with and it‚Äôs causing me resentment that‚Äôs affecting my career. I could really use advice around 2 problems. 

#1. I work in healthcare but my job is highly defined by metrics which was not presented to me when I took the position. I consistently exceed my metric goals but what I‚Äôm taking issue with is these metrics are starting to always be shared with the entire team. It makes me feel uncomfortable. It‚Äôs metrics from everything to important stuff to silly things that aren‚Äôt even accurate because they are nuanced but they are just looking at data. When I brought this up I was basically told to get over it, and if I realize it doesn‚Äôt need to be addressed I can just ignore it and move on. I also feel like seeing people who are low performing every week has me build contempt for peers that are consistently low performing because the rest of the team has to make up for it and vice versa I don‚Äôt want everyone to see my metrics because I don‚Äôt want to be seen as an over achiever. 

#2. Because I‚Äôm considered a high performer I have been allowed to start learning more leadership skills over the past year and a half. However, the projects I‚Äôve been assigned are not formally announced to my team that I‚Äôm leading them so my peers are just viewing me as bossy and complaining to each other behind my back. I also am consistently being asked to do things that are multiple levels ahead of my current scope. I‚Äôm fine doing them but I feel like I‚Äôm being taken advantage of because I‚Äôm not getting the title or financial compensation for them. If it was just a few leadership exercises I understand but it‚Äôs being put in charge of multiple things over and over, being asked to mentor other employees, lead meetings and generally help create workflows, being asked for feedback about my peers etc. All of this is putting me in an uncomfortable position with my peers since I don‚Äôt have any formal foot ahead of them. 

I really like my job but I don‚Äôt enjoy being put on display and being financially taken advantage of by being expected to do extra work constantly that I‚Äôm not compensated for and I enjoy my peers and hate that it‚Äôs now causing them to distrust and resent me. 



TLDR: my work is displaying individual metrics without context for all teammates to see and I‚Äôm being asked to do things above my job without recognition financially or verbally of my leadership causing resentment from my peers.

I wanted to take this laborer job to get some life experience, since im still only 21 and have not worked full time outside of the Summer. I dropped out of college to take this job currently. I earned this job, through a combination of references and college experience, and taking the interview extremely seriously. I wasn't given this job because of who I know and that's a big source of pride for me.

  
This is also why I did not apply at the mine when they were doing yearly hiring last year, despite having a great chance of being hired. I want to pave my own way.

  
My family don't believe that I should sign the contract and should instead try to negotiate a way to stay as a laborer without being expected to become a tech. How would I go about doing that? The company is shorthanded and hurting for proper technicians, I believe they may fire me if I refuse to sign the contract. Should I sign it anyway?",This-Champion-829,1,1.0,2,1725075117,2024-08-31 03:31:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f5e1tt/should_i_sign_this_contract/,8,2024
1f5dvri,Nursing or engineering ,"I‚Äôm not sure what type of engineering thinking of mechanical. I was all in for nursing until I guess you can say second-guessing everything.

1f5d6h9,Counter offer guidance (US) ,"TLDR: how do i best position myself in getting a max counter offer when company will know they are in a bad spot. 

-------

Have an offer for 30k over current salary of ~200k and a senior manager position at a competitor. I am currently at the equivalent of the Harvard of my industry. Have been with them for 3 yrs and will be promoted to supervisor type title in December if I stay. Have 10 yrs in industry. New company is still highly regarded. 

At my current company there are 3 of us that are integral to the functioning of the group and essential to the company. 1 of the 3 gave notice a few weeks ago and last day was last week. The other person has an offer and is giving notice this tuesday - same day I intend to give notice.

I know my colleague doesn't intend to consider any counters but who knows what could happen. I intend to give notice about an hour after. 

Unsure of how to approach this to maximize the chance of a viable competitive offer. I don't know whether to have them pitch me or give them a list of things for me to stay - ie comparable new title and 30k more than competing offer. I also want to advocate for the greater team as we are currently understaffed and they are doing significant forced OT and shifted schedules. I have been advocating for a special bonus, but nothing has happened (bonus wouldnt impact me or benefit me). People are getting burnt out. If the 2 of us leave the department will be in bad shape and hiring takes time and has a 6month-1yr timeline for new people to be able to do work independently. Also takes up resources to train. 

People will leave in coming months either way but more will if we both depart. All 3 of us are moving to leadership positions where recruiting from old company will happen. Current employer knows this. They really should counter and keep both of us at all costs, but they need to keep one or face a rough road. 

Some additions: 

I would be completely happy at new company but dont like starting over. Also currently fully remote, which benefits my family - new position is 3 days in office/week. Commute is 45 mins each qay. 

I was recruited by the new company and will likely have better titles at new company in near term but will make more at current company long tern. Current company works people verrrry hard and we have high attition.  

Should I disclose that I know of my peer also giving notice? 

Again - mainly looking for advice on giving notice and whether I should wait for a counter or propose one to maximize potential outcome.

1f5cjbk,"Management won't say ""yes"" or ""no""","First time poster/commenter here.

I‚Äôm a teacher.¬†

Long story short I put in a sub request for two-weeks vacation about two months ago for a trip that would be two months from now. Basically, there was four months for admin/secretary to make arrangements.

I forgot to CC admin. I only talked to the head secretary who has been there 10 years and gave me an unofficial OK and already started looking for subs. Forgetting to CC admin was just an innocent oversight by me, but I did talk to them about it four weeks ago and officially added them to the email thread with the secretary.

After four weeks I get ambushed by an admin during my break. Guy just walks in and says it‚Äôs a bad idea to take this vacation. Or he doesn‚Äôt want me to go. Or something to that effect. He won‚Äôt say my request has been denied or I can‚Äôt go.¬†

I totally see his point about forgetting to CC him and the relevant admin from the get-go, but by the time I did CC them it was still three months out from the trip. As I mentioned, I did bring it up and email them four weeks ago.

If it was some unwritten rule not to take a two-week break during the school year, they could‚Äôve said something as soon as I mentioned I was going. Or maybe a day later. Not four weeks later. (For context, I‚Äôve worked at other schools where this was okay with advance notice, and other teachers at this very same school have done it, and the lead secretary even advised me how to use my sick days.)

So I‚Äôve got some questions:

1. Why do you think admin would take so long to inform their employer of a decision they probably made so long ago? I have a feeling they just dragged their feet on this one or didn‚Äôt want to deliver bad news. For context they also didn‚Äôt fire a problematic employee; they just waited about half a year for his contract to be up.¬†
2. Why do you think my boss (one of many bosses) would say ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a good idea to go‚Äù instead of just ‚Äúwe have to deny your request‚Äù? My hunch is they don‚Äôt want to officially deny the request and thus put the onus on me to postpone the trip.¬†

Of course, no one can say for certain what the thought process and decision making process was like, but I‚Äôve never encountered this before. A simple ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very sorry, but we need you to be here during the term. Here are some ways to extend your break during official school breaks, such as using a few personal necessity days before and after‚Äù would be clear and direct. What I dislike is ‚ÄúHey, there‚Äôs this thing we would like you to not do, so it wouldn‚Äôt be good to do, and it‚Äôs not a good idea, etc. etc‚Äù. We‚Äôre adults. By not just saying it clearly, they‚Äôre coming across as . . . weak? Anyway, I would respect them more if they just denied my request. No hard feelings. Now I know what the proper procedures are and what the expectations are from management.

Here are my options:

1. Go ahead and take the trip anyway. (For context, I do not work in a program where there is a clear beginning or end. There is no certificate or degree or cohort. It‚Äôs open-entry/open-exit, which means students are free to enroll or leave anytime, so it‚Äôs far less disruptive to take a break during the term than it would be at a typical class.) I couldn‚Äôt travel for two years because I was a caregiver for my father, and then when I finally decided to just travel anyway, he got worse, and my trip was basically miserable. Now that it‚Äôs been a year since he passed, I feel ready to travel again. Traveling during the official school breaks means two or three times the cost of flights and hotels (I‚Äôm going to Japan). On top of that, my 18 year old dog has a terminal condition (though is symptom free for now), and once she becomes ill I won‚Äôt be able to travel. Either I travel in two months or I wait over half a year until the spring break.
2. Postpone my trip about six months (so eight months from now). Traveling in two months is actually not the ideal time for me, and I had seriously considered postponing the trip anyway. One reason I decided to travel before the time was ideal was . . . well, if you keep postponing things you may never do it. At 40, it‚Äôs easy to get stuck in a rut. I don‚Äôt want to rock the boat at a relatively new job (3 years in). I wouldn‚Äôt be fired, but my contract might not get renewed the following year, or it might just make for passive-aggressive relations with admin.
3. Speak with the admin as two people, not teacher and administrator, and just explain my situation and rationale. Perhaps they think I‚Äôm just taking the trip on a whim. Perhaps they think I‚Äôm disregarding the general needs of the school. (I‚Äôve basically been doing a very good job, and perhaps most importantly have built up a lot of good will and rapport with students, who, at the end of the day, keep the funding coming in through attendance. The admin makes it sound as if attendance will plummet if I leave for a break. He even expressed displeasure when I took a short trip to Palm Springs when me and four guys were celebrating turning 40‚Äîthree days off in total.) I might go, I might not go, but I feel as a human it‚Äôs important for admin to know where I‚Äôm coming from, as they are generally nice people with their flaws (and I‚Äôm not flawless by any stretch).

Long post, but it‚Äôs my first time and I‚Äôm curious to hear what others think. I‚Äôm concerned about my career, but overall this has to be just a drop in the ocean.

At the very least, by seeing how admin has handled this in their indirect, unclear, indecisive way, I now see them for what they are. In a way these people have kind of lost credibility with me, and that I shouldn‚Äôt trust them to look out for me. Not that they are evil or sneaky, just that I cannot trust.¬†

The next day at work I felt . . . ‚Äúfree‚Äù . . . kind of like, well, I can still be a good worker and a friendly guy, but I‚Äôm not your friend, you‚Äôve lost my respect, but I won‚Äôt act out either. I guess I felt free to not give a crap about them if they‚Äôre not going to do the same for me. Yes, ‚Äúnice‚Äù admin will ask you about things, ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your family?‚Äù, etc., but at the end of the day it‚Äôs actions that count. Now it‚Äôs just in and out for me at the school. I love my work, I‚Äôve always loved teaching, but I just have to look out for myself now when dealing with admin and make sure to cover all my bases.

I don‚Äôt know how to explain it. I hope this post made sense. And I really do appreciate all comments and feedback.

1f5bnnf,I just don't know who I am,"Throwaway account out of shame. Title, I just don't know who I am in terms of where my skills fit in a work environment or even if they have any practical uses in general. 



I did the college thing and got my bachelors in business management/entrepreneurship. I went back and got my Masters in industrial psychology thinking it would help me be a better manager or leader in a business environment.



I've done a couple years of anti money laundering analysis and the other parts of those sorts of jobs require (federal compliance, excel, normal business things I would think?). 

  
So that's sort of my background however, I have no interest in being scummy and selling things to people that I'm not 100% sure they want. I'm not interested in being a sigma male grindset person that thinks it's a brag to lose your time for the sake of a job to get money you'll never have time to spend. I feel like I have some form of professional dysphoria? Everything I think I personally excel at I feel aren't things that can be put on a resume (I think?), like analytical skills or problem solving in unique situations. Those sort of skills I think a good candidate would have? Do most workers not have those, if they did then it isn't worth listing right (like being able to read and write)? 

  
I planned to write this and ask you all in the chat to maybe help me identify who I am or a profession I should proceed with but I am realizing that I can't really describe myself. I've never failed at any challenge or request put before me in a school or professional environment so I can't look to my failures to try to identify my strengths. I constantly love learning new things and challenging myself to perfect a system or process as quickly and easily as I can.

 

I am currently unemployed and literally feel aimless. I hate how all these job applications list titles for jobs, they all sound the same to me personally. For instance what is a business development analyst compared to a business development representative II? What qualifies you to be a business ""analyst"" is that a degree? Is there cross over?

  
I want to apply to any and all jobs I'm qualified for but I don't know how broad my skills go? I suppose I don't even know what qualifies as a ""skill"" in terms of job hunting. I'm 33, I have pretty severe A.D.D., and I just don't feel like the world has a place for me. 

  
I'm sorry if you made it this far in this post and I still wasn't clear as to why I posted this. I'm happy to try to explain it differently, because of the A.D.D. I'm very accustomed to having to find several ways to describe the same thing. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes time out of their day to read this. I really could use your help.

1f5b8ob,"No work for a week, no communication from boss","I'm posting for my husband as he isnt a social media/Reddit person. Please let me know if I should post this somewhere else! 

My husband has a job that is work dependent. He comes in, gets the work order(s) for the day, and goes home when the work is complete. Recently, his branch has switched to the manager (his supervisor's boss) texting in the morning before the workers come in if there is work to be done. The manager does not text if there isn't work.

For the last week, my husband hasn't gotten any communication regarding work. He's talked to some coworkers and found out they're getting work, and sometimes overtime or weekend jobs. He has reach out to his supervisor and manager, but hasn't gotten responses from either.

His job is part of a union, and he plans to reach out on Tuesday. However, his union is a ""loose"" union(?) According to long-time employees, the company is a union so they get union jobs, but they ""don't operate like a normal union"" whatever that means. It's our first time experiencing a union job, so we're not sure what a normal union would be in this field (concrete, roadwork)

He started with this company 7 months ago, and everything has been fine until now. However, the first four months he was driving to another city to help with a specific project. While it's under the same ""home office"" for the union, he was working under a different branch with a different crew. The home office (union headquarters for his location) is in a city about 4 hours away. I'm not sure if any of that matters, but wanted to add it just in case.

We're wondering what his next steps should be if it's outside of contacting the union. They haven't fired him, so he can't collect unemployment. He's started looking for other work, but his industry has an abundance of workers in this city and it took him months to get this job.

I was recently laid off and just got two job offers on the same day, but not sure which one to take. I'm 30, single, no kids, and just got my masters degree (MBA). I currently live in a small town in southern Minnesota near my parents. All my friends from HS & college have moved to various parts of the country, and my ex gf and I just broke up. No real reason to stay in this area besides older parents. I also got into some trouble 6 years ago (bar fight - acting in self defense but still got charged bc I was in boxing for a decade and fucked the guy up). So I lost some friends as well and looking for a fresh start.

Job 1: Director of development and communications for the MN PBS. Great job and good for my resume and future. Its about 4 hrs north MN from my current location. Downsides are the pay is not great (non profit) and the job/apartment would be in the middle of nowhere MN (10-20k people). Also hours away from any major city. So job is great but location sucks.

Job 2: marketing specialist job in aspen Colorado for a luxury real estate company. I love the location and grew up snowboarding/hiking/etc. With the cost of living, the pay is the same as job #1 (little to no savings for each job). I love the location and more to do in my free time, but the job isn't as good.

1f5a1gr,I am on the brink of total meltdown,"Hey there, I've been working for the same company for seven years, but semi recently went through a huge life adjustment that kind of torpedoed my ability to do my job.

I got divorced and started living alone for the first time ever, as well as retaining custody of a high energy dog that requires a lot from me, on top of a f*cking heap of things (autism/ADHD diagnosis, CPTSD, severe burnout) I've been going to therapy for during the same time period.

Honestly, I'm burnt out as hell. I am barely holding on by my fingertips and have no support system and am underpaid to do a management job that is asking a LOT of me. I can't take time off because my finances are too tight (even if I have PTO, it's not a tipped wage and therefore could not hope to cover my expenses in this economic time) but I have been steadily breaking down in my workplace and not able to put in the effort to improve myself.

I haven't successfully applied for other jobs because my anxiety is so crippling that I feel literally powerless in my own life. I'm honestly barely keeping myself and my dog alive, and I am on the brink of total collapse at any moment.

It's a small company. Gossip happens, and honestly I've been kind of a terrible employee, in full view of others. They're not entirely unjustified in their criticism. They have addressed these performance issues with me several times without any real follow through on providing me with the necessary accomodations for my (literal, legally diagnosed) disabilities however.

I am the most senior employee that hasn't transitioned into a more corporate role, and have stayed on the retail side of things. Recently during a performance review, they said that ""this time next year"" I wouldn't be in the role because neither they nor I wanted that. I've also reached my ""salary cap"" in my position.

I'm having a meeting with them (hr and immediate supervisors) next week to ""discuss goals"" and I am terrified I am about to be fired in a time where I can't imagine getting a better paying job that wouldn't be equally as draining without any advanced educational background.

1f59glb,BS in Biology and Wanting a Career Change - What Should I Do?,"I graduated with a BS in Biology in 2020 and worked at Moderna in manufacturing and now I‚Äôm a QC analyst II at a pharmaceutical company. I get to work from home two days a week but the days I drive onsite I spend about 3 hours commuting round trip. I‚Äôm feeling really unfulfilled and burnt out even though my job isn‚Äôt necessarily hard. I‚Äôm not sure I want to commit to grad school since I don‚Äôt really know what direction I want to go in but I‚Äôd love to teach myself some useful skills for finding other jobs. Some stuff I‚Äôve been interested in is science writing, research (not sure what it‚Äôs called but I‚Äôd love to do some sort of brain imaging on people with brain injuries or mental health issues), working for a natural history museum (not sure what the job title would be but it sounds like a neat idea), clinical research (seems like it would feel less detached and more fulfilling than my current job especially if I‚Äôm talking to patients), writing school textbooks, going into healthcare, etc. I‚Äôm worried going into clinical research will be a big pay cut and it seems like science writing jobs are tough to find right now. I‚Äôve applied to about 50 jobs the past month and a half and haven‚Äôt even gotten an interview. I guess I‚Äôm just feeling lost and sad and looking for inspiration from others so I‚Äôd love to hear what other people with Bio degrees are doing and if you think a masters is worth it or if you recommend I learn some sort of skill in my free time to help further my career. Feel free to share what you do for work, what your career path has looked like, what skills you think are valuable and can be self taught and even just job titles that I can look into further.

1f599r3,"Leaving small company, not sure best way to resign","Hi all, I'm dreading leaving my long-time employer, but need to as it is the best career choice for me. It is the first real job I've held outside of food service, and my position has evolved over several years (partially through my own actions as I like to keep busy). I have grown a lot since coming on. My resignation will be a large blow to the company as they don't hire quickly and we are a team of 6 with me handling a large majority of administrative work and no one else really knowing how to do the job I do since I have been doing it for so long on my own. I am very close with my boss, who also owns the company. We work hand in hand when she is in the office, and she trusts me to keep business going as usual when she is not around. I am the only person she calls regularly, as I know what is happening at all times for any division. Basically right hand. 

I have an offer coming Tuesday. With the holiday weekend, it's just awaiting the right signature before coming to me officially. I have already taken Tuesday off, several months ago, as I have plans. I dont take very many days off and don't plan on adjusting my schedule just because I have an offer. My start date is already set to the 16th. I had hoped to resign today to give a full 2 weeks, but I am unwilling to do so without the paperwork in hand from the new employer. So when it does come in, I plan to hand my resignation in immediately to ensure as much notice is given as possible. 

After discussing with my parents, they feel I should resign in person and hand over my letter at that time. I was originally planning to email it, to give them time to process before coming back to me. No amount of money offered (which will happen) can make me stay, and I know I will have several conversations about it before my final day, which I'm dreading. I don't want to give them reasons as to why I'm leaving, as they don't reflect well on the company. I want to maintain a decent relationship, and just give off the feeling that it is time for me to move on to something new. I feel as though these people are my family in a way (and there have been several comments over the years that indicate they feel the same) and I don't doubt that communications will end just because I leave. Even people who have been fired still have decent relationships with my boss as they appreciate how much they learned here and again, it really is a family. Though I would say that those people went through hardships and they were financially helped which may make them a little more burdened to feel so appreciative towards the leadership (whereas I don't feel that my company is responsible for my financial wellbeing by helping me through hardships, bit of a sore spot for me). 

So I want to be respectful, but not sure the best way to go about that. Keep in mind that during my final time at the company, I will be spending quite a bit of time with the owner, and theres no way around that due to the nature of our positions. Any advice?

1f58yy4,Probable End of Project,"Hey Everyone. I'm a finance person with project management + process improvement credentials and I'm currently running a finance-centric project. The project has a renewal coming up and it doesn't currently look like it's going to renew based on signals my boss is sending me. The project has been a success, efficient + well-run, and pretty useful for our org but there doesn't seem to be something I suspect the top brass wants to continue for budget reasons. Fair enough.  

My boss is starting to get cagey about stuff like budgets long term outlook and encouraged me to take on another role in another department which would mean I do 2 jobs at once (existing plus another). I declined this opportunity as I would do neither efficiently and would be too much stress. Our organization has gone through budget cuts, has eliminated jobs and put in hiring freezes although I'm cautiously optimistic this has mostly come to an end. 

I'd like to stay in my current organization despite my project ending, but I'm not sure how to go about making the right moves to do that. I've done a couple of finance/project roles and have done well in them at my organization, but need to translate that into a new role smoothly. The last time I had a contract come to an end at this org, they had me doing 2 jobs at once and it was a nightmare for me (but the org loved it) but at least they collectively found a new role for me which I think I've knocked out of the park. This time I'm not sure what is happening. 

Ideally, I'm able to land something internally I'll enjoy without pissing off people and ruffling feathers. Any pointers on how to safely land a new job internally?

1f58qe7,Why have people from university and industry treated me with level of abuse? ,"This reddit post will require a considerable quantity of background... I will aim to keep it brief.  
  
I graduated with my degree in computer science from an accredited US university. That was three years ago. I was unsuccessful in obtaining an internship or industry experience while attending. I did go to a few events... Code24, recruiting events, etc.  and I went to every event I could. Talked to recruiters. Gave out my resume. Applied to jobs. 

  
I got this general feeling that my presence wasn't welcome on campus. So many of my acquaintances or potential networking contacts seemed to want to abuse myself or my reputation (judging by relationship outcomes). Nobody told me anything of that aspect but I was left at the end of wondering why so many times people seemed to know of me prior to forming any real connections. If any connections occurred, 98% of the time they ended with myself being treated with callous, toxic behavior.

  
I get this general feeling that I am well known and generally regarded as not wanted.  

  
I am not certain as to why this occurred, or what if anything I can do about it. I spent a lot of my life and money going to this university with the aim of working in the field. My goal was not to make tremendous sums of money... I've had interest in the field since high school. I love STEM!!

I don't ask any of this because I care that much about what others think of me. I ask all of this because these problems seem to follow me around. I have not found an industry job... though I am working. 

  
My grades were much better prior to university... and I am capable a lot. I feel like the student body (faculty and administration too) unilaterally rejected me. The impact to my mental health is immeasurable. I had beef with some people who called themselves my pal... but they decided they would abuse me instead. When I put my foot down, said ""goodbye""... Nobody cared but so many people turned their allegiances toward this other person. I was on edge, and angry, many a day due to these things.

  
What can I do? I went to university because I love this work... if those who got into industry ahead of me are trashing my reputation when they see my application or in gossip circles... and keeping me from obtaining my goal... want what was the point. What is the point of living anymore anyway if that's the case...?

1f57ps9,Which sales job would be better?,"My background is in wireless sales and I‚Äôve been offered two sales jobs:

1. Member Experience associate at AAA

Pay is $24-$25 hourly and there will be monthly incentives/ commission, which they didn‚Äôt talk about, but the job posting says employees earn between $270-$3500 annually. Their benefits seem better than sleep number but it‚Äôs mostly customer service I guess.


2. Sales Associate at Sleep Number

Pay is $16 hourly. The commission works on a percent basis for how much you sell per month and they got store/ team bonus which makes it about $50,000-$60,000 per year. They told me they don‚Äôt rely on foot traffic due to low volume store and they gotta make 100 calls per day to potential sales/ referrals

1f579f5,Should I reject a higher offer based on principle?,"Hey guys! I am a recent college grad with my degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I have now been hit with two offers at the same time, but they are in different aspects of engineering and come with different circumstances. I want to provide a little background for the whole picture and see what you guys think. TLDR is at the bottom

**Company X:** This company is the company that I am currently at. I have worked here for about a year as a Software Engineer Intern as I graduated college. When I graduated, they let me know that they are waiting on contracts in order to be able to offer me a full time salaried spot. I do not doubt this as they just sold the company due to seeing it as a better way to expand and grow. However, they just offered me a full time salaried spot and this is because I received the other offer from Company Y. It is very hard not to take it personally that now all of a sudden they can offer me when I am about to leave. I really do not like the way they have handled my situation. At the same time, this company is way closer to where I live, has a better start time (9am), and offered $1k more.

**Company Y:** This company is the one I am thinking of leaving Company X for. This would be an automation engineering job. I have never done automation engineering, but it seems fun and interesting. The people at the company also seem very nice and made it sound like I would learn a ton of different aspects of engineering while working there. I also had a friend who was an intern here and let me know it was a great place to work with great people. The only downside of this company is that it would be an extra 30 min drive and be a 6:30am start time.

I do believe Company Y may be better for my career, but it is hard to say as I have never done automation engineering. I do also like all the people I have worked with at Company X. Upper management is really who I have an issue with. What company would you choose?

TLDR: Company X has treated me like trash but will offer more. Company Y would be a new field of engineering, further drive, and early start.

1f567mw,Help! Quitting consulting,"I have been a consultant since I got out of college for the same woman, who is about 10 years older than me. We have worked very closely as a team of two for 2 or 3 years now. In the past year the work has become equivalent to full-time. So much so that I can't take days off as I am working against constant deadlines (I will be working a full day on Labor Day, for example).

My boss has a vision of her and I becoming partners in her 'agency,' and she wants to give me a small amount of equity as a sign that she wants me to stay working with her forever. But I'm only 23, and there are some other issues such as lack of professionalism/volatility, constant 15-60 minute tardiness to meetings, etc. that has been pushing me away.

I‚Äôm nervous to share this with her out of fear that it will just be awkward, especially 1) bc we have three meetings before this ‚Äòbig‚Äô one on Thursday and 2) bc my last day with her wouldn‚Äôt be until very the end of September because of the nature of our contract.¬†

1f55w7c,"New boss stressing me out, seriously","In March, I got hired into my current position(3rd tier), which is a part of the three-tier system. A month into the job my supervisor(2nd tier) left, and since I came into the job, not knowing anything prior about the organization and expecting leadership me and another staff member on my tier had to struggle through the summer months. We had a lot of help from our first tier boss, which was great, but then she stepped down, and one of the second tier staff members took her position. The first supervisor was so extremely helpful and nice, and she gave any guidance where she had knowledge. The second and current supervisor does not have any interest in the area that I am in. And I have also been promoted into the second tier position, worthy prior staff member stood, with that position taking affect on soon. With all of the transitioning happening since I‚Äôve started it‚Äôs been a lot of things thrusted at me that I‚Äôve truly been taking on the chin, but it‚Äôs as if she does not understand the work. 

Anyways, I had spoken with the New first year boss about utilizing my last two sick days, but I have a crude before the transition because I will not be able to take them with me with the promotion. Initially, I wanted Thursday and Friday of this week, however, she recommended for me to take Friday of last week and Friday of this week instead. I reluctantly agreed and have already utilized last Friday‚Äôs day off. However, this morning, I have received a few emails which required me to have my laptop, which was at the office. So when I went there, I decided to stop by her particular office room and just give her general updates on the program since she had been out Wednesday and Thursday of this week for her own new position reason. She started talking to me about how I need to work on my leader ship and be prepared for what‚Äôs to come because other people are watching me. And while I understand that it‚Äôs important to make good impressions, I feel as if I‚Äôm being penalized for not getting with the program simply because I‚Äôm new.

Regardless, she asked me if I was coming back to the office today and I let her know that I wasn‚Äôt because I was utilizing the sick time. She asked me if I reflected it on my calendar and reported that on my timesheet. While I did submit it on my timesheet, I forgot to, put it onto my calendar. I put it on my calendar after she mentioned it because trying to do the right thing. I assume she noticed because now we have to talk on Tuesday, and I do recognize that people can forget a lot of things because I am having my own issues with that. But every conversation just feels like a stern talking to disguised as lighthearted banter and check-ins

I‚Äôm doing my absolute best with only being at this job for six months, but every time she speaks with me, it‚Äôs extremely discouraging even though there‚Äôs no one else that could possibly fill this position. In addition to that, I‚Äôve also been struggling all my life with what seem to be signed of neurodivergent and gotten older. It‚Äôs only gotten harder to pretend. I‚Äôm not trying to be paranoid to feel that my boss is working against me, but I just don‚Äôt feel supported.

The way that every single time we talked, turns into her telling me that I need to work on my organization, structure, leader ship, and asking me if I really want this position is so disheartening. I‚Äôm only dealing with this because I do not have a lot of work experience, but any advice is very much necessary, wanted, and I truly would like some sort of help.

1f556ha,Am I being deceived at work?,"Hi all, to keep this short and sweet, I reside in South Florida and I (28F) work at a private religious institution. The previous school year, I was a coach for a sport and was paid a stipend at the end of the season. This school year, I was asked to interview for a position and was told in writing the following:

""We are looking for possibly 2¬†permanent¬†substitute¬†teachers that will also assist with campus supervision, especially during the lunch periods. The pay will be $40,000 (based on a yearly salary of 10 months) and it will be an independent contractor hire as we will not provide health benefits etc.. When not subbing, can also assist Athletics depending on the duties assigned.""

I started this position August 8th, and signed a contract that says:

""On behalf of the community at \[Redacted for Privacy\], I am pleased to conditionally offer you the position of full-time Substitute for the 2024-2025 academic year. This offer is conditioned upon the successful completion of a fully executed background check, drug screen, the completion of the Virtus Safe Environment for Children Program, meet the requirements of the E-Verify program, and the completion of a reference check. Once these requirements have been fulfilled, a formal letter of employment will be issued. The status is full-time, independent contractor 1099). The salary $40,000 and is not benefits eligible. In addition, there will be no withholding of taxes or other liabilities deducted on the school's part; these are your responsibility. The hours are 7:30am - 3:15pm Monday-Friday with limited evening and weekend commitments as delineated on the master calendar or requested by the school administration. Participation in extra-curricular activities which carry a stipend may be discussed at a later date. New teacher orientation information will be forthcoming...""

Yesterday, Thursday August 29th, I was walking past HR and was asked to stop in with the other sub that was hired in the same position as me. HR told me that there was ""something wrong with the contract"" that both of us had originally signed, and that we are actually hourly employees. They say ""roughly $22.73 an hour."" They said they were typing up the new contract and would send it over as soon as it was done. I never received my contract that day.

This morning, Friday August 30th, I was paid. At 5am this morning, I looked at my paystub to see that I had been switched to hourly and paid $600 less than my last paycheck. At 10:45AM I recieved the new contract stating that I now make $22.73 an hour and the max amount of money to be paid is $40,000. The new contract states:

""THIS AGREEMENT¬†entered into this¬†8th¬†day of¬†August, 2024, between Chaminade-Madonna College Preparatory, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the ‚ÄúSchool‚Äù) and¬†Heather Anderson,¬†an individual (hereinafter referred to as the ‚ÄúContractor‚Äù), provides as follows:

‚ÄãThis agreement¬†shall be for the¬†school year (10 months)¬†as determined by the School¬†calendar.¬†¬†The Contractor will provide¬†responsibilities as determined by the Assistant Head of School

Position:¬†Substitute Teacher/Supervisor¬†

The Contractor shall be paid at¬†an amount/rate of¬†$22.73¬†per¬†hour. ¬†Payments will be made¬†on¬†biweekly basis.¬†The total compensation will not exceed $40,000¬†for the 10 month engagement.""

Important: All teachers and subs are instructing to sign in at the beginning of the day, but we do not sign out. I have not gotten any new instructions since being given the new contract. With that being said, how are these hours being tracked?

Please help, as I do not have anyone here to talk to, HR has been no help in clarifying the situation, and I do not have the money to seek any legal opinions. Is it legal for them to switch me to hourly before I even got the agreement? What do you suggest I do?

I was fine and I just established boundaries. The real problem started when I noticed the drastic difference between how my manager treats her Vs. Me. When I was in my probation period, I was scrutinized a lot and he expected me to be perfect immediately. He didn't give me the leniency that turns out he is very capable of now. Then, comes the fact that he was giving me negative feedback in front of her in meetings or casually. Meanwhile, he talks softly to her in a very careful manner. I feel so confused and frustrated. It's making her feel better than me. She already has a big ego doing the minimum and getting the better treatment. It's affecting my mental health a lot. Because I keep doubting myself and having horrible anxiety about this. I try to rationalize this but then I go to work and something happens and it's been a cycle. She seems to be the kind of person who would also step on someone else to not be held responsible for a mistake. I already thought about talking to my boss but there is nothing solid to complain about. And he might be on her side and give her excuses. How do I deal with this situation and be professional? I am so upset and feel kinda angry.

1f54f2u,30 year old experienced mining engineer looking to transition into business/corporate outside the mining industry. How should I go about this and what roles would I be well suited for? ,"
Hey everyone. I‚Äôve been working as an engineer at various mines across the country (Canada) and throughout the world since age 19. All these jobs were fly in fly out on 4 weeks on 4 weeks off or 2 weeks on 2 weeks off schedules. I had a short stint in engineering consulting in an attempt to get back to the city to be closer to my wife and family and friends. But I got laid off and had to take a job back in the field to make ends meet. I enjoy the work but the turmoil my personal life is in (constantly fighting with my wife and being pressured to quit) make it hard for me to be away and do this job. 

My question is this: what career options would pay similarly to what I‚Äôm making (150k CAD/year) that I can transition to with my current skillset? I currently manage a team of engineers and surveyors, oversee mining operations, support the operation through designs, calculations, and ongoing engagement with stakeholders and various departments within the mine, and give regular presentations to large groups. I‚Äôm great with excel and am a fast learner. I also have a lot of experience with sales and have worked part time in sales on my time off to make some extra money. 

I‚Äôve considered going into investment banking and doing a CFA but I‚Äôm concerned that this would be an even worse work-life balance trade off. I‚Äôm also considering business development but from what I‚Äôve seen the positions that I‚Äôd be qualified for only pay like 75k/year and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay my mortgage. 

At this point I‚Äôm open to anything and if nothing comes up I‚Äôm willing to do an MBA though I‚Äôd have to go into my savings to afford it. Overall I feel stuck. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

1f53ggn,What is the process of relocating like within global tech companies? ,"Hello,

For people who have been in the industry for a while and as a student from the UK that has a goal of moving to the US at some point in the future - 

How often do you see people relocate within global companies to different countries (e.g FAANG)?

And to add onto that, I know this is a question that is heavily subjective and varies from person to person-

How experienced do you have to be within the company to even enquire about this? 

I imagine you would need to be a good amount of years into employment and would have to be respected in terms of your skills and experience within your workspace. I might be answering my own question with that but if anyone has done this and have moved around worldwide, how long did it take you before you got that move and how long do you normally see it take for people to relocate within their company? 

I'm probably very narrow minded when it comes to this topic and I do apologise however I'm keen to learn about your experiences and even if you haven't experienced this yourself, just some advice anyways since you're probably more knowledgeable on this topic than me. 

I'm just trying to draw a picture in my head of what things could look like even though things can always change. I also understand that once I do finish my undergraduate degree, I will probably seek for more experience and do internships or maybe pursue a master's degree since that is probably more realistic for getting such a job as I doubt it would be as simple to graduate and then land a job with global offices and relocation packages. 

I do understand that I have to add the years of work experience before I even get hired for such companies capable of letting me move across to world (in my case, my goal being the US). 

Any advice would be appreciated. ",AceSfRonaldo7,1,1.0,0,1725045106,2024-08-30 19:11:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f53ggn/what_is_the_process_of_relocating_like_within/,8,2024

Im working at a facility that teaches a new sport that I love and Iv been able to grow a community, compete internationally and be in a industry with so much potential but some things have me wanting to quit. Iv been working here for 3 years and have begun to make my way up the corporate ladder with the promise of becoming a district manager with my own facility in the near future with the owner of the company wanting to help me achieve that success. currently Im not making a lot of money but iv been sticking it out as I have a strong work ethic and want to see this through and if this company pans out they way the owner invisions I could make lots in the future. In the beginning of this year the company went through a restructure of its corporate team and many people were let go and some had made their way higher up one being now the new director of operations and she has imposed many changes and the delivery of said changes have come across as attacks to me and many staff members. Recently she imposed that I no longer be present during meetings when I am part of the leadership team and have been present and collaborative during these meetings with the other operation leads theses meetings are for the leadership team to communicate things with the higher ups and so we are aware of things happening in the company regardless if it's our department or not the other leads who are just as experienced as my self were not told they were only needed on occasion why just me my department is just as necessary as anyone else's so couldn't help but feel attacked. This is just recent events many events from this new director have made me feel as if I'm not wanted in the company anymore and I don't have a future and I don't know what to do, I could go back to school for years and become my second choice a teacher but that 4-6 year commitment I'd be almost 30 when I got out and add to my debt, I could stick this out and maybe have a promise at a future or just end up nowhere.

1f527kx,Anyone else unhappy with their career?,"I'm 20 and I feel pretty miserable with my career choice. 

In my country you can choose an apprenticeship at 16, then you get trained for a certain position at a company for a set amount of years. I did that, as a software engineer for 4 years, I wanted to quit after 2 weeks, but I persisted. Now I'm set to start my bachelors in computer science in 2 weeks and I already have no motivation whatsoever to do it. 

During the whole apprenticeship I felt lilr an impostor, I was always the last to understand concepts, could barely and still cant code, but besides having no skills I have no love for it, my colleagues always talk about their side projects, tech news etc. but I just cant even listen to it.

I've been thinking of pursuing a creative career, something in film, maybe advertising, since I love cinema, literature, history, write stories and create music myself. The problem with this is that it's not as well paid of course, a creative director earns very well, but until that point it's a rocky road. I think I may be more money oriented than I would like.

On the other hand I feel ungrateful, I am. I needn't look far, even my cousins would kill me for my life and career, maybe I should just endure it.

1f526yq,Decision Time ‚Ä¶ what am I missing. ,"Job offer:
WFH (which I have been wanting) 
50% pay cut and 50% less PTO accrual rate.  (6 figures to 5 figures it‚Äôs the PTO that is a huge deal for me and they aren‚Äôt willing to budge).  This would be going from boss to workerbee (all that I have to worry about is my performance). 

Current: 6 months in a new industry in an administrative management role with a co- Director. 
Co- Director is a horrible human causing me to hate my everyday that I have to interact with her. I found out the last three people left due to this person. Otherwise the job is easy and even boring. Current boss leaves me alone but does seem to put more into what the co-dir says. 
I have been told boss and HR are fully aware of her and due to the amount of revenue she generates it‚Äôs been overlooked for years (I don‚Äôt think this will change).  Otherwise I have wonderful work life balance, good/fair pay for the work I do and great PTO I negotiated. 

Previous role/company 7yrs:  received title promotions (already at the top position wise) but was very burnt out and 0 work life balance.  Could go back to this type role but would hate life again.

1f51uol,URGENT: NEED HELP!!,"So the thing is I'm an average guy who scored 61% in 12th boards pcm and took a year drop after that.
Now the most common/basic reason would be to crack JEE or any other entrance exams but that wasn't the case for me
I took a drop year solely because I was not prepared to enter into a college 
I wanted to do btech with c.sc and I still want to do it too but I knew that I know nothing about it
I took c.sc in my 12th but I didn't study properly 
I knew if I'll go into any college now first of all it won't be a good college cause no good colleges gives a seat to a student who've scored 60% in 12th boards and my scores in jee(single digit percentile) and cuet were also very low and I didn't want to get into a private college cause a good private college would charge a lot of fees.
So I decided to take a drop and my main goal now is to crack cuet or the personal entrance exams colleges do of thei own and get a good percentage of scholarship(atleast above 50-60%) 
Academics was the first reason I took a drop

2.Now this also plays a very big part for which I've took a drop and the reason is 
I want to be THAT guys in college
You know the one people want to be with you genuinely enjoy their company
All my life I've been an introvert and I don't have too many friends 
I had 2 friends and now I just have 1 
So
I wanted to be good in every aspects not for people to like me but just for myself i.e. be it physical appearance, spirituality, academics, intellectual,broad knowledge, EARNING MONEY(even if it is in small amounts just as a side hustle), high value skills which will help in the real world, a bit of head start in programming, musical instruments like guitar, harmonica,etc.
But I don't know how to do it 
My current lifestyle includes 
Waking up at 6-7 
Going to the gym at 7:0-8 and coming home at 10:30-11(I know it's a lot of time and I have to reduce it) 
Coming home and have a bath 
I sit for sometime infront of the laptop but I use my phone all the time 
I have lunch at 2(I follow a good diet which is high in protein) 
I scroll insta for some more time and then I sleep for sometime 
I wake up at 4 
I don't know what I do after that 
I just use my phone 
And then I have my dinner at night and sleep 
At this point I'm fed up with my current lifestyle and I know that if I have to achieve something big I'll have to change my lifestyle 
I just go to the gym and eat clean atleast 80% of the day and that's all I'm doing 
I'm not proud of this 
I want somebody to help me with a roadmap of how to become the person I want to become 
I want to learn stock market too basically I want to get rich or atleast start a basic income for myself before I get into a college next year just so that I can have money for a good diet and my family doesn't have to take stress for my personal spendings which I can't even ask for at my home 
I come from a middle class family and I know my father will provide money for me if I ask for it even if it means taking a loan but I don't want that 
I want them to just to give my fees as I can't afford it rn and Ik that 
The least I can do is get a source of income online and get my monthly expenses by myself for my diet and personal spendings.
I just want someone's help, I know I don't have much time left and I'll like to come on the right track as soon as possible

1f50xzm,Should I resign without another job lined up?,"I (25F, recent university graduate) am currently working as a sales assistant at a beauty supply store, and it has been 3 months since I started. My workplace is generally good - we get paid on time and the work itself isn't too bad. However, I am considering resigning for a few reasons:

1. I work in shifts: Shift 1 from 9.30am to 5.30pm, and shift 2 from 1.30pm to 9.30pm. On weekends everyone work full shift, and starting next week, I will be working 3 full shifts per week (previously just 2). Because of this, I have missed some family events and hangouts with friends. I feel bad for keep requesting my manager to switch my shifts, and it's hard to request for paid/unpaid leave since it's only me a one coworker placed on our branch.
2. We have commissions, which creates a competitive atmosphere among colleagues and making it difficult to form genuine friendships. The commission rate is not even that high. We only received 1.2% of what we sell and in order to get $100+ commissions, we need to sell at least $10k worth of products.
3. My coworker and I are the complete opposite. She's not the worst coworker to have, but she really drains my energy and keep crossing my boundaries. Plus, it sucks that my boss thinks that she is more competent than me just because she is more extroverted. It pisses me off because I'm working my butt off for this job - always being on time, sometimes skipping breaks to boost sales, and learning about products to better assist customers. I really feel undervalued and not gonna lie, it kinda hurt my ego because I worked there a month earlier than her. It's just hard to stay positive when the boss made it clear that your junior coworker is outperforming you.
4. I do not like how my boss turns small matters into big ones. For instance, a few weeks ago, a customer came to pick up his item while I was away. I was working alone that day and was on my break. The customer DM-ed our IG account about it, and instead of privately texting me or my manager, she decided to show the screenshot of the DM in the main group and asked if only one person was on duty. This is not the first time she did this, it seems to me like she is looking for faults or issues.

So yeah, I'm starting to feel demotivated and I keep feeling anxious before going to work. I have applied other jobs, but so far no luck yet. Is it a good idea to resign now or should I wait for few more months?",gomddae,1,1.0,2,1725038817,2024-08-30 17:26:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f50xzm/should_i_resign_without_another_job_lined_up/,8,2024

It was nothing technically wrong that I did, but I think he didn't like the way I handled his request for some work.

I think my contract will end now because of this. I don't care about the contract but just in terms of good communication ettiquettes, do you think I should bring it up?

Just because I respect this manager, and it feels really unprofessional to not say anything about it even though I am sure this is the reason he is ghosting me.

It has 2 weeks since the incident, and one week since any communication at all. We did communicate very briefly over email about some other work in the first week after it.

Will it be unprofessional and weird -- or will it actually be me being professional by taking responsibility for my actions (even though I don't actually think I did anything wrong & do think he is kind of overreacting tbh, I think it's fine to apologise if he thought it was that wrong?)

Any advice appreciated. And if you have perspectives on it from the manager side as well. Would you prefer the employee just let it slide?

1f4xzb7,Made a mistake at work- how do I approach this? ,"So I am a marketing manager for a company. We run billboards for most of the months. I emailed our rep a billboard back in April to schedule it for these past 2 weeks.   
Today I get a call from one of our salesmen that the board of directors for the fair (what was going to be run on the billboard) wasn't seen by anyone on the board. I reached out to our current rep and turns out the old rep never scheduled it. I did not follow up with the new rep to make sure that we had a billboard running this week as I was under the impression the old rep scheduled it.

For context, the old rep quit about 2-3 weeks after I emailed her the billboards for scheduling.

Now I do not know what to do. Do I lie and say that they were up? Do I approach my boss before the salesman and tell him what happened? Now I am worried because the billboards were supposed to be run in lieu of sponsorship money. Not only did we pay for 2 weeks that an incorrect billboard ran on, but we might owe money.

When I need a barrier removed from a work project or if I need advice on what to do next, I find myself asking our VP instead of her because she invariably defers to him anyway.

I'm a freelancer and the man I've been working is too. He is late 30s and I'm late 20s, he has a baby and I don't. We have been working on some projects these months and he is so nice. Although, he often cancels our schedules. For example, he cancels the schedule almost once every 3 times at the day we have the meeting because his baby got a fever. I understand that babies easily get a fever and I never blame it, it's natural. Although that's the fact that I feel sad every time he cancels our schedule and we can't proceed our projects that much.

If he is an employee in a company, someone else of the coworkers work instead of him and make up for it. But he can't because he is an individual. If he can't work, it means we gotta stop our projects.

Fortunately we can continue the project slowly and we don't have to hurry that much, but I feel frustrated more and more because I adjust my schedule for the project.

1f4snym,Employee bad mouthing about freshly founded company to potential partners. How to behave to stop this?,"I try to be as short as possible, but cannot go too much on details‚Ä¶
Few years ago, production company was founded. We worked really hard all the time, completed a project and had success between investors, so we got other funds to make new project for other potential buyers.
 However, first collaborators for this new project were very slow and could not meet the deadlines or were ghosting most of the time, so company had to cut ties with them. We found ourselves at the very last moment with no one and so had to look quickly for new partners to help us out.
I knew some (very good) professionals who could help us and made some names. However, one of them in particular, was very VERY critical about the entire project and gave me the impression that he was expecting the levels of some big multinational company with huge budget. Moreover, I have the impression he wants to take direction for very thing (while I asked only if he could give just a help and, if needed, give some advices- obviously everything should have been fairly pained). 
 We had already other other professionals I called that are in the same network, and as first they looked interested and then they completely ghosted us. I am a bit worried that this very critical professional, has been badmouthing about the project before them to see it, so I am afraid that he showed and described the project to other people even if signed for NDA. Moreover, I believe this happened to a vocal chat where there are other people I have never called into the project.
I notice all of this by the behavior of anyone (included total stranger) towards me when I entered the chat (as soon as I arrived, they ALL logged out and sounded embarrassed).

The company itself is not very big, it has just opened and might not be ‚Äòperfect‚Äô with ‚Äòsuper high level skilled‚Äô people or work, but we are really working hard towards this target, I am a bit angry that someone is poisoning the project while it is trying to grow.
 Anyway, the pay and treatment is totally fair, or else I would have not called very demanding professional, so that was not totally the issue. 

I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this situation, how to behave to stop this badmouth and total nonsense from this person. Since anyone now is listening just to this person, I am afraid that if I come out with my hypotess, situation may become even worse and should have to go to seek totally into another network.

1f4skqo,"Job A offer, Job B final interview‚Ä¶ how to move forward","I have been applying for a new job for the last 18 months, and in that time I've gotten quite a few interviews but ultimately no offers (except one which I declined).

I've been talking to people at Job A for months because they are rolling out a new team and figuring out there roles, and they'd been keeping me warm while finalizing things. As such, the time between my actual application and getting an offer was surprisingly quick. It's a big pay raise from where I currently am, and I think a good team to join, in the same niche field I've been in for a long time.

ON THE OTHER HAND, a month ago, a team I previously interviewed but didn't move forward with reached out to ask me to apply for a new role they created. In my first interview last week they said that, as they created the role, they thought I would be a great fit for it. It's in my industry but is different than my current role, and would be a great shift opportunity for my career - and the pay and perks are up front better than Job A.

I hadn't heard from them for a while about another interview so I emailed them to let me know I have an offer and to check on my status with them. They said that they got delayed by hiring for another role, but that I am a favored candidate and they want me to advance to a second interview. The way the timing is, I would have to answer Job A before knowing if I'm getting an offer from Job B.

A friend suggested asking my current employer to counteroffer on Job A -- which, if they give me a raise, gives me an out with Job A and time to wait for Job B's decision. And also that accepting A then backing out if B comes along would be very bad for my reputation. If it weren't for Job B I would definitely be moving forward with Job A. I'm not sure what to do now! I know it would be bridge burning to renege on A but also that I ultimately want to make the best choice for me in the long run, and don't want to miss out on a good opportunity by gambling on a better one.",IndividualCut4703,1,1.0,2,1725016228,2024-08-30 11:10:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f4skqo/job_a_offer_job_b_final_interview_how_to_move/,8,2024

1f4qkoh,"wound up at a dead end in a dying inudstry, where to go next?","I'm an Austrailan, and I've realized I'm not happy where I am in work. Only problem? My field is dying, hard, and moving around within it honestly seems fucking pointless. So I'm not sure what to do next. What follows is a brief blow by blow of my weird fucked up career in the hope I might have some skills that are useful...

I worked retail jobs during university and graduated with a bachelor's degree in aerospace & mechanical engineering. I eventually secured a job working in manufacturing and hated it because it was just excel and boring shit and the factory was going down the tubes. I got out by doing a year at an agricultural company as a social media marketer because I'm confident and a good talker and if you knew what Facebook was, that was good enough. Did that for a year, moved into their engineering department, and hated it again, and quit.

Why'd I quit? Well, I'd picked up enough side work as a journalist that I could live a meagre share house existence off that money. Then I picked up a really interesting electronics R&D job on the side because I knew Arduinos and a bit of Python and again, I can talk good. Did both for a while until the R&D job died when money dried up because of COVID.

At this point I was approaching 30 and was sick of living in a sharehouse. I still had my writing job so I got more writing jobs and made that my main career. It was okay for a while but the last few years have been hell. Layoffs everywhere. Magazines almost all dead now. Only a handful of websites left, few of which are cashflow positive. Forever fearing you're next to be laid off. Every day is a fight for relevance as you pray the algorithm gets you enough views to dodge the knife for another week, month, year. 

I want out. This is no way to live. It's like working one of those sales jobs where every fucking day you're just sweating if your numbers are good enough.

The problem? I don't know what else I can do. I don't want to go back to some shitty entry level engineering job; the pay was poor and the hours were long. I'd like to stay fully remote too. 

I've thought about software but I'm pretty limited to some intermediate Python. I can do plenty of embedded stuff but not at a high professional level. Outside of that I've got some video editing skills and I've sold a few video game soundtracks but I'm not convinced either is going to net me a decent wage.

TL;DR: I have a bunch of scattered skills, none of which are world-class, I don't want to work in an office, but I still want to pull down six figures. Do I just have to learn software and chase a tech job?

1f4qf06,Continue to work two part time jobs?,"Hello everyone, 

I am currently working two part time jobs, I‚Äôm having continual repetitive thoughts on leaving one of them. For context, I am 21 years old and live with my parents. I don‚Äôt pay any bills apart from my car payment and insurance. 

One of my jobs is working at a hospital. I got this job because I needed prior healthcare experience, and I like working 12 hour shifts. My other job is at a gym, which is really starting to becoming boring and repetitive. I‚Äôm considering quitting my job at the gym, but I‚Äôm struggling because I would lose the perks of working there. For example, a free membership, discounts on gear and access to special events and classes. While I have many very close friends there that would probably let me in for free and give me access to discounts, it‚Äôs nice that to have that guaranteed. My performance there has been going downhill since starting my hospital job, and people have started to take notice. 

Either way, I would have to leave my gym job come March when I begin school. My question is, should I stick it out until March?

1f4pqao,Beggining of career struggle: need some advice,"Beginning of career struggle, what should I do?

Hi everyone,

I'm an engineer working in analog design in the semiconductor industry, and I‚Äôve been feeling pretty lost and unhappy in my career lately. I've been with my current company for about a year, and while I‚Äôve gained valuable experience, I find myself constantly stressed and struggling to achieve a good work-life balance.

To give a bit of background, I‚Äôm based in Central Europe and have been in the field of Electrical Engineering for around 1.5 years, including some experience while finishing my degree. My current net salary is in the range of 2,000-2,500 euros per month.

I‚Äôm currently considering a few options for my next steps. One option is to look for a different job within analog design, staying in my current specialization but hopefully finding a company with a better work environment. Another option is to explore other areas within Electrical Engineering, potentially shifting to a different part of my field that might offer better balance and growth. Lastly, I‚Äôve been thinking about switching to a different career altogether, though I'm not sure what that would look like yet.

My main concerns revolve around finding a better work-life balance, as I want a career where I‚Äôm not feeling constantly stressed and can enjoy my life outside of work. I‚Äôm also looking for growth opportunities, somewhere I can grow both personally and professionally without feeling drained or unmotivated. Future remote work options are important to me as well. While I know early career stages might require more office presence, I‚Äôd like a path that could lead to fully remote work or a hybrid setup with a maximum of one day in the office per week. I prefer the comfort of working from home over traditional office environments. Lastly, maintaining my current salary level is important, as I would like to avoid a decrease in income.

If anyone has experienced something similar or has advice on navigating these options, I‚Äôd really appreciate your insights. Any advice on remote work trends in engineering or similar fields would be especially helpful.

1f4njr2,What would you do?,"I work in operations as a supervisor. I‚Äôve been here for almost 2 years and excel at the job. I work 30ish hours per week, and half of that is waiting for my employees to show up just so I can provide some face time. Clients like me. Boss likes me. I‚Äôll make just a hair under $65k this year before bonus time (April ish‚Ä¶~$5k).

I‚Äôm also likely to get a promotion that will bump my base pay to about $75k, plus a bonus. Bonus will depend on how many locations we open, costs, profit, etc. I‚Äôd say $80-$85k is my guess for TC, though there is a possibility it‚Äôs quite a bit more. Travel would be required 4-5 days per week for probably half the year (I enjoy traveling, so this isn‚Äôt a bad thing). 

The rest of the time is work from home - but other than an occasional meeting, my work (from home) could be done at any time and certainly wouldn‚Äôt be very demanding. 

I should note, the company is rapidly expanding. I‚Äôm currently 2 spots from a director role, and the goal is to triple in size within the next 8 years - though an influx of cash just came in, so it‚Äôs possible, likely even, that it‚Äôs within the next 3-5 years. 

All of this to say, I‚Äôm well positioned. 

‚Ä¶

However, I had an interesting opportunity fall into my lap. I have the potential to be the sole distributor in America for a new product. I say new, it‚Äôs more of an improved version of some product that already exists, but approaches it quite differently. IF*, and it‚Äôs a big if, business go for it, it would save them money and time. The typical way it‚Äôs worked is essentially an on demand service that‚Äôs charged monthly/yearly. The costs for this from us would be all up front. 

I firmly believe in the product and see many uses for it. 

I‚Äôve been told that the costs for the company are roughly 60% of the product (though that‚Äôs an estimate). Leaving a 40% profit margin, my guess is the profit margin might be a bit higher than estimated but I have no possible way of knowing. 

I‚Äôve been offered 20% (an even split of the profits) commission (this also isn‚Äôt entirely accurate, they‚Äôd want me to bill them, so really I‚Äôd be a separate company ‚Ä¶ I have a tax guy I‚Äôll seek his counsel on how best to approach that). 

They‚Äôre based in Europe, I‚Äôm U.S.
‚Ä¶

So about me‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve successfully run my own business before. Primarily arbitrage, but worked with some wholesalers and became a distributor for a few. I sold the business literally the week before Covid essentially shut down the US. 

I can talk to anybody, I‚Äôve often thought about a career pivot to sales or insurance or financial advisor - so I‚Äôm not scared off by any of that. 

I also think there‚Äôs a chance I can talk with my current boss and more or less keep my day job. My thought is pitching them to letting me be fully remote (though I‚Äôd actually still go in some of the time)‚Ä¶ the pitch would be something along the lines of offering a salary reduction (25% give or take) with the ability to take more time off (currently I‚Äôm limited to 3 weeks - by far my biggest complaint). Ive got all the flexibility I could ask for in my current role. 

I‚Äôm on mobile and can‚Äôt add this where it really belongs, but: I currently am not remote. However I run my own area, roughly 90 minutes away from my boss and nearest colleagues. My primary job is answering emails/phone calls. No reason I couldn‚Äôt do this completely remote - the benefit of being on site is simply so my employees see someone. The stuff that needs to be done at the physical location my lead can handle almost all of.

‚Ä¶

So essentially saying, ‚ÄúHey boss, let me keep this as a backup for 6 months or so, and if it doesn‚Äôt work out I‚Äôm committed here‚Äù while being completely transparent about my effort (or lack there of currently), as I‚Äôd be willing to walk away with minor changes to the comp I‚Äôm being offered - biggest goal would be for them to offer me a guarantee for 6-12 months along my current salary - with the commission working against it. 

I believe it could radically shift my income, lifestyle, etc., but ultimately it could really improve life for my family. But some insurance would sure be nice. 

So I guess I‚Äôm not asking what you would do, I think it‚Äôs clear what I want to pursue. Apparently my question is, what do you think the best approach is to keeping my current position while pursuing this opportunity?

I stayed thinking I‚Äôll do the work that‚Äôs given to me and continue on with up-skill myself. 9 months in the project is almost stopped and I have no work to do, they are not letting me go yet but I don‚Äôt know when they‚Äôll ask me to leave. I don‚Äôt like the feeling of sitting and not doing any work for the company. 
And now I feel like I‚Äôve wasted 9 months without doing anything useful and didn‚Äôt do anything that‚Äôll help me for my future.

Please help on what next step should I take quit even if I don‚Äôt have any offer in hand or should I stay it out till the end and continue up-skill?


TL;DR: I am a contractual employee with no work for me at the company, I‚Äôm taking courses to upskill but not sure to stay till they ask me to leave or quit.

P.S: I have been trying my best to land a job but I‚Äôm not getting any revert from the recruiters.",BuzziliciousCupcake,1,1.0,0,1724991135,2024-08-30 04:12:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f4mc4e/dont_know_if_i_should_quit_or_stay_at_my_job/,8,2024
1f4magi,Is this really how the corporate world is? ,"Can we talk about adjusting to a first job fresh out of college? Corporate specifically. I feel like no one talks about this (that I know of). If I sound spoiled and bratty, I‚Äôm sorry in advance. But so far‚Ä¶it‚Äôs been tough. I feel so lost. I feel like the team I‚Äôm on either couldn‚Äôt care less that I exist, or they just simply don‚Äôt like me.¬†

If you look at my recent posts, I‚Äôm a part of a 2 year rotational program where I get to try out different teams, and by the end of the program it should be clear where I fit in best. Not many companies have this opportunity and I‚Äôm very grateful for it. It‚Äôs basically getting paid to learn, but of course I‚Äôm still contributing to the team like any other member.¬†

So far, the first team I‚Äôm on is tense. The people themselves are very grim and serious and weren‚Äôt too friendly to begin with. They didn‚Äôt come off *mean* per say, but almost like I‚Äôm a burden being added to their team. I‚Äôm the new guy who doesn‚Äôt know anything.¬†

On top of all this, I wouldn‚Äôt say that my performance is bad, but it‚Äôs not the best either. This is coming from the feedback I‚Äôve been given so far. My first month and a half, I got nothing but negative feedback, and it was coming from one particular team member who seems like she has a stick up her bum honestly. I finally started to receive some vague, positive feedback very recently because I had to adapt to the way they do things. Most of the negative feedback comes from being thrown into a task I‚Äôve never done before, then I‚Äôm expected to know what to do with surface level exposure, and oh‚Ä¶GOD FORBID I have questions, that‚Äôs a problem. This is all interpreted as a ‚Äúlack of understanding‚Äù and ‚Äúslow progress‚Äù rather than realizing that I‚Äôm getting horrible training. I am literally terrified to ask anyone questions if I don‚Äôt know something. This is because to the members on this team, I‚Äôm not putting in the effort to figure it out on my own and I‚Äôm not bright enough to do so. However, this isn‚Äôt the case, in my opinion.¬†

I was given vague instructions to do my own homework on how the business operates, and soon enough I should be familiar with the way things run. The problem was that I had no direction. It was just, ‚Äútake some time to look at some documentation, and by a few weeks you should be familiar with the way things run around here‚Äù. But who am I to sit there and complain at my first ever job, right? I‚Äôm not asking anyone to hold my hand, but to someone who has never worked with certain softwares and that‚Äôs not familiar with the business in general, it‚Äôs very frustrating. I sat there, and took their negative feedback like a punch in the gut. I‚Äôve never felt so clueless and lost in my life. The problem is that my manager takes the team's word over mine, so in his eyes he thinks they are giving me the tools to learn, when in reality I either have to sink or swim.¬†

I‚Äôve spoken up to one of the members that I feel doesn‚Äôt like me, because I basically told her that her feedback wasn‚Äôt fair considering her training is dog crap. She‚Äôs one of those people that has been in the industry so long that it‚Äôs difficult for her to explain things at a low level. I think that ever since I spoke up to her (in a professional way), she began to resent me, especially since I made it clear to my manager that I feel tension from her. I had no choice because I felt like I was being cornered.¬†

Through all this, I felt like I was idle. I wasn‚Äôt being given tasks and included in any projects. I was getting worried because I didn‚Äôt want my manager to think I‚Äôm sitting there doing nothing. When I started to bother them for things to do, I think it made things worse because they just simply don‚Äôt care to work with someone who has to start from zero. I‚Äôm really trying to remain optimistic here, but at this point I feel like everyone thinks I‚Äôm worthless and have no potential. I hate talking to my manager because it almost sounds like he‚Äôs disappointed in me. The last thing I want is for him to regret hiring me. I have a month left on this team, I hope the rest of the company isn‚Äôt like this. Am I being over dramatic, or is this just what the corporate world is?¬†



Also, please give me advice other than looking for a new job. Thanks.

1f4jjcq,Thoughts?,"I have been at my job for almost 5 years now. I get paid for 30 hours a week. Boss has never tracked my time or anything and honestly some weeks I have worked more than 30 hours when needed but never got paid for it. I felt I was being treated fairly because he always paid me when I went on vacations, out sick, or out for the day for a doctor appt or whatever. Of course, this was not a weekly thing but I took time when needed. Boss is hardly ever around so I am the one making sure things are running properly as I am the manager. I have always gotten things done and answered my phone when people called me if I was not on site/at home during my hours. Never had an issue until now. He now wants to track me with an app on my phone to track my hours and where I am at since I have multiple locations I go to and manage and keep up. He expects me to be available for calls/texts but wants me to clock in and clock out on the app when I answer these calls.  He has added 2 more locations which adds roughly 45 more people he rents to as well. He has also added a person to the mix and was told since the number of employees have doubled he needs a way to track our hours. Literally has 2 employees instead of 1 now. He has found ways to also maneuver around not discussing more compensation for my added responsibilities. 



I took this job due to the flexibility and not having someone constantly looking over my shoulder because I tend to work much better without that little parrot on my shoulder constantly. But he is changing things up so much which makes me feel like he doesn't trust me when I have done nothing to make him not trust me.

At my current job I‚Äôll be making a gross pay of $6895 a month. That‚Äôs almost 83k a year.

My new job said they can top that. The man said I‚Äôd start out at $33.42 an hour. From 7-11 I‚Äôd be making 36.17 an hour. From 11-5 I‚Äôd be making 38.42 an hour. Then he said I will get a 25k sign on bonus which would put my at $42 an hour.

I did the math and it would only be $42 an hour if I was being paid 38.42 the whole night shift. And the $42 an hour would only last three years because my bonus would be dispersed by then. So in the long run I‚Äôll be making way less?

1f4iiqp,What should I do next?,"Bit of backstory: I graduated with a bachelor's in Geography, minor in Geographic Information Systems in 2016. I pretty much coasted through university, couldn't find a job out of college and moved back home. Ended up working retail for a few years and in 2019 found a sales position at a travel company. I assumed it would be a stopgap until I could find the next thing but I turned out to be pretty good at it and have been working there ever since. I no longer do sales, and have been promoted to a more behind the scenes position supporting the sales staff since 2021. 

Since then, I've kind of just coasted in my role with my company being 100% remote since 2020. While my work-life balance is fantastic, I'm turning 31 and live in an expensive part of Orange County and make only $56,000/year. My wife works and makes around $70,000/year so we somehow make it work. I wouldn't say we're struggling but we do need to be frugal and have adjusted our lifestyles accordingly. We have no debt. Increasing my income to match hers or even getting to $80,000 would be great but I'm just not sure where to start or what path to take. 

Searching on LinkedIn, anything that I would remotely qualify for with my current skillset has 100+ applicants. I'm thinking of taking some courses to get my GIS certification but would be back in the same spot I was in 2016. I'm not against this path and would certainly be a much better student than I was back then but if I'm going to take classes, I'm also open to other skills that might have better job prospects and earning potential.

1f4iaan,Should I quit before I'm fired?,"Hello everyone. I am looking for a little advice... I am 23, and I got my first big girl job in back in November of last year.  It's at a credit union, and I'm a teller - part time tho, but i average 30+ hours.  I'm a very shy person, and I'm also rather short... plpeople think im like 16 years old, which I'm starting to think that's why I was hired. To be a pet of sorts. She has been acting like I'm her favorite in front of my coworkers, but is constantly picking on me in private. She is pregnant, so I'm trying to keep that in mind that she may not be feeling the greatest everyday. But the problem is, she will tell me to do one thing (usually against policy), and then if I do what she says, I get in trouble.  For example, on my first day she told me that the company culture is all about employees first, and that if I ever felt even the slightest bit unwell to simply call in and it wouldn't be a problem (I shared with her that I suffer from painful menstrual cycles and frequent migraines). I was wary of that since I knew that I was in my 90 day probationary period. Well, I ended up getting a bad eye infection, and I told her about it. She said no problem, just stay home. 

It is also important to note that I don't have my own car yet, so I rely on my mom to drive me, or I drive myself if she doesn't need the car. My boss knows that as well. 

I was supposed to have a week of online training, and then shadow for 1 to 2 months. My training was never completed, and I only got to shadow for 2 weeks before I was given my own drawer and expected to work off of it. About a month after I got my drawer, I was working an entire drive thru with 4 lanes alone for hours. So one day, a woman came to the drive thru and cashed a fake check. At that point, no one had taught me the steps involved in documenting the check and member. Needless to say, I got in trouble.  One of my coworkers had cashed a fraud check for the same woman, and was actually fired. He had been there for almost 4 years (another show of favoritism) I was put on a final warning for a year. My manager told me privately how she had saved my job because of how much she liked me, but it's been downhill from there. She has been holding that over my head and saying that I need to remember how she saved me from being fired. She will praise me in front of people and then tear me down in private. 

Also, I am responsible for meeting a sales quota every month, and I haven't been able to meet it. We have a membership base that consists mostly of elderly people, and I am supposed to shove products down there throat even when I know it isn't good for them. I just can't do that when I know that it would do them more harm than good. 

I am regularly called in short notice and expected to answer my phone at all hours. I always do my best to be there. On days that I am scheduled to get off before closing, I am made to stay hours past my scheduled off time and I get in trouble if I don't.

Long story short, I was called in the office today and told that if I don't stop calling in sick (I have called in a few times this month because of migraines due to the stress I'm under. But I have the sick time and I always let her know the night before if I have a migraine. She asked for 2 hours notice and I always exceed that) and don't reach my sales goals I have 30 days before I'm let go. I just don't know what to do at this point. I'm wondering if I should just quit before I'm fired? Or am I just over reacting? I am so confused, and so stressed. I thought about reaching out to the regional manager, or HR, but she said that they are involved in the decision to put me on the 30 day notice.

So 6 months ago a VP I previously worked with reached out with an opportunity at this company she works at.

1f4hhra,What Do I Change My Major to,"So I am going into my junior year, currently with a supply chain & operations management major. I have always had mixed thoughts on the major, and to be honest something in my gut has always made me feel like this isn't my path. I took a supply chain internship with a F500 company at their main DC that managed the majority of their supply chain this summer, basically as a well this will give me good experience in the field and tell me if I want to continue pursuing supply chain or not.

After having now completed the internship, I can say I completely hated it. I hated the location, I hated being in a warehouse (I never want to be in a warehouse again), and to be honest the whole time I just had this overwhelming feeling that I can do more than this and am meant for more than this. I found everything to be so boring, to lack an ounce of creativity and actual challenge. I found out I hate logistics--I know supply chain is a very diverse field, but so much of it is in logistics and I just don't want to be around that ever again. I also hate how supply chain, while being diverse, is so niche that if you choose to pursue it, you're always stuck in supply chain somewhere. The skills just are not that transferable.

The one thing I did like was being given a business problem and being expected to find a solution. Although I did not like my project in reverse logistics, I liked this because it felt like I was making an active impact on the business. 

In high school, a lot of my interest was in law and film (a weird combo I know). I really considered the prelaw path (and still consider eventually pursuing law school), and my parents pushed me from the film path (really wanted to pursue media production, a lot of times I wish I had). I took a gap year, worked retail and discovered a passion for business so I ended up pursuing that. I didn't really know what sector of business, but I knew i had a passion for product/fashion so supply chain made sense because you are dealing so much with the product (or so I thought). But then I actually did an internship in it and hated it.

So now here I am, starting junior year with no clue of what to do. Sometimes I question if I should pursue marketing, because I love brand management concepts (took a class in it last semester) and I think it relates a lot back to original interest with media and film. I also have interest in finance, mainly due to high pay, it being a more glamorous field (especially compared to supply chain), and I feel you have more of a direct impact on the company and can go so many routes in finance and pivot careers. I also have interest in double majoring with information systems, because although I wouldn't want to work coding all day or implementing software, I think it is a great skillset to have in today's age.

So, looking for some help and guidance. Do I drop the supply chain major and go for something else, or should I just stick it out? I feel like I want/NEED to change, but I am unsure of what and am scared of hating something else. I have always had a lot of interesting in consulting because I love the intricacies of how businesses work and the idea of helping companies with certain projects excites me. But then again, I know it is very competitive and I wonder if I am at a disadvantage now that my one internship was a supply chain internship (but it was kind of like consulting in terms of my project? plus I got a ton of data analytics and research skills from it)

1f4g6bt,Employer is trying to force me and other salaried employees to work weekends. Need Advice. ,"I work in fundraising at a museum. My work hours were explained to me to be Monday - Friday and occasional weekends for fundraising engagements. I specifically clarified this during my interview. I have been at this company for nearly a year now. There are coordinators, managers, directors and VPs. When we're open to the public, we have Managers on Duty (MOD). The MODs used to just be directors. Then they trained managers to be MOD during the week to help out when needed. As a few weeks ago, my supervisor (a director) told me to not sign up for weekend shifts because directors and VPs are supposed to cover those. We were emailed a schedule of days that needed coverage and some of them were weekends. No one signed up for weekend of course. Now, the managers are all being required to work 5 weekends a year. No incentive, no extra pay. In addition, my position was told today that I would be supervising a new employee (a development specialist). No increase in salary. When I originally interviewed for this job, my senior dog was very ill. I needed flexibility to take her to appointments. They told me that would be no problem during my interview. Today when I met with my supervisor about this, she said ""we have been very flexible with you over this last year. you need to be a team player."" The flexibility was not contingent upon me working on weekends like they told me I would only do for things specifically related to my job. They are treating this like we work in retail and can do whatever. This is so crazy to me and I'm extremely upset. I'm looking for similar stories from others and how you handled it. I'm in the process of looking for another job, too.

1f4fvpe,Looking for a new career after 20 years in film production. What path would be a good fit?,"Hi all, thanks in advance for any advice. I‚Äôve been a working cinematographer for 15-20 years mostly filming feature documentaries and commercials in the same style. I‚Äôve finally reached the point where the sacrifices required to maintain my career are no longer viable. Primarily because I want to be in my daughters‚Äô lives, but also because I have some significant back issues that are made much worse by shouldering a camera for 12 hours a day.

I‚Äôve been trying to understand what‚Äôs possible for me, I started film before going to college and I got a BA in film studies, but I was so set on my path that I never even explored what was out there and now feel very ignorant about careers outside film.

My role as a cinematographer is somewhat analogous to being a designer, I think. I translated the story and director‚Äôs perspective into visual language using my own taste and technical knowledge. I regularly lead teams of 2-10 people and interfaced with other leads as well producers and clients who sometimes had different agendas then the director I was collaborating with. In verite documentary that all happens in real time as the story is unfolding in front of you so it requires a lot of presences of mind and improvisation.

I‚Äôve also always been a tinkerer, and would often build rig when I couldn‚Äôt find a product that would suit the production‚Äôs needs.

I‚Äôll be 45 this year, I‚Äôm open to going back to school if that makes the more sense. I‚Äôm hoping to find something that suits my talents as a creative and my soft skills as a collaborator, but where I can realistically expect to be making over 100k within 5 years or so, if that is possible.

I currently work at Kroger. I do overnight stock. I moved to this position because of the money and hours it offers- 40 hours and week, $18 an hour. This overnight shift is killing my ability to do anything though. I've gotten quite depressed over thease last two months and haven't been able to find the energy or ablitiy to schedule to hangout with freinds or go out to music venues (my favorite pass time). 

The money is very important to me, as I'm trying to move out in the next 6 to 8 months with my lovey boyfriend and two of our freinds. 

It's impossible where I live to find a postion thats full time and pays well. Although I do worry that maybe I'm not thinking outside the box enough. I have plans to attend college after moving out. My first priority is to move though as I can't thrive in my living and family situation (long story, as is for most people haha. Toxic environment, puts too much of a strain on me to live here for the next 4 years while I attend school)


There is this new place that is opening though, called huey magoos. Very simular to Canes or Chikfalay. I attended an interview earlier today with them, orgianlly hoping for a management postion as it'd pay and I have a lot of fast food experience. 

They offered me a front of house postion instead, starting at $14 an hour full time. The interviewer expressed that with the chain being so new, there will be opportunities to move up after gaining general experience in the store. As well, they'll be opening a store in the town I want to move to around the time I plan to move. 

I guess this is a question of where my morals lie, although I would like to hear your guy's take. Do I want to keep grinding it out and not having much of a life outside of work for the extra money while I'm young and I can, or do I move to this position to get off of days in hopes that I get the opportunity to move up?

However, I feel a bit miserable here, and I also have to travel 2 hours to get to the office. I want to study and learn more to be able to perform better at least, but after so much traveling and f*ckups at work sometimes I‚Äôm just too tired to want to do anything else.

I accepted the job position and signed the contract because I really need a job asap out of uni to start saving properly, but I‚Äôm in a constant ‚Äúfear/anxiety mode‚Äù of f‚Äôn up often; and really don‚Äôt like the 40-year corporate world lifestyle.

Anyone has any experiences in the workforce and/or life that would like to share?

1f4bvbg,Looking for feedback and advice,"Hey guys, looking for some advice and pointers.

So to start off, I was not rich. I grew up fairly poor to be honest, as my family started their business when I was just a little boy.

However, family business grew as I grew older and was able to attend top private schools and even went to a reputable university abroad. The wealth we gained was gradual and it was not long ago I was living in a small 2 bedroom apartment which we didn't even have a bed, slept on the mattress. 

Anyways I was working abroad, secured a job in the country I went to university in when my parents told me to return home. After much consideration, I did as it's been over 5 years since I visited home.

So I left my job, and returned home. Luckily, or unluckily this was the end of 2019 and COVID-19 happened. So it was lucky for me.

I helped me family business in the meantime and did freelancing to get some income. Income was barely survivable.

However, what was unexpected was this. Although I believe my support was only emotional, due to some good decisions, my family biz grew during COVID when everyone else was struggling, to just under 9-figures (USD) in revenue.  

We own 3 houses now and yeah basically things financially have been better after decades of struggle. I thought it was time for me to leave the nest and make my own income (i'm 28) So I started looking for jobs now in the local area, been applying for 1-2 years now.

Man, the job market has been terrible. I just can't for the love of the life find a job. Recruiters just look at my experience which has been mainly family biz and a few side projects here and there from my freelancing gigs as ""not real job experience."" I've been looking for a software engineering role lately, as the field of study was computer science, nothing. 

My experience though professionally has been in business development, sales and marketing as this was what was needed of me in the past few years. But it has been my dream to work with computers and I'm a huge nerd unlike my family who are business people.

I'm thinking of taking a coding bootcamp and sharpening my skills. But it's been 1-2 years of this airplane mode of getting nothing, pretty discouraging. 

I don't know, did I regret leaving my first job I had to support my family.. perhaps I did. If I stayed probably career wise I would've been ahead but maybe perhaps my family biz wouldn't have grown at the rate it did.

It was a tradeoff. But now pretty much I'm still at the same position of a fresh grad from uni without a job.

Perspective needed. Thanks.",MetalTerrible1155,1,1.0,0,1724961460,2024-08-29 19:57:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f4bvbg/looking_for_feedback_and_advice/,8,2024

I currently work in a helpdesk role at a small to medium-sized business. Recently, I noticed a job posting on Indeed for a Client Account Manager position within the same company. However, the company hasn‚Äôt offered the role internally, and I‚Äôm unsure how to approach this. As the sales side of IT is something I would like to progress into.

Should I apply directly through Indeed as if I were an external candidate, or would it be better to reach out to the Operations Manager directly? 

One thing that's giving me pause is that the department‚Äôs manager has a bad reputation‚Äî the last person in this role left due to a lack of support and guidance from them.

Any advice on the best approach here would be greatly appreciated!

1f49fou,Should I leave my job due to my supervisor‚Äôs hostile demeanor and mood swings?,"I just need some outside perspective. Please let me know if I‚Äôm overthinking this. 

Long story short, my direct supervisor has made me feel like staying with my company is not tenable anymore. I‚Äôve worked for her for a few years. She‚Äôs always been very moody, often going from effusively outgoing and jovial one day to resentful, sullen and argumentative the next. I‚Äôve heard her make off-color comments out of anger and she often badmouths her other direct reports, so I assume she does the same with me behind my back. 

She has said many rude things to me in the past when she was a coworker (before she was promoted to supervisor), which I‚Äôve brushed off. That behavior has continued somewhat after her promotion but she seemed to be dialing it back a bit for a while. However, I think my final straw was the other day when she heard me speaking with a coworker about the temperature of the office. Basically the other coworker was saying how warm it was in his office and I said I‚Äôd trade him because I‚Äôm always cold. That was it. 

That‚Äôs when my direct supervisor interrupted our conversation and told me that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre free to leave (the company) anytime I want.‚Äù

I was so taken aback. At first I thought it was a poor attempt at a joke (after all, who would suggest one should quit over such a trivial matter?) but it quickly occurred to me that she was serious when I looked at her face and could tell she was visibly upset. 

I know she deals with some health issues and I believe she has other stress factors in her life that could explain her demeanor, so I have tried to give her as much benefit-of-a-doubt and grace as possible and overlook a lot of her behavior but I think I‚Äôve reached my limit this time. 

So for the first time in my many years with this company, I just submitted my first two resumes for jobs elsewhere. Hope I‚Äôm not overreacting. I‚Äôd love to hear some feedback because I really don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing the right thing.

1f46jal,Seeking Advice on Internal Job Application: Helpdesk to Client Account Manager,"Hi Reddit,

I currently work in a helpdesk role at a small to medium-sized business. Recently, I noticed a job posting on Indeed for a Client Account Manager position within the same company. However, the company hasn‚Äôt offered the role internally, and I‚Äôm unsure how to approach this.

Should I apply directly through Indeed as if I were an external candidate, or would it be better to reach out to the Operations Manager directly? As the sales side of IT is something I would like to progress into. 

One thing that's giving me pause is that the department‚Äôs manager has a bad reputation‚Äî the last person in this role left due to a lack of support and guidance from them. 

Any advice on the best approach here would be greatly appreciated!

1f462gh,Which job would you take? 62k salary or 80k?,"
I (M27) am in the process of potentially getting a new job and am looking to compare my options. Which do you think is better.

Current employer: 4.5 years employed, 62k salary, usually get around 2k in annual bonus. Company has an ESOP and my shares are currently worth 18k, my vested amount is 15k. Fully vested at 5 years. Usually get at least $3k worth of new shares every year. My ESOP shares are projected to be worth around $400k by 2036. Not sure if that means anything though because I‚Äôm assuming share price can change. 401k match is 4%. The other major benefit is I get 100% of family health insurance premiums paid for. Company also contributes $1200 to HSA. This current employer also literally announces just yesterday that starting in 2025 they will offer 3 weeks of paid paternal leave and also get rid of a policy that says you must work at least 4 hours during every weekday in order to not use PTO. So a lot of people currently get there hours in and are out at noon on Friday. But with this new policy you could technically have a 4 day work week as long as you work 40 hours. I should also add that I‚Äôm not really enjoying this job much anymore or some of the people. Feeling burnt out here.

Potential new Employer: Starting salary is 80k but with my experience I could see 85-90k as an easy possibility. Not sure if there is a bonus program. Company has a pension plan where the employer contributes 14% of salary annually. Fully vested after 3 years. Not sure what the pension benefit formula is. 401k match is 2%. Health insurance premiums for entire family would be $380 per month. Company also contributes $3,800 to HSA regardless of what I put in. 

Both jobs have good work life balance and the team I would be working with is roughly the same size. Both are about the same 12 min commute to work.

Which would you pick?

I'm writing this because I don't really know what to do anymore.

I'm 30 and I have a few issues mainly being massively overweight and amongst other things.

My Job tho I just feel exhausted.

I've been at my place of work for say about 8 years and for like 5 years I was full-time.. then my bottle crashed one day and went to part time.. honestly I think it's one of the worst choices I've ever made...but one I needed to make in order to keep a stream of income.

I was recently placed back into the office. And honestly it's just been the worst... about 10 days ago I suffered a minor concussion. Then yesterday I bashed my knee in a fall on the way to work.

I haven't been told of any sort of failing standards but I just feel like they are sitting waiting in the wings for that particular moment.

Everything just frustrates me now the simplest annoyance from a customer is driving me mad.

Work even pulled a fast one on me changed my shift and didn't inform me of the change.

I was two hours late because of them, then I took AL knowing full and well that I didn't have any left to take.

I'm so scunnered I feel like this is the end for me.

1f42toc,Should I open up to my boss about my struggle with mental health?,"Hello everyone, I (F24) been working in the IT department of a multinational company for about four years now. Currently, I am part of a rotational program where I switch IT roles every five months, and I am currently in my second year of the program. For the first two years, I worked in the office as a regular employee before joining the rotational program. However, for the past two years, I have been working from home. Although it can get lonely, it is much easier than dealing with a two-hour daily commute. I have to wake up at 4am and leave the house by 6am just to make it to work on time.

The past year has been extremely challenging for me as I have been going through severe depression. I have been attending therapy sessions every week and have incorporated various self-care practices into my routine such as eating healthy, yoga, walking, lifting weights, and meditation. While these habits have helped me feel better physically, mentally I am exhausted and lack motivation. I have been experiencing dark thoughts and have been drinking alcohol more frequently, which has raised concerns among those close to me. I wake up feeling miserable and angry, and I've unintentionally damaged relationships with people I deeply care about. I can feel myself losing hope and fear that I may make a regrettable decision soon. My therapist has suggested that I attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, but my busy work schedule and commitment to maintaining my self-care habits have made it difficult to find time. I promised my therapist that I would quit drinking, but the depression persists regardless of how many positive habits I adopt. The temptation to go to the nearest bar and have a drink is strong.

In my new role, things have been extremely slow. I haven't heard from the person who is supposed to train me in weeks. When I go into the office, I find myself sitting alone with nothing to do. I feel guilty. Most of my IT colleagues work from home, and there is only one other woman near my cubicle among the twelve. I have offered to take on extra work, but no one seems to have anything for me or any time to spare. My boss suggested that I start going back to the office because of my age and the need for in-person human interaction, but the commute is dreadful, and there is hardly anyone in the office. I usually get home at 7PM, work out, take a shower, and then prepare for the next day, which I dread.

For the past few weeks, I've been experiencing sleepwalking and waking up in the middle of the night with intense feelings of fear and anxiety. I've never sleepwalked before. It has been challenging for me to fall asleep, as I spend hours trying to do so. Despite my efforts to meditate before bed and reduce my caffeine intake, I struggle to quiet my racing thoughts.

I have considered moving closer to the office, but the rent in that area is exorbitant, and I am trying to save money for a future move out of state. I would like to open up to my boss about my personal struggles because she is a great person, but I am terrified of rejection and invalidation. I despise feeling powerless and fear the consequences of sharing my situation. I am not sure what to do or say, and I would appreciate any thoughts or advice from anyone who has faced similar experiences.",Glittering_Set_4591,4,0.8399999737739563,29,1724939143,2024-08-29 13:45:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f42toc/should_i_open_up_to_my_boss_about_my_struggle/,8,2024

I‚Äôve recently been offered a position as a Manager Product Development at a leading solar tracker firm ( specializing in solar tracking systems. They design and manufacture advanced solar trackers, which are devices that allow solar panels to follow the movement of the sun across the sky).

Initially, I interviewed for an R&D role more aligned with my background as a structural engineer. For context, I have an undergraduate degree in civil engineering, a master‚Äôs in structural engineering, and about 5 years of experience in the field, mainly working on buildings, bridges, and steel structures design projects. 

I eventually noticed there wasn't much financial growth in structural engineering, which led me to explore other opportunities. This product development role was offered based on my problem-solving skills and some ability to write code.

I‚Äôve always been quite good at structural engineering, but now I‚Äôm stepping into a new area, and I‚Äôm wondering if I have the skills to succeed long-term in product development, which is exciting but also a little nerve-wracking.  What are the future prospects in this field? How can I make sure I don‚Äôt miss out on new opportunities, as I feel I may have done by sticking with structural engineering for so long?

This year I got a 6% raise, not the best but still.

They were both hired last year, one was a year and two months ago the other not even a year. With my 7% total raises, I only make 1500$ more than them.

1f41fgk,"Three Options, Which Would You Choose And Why?","I‚Äôll try to keep this simple:

Option 1: Stay at current job. 137.5K USD office job with higher performance incentives, but environment has not been conducive to achieving them. Small company (12-15 people).Boss is someone who gave me my first real shot in the industry 15 years ago, but doesn‚Äôt seem to respect me. Overheard him call me ‚Äúshitty‚Äù at my job even though I was responsible for 20% of the profits that year. High demands for ‚Äúface time‚Äù in the office (60+ hour weeks). Flat hierarchy with owners being the only people I report to, but who also have zero people skills. Hugely successful in the industry but somewhat clueless about managing people. When we disagree, more often than not (70% of the time) I am right and it could have made all the difference in my performance pay. Also recently hired a family friend and the environment feels like nepotism (to nearly everyone in the company). Not really any advancement opportunity but with a young family I‚Äôm not sure I care to have more responsibility.

Option 2: Remote job with coworker who left (partially due to nepotism mentioned above). 150K USD with slightly lower performance incentives. Professional environment at a larger company (150+ people). Less demanding time commitment with more freedom to step away for a run or go to the gym. There will still be weeks where 50-60+ hours occur, but at least when things are slow it‚Äôs acceptable to pursue hobbies and passions. Also not a lot of advancement opportunity due to remote nature (could be wrong, here) and flat hierarchy. Report to one person who is tasked with people leadership. Won‚Äôt be fully ‚Äúalone‚Äù as an open chat and zoom will be available during the days.

Option 3: Spearhead the establishment of North American operations for a European firm looking to expand. Pay not yet known, but will be at least 150K USD to start with a profit sharing / equity arrangement. Would be effectively a senior partner and salary would eventually rise to 250K and potentially much higher in the future should the expansion be a success. I have built out a couple other expansions in the past that I exited due to trust issues with other stakeholders, and they were lucrative but extremely demanding of my time.

I have a young child and a baby on the way. Early 40s in a high cost of living centre. Wife works but mostly non profits where she only earns $40K USD per year. I am struggling to decide if I should go for option 3 and hope that I‚Äôll manage my time effectively enough that I won‚Äôt miss out on my family. Option 2 is attractive due to the flexibility and freedom and less responsibility which I expect to mean more precious time with family. Option 2 may also open a door for moving to a lower cost of living area, but we are near great schools and hospitals (my child has special requirements that mean semi-annual trips to the hospital).

So just to start - THIS HAS NEVER HAPPEND TO ME and this is just purely a fear that is embedded in me.

Bit of backstory: I'm a qualified mental health nurse - I now no longer practice nursing and am travelling and tryna 'find myself' and what I want as a career (absolutely not nursing!)I'm 25 F FYI:)

I LOVE helping people and have recently learnt I get the same satisfaction with ANY kind of help (it doesn't need to be something as extreame as helping someone in mental distress!). So you'd think that has opened up by mind to the variety of potential job prospects however I have developed this absolute fear (verging on somesort of anxiety disorder) of being in any type of situation/job where i have responsibility over someone else(or several people) -> them dying -> me getting in trouble/really struggling mentally.

I'm very much a people person and I feel like I'd get alot out of working with people, even if it's not in a caring role but even when I look and deep dive into any kinda job I kinda think 'ohh what if I can't do this jobs because of this fear'.

For example tonight I started looking into volunteer coordination roles and I was getting all excited and looking into different routes into the role and then I thought 'oh no, what if one of the volunteers dies and then blah blah blah'. 

So yeah basically I'm tryna thing of different jobs/a career field I could look into that could potentially fit me given my detailed fears.

1f3ugr7,"Stay in college or temporarily work full time?
","Hey all - I‚Äôve never browsed this subreddit and am on mobile rn so idk any meta or formatting, apologies in advance. Context starts when I finished high school back during 2020 and I decided to take a couple of gap years due to Covid and not really having anything I particularly wanted to pursue in. Fast forward by 3 years, I‚Äôve was working for 2 of them at a casino as a dealer. Extremely good paying entry level job (\~45/hr) that took <6 months to get multiple certificates in dealing multiple games. While working this tipped job for those years I did eventually of course become loathsome of it. It‚Äôs extremely repetitive mind numbing work, forces shifts on weekends/holidays and those shifts are late (9pm-5am). Some existential crises later stacked upon self reflection, i decide to leave this field because of two main reasons. 1. I never attended college and have the means to. 2. There‚Äôs no scalability with the casino career, the tips you make as a dealer are so great that it completely outweighs what money you‚Äôll make when you‚Äôre eventually promoted to a supervisor(\~25/hr).

Right now I‚Äôm enrolled in university and studying Computing & Informatics which has multiple subgroups I could specialize like sys admin, cyber security or the likes. But it‚Äôs almost a given that I would end up in general IT as my first job which is where the problem arises. I‚Äôm honestly not as well fleshed out into how this job market is considering this is my major. But after speaking to multiple people like my boss and other colleagues, computer jobs in general are in a heavy downward spiral. IT help desk jobs on Indeed are dropping heavily in percentage, coding is dead (for the most part). But there is a saving grace. Multiple people told me if I sought to get into General IT, you don‚Äôt need a degree. Most people have mentioned to me of online certificates given by CompTIA. These certs like A+ Net+ Sec+ should be enough to land a job and allow me to start the ladder to work towards a salaried job. The only thing is I see an opportunity, some may see it as a risk but I see it as an opportunity.

I had a job that made \~45/hr which equates to 75k gross, (32hr weeks). And my current housing is free (my parents) but obviously at a certain point I wanna move out, and honestly the sooner the better. I would ideally like to go back to my casino job and work full time for 3years\~ and essentially save 100% of all my paychecks. In those 3 years I would‚Äôve saved enough (plus my current savings) to pay for more than the entire mortgage of a home. During the 3rd year of work I‚Äôd be working on obtaining these Online certifications so once I‚Äôm financially secure to move out and purchase a home, at that point I‚Äôm ready to transition careers. I‚Äôd be able to afford an initial paycut from the 70k to 40-50k of an entry IT job, But I‚Äôll work on going up the ladder. While this sounds ideal there is something I‚Äôm concerned about. This fall semester will be only my second ever semester of college, and i would have to drop out to do this plan as I do not have the time otherwise.

Also maybe job placement will not be very easy with just the certs, but I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs doable. So my main question at the end of the day is, is it worth it to drop out to pursue this plan? The way I see is if I stay in college and pay tens of thousands in tuition for the entry level job I‚Äôll attain either way through certifications, then why not work full time instead and drop out?",Educational_Crow_749,1,1.0,0,1724908054,2024-08-29 05:07:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f3ugr7/stay_in_college_or_temporarily_work_full_time/,8,2024
1f3u07n,Looking for advice with offers and counter offers. ,"Basic info: I'm in the US, and an aerospace welder. No idea if this etiquette is different for white vs blue collar. 

In a bit of a pickle. Recently got a new job, came with a $5/hr raise and better benefits. Accepted the offer, turned in my two weeks, and was hit with a counter offer from my current employer. 

Currents' offer was a $7/hr raise, but they couldn't do much for benefits. Declined. Figured I'd be better off at the new place in the future, and could probably expect to be getting raises and getting that amount this time next year anyways, WITH the better benefits. 

The next day manager came back and asked what it would take to get me to stay. I said a $10/hr raise and a signed agreement for guaranteed cost of living adjustments every year. Honestly I figured they'd say no and I could move on to the new place no prob and no hard feelings. 

But now I'm scheduled in for a meeting first thing in the morning to discuss my offer with management. Oh boy. I have no idea if they're actually going to fully meet my offer, but they might get pretty damn close. 

I don't really know how this whole offer and counter offer thing works, and ain't no one else I know in any kind of work, let alone blue collar or welding, has ever had this problem. 

If I get that unicorn counter offer from my current work, would it be okay to email the new job and give them the opportunity to raise their own offer? How the fuck would I even phrase that? 

I'm really not interested in staying at my new job even if they do make that offer... But if they make that really good offer, it's gonna be a REALLY GOOD OFFER, and I'd kinda feel like an idiot turning that much down. 

I've got other issues working here other than pay, and I don't want to drive away the new place by asking them to increase their offer by too much when I'm so far along in the hiring process. I've already gotten paperwork! I'm supposed to get my drug test scheduled this week! Goddamnit! I'm suppoaed to start at the new place on the 9th next month!

Does anyone else have experience with this sort of fuckery? Any advice? Please?

1f3tnoq,Confused and has no direction ,"
I will post this here since I can‚Äôt open this to anyone. Please everyone be kind.

Hello! I am 20F currently studying environmental technology, but I‚Äôm really struggling to figure out my future career path. I don‚Äôt have any experience in the field except my courseworks, and I can‚Äôt seem to find anything that truly interests or motivates me. Right now, my main focus after graduating is to earn money, especially since I have a student loan to pay off, but I feel lost and stuck with no clear direction in life. Although I‚Äôm often told that it‚Äôs okay to take time to figure things out, the pressure from my student loan and helping my family is making me feel more anxious than ever. On top of that, I have a fear of social interaction, even though I‚Äôm usually good at communication and can express myself well. Despite this, I still hate interacting with others. I also feel inadequate because I don‚Äôt have many skills outside of basic household chores, and it makes me feel dumb. Each day feels worse, and I‚Äôm really struggling to find a way forward.

I was hired at this hotel almost last year and I was making good money and getting 40 hours a week. Now its not that good anymore. They cut hours from everybody employee. I have to pool tips with many others. The new hire makes me feel uncomfortable and tries to prove to management that she is doing the job better.
Then we have a new food and beverage director and is trying to find flaws in my section. I didn't give a good first impression and yeah. Now I have to worry about getting my hours more cut and even being replaced. (Happened in other workplaces)

1f3t370,Started a new job and my manager is a nightmare. Should I quit? ,"I was laid off a couple months back and I just started a new job and during my first month, my manager was not here. She worked from another country (I‚Äôm in the office everyday) and because of the time difference my entire time I‚Äôm at the office she‚Äôs pretty much asleep. I can reach her when I first get to the office or I can send her a message and she will respond after I leave. 

I wasn‚Äôt aware of this until after I started but tbh I felt kind of abandoned and didn‚Äôt have much direction. 

Fast forward to when she was supposed to come back, I get into the office and she‚Äôs not here again. She got sick and I heard from my coworkers that she‚Äôs not coming back yet. To me, I feel like she should have let me know that she wasn‚Äôt coming back yet since I find it quite weird to have to hear that through the grapevine. I never hear from her for the first couple days so I cancelled our meeting for the week since she also hasn‚Äôt accepted. She then messaged me and says she feels better and that she‚Äôs coming back tomorrow.

I go over to her office to introduce myself and she glares at me and says ‚ÄúSTAY AWAY FROM ME‚Äù. I was confused and was like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre still sick?‚Äù. She says she isn‚Äôt but just to be safe. That interaction was extremely weird to me but I guess I understand her reasoning. 

Throughout the rest of the week she does come by to talk to me and the way she talks to me is kind of rude. When she tells me something, she kind of barks her orders at me. I ask her questions because I‚Äôm new and am not sure how to go about a lot of things and she pretty much ignores me some times and when she does gives me feedback about my work, I‚Äôm get berated in front of everyone and a coworker had to come and check if I was okay. I was shaking and literally so upset. 

I then found out that two people in my position before was driven crazy by my manager and ended up quitting. On my first weeks, the director also set up a meeting me just to talk about the company but he said ‚Äúif I ever feel like I need to get out of here, I‚Äôd like to know before you get to the point of quitting‚Äù. When he first told me that I was surprised and now I‚Äôm starting to connect the dots. 

I‚Äôm thinking of setting up some time with the director to share my concerns and also possibly talking to my manager about her tone. The way she talks to me makes me uncomfortable. I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs a good idea? Tbh at this point I already want to quit but I feel like I should give them a chance. What should I do?

1f3szir,Negotiating a potential job offer at 6 months pregnant (and already disclosed)?,"I've just finished final interviews for a new corporate role, and got a good update from Recruiting/HR today - who noted a ""very positive"" position and asked about any additional incentive requests (I've already noted inline salary/bonus expectations, with no issue there). Feels like prep for an offer, but TBD.

I am 6 months pregnant (due mid-November), and both HR and the hiring manager have been aware of this from the start. Obviously, there are two challenges, if offered - A) I'll only be in-role maybe 2 months before delivering, and B) I won't qualify for FMLA.

* Is this the right point to start asking about/negotiating maternity leave details? I think yes (less awkward with HR than hiring manager?), but would appreciate any advice/thoughts here.
* I think I'd feel okay with taking like 10 weeks unpaid, as I'm on husband's insurance...but should I let HR make a proposal first before offering that, or is it better for me to proactively signal that willingness? I've been unemployed for a year now, so am nervous about pushing too hard. I've also considered 8 weeks, but that feels rather short.
* I also will have to negotiate an out-of-state relocation package (already broadly discussed), so I'm wary of pushing too much on multiple fronts. I'll have up to 12 months to relocate from start date, but I think I'll also need to get in writing their expectations for on-site travel frequency between my return from leave and time of relocation...for example, I won't want to be flying out-of-state 2 weeks a month with a new baby.",flashbang10,1,1.0,0,1724902794,2024-08-29 03:39:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f3szir/negotiating_a_potential_job_offer_at_6_months/,8,2024

1f3rjrm,how to feel less insecure about your job?,"Im a sixth form student and only recently managed to land my first part time job. When i tell you it took me absolutely forever to land this job, genuinely what felt like the most humiliating and humbling 8 or so months of my life. I know thats a bit dramatic but the point still stands, the constant rejection after rejection even when you know you are qualified but nobody is willing to give you a chance really destroys your mental health. All this stress about a part time job while i‚Äôm still in school seems a bit much i understand. However, i sort of resent everyone in my life who barely had to do anything to get their jobs, yes i have one now, but it took them maximum a month to land theirs and they basically make double what i make, more consistent hours (i‚Äôm on a zero hour contract) and just get to do more things with the money they earn. I love my job honestly but i can‚Äôt stop feeling so inadequate about it, and in some ways, angry, because why did i have to do such a crazy amount of work to land a minimum wage job on zero hours contract where i would have to work very hard (my job involves running around and working with kids) to earn only half of what my friends make in retail? 

And before anyone asks why i didn‚Äôt just apply to retail i promise i did, i got hundreds of rejections, i have been stood up by employers when i was meant to have an interview and rejected by hundreds. 

I don‚Äôt even feel like its my place to engage in work related conversations, i dont even make nearly as much as my friends do, nor do i get given regular hours like they do, i just feel like an imposter, and i feel somewhat pathetic because of the amount of blood sweat and tears that went into finding a job that is so much less than theirs.

Again, i do love my job, the people are great and honestly i am excited to go to work, however i just can‚Äôt get over this feeling that i am falling behind and desperately trying to keep up in a race i barely qualify for. I had plans on saving my money when i got a job and funding a few small things for myself but i am embarrassed to say i barely make enough to do that, i still find myself asking my parents for money (to reiterate, i am still in school so i haven‚Äôt started uni yet) for the dumbest things when i was meant to be able to buy these things for myself. I look at my friends making my monthly earnings in about one/two weeks and being able to save a good chunk of their money while still being able to buy themselves nice things and feel like complete shit about myself. I am very good at my job, ive been praised by so many people and my training period ended over a month early due to my performance and i am incredibly proud of myself for that yet i still feel inferior because i‚Äôm not earning nearly as much as everyone around me. I am saving whatever i earn, its not much but its more than i had a few months ago, but how do i stop feeling like a total loser ",Beneficial_Bowl_4871,1,1.0,0,1724898321,2024-08-29 02:25:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f3rjrm/how_to_feel_less_insecure_about_your_job/,8,2024

1f3pxoy,Private vs. Public  - Civil Engineer,"I‚Äôm currently in my late twenties (single without children) working as a civil engineer for the public sector. I previously worked privately after I finished college. I enjoyed working in the private sector - the projects, the learning/growth opportunities, having a young, supportive, motivating and energetic team, and I enjoyed my role. At times, it was stressful with long¬†evenings, but that comes with the territory.¬†

I made my transition to public about 3 years ago since the opportunity was much closer to home, the pay was better and for a better work/life balance. I immediately wasn‚Äôt a fan of the public side, but I wanted to give it a fair shot! The reasons as to why I didn‚Äôt like it (and still don‚Äôt) was because it was dysfunctional, the lack of professionalism amongst my colleagues, the unsteady work pace, no team mentality and no drive/motivation to get things done‚Ä¶ but above all, I was an unnecessary hire being underutilized given very little to do. The majority of the office is in their 50s/60s, counting down to retirement, counting down the hours to lunch, and speak to me as if I am their child. It seems others in different departments or in different civil disciplines are seemingly busy, but cannot understand why I am not. When I had a direct manager, he would accomplish the majority of the tasks and I would sit there with nothing to do. I always offered my help and asked to be included in more projects with little change. I mentioned this problem to upper management as well to no avail. In turn, I made the most of my down time to study for my professional engineering exam (PE) and can happily say I passed!¬†

Now that my manager retired, I passed, I'm still seeing that work is the same as it was 3 years ago when I joined. I don‚Äôt have the responsibilities I wish I had at work. I often have a ridiculous amount of free time and feel like my brain is going to mush. It is very unfulfilling and I feel useless especially because I know I am capable of more. There are rumors I may be eligible to take on my old manager‚Äôs position which would come with greater responsibility and a raise, but with the pace the government works, I am unsure if and when I would be presented with that opportunity and if that is even something I am interested in.¬†

Many people say that once you have a government job don‚Äôt leave because you can‚Äôt beat it. While I agree, you can't beat the benefits, the low stress environment, time off, and set working hours and while I am taking full advantage of the perks, I don't know how much longer I can hang on with things going in the same direction. If I go back to private, it will be more demanding and overwhelming which makes me fearful, but if I stay in public it is more or less everything I previously described. I understand no place is perfect and I am grateful to have a job. I‚Äôm feeling a little lost and indecisive about all of this. Do I make a change or stay? I can see kicking myself later in life wishing I still had a government job especially if I have a family. All I know right here and right now is that I need to feel more productive/fulfilled during the work day, want to learn and remain in the civil engineering industry.¬†

1f3pj9z,WFH to full in office for a $30k salary increase ,"Hello, I was looking for some insight, or if anyone else has had a similar experience.

  
I currently have a WFH job that pays $30 an hour, it's guaranteed 40 hours a week, Health, Dental, Vision. This job is a 2 year contract position that will hopefully hire on full time once the contract is up.

Cons:

- It does not have matching 401k

- PTO is not great

  
I just got an offer from a company I use to work at for $90k, fully benefits, good PTO, 5% matching 401k.

Cons:

- Full time in office

- Schedule isn't consistent, it's based off of 2 month rotations, that you will be either working, weekdays, weekends, or nights.



I don't mind the work I am doing for either company. But I had a really hard time being full time in office, it's a full time desk job and honestly just had a really difficult time doing that every day.

  
For reference, I am 30, I have a decent amount saved, I am financially stable, which is making weighing my decision of not needing to take the higher pay if I won't be happier.

1f3ovq7,Passed over for promotion and need help deciding how to move forward,"My department keeps hiring external candidates at a higher title and pay. They just brought in two more at a higher role than me with the same experience as me if not less. I have worked there for two years now and well overdue for a promotion. Since i‚Äôve been passed over again I‚Äôve decided I want to leave. 

I‚Äôm coming to you guys because I am trying to figure out what to do. I have talked to a few people in my life and getting mixed advice. Some tell me to say fuck them, find a new job and leave now. I get that perspective because they don‚Äôt value me and my work ethic and all the extra OT and work I put in. I personally think it is better for me in the long run to stick it out until after the first quarter of 2025. That means for roughly about 6 more months. This way I still am eligible and will receive my bonus (which I worked hard for this year) and will probably be promoted in the first quarter (maybe if I don‚Äôt get passed over again, but there‚Äôs no one left to promote except me) so I can take the promoted title with me into my next role. 

If I don‚Äôt get it it‚Äôs whatever at this point I just want my bonus and to not leave money on the table. If I do this I plan to take a step back from all the extra responsibilities I took on and just do the bare minimum. Initially I felt so much anger but I tried to talk myself down and think about it logically.

I also want to note that I  live in a rural area and there are not a ton of jobs near me for my role. My commute is about 45 minutes currently and looking at similar jobs hiring they are a bit further than that away. about 1.5-2 hours away. I am planning to move closer to the city once I save up some money and so that‚Äôs another reason I was thinking I should stick it out. I don‚Äôt really love the idea of a longer commute.

Right before I left I was being train to become a co-director as a director of my department at the time was leaving so I was on my probation period still being phased in as a ""director"". Yes I know the title is a bit inflated but that's what it was. Now I'm in college and I want to start looking for internships and the best thing to have is past experience. I want to list the year I worked there as a experience because I did the fucking work. But I can't reach to them to ask for a reference if I need it. I have the experience on my LinkedIn for now but I also want to put on my resume and start applying for internships. If I get asked what do I say, how do I handle this? 



I know what I did was bad. I was young and stressed I didn't know how to handle it so I just stopped engaging with the thing that stressed me.

1f3o7d8,What should I do with my first real job offer as a full time student,"So to keep it short and sweet, I am a full time final year student with high above average marks, I got contacted out of the blue for a potential role opening up and they want me. So naturally I was excited as this would be my stepping stone into the software development field.

Went through this interview and to my surprise after the interview they contacted me and asked if I will be able to start next week as in 4 days, they also want me to relocate to the town they are based in.

Now this alone makes it difficult for me, I am currently still busy with my studies and will only be finishing it by end of November and it is clearly stated on my CV and everything, so now I am worried that if I accept this opportunity I will need to locate to a different town and not sure if the salary offered will cover my monthly expenses and besides that I don't want my university duties and work affect my actual work and vice versa. I know most will say that I shouldn't apply as a full time student but I was approached by the company in this instance and all my previous job applications were for graduate positions that commence upon completion of my degree.

I feel torn between the positive side and the negative, yes I want this job it suits me, but on the other hand I am also a top achiever in Uni looking at obtaining a cum laude, so in essence I don't know what to do as I feel my priorities should lie at finishing my degree as best I can to achieve my cum laude, but yet I also want to start learning and earning experience and lastly the relocation I won't be able to afford right now and yes I am still young living with my parents who care for me which I also feel guilty about because I can't provide anything monetary back to the household and should I have been able to afford the move, the initial shock of moving far away from them and potentially losing my bonds with them scares me.

Sorry for the lengthy scenario, just looking for some insight, this gave me a little glint of hope as that when my situation is right i.e. finished my degree and come to terms with what I need to do I wil be able to go where it's needed, but on the other hand it feels like I will be missing out on my one and only chance to follow the career I set out for me and another opportunity won't come my way

1f3o4w9,"One step back, two steps forward - Good/Bad?","I recently started a new job at a firm that I wasn‚Äôt excited about initially, but I didn‚Äôt have any other options. I thought it would be better to have something, than nothing. A few weeks have passed and I am completely miserable, regretting every decision I made. Plus, the job is completely the opposite of what I signed up for so my experience will not be too relevant for my target career path.

There are a few things keeping me here:

- Loyalty: If I leave before a year passes, I think it would look bad from a career standpoint. I‚Äôve never been one to jump ship early, but I‚Äôm seriously considering it this time.

- Job Market: The job market is tough right now, so there aren‚Äôt many alternatives. I‚Äôve been offered a few lower-level positions that could potentially lead to a great career path, but they would require a significant pay cut. Is the risk worth the reward? Is it wise to take one step back to move two steps forward?

- Financially: If I leave now, I‚Äôd have to pay back a $15k signing bonus.

1f3niqa,[EU] I'm on a failing PIP. What to do?,"As the title says, I'm now in the 2nd month of my PIP and waiting on feedback, that will most likely ne negative.
The first month i was rated as ""off-track"". Initially i was supposed to be on track but the feedback meeting got delayed and the off track verdict was given.

During the 2nd month i had a planned vacation(planned since last year) and when i came back i realised that I'm severely burned out, even got to the ER with some problems that could be related. 

Now the context is almost given, here is the situation:
If i fail this PIP I could be terminated for ""Professional misconduct"". Due to internal policies, i would be then reassigned somewhere within the company (It's big, I'm in s company that's subsidiary of a fortune 500 one) or if there is ""nothing available"" to be assigned to an employment agency to find a new job.

The thing is, I'm not sure that comes up a write-up for the Department of Labour, and if that professional misconduct will have any long term association.

1f3ng5a,Is this job toxic or am I just being dramatic ,"Have been Working at a government contractor job the last few months and my supervisor is an asswipe who doesn‚Äôt like to admit when he‚Äôs wrong, and instead puts blame on me/us. 

Im a technician , can‚Äôt say a lot on what we do but whenever Im working on something he‚Äôs constantly looking over my shoulder, waiting for me to do something wrong, and when he finds something‚Äôs , he catches a attitude, shakes his head, gets hot headed and says snarky comments. He does this with others too. 
There‚Äôs also times he will tell us what to do, we will do it just as he explained, then back out of it and act like that wasn‚Äôt what he said and blame it on us, to the manager, basically saving his ass. So now the manager doesn‚Äôt think so highly of us. 

Today, he also said we fucked up what we did yesterday (which was exactly what he told us to do to a T) and we had to fix it today. Manager wasn‚Äôt happy either, but he clearly wasn‚Äôt taking the blame for it. 

My final gripe is , the job is painfully slow. To the point we‚Äôre on our laptops all day doing ‚Äútraining‚Äù buying, wasting time, which also he will periodically complain about like we actually have work to do, when we dont. Aside that , we‚Äôre doing training until we finally have something to do, which usually takes 5-10 min or sometimes a couple hours. Im also making 18 an hour which feels pathetic , which before taxes comes out to just under 35k a year. That‚Äôs not livable. I want to leave because it‚Äôs really starting to effect me mentally, the not doing anything , the constant needling like we can control the lack of work, how we ‚Äúmess up‚Äù but we‚Äôre only doing as we‚Äôre told.

1f3n5uo,Did I make the right choice? Feels like I acted selfishly ,"I am 26 almost 27F. Since I was 23, I have been a data science role. The past 3 years I stayed at the same company. I feel very fortunate to have gotten in a data science role so young. It's not common and typically requites years of being a data analyst before becoming a data scientist. I have worked hard, had outstanding grades and work experience that have helped create the path I am on. However, there were some issues I had with understanding my career trajectory at my old. I felt that it wasn't well outlined and the growth was weak at best. Company culture ( more specifically the data science group I was in ) was not really bearable, but I just sucked it up, kept my head down, did good work.  Through a referral, I interviewed at a new place, for a 50% salary increase and a more senior title ( I know, titles dont always matter ). This opportunity sort of just landed in my lap. My old job, upon turning in resignation notice, offered to match my salary, but it was more than just about money. I truly saw this more senior role as being a segue into the career path I want to head down - as in, it shows progression. However, my husband and I are expecting our first baby at the end of March, so I took this new job already having known that. My rationale was that if I turned down this new job because I am pregnant, I dont know when id get the chance again to transition to a better company that also helps tremendously with my career progression. Meaning that, I got over the speed hump of getting a better job now, instead of waiting for later. Had I stayed at my old job, taken my maternity leave, I dont know when I would be given an opportunity to get a better DS role. For those that don't know DS roles are competitive, and the interview process is quite lengthy and rigorous. I feel blessed that this opportunity came to me in a relatively easy going manner. 

  
People have said ""be selfish"" and do what's best for you. I view it as even taking maternity leave in March 2025, I have already ""secured"" this better position/salary/ title. I am getting the inconvenience of becoming a parent out of the way now.  Did I mess up? I feel like this new company is fairly liberal, has good work-life principles in place that I have seen with my own eyes after just starting here. In other words, they seem to walk the talk. In addition to having a great parental leave policy. I care a lot about by career and have always wanted to be a ""working parent"" as well. Just wanted to get some thoughts / ideas from. Anyone in a similar situation or know someone who was?

1f3mqpr,I think my boss is setting me up to be fired,"I started working for my current company a little over 2 years ago. It‚Äôs a small company and I‚Äôm the only person on my team under my manager, Shelia (fake name). Shelia started about a year ago, but went on leave for a few months at the start of this year during which time I was placed on a team under my director (Shelia‚Äôs boss), Amy. Shelia had gone over my yearly review with me before she left, and while there were some things she gave me to improve on, I got a ‚Äúmeets expectations.‚Äù

I got great feedback from Amy and her team while I was working under her, but I guess Shelia hadn‚Äôt recorded my yearly review before she went out so Amy pulled it to do again (? idk, it was weird), and now I had a ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt meet expectations‚Äù. She asked if Shelia had gone over this with me and I said yes but with a different grade. Amy was surprised by what Shelia had put down and told me she didn‚Äôt agree with it, but as she wasn‚Äôt technically my manager there wasn‚Äôt much she could do. I decided to just shrug it off and keep on going. 

Shelia came back a few months ago and resumed her role as my manager. Our midyear reviews come around and she asks me to get feedback from people I‚Äôve been working with as she was gone most of the year. I reached out to multiple people, all of whom have given me good feedback in the past few months (including Amy), but when Shelia went over my mid year review every single feedback comment was negative. Literally nothing positive. I was pretty surprised given the feedback I had gotten throughout the year. The weird thing was that it was all an Excel document, but we do our reviews through workday and for all of my past reviews these things have been in Workday and I‚Äôve been able to see the de-identified comments there. This time I couldn‚Äôt. 

She was almost gleeful by the end of my review. Like, really, really, happy to give me a bad score. I felt so dejected after the review that I didn‚Äôt say anything or question it, but it‚Äôs been eating at me more and more. We really haven‚Äôt clicked since she started, and she‚Äôs been talking about hiring more people for our team (including the role above me that I‚Äôm technically more than qualified for) and has been clear that I won‚Äôt be considered for a promotion.

When my director was hiring the line manager, the director told me it was really important to them that the line manager was nice to me and we worked well together as it was a priority for the director that I am happy.

1f3kr1k,Need help with resume bad. Super stressed.,"Let me start off with saying that I'm really only applying to restaurant jobs and things of that nature, nothing crazy. Let me also add that I do have some fake work history listed in my resume. Why? Because I am 33 and have only recently (for the most part) started working due to depression and anxiety I've had in the past. I'm doing fine, but yeah, I really would like to avoid my resume being basically blank. My fake job to have years covered is a freelance marketing gig that I only did for a few months and have extended into years. There's that part. I would take it off if suggested, but yeah, right now I feel like it's better to keep it in there. Plus I'm not using it to get any jobs I'm not equipped for.

My main question is that I worked for Walmart for two months (March-May) earlier this years had to relocate due to a death in the family, and was unable to transfer to a store where I currently live. I've explained it in interviews, but I'm worried about how it comes off, whether hiring managers even end up hearing what I explained in my interview, and if applications are outright rejected because of a short stint at a job. 

The same thing happened again May-June. I was let go from a restaurant that I did an excellent job at. The owner wanted someone with more food service experience. I have a couple years of thatz but was let go anyway despite being highlighted by people I actually worked with (the owner was never there). So that's another one month stint at a job.

I'm currently working at a restaurant for a residency that only lasts a month. That i'm sure I'll keep on my resume. Why not. Good reference if actually contacted. But what about those past two jobs?

Should i just leave them off my resume? Does it look that bad? I'd rather keep them on there, to be more truthful, show that I am trying to work, that ive gained more experience, etc. But I have maybe 20 interviews over the past few months and have not been offered a position for any of those. I lucked out with the past two roles I've had.

Also if i leave them off, I'm leaning on creating another fake job to cover more time, or extend that one fake job to cover me from last year to May.

1f3k6kx,Career - What to do ,"Never really used this before but trying to get some insight. I work for local govt. been here for about 2-3 months and have not been properly trained. I have done all training modules and assignments that were given to me and have only made small little mistakes that were easily fixable (I.e. forgetting to send a revised document). But other than that I have reached out to other employees in other departments for help with my role as instructed and either they don‚Äôt answer my calls or teams messages or they simply do not help me at all and leave me on read. 

I was supposed to start teleworking after my 90 days as discussed in my interview but because I come in everyday and haven‚Äôt been trained to do my job now I can‚Äôt which sucks because this wasn‚Äôt what was discussed prior. 

My clock in is at 830 and end time is at 430 but have relayed to my boss about switching my times because leaving at 8am and commuting to the office makes me late but if I leave out 20 min earlier than I‚Äôm too early. There wasn‚Äôt a definitive answer to it, only that business hours are 8:30-4:30. So I leave out about 4:10-4:15 most days because I can‚Äôt clock in the time as overtime but if I‚Äôm late to work it‚Äôs an issue. I have a co worker that constantly harasses me about invoices that need to be paid but that aren‚Äôt her responsibility to worry about but they are all messed up from the previous person that was in my role so I do not know how to fix or handle those. Long story short. My boss has stopped communicating with me about things that need to be done and does them himself. And I fear now that he is attacking me by bringing up the small mistakes that I have done and say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt complete assignments or tasks when asked of me‚Äù when I certainly do. Has put me in a fear of thinking that I am going to get fired. Is this true or not ?

I recently sent an email to said co worker very professional to stop asking about the invoices and our boss is aware of the situation and there‚Äôs not much else I can do until I hear back from someone.

1f3k57s,My Boss Rewrites My Work,"Hi guys,

So, as the title describes, my boss has rewritten any copy I‚Äôve ever submitted to him. For context, I‚Äôm about a month into the job at a startup and it‚Äôs an entirely new field for me. I often write copy for things like blogs, press releases, case studies, and occasionally social media. 

He often gives me feedback like ‚Äúgreat job pulling this together, made a few adjustments‚Äù but I‚Äôll go in to find nearly everything rewritten. Sometimes changes like ‚ÄúMicrosoft is excited to announce‚Äù to ‚ÄúMicrosoft is thrilled to announce‚Äù. 

To make things more stressful, it‚Äôs not only him who has edits. The entire C-Suite level team will go on and start changing things as well, I start to question why I even wrote anything in the first place. 

Then, this morning I had one copywriting project stripped from my to-do list to ‚Äústreamline‚Äù things better. It feels like people think I‚Äôm not doing my job properly and it‚Äôs making me self conscious. It gets to the point where I don‚Äôt even want to work on the project and I procrastinate starting it because I know it‚Äôll be rewritten. 

Does anyone have any advice? Should I ask for extensive feedback?? Should I be worried that the project was taken off my plate? I was laid off earlier this year, I really don‚Äôt want to go through that again!

1f3gsea,What would be an ideal masters to pursue for an engineering graduate that opens a wide range of job opportunities in todays job market,"Hi, I am seeking some detailed advice from someone who has been through the same thing as me or something similar. I am studying my bachelors at a university in glasgow as an international student and I wasn‚Äôt really planning to do my MEng (atleast in the same university) before working a year or two. But many of my colleagues and friends have told me it is best to apply for a masters course that is integrated with my bachelors as it bumps up the qualification but on the other hand I have been seeing lot of graduates regretting to get masters in ChemE. Many of them I have talked to prefer to pursue masters in something very specific and if possible something that isn‚Äôt quite related to industrial work mainly due to unethical work-life balance and a pay that does not make up for the hassle. 

1. What would be some masters option you would prefer if I was looking to get into the engineering field but also avoid the hassle of working in a factory or as a lab technician? I‚Äôm looking for a field that offers diverse opportunities and doesn‚Äôt limit me to factory or lab work. 

2. I am also seeking to work in the middle east as most my family lives there (gcc countries), I would like to hear from those who have worked there about the significance of chemical engineers in the job market. Despite the abundance of oil and gas reserves, I‚Äôve heard that the demand for chemical engineers might not be strong. What qualities do employers typically look for, and what are the working conditions like? As I approach the completion of my BEng in Chemical Engineering, what would you suggest I pursue for my master‚Äôs? I understand this is similar to the question in point 1, but I am seeking insights from both perspectives since work life and conditions in the Middle East can be quite different from the US and UK.

1f3eais,"I signed a contract too early, would it be stupid of me to negotiate for a higher rate? ","Last week I posted on reddit asking what people usually charge at an hourly rate for freelance. I got around $60 minimum from most replies and realized I've been massively underpaid. For context, I'm an independent contractor working fully remotely at a company that designs plush toys and apparel for clients and I've been there for over 3 years. The hours are pretty unpredictable, some weeks I work 40 hours and some weeks I work 20 hours. People were telling me that as a freelancer I'm the one that should be setting the rate.

1f3e6lp,Coworker one level above me suddenly starts micromanaging. Is it me or her?,"Hey y‚Äôall so I‚Äôve been at my company for 3 years now and have been working with my coworker, let‚Äôs call her Jane, since I began. Her and I developed a pretty close friendship as far as coworkers are concerned and she joined the company just 6 months prior to myself so we really learned the ropes together.

She is the level above me, mostly due to tenure at the company since that‚Äôs how it works at the lower mid level here, but she‚Äôs often said she feels like we are equals or that I should even be the position about her. I ofc took that with a grain of salt since everyone likes to flatter their coworkers but there are many times that I feel like she relies on me for direction, however, I always feel like a team should be collaborative regardless of level so I don‚Äôt mind.

Anyway, our company went through a restructuring recently and we all got new managers. Jane got a really really great manager that she works with regularly, I got someone I‚Äôve never met and never will work with on the day to day which raises concerns to me in itself on performance tracking.

Where the problem arises is that previously Jane and I would have offline conversations giving each other feedback on our work and working collaboratively on it. Lately however, she‚Äôs been leaving all her feedback to me in team group chats for everyone to see.

To be completely honest, if there‚Äôs ever a point her and I disagree and she raises it to the team they often do agree with my perspective over hers. Also, there‚Äôs many many many times someone will ask her for something and she just completely misunderstands and drops the ball and I will typically help her fix it last second without making it known because that‚Äôs what a team should do for eachother.

Anyway, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if her manager said she should show how she differentiates herself from me at a lower level maybe? She‚Äôs told me that leaders have questioned how we work together since we‚Äôre different levels but do the same work.

My biggest concern is that her trying to showcase more seniority is going to hinder my reputation since my manager who approves raises, promotions, etc isn‚Äôt involved in my work and now my teams are suddenly seeing mass amounts of feedback all of a sudden.

I also am not trying to just blow it off and am willing to accept if maybe I need to step my game up, but some of the notes she gives me come off as knit picks and suddenly out of the blue. What we do for work has a lot to do with writing and she‚Äôs beginning to just reword my work, which is fine, but also the content wasn‚Äôt wrong and it seems like just preference based edits. 

Wanted to get everyone‚Äôs thoughts on this. Am I being stubborn and not accepting feedback? Or is maybe overcompensating to make herself look good?

TLDR: coworker who‚Äôs been in parallel with me suddenly is making a big deal about feedback. Should I suck it up and do what she says or is she overcompensating?

1f3cjol,I was let go,"After 6 weeks of training, I was given alot of miss information. 

They lied about being a new company, who was in fact a fully on going company.

When I got hired they told someone that day to train me. She was not prepared.
They gave me outdated material and it wasn‚Äôt until 3rd week that I actually started to get trained from online sources and usage of their application. 

I was reaching out to anyone who would train me and knew what they were doing. Then they surprised me with an assessment. They felt I was not trained enough and with out warning very next day said I wasn‚Äôt a good fit. 

They sent loads of electronics and only want one thing returned leaving me with loads extra of electronics to have to get rid of myself. 

When I probed them why, with any feed back as my assessment on training the day prior I was told I knew the entire system. It came as a surprise. I only got you aren‚Äôt a good fit. 

I find this bad management over all, with being my responsibility towards being trained which was stressful. The manager made it sound like she had more to offer than what was. 

It also was my first position from years of school. What would be your take on this professionally? In the future what would you suggest I look for to avoid things like this during interviews? They also dropped the pay after the initial interview due to non experience. Over all super disappointed but the training was heavy and on me to get down vs the company.

I'm not interested in doing business or any sort of engineering course but I'm very interested in the brain and psychology of humans but all that I'm reading is that the salary isn't fair and people won't hire any undergrad or a masters in psychology so there's no point of doing it.

Even if there was a way to get a good pay neuropsychology job out there, how do I do it and how do I trust it without ending up being a primary school teacher. I know neurologists and neuropsychologists are not doctors by any how but is there a way there are useful?

1f38rxe,"Miserable at new job, am I being set up to fail?","

Stressing out at new job; am I being set up to fail? 

Since leaving my last job because I moved across the country, I had been struggling to find a job in publishing sales. After 7 months of searching, I finally scored a sales associate job (entry-level) that‚Äôs fully remote with a decent salary at a smaller publisher. I was so grateful because the job searching process was brutal, and my partner and I really needed the money. 

However, after two months at this job, I feel very unhappy and overwhelmed. This company is much smaller than the last one I worked for, meaning I have a much larger share of responsibilities than my previous position. But it‚Äôs not just that, I feel pretty unsupported. My boss was on vacation my first week, so she just had me in meetings with my coworkers to learn about what they do, and a couple of them showed me some of the programs we use and what they do. My boss gave me a sales manual and that‚Äôs all the training that she gave me on her own. She constantly gives me work that‚Äôs not covered in the sales manual, without telling me what exactly I‚Äôm supposed to do. She forwards emails to me from other people telling them that I can help them with something, and it will be something I have no idea how to do. We constantly have team meetings and she never tells me what they are for, and no one explains to me what‚Äôs going on.  There have been a number of times where she has asked for updates on a project that I had no clue was my responsibility, and her reasoning is that it should be in the sales manual. The person in my position before me left very suddenly, so many people took on my position‚Äôs responsibilities until I was hired, and then everyone was eager to put it on my plate. But now people keep giving me work and telling me to do things without explaining what it is or how to do it ‚Äî and often times, it‚Äôs not covered in the sales manual. I try to ask questions but I have to ask so many that it makes me feel like an idiot, and my boss always seems dumbfounded that I‚Äôm so confused. Not only that, but my boss often does not respond to my emails and I have to try really hard to get a response from her. I asked advice from one of my coworkers and she just said ‚Äúyou kinda just learn as you go‚Äù and that really really stresses me out because I feel like I‚Äôm flailing. I have so many responsibilities at this job to keep track of (way more than my last job for the same pay) and I‚Äôm no stranger to hard work but I feel so unsupported. Every week I figure out there is a new project that is my responsibility to keep track of that no one has ever talked about to me before and I had no idea it existed. I panic and scroll through my emails to figure out if it has been mentioned before and usually it hasn‚Äôt been or has only been briefly mentioned.  I don‚Äôt know what to do, I really need this job money-wise but I am so unhappy and stressed out. I feel like I make it seem like I need my hand held but I just wish I could have gotten proper training that involved someone sitting down with me and telling me all my job responsibilities and how to go about them ‚Äî especially because so many of them require programs that are specific to this company so I have no idea how to use them and no one has showed me how.

1f36ot1,Am I lowkey being demoted?,"I currently oversee two departments, department A and department B. I report to a manager who is a national/general manager for the business and she reports to the director. 

As the company I‚Äôm in is on a rapid growth journey, it‚Äôll soon be too much for me to oversee both departments, so the intention was to split them off into two separate reporting lines. I expressed my interest in continuing to lead department B over department A, as its where I‚Äôm most qualified and the work lies within what I studied. 

Come to find out, if I wish to continue to lead department B, I must change to report to someone I currently work alongside who manages an entirely different department, C. He currently reports to the same manager as me and we are equal in our structure as is. If I stick with department A I get to retain my current manager.

I view this as me being sent backwards. I have expressed that I feel as if this is a demotion but I am continually shot down and told that this is a great opportunity for me to grow and advance my career. My current manager is fantastic but to be frank, coworker who leads C is utterly useless and I have multiple work ethic and communication issues with him currently - certainly not someone I‚Äôd want to report to!

I‚Äôve been told multiple times that they want to advance me, that there‚Äôs ‚Äúmore on the table‚Äù for me, but I can‚Äôt see how this is it.

Every performance review there‚Äôs little to no feedback and I just get put up the ranks again. My performance review just gone I was told I‚Äôd be going up again and I‚Äôd have a new role in August - well, this is the apparent promotion.

1f368i0,"I got offered top of my salary range, but I realized I should‚Äôve given a larger range from the very beginning. Can I negotiate?","Okay. So. I was poached about a job opportunity a few weeks back on LinkedIn. The HR manager was impressed by my resume/background and asked to set up a call to chat more about the role. I was intrigued so I agreed. In the meantime, she sent me the link to the job description. It all sounded great, but the salary range was too low at $90K - $100K. I make $115K today. 

We hopped on a call and she went through the job in greater detail, and then asked if I felt about the salary range. I explained that it‚Äôs lower than roles I‚Äôve been targeting and that I‚Äôm seeking roles in the $125K - $130K range. She seemed a little startled, but said she‚Äôd go back to her finance team to check. Keep in mind I‚Äôm extremely qualified for this role with 7 years of experience, when the posting only required 4 years.

She came back and said they can be flexible to $125K with an ever bigger stretch to $130K and asked if I wanted to proceed with the interview process. Which I happily agreed! I was excited they were open to that range. 

The 4 rounds of interviews went so well and she asked for my references. She then says ‚ÄúOur team has enjoyed meeting with you. Just wanted to check with you again about your salary ask as I know you mentioned you were closer to 125 - 130k is that still the case?‚Äú

A little thrown off, I asked if we could hop on a quick call. I thought she was going back on the 125-130; so I was prepared to make my case. We chatted and I reiterated that range is correct and that I‚Äôm currently interviewing for other roles in that range, but that this opportunity is top of my list. 

TLDR:
They offered me the job at 130K. Can I negotiate? Because while this is great and they met me at the top of my range, I‚Äôm realizing that I should‚Äôve presented a larger number. Based on market value, the workload, my 7 years of experience, etc etc. but also the fact of changing jobs and I should‚Äôve been targeting a 20% salary increase.

I should mention that the job does offers good benefits of hybrid 2 days a week, unlimited PTO, 30 paid holidays, gym membership, WFH $ for equipment and internet, etc etc. so I‚Äôm trying to look at the full picture, but I still feel like I sold myself short on salary. And it also feels weird not negotiating! Is it too late?

And help/advice is greatly appreciated.

","Hi Beautiful People,

I am a 28-year-old male from Pakistan. For the past 2 years, I left a full-time job that was significantly underpaid to pursue freelancing in hopes of earning better.

Here's my situation: I am not specializing in one specific skill. My first client was a nonprofit organization; I did some cold outreach for them and helped them secure a state-level partnership through a connection. Then, a casting director reached out to me for outreach work related to American Idol, but she was too broke to even pay $300 a month.

Currently, I am working with an established eCommerce SaaS and a career coach. For the career coach, I:

* Book inbound leads (they have automation in place to get leads)
* Find jobs for the clients and apply on their behalf
* Send out a newsletter (he is now asking me to help with growing subscribers, which I will need to learn)

For the SaaS founder, I:

* Ghostwrite
* Do outreach through Apollo and Sales Navigator

I earn around $1,200 from both clients, which is not enough to live comfortably even in Pakistan due to high inflation.

I need serious advice on where to go from here. I feel lost. I can't even clearly define what I specialize in, and I am not exceptionally skilled at everything I do, which scares me. I worry that an expert might eventually undermine my chances.",Ijazsaab,1,1.0,0,1724838656,2024-08-28 09:50:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f3654j/help_i_cant_figure_out_my_specialty/,8,2024
1f35wpz,Will my travel plans that clash with the start date of an internship program ruin my chances of getting the role (they offered me today)?,"

So I did an interview for an internship literally yesterday, and crazy enough got a call back today by the hiring person, who extended an offer to me for the position. I verbally accepted and she went through the next steps in filling out documentation, police checks etc etc.

At the end of the call I asked her a question regarding the start date, and if its strict or not. The proposed start-date is 15th Jan 2025, I get back from my holiday the 19th Jan...the hiring person asked me what date I would want to start and so I ended up with the 22nd of Jan. I've actually informed the same hiring person about this trip in an earlier screening session, and informed my interviewers during the interview yesterday, to which they said I will have to let the hiring person know.

After a bit of discussion, I briefly asked if I should just be waiting for the email, but she said ""she will have to speak with the associate brand manager (who I interviewed with yesterday) about the offer and see what he thinks."" So its a bit ambiguous and there's a bit of miscommunication going around.

1f33xtr,"26F Unemployed - BSc 2018 Graduate with No Work Experience, Need Guidance","Hey everyone,

So, here‚Äôs my story. I graduated with a BSc in Chemistry back in 2018. From a young age, I wanted to pursue music, so I didn‚Äôt really focus on my degree as much as I should have. After graduation, I stayed home for about a year before moving to Chennai in June 2019 to learn sound engineering. Then COVID hit, and everything just went downhill. 

During that time, I went through some personal struggles, including two abortions, which led me into depression. I felt like I lost my way in life, and even my passion for music is like 'gone' ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt create anything anymore. But recently, I came across a quote - ‚ÄúA year from now, you‚Äôll wish you had started today.‚Äù That really struck me because I‚Äôve been feeling like that when I think about where I was a year ago.

So I reached out to some friends who work in IT, and they suggested I learn Excel, SQL, and aim for business analyst roles. But when I started searching on LinkedIn, I noticed that most companies are looking for either BTech graduates or people with around 4 years of experience. Now, I‚Äôm questioning whether I‚Äôm heading in the right direction.

I‚Äôm a quick learner and I somewhat belive I can still turn things around, but I‚Äôm not sure where to start or what possibilities are out there for someone like me. Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for reading this far. Have a great day! (:

1f33goa,Developer Dilemma: Specialization vs. Broadening Skills,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently at a crossroads in my career, and I could really use some advice from fellow developers who might have faced similar situations.

A bit about my background: I started as a software developer a year ago after completing a 6-month bootcamp. Since then, I've primarily been working as a frontend developer, focusing on Vue.js. Over time, I've gradually moved into fullstack development, mainly working with Symfony.

However, I‚Äôve encountered several challenges along the way. First, I find Symfony to be almost unbearable. I'm not sure if my struggle with it stems from my lack of skills or if it's simply a framework that doesn't suit me. On top of that, the projects I work on have over 20 years of development history, with layers upon layers of bundles, making the codebase feel like a maze that‚Äôs difficult to navigate.

In addition to development, working at a small agency means we also have to handle a lot of system administration tasks. This overlap between development and sysadmin duties is something I find extremely difficult to manage. Linux, in particular, is a challenge for me, and I often feel lost trying to figure it all out.

Now, I find myself at a dilemma: Should I specialize and focus solely on frontend development, which I enjoy and know best, leaving behind the complexities of fullstack development, Linux, and all the associated challenges? Or should I persevere and continue wrestling with Symfony and the fullstack responsibilities, hoping that with time, things will get easier?

So, I‚Äôm reaching out to the community with a few questions:

* How did you decide whether to specialize or broaden your skills?
* Do you have any tips for dealing with overwhelming complexity ?
* Is it normal to feel this lost after a year, or am I missing something crucial?

I would really appreciate any insights or experiences you can share.

Thanks in advance for your support!",Ok-Train6545,1,1.0,0,1724827083,2024-08-28 06:38:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f33goa/developer_dilemma_specialization_vs_broadening/,8,2024

1f32mlk,Bachelor in CS at ETH or EPFL,"I want to study a CS undergraduate degree in ETH or EPFL and I have no idea which one to choose. Because of the following reasons.

‚Ä¢Reputation: They're both ranked among the best university worldwide being ETH 9 and EPFL 11 in CS (QS Ranking by subject CS 2024) and globally being ETH 7 and EPFL 26. I want to work in Switzerland so I think both are pretty much at the same level.

‚Ä¢Exchange programmes: ETH has much more top tier options such as MIT, Princeton, NUS, NUT... But I've seen that it's actually really hard to get into on of those you have to get +5.75/6 so since I'll have to work and study at the same time and EPFL has also great exchange programmes I don't think it's neither a relevant fact.

‚Ä¢Internships: In ETH are hard to get because exams are in summer, but I don't actually think that that will be really relevant because I already have experience in IT industry and because internship at EFPL will be like 2 months long so there no much time to actually take profit of it.

‚Ä¢City; I've been in Zurich a couple times and I love it it's where I want to live in the long run, but at the same time because of that I might want to live in other places before settling down also I've heard that Lausanne has a better student life vibe.

‚Ä¢Master: I've heard that studying at EPFL guarantees you access to masters in EPFL and ETH does not.

‚Ä¢Toughness: I've seen that both of them are pretty much equally challenging being ETH less intense but without vacations and EPFL very intense during semester but with real holidays.

‚Ä¢Language: I don't know much of French or German but since I'm Spanish native I find French quite easy.

This is pretty much the information I've got of both unis. 

What do you think it's relevant that I did not take into account? Which one would you choose and why? And also any tips to manage the cost of living without any aid whatsoever?

I'm (26F) starting my last year in law school and the closer I get to the end, the further behind I feel. I'm doing my schooling in Canada so I would have to do one full year to graduate, then attend bar school, then 6 months of articling (internship) before finally being a practicing lawyer. although I have enjoyed the program, I'm not sure if this is what I want to do for... the rest of my life I guess. i know I'm sounding dramatic but I would only be practicing by 28-29 and I feel this crippling pressure that what if I finish all this schooling and realize this profession is not for me after all?¬†

i currently work in finance (part time during school, full time summers) and was just offered the opportunity to move up in the company (I really like this company - been here 3 years with great benefits/security),but that would require me to commit full time to the role, and I wouldn't be able to do that while still in law school.

At the same time, would I be doing a disservice to myself by getting this far to not see it through? I worked hard to get into law school, it was a big accomplishment of mine and I want to prove to myself/friends/family that I could finish it now too, I‚Äôll feel like a failure if I don‚Äôt.¬†

I did 6 months full time as a plumbing apprentice while working part time at a sandwich shop. Decent money but the trades aren‚Äôt for me. At this point I just don‚Äôt want to do this grind anymore. I want a simple life. I have the option to move with my mother in Mexico she has a nice house and that way I keep her company and take care of her. As she is 60 and totally alone. Divorced with no family near her. Me and my sister live in the USA and would only really be able to visit once a year. So basically I could cover all of the bills and living expenses for roughly 500$ a month. I‚Äôm curious if there‚Äôs any jobs where I could work for say 6 months or until I make like 10k then have 6 months off and be able to return to the job after. Preferably with live in accommodation. So I could say do 6mo in the us saving all my money then return 6 months in mexico more or less. I know I could just do a fast food job for 6 months then quit and repeat but the problem then becomes how my living situation would work for only 6 months. I looked into cruise ship jobs as they tend to work on 6month contracts and have accommodation included. But I was just curious if anyone had any other ideas. I also looked into work form home jobs. But in Mexico they don‚Äôt pay good and I‚Äôd have to work pretty much full time at my desk and  that sounds awful. I know people work US WFH jobs and live abroad but I don‚Äôt totally understand how that works. And kinda worried bout the whole legal and tax implications. For what it‚Äôs worth I have dual citizenship so I can work in Mexico. But I‚Äôd rather be paid in USD. Sorry for the Uber long horribly written post.

1f30cgz,"How can I secure a co-op in tech/it at the age of 30+, with little previous work experience, and an obvious disability.","I'm just over 30. I have a profound physical disability, which, in my 20's, made it impossible for me to secure traditional employment, or at least very difficult. Constant flare-ups coupled with the physical inability, meant there were not many unskilled jobs I could have considered.

I managed to finish a diploma in IT, and even worked at a startup for 6 months in 2020 during school, thanks to their flexibility and my 1099 status. However Covid caused the shuttering of the company, along with my co-op being rescinded. 

I eventually graduated but never could find employment that could accommodate.

  
However, advances in treatment meant my disability is now 100% stable, I have the energy levels of a regular-ish person, and no flare-ups. Though my physical ability is akin to a wheelchair user and as obvious.

  
I have just been accepted to an advanced graduate certificate program for cyber security, 8 months, with a co-op. But given I am in my 30's with 6 months of work experience, and a visible disability, the prospect of finding employment feels impossible. Who would hire me?

I am just wondering, what can I do between now and then to shore up my resume/cv as much as possible? Is it hopeless?",techjobber99,2,1.0,1,1724815547,2024-08-28 03:25:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f30cgz/how_can_i_secure_a_coop_in_techit_at_the_age_of/,8,2024

1f2yzy9,"GM left, I got ALL their duties, but not their pay","Long story short, the company I work for is moving locations this weekend and our General Manager received an awesome job offer and gave notice; their last day was Monday - just barely two weeks and practically zero information was passed on, aside from logins.  Our Owner is a wonderful person, but fairly inexperienced and naiive when it comes to anything business or financial.  The Owner has also been very hands off for the last 5+ years and doesn't seem to have any awareness of what the day to day operations are or what is involved in running any portion of the business - nor do they seem to WANT any awareness of it.  Nearly every aspect of the company is outdated.  Everything from having physical paper records to the office and warehouse furnishings and equipment...right down to the PTO policy and the pay scales.  Our GM was trying to improve those things and knew I had the experience and skill set to follow in his place and keep working on improvements.  All that being said, our departing GM asked if I wanted the position - as I am fully qualified - and said they wanted me to take it.  I said I would happily accept an offer, if given, and they told the Owner all of this information as well.  In response, the Owner said they have decided they will just be more involved instead and we don't need a replacement GM.  üòë  

Now we, as a company, are somehow expected to coordinate the move, handle the physical reset of the office, the physical reset of the inventory, and physical reset of all of the shelving and storage racks that hold a WAREHOUSE of inventory items, and do so in addition to maintaining our regular job duties.  Another important piece to note is that we are a small company of 4 HOURLY employees.  And we all know, employers don't want hourly employees to work over 40 hrs a week, but they still want the jobs done all the same.  (This brings a perfect example though, as no one is in charge except the absentee Owner, and they have zero awareness of overtime rules and regulations.  I'm quite certain the thought of all these things hasn't even crossed their mind either.  If it had I feel like ANYTHING to do with ANYTHING would have been addressed with us all.)

All of this information leads me to my main point and reason for my post.  EVERY task of the GM has now become MY task.  And when I say every task, I mean EVERY. SINGLE. TASK.  So I have been forced to take over every duty and task of a position that was receiving $150k/year - in addition to my own position - which is quite underpaid to begin with.  The takeaway:  I am doing two full time jobs - one of which was worth $150k/yr to them - but I am getting paid my same, already underpaid wage.  The Owner appears to be completely and genuinely oblivious to this fact, as they just have zero concept of anything business or employee related.  How do I approach this with them??  I have never been in any sort of situation like this before.  It is absolutely mind blowing to me that they don't realize someone had to absorb those tasks.  They claim to want to be more involved, yet they think those tasks of a full time job just disappeared into thin air with the person leaving?!  I don't feel as if the Owner has done this intentionally, but regardless, I feel the result is the same; I'm 100% being taken advantage of.

1f2xi8h,Tips on Mentoring?,"There‚Äôs a guy at my work who is getting awful metrics, and while I was filling in for his supervisor I noticed some days he was doing literally no work whatsoever. I addressed it with him and we had a real in depth talk and coaching session. I also advised his supervisor of the same.

He didn‚Äôt take to my coaching from what I see currently because I checked his work product and no change. He also has a really bad attitude about work in general. Lots on venting and negativity. Leadership advised me though that they are very impressed by how I addressed some of the stuff I saw with him and they asked me to mentor him because I‚Äôve already built a rapport.

I agreed. I‚Äôm looking to get into leadership hence why I filled in for his supervisor to begin with. But I truly don‚Äôt think based on what I‚Äôve seen so far that he is even interested in having a mentor. His supervisor however advised me that he was in agreement to this as well. But considering how he doesn‚Äôt even do anything some days I can‚Äôt imagine that he is going to take well to this. It really doesn‚Äôt harm me in agreeing to this because his metrics truly can‚Äôt get worse. It will look really good if he commits.

My manager told me I did way better on the exam than the guy who was in my position before me (out of curiosity I looked up the guy to see how long he held my position and found he worked at my current level for a year before leaving), I have been in my current position for almost exactly 3 months.

I have 2 BSc degrees from a top 20 US school, MBA from a top 25 US school, MPH from a top 20 US school, and a post grad from a top 3 US school. I have 7 years total experience: 2 in retail management, 4 years in project management, 1 year in corporate management (non c suite and was laid off during a company debt restructuring).

1f2v4z9,Move from Pharma to FMCG?,"Hi everyone,

I graduated this year from my PhD and joined Pharma in a good position. The company is great, as well as the team and the pay is good.
But almost everyday I hate waking up and going to work, as almost nothing in the work, while challenging, excites me. It is involves a decent amount of beaurcratic work (GMP) and this field of Pharma does not really excite me.


I have the opportunity to move to FMCG in a similar role, but the techniques are more cutting edge and I hope I enjoy specific field more than Pharma (more tech, more coding, more cutting edge).

My worries is that I have been in this role for less than a year, also considering the stage of my career and age, the experience is more than I could hope for. (A lot of responsibility and managing 2FTE).

I don't know what to do, also I lost sight of my career and life goals (do I even want to engage in this rat race).

Would this be a smart move, or shall I grind two years more? Anybody that wants to share his two cents, would highly appreciate it.

1f2uta0,Was quitting retail management the right thing to do?,"Was this the right thing to do?

I was offered a frame shop job at an art gallery where I live that starts at $25/hr; well above the $21.50/hr I make in my retail ""management"" job with a company I've spent six years at. I put in my notice to begin on September 16th. I am thirty next week and felt like I've wasted enough of my best years in a soul sucking big box store, and that I'm running out of time to make a change.

Pros:

-Guaranteed 40 hours a week and potential overtime. I was averaging only 35-39 before and would always be cut off before 40 so that the company wouldn't have to pay overtime, though it was permitted during November-December

-Better treatment and fewer restrictions. No more playing by silly corporate rules and regulations that made my job impossible.

-Set schedule of 9AM-5:30PM M-F. Schedule was impossible to predict at the retail job and very hard to make plans for anything. 

-Get to do what I love. Picture framing and art care/display were what I loved at the old job but I basically abandoned it to take an assistant store management job and I hated every minute of being one.

-Obviously better pay.

-Accrual of sick leave, vacation time, and health insurance after a three month probationary period.

-Tentatively planning to move abroad and this job provides a slightly better chance to do so based on its skill set, but mainly for also being able to just afford it.

Cons:

-No more 401k/workplace savings plan with matching contributions from employer. I have around $12,000 in it right now and could roll it over to an IRA.

-I was very close to becoming salaried management that would have paid better than even this job, however, it would have been more agony and hatred for the job itself and being miserable, likely to the point where the money wasn't even worth it.

-My store manager would probably take me back in a heartbeat if this new job didn't pan out, but it would be restarting as part-time more than likely and that will not sustain me in where I live in any way, shape, or form.

-I had three weeks worth of vacation yearly that reset every April. I mentioned this to the new employer and am hoping against hope that they can match this when I complete the probationary period, but I have my doubts.

1f2uko3,"Junior colleague has threatened to report me to HR over being loud, boss and others said to ignore her, what do I do?","Ok so I am going to get fire over this,  but please before you shoot, read for a little context. This is really primary school stuff, but the threat seems quite serious...

TLDR: in a loud office I am being singled out by by junior lazy colleague for being ""loud"", she told me to shut up, I proposed to have a chat, but she went ballistic and threatened to go to HR, manners? Here for constructive feedback and critique discussion.

I (27M) am a specialist engineer in my shipyard, I work in an open space with 25 other people, part of them work on my project, part of them work on all projects with single designers allocated to each project.

My whole company is made of large shared offices and open spaces... And I have to say, we are away from the great mass, where superiors shout loudly and aggressively or the production come and scream to get drawings handed in...

Our ""loudness"" is more like having to do meetings in the office (we don't have meeting rooms with Internet...) dealing with supplier phone calls while having to be in front of a drawing on the PC or the occasional banter.... 

Enter new colleague (24F) who came in the office one year ago (experience is not basis for pulling her down BTW)... She cuts the clock with little extras (I don't mind), but she's often distracted, takes 5 cig and coffee brakes a day, often sick and also banters as much as my team does, now again, no issue, although her team leader has called her out in front of everyone repeadetly, and this is the catalyst for the following part...

Now, another (possibly?) interesting bit is that initially, we had a friendly relationship, to the point that she even asked me out (99% of local population is my company, so sorry, these things happen) and well, nothing happened, she started talking about her ex and few other guys that she was seeing, so I got the hint and moved on. Since then, (6 months ago) she stopped saying hi, and progressively became passive-aggressive.

I would be helping a junior modelling something with Rhino, she would snap around and give me a bad look. I ignored this until last month, where she texted me to shut up, I tried to be kind and asked her to tell me exactly when I was loud, but she just told me overall, to keep quiet... Again, I would tone myself, but observe how absolute chaos would blow up and she'd say nothing...

Now, today, my team is on vacation and I am covering for 3 colleagues, I need to take all their phone calls, and their phones are in the office... 

She texted me ""begging"" me to shut up... I pointed out my situation, and she just said to work for 3 but quietly... I told her to watch out with direct orders... She told me that ""everyone"" in the office dislikes my volume and that next time she would go to HR... *Screenshot*

One of my senior colleagues was next to me when this happened and he said that she's nuts, and has also noticed her behaviour towards me...

Later, just to be sure that I am not mad... I got one of her seniors, without saying what happened and asked if my volume was causing issues to the team, he said ""no, why?""

I forwarded screenshots to my team leader and he said ""ignore, keep grinding hard, don't engage in conflict"".

So yeah, I am really sorry that this is happening and I understand that our office is loud, I do question myself but literally I look around and everyone is loud AF, why me? I never had issues before she entered the picture.

1f2uhbl,Which Path Do I Take?,"So I currently work in childcare and while I love it, it leaves me stressed and overstimulated most days. By next fall I will be going back to college (was getting a degree in something childcare related, but dropped out because I wasn't sure it's what I wanted to do) and the degree I'm looking into is a Health Information Technology degree. Specifically to be a medical assistant, and afterwards getting a certification to be a medical office administrative assistant. (Yes, I know it's very different from childcare.) My cousin is an RN and I asked her about it, and she said I should become an LPN. I'm unsure if an LPN is a career I'd enjoy. I like office work and would prefer a steady schedule with the same hours every week. With either career path I'd make more than I am now as a childcare worker so the pay difference isn't a huge thing for me to consider. I'm unsure of which one is the best for me.

1f2tlaz,"Hey, I am 28 and have a post-grad in Psychology from a well-reputed University. Due to a huge career gap and lack of any form of guidance, I am feeling quite lost and low. Help...? ","I completed my Masters in Psychology from one of the top universities in my country in 2018. I always wanted to pursue Clinical, but got diagnosed with Bipolar disorder II immediately after. Recently discovered (diagnosed) I have adult ADHD as well. Um, well, being an extremely empathetic person, I discarded the desire to pursue Clinical (my psychiatrists' and therapists' advice, and my gut's). 

I had no idea what to do next. All felt lost. Never explored the idea of pursuing research in all my college years. Was very single-minded. Couldn't figure out which other specialty of Psychology to pursue. Ever worsening mental health and constant triggers weren't helping either. So, well, after a loootttt of struggle and breakdowns, in late 2021, I decided to apply for PhD in Neuropsychology. Had a topic in mind. Good topic. Frickin amazing topic. Since I never had an academic writing course in my curriculum and was never ever taught, so was lost and anxious again. Spent 3 years on my proposal, never knowing what to write, how to write. Just kept doing literature survey without doing any writing. Again, no guidance. Had so many breakdowns over it. Defeated, I dropped the idea. 

Now, I am thinking of doing Masters in Neuropsychology first because I want to be an absolute expert in my subject, before going for PhD. Going to start applying in October when admission portals open (Netherlands, Australia, etc). 

For that also, I need to write some writing samples or finish my proposal to get some edge because my resume sucks. And I still don't know how to write! I always think of writing some papers and I have exciting and brilliant ideas, but I just don't know how to. 

I dunno. I've just lost all my self-esteem. I used to be a top student in my batch always always and now even the worst of the lot have become therapists/assistant professors/completed their PhD. 

I have lost touch with all my professors and it's very embarrassing to ask for guidance after 6 useless years now. I just. 

Do any of you guys have any advice on how I can start afresh? Is it even possible now? Do I have any chance? I absolutely love studying and learning any thing and every thing, always have (although I struggle with initiating tasks and concentration). I still have a sharp mind (most of the days when not struggling with my mind and body). 

I am going to be 30 soon. This freaks me out every day. No prospects obviously. 1.5 years of irrelevant experience (and its extremely difficult for me to hold down a job). I don't even apply out of fear of rejection and discovering that I am dumb (although everyone says I am intelligent, I don't believe them at all). I don't even know what kind of job I can do. No research experience. Just my degrees and my mind and my passion. 

I can't put into words how awful I feel every single day. A failure. Letting down myself and my family. 
I know I am a pretty hopeless case, but could you help?

ive been working part time in a restaurant for over a year now. the work is great and i like my managers and older coworkers, but ive had a few problems with the coworkers my age (im 18 for context)

for context, all (and i mean all bar maybe 5/6 other girls) of the other younger, female employees i work with are all best friends, they hang out together outside of work and have group chats with eachother. i have a suspicion that they do not like me (stop talking when im around, blunt with me, rude to me, general mean girl activities) and also talk about me inside these group chats
recently, i was talking with two coworkers and one of them mentioned her upcoming 18th birthday party, she said that we were all invited and i had assumed this also meant me. for the next few weeks i used this as a convo starter, and everything seemed okay.

however, a few days ago, birthday girl pulled me aside and said i had been making people uncomfortable talking about her birthday, and that they assumed they werent invited since she had told me before everyone else.

i genuinely had no clue i was making any of these girls uncomfortable, i now have a feeling i wasn't actually invited and just assumed i was since i was there when she was inviting others.

ive always had a problem getting along with girls my age for basically my whole life, i also have a suspicion im neurodivergent, if anyone who has a better grasp of social queues than i do can tell me if i have done anything wrong please let me know, thanks!

However, I‚Äôm not entirely sure where to start with this transition, especially when it comes to the specific skills, certifications, or experiences that would make me a competitive candidate in SaaS.

2.	Are there any certifications or courses that would be particularly beneficial? While I have some college coursework, I‚Äôm looking for targeted learning that could help me stand out.
	
3.	How can I network effectively in the SaaS industry, especially while living in a small town? I‚Äôm eager to connect with people who are already in this space.

I've been working as a compliance auditor for about a year, and it's been going well. Initially, I took on a different role within the audit process due to a lack of available personnel. After a few months, I began training for my current role as an auditor. 

Recently, I've been asked to train temporary staff for the audit process role, but it seems the company is struggling to find a permanent solution.

Given that I would be balancing both roles, I'm currently earning $50k. I'm wondering if it would be appropriate to request a raise, considering that the company is having trouble filling the role and that my responsibilities would be split between both positions.

To premise this, I‚Äôm supposed to be a director found out that they hired me in at sr.

I‚Äôm having a baby in 3 weeks, my Sr. Director asked me to not take baby bonding which is supposed to be 16 weeks of paid leave. Instead he asked me to take 3 weeks of PTO and continue to stay connected. We went back and forth and I finally said I‚Äôll take 6 weeks of PTO up front and then take time off during holidays when things are slow such as Xmas and thanksgiving to minimize my impact. 

Now yesterday he told me that he wants me to consider a lateral role for 6 months to a year and put someone else in my position, I would lose my title but basically would have to do all of the other jobs besides the actual director duties. There was nothing guaranteeing I would get my role back nor any specific time table. Just an open ended thing. I‚Äôve been promised director multiple times but that kinda just stopped.

It doesn't matter who is there. He'll just go for it anyways. I'm the opposite - I am introverted, but I still advocate and use my voice in meetings. I am very much a leader on my team. I am experiencing difficulty acclimating to this shared leadership role with tall white guy coworker. Why? Because he's already taking away opportunities that would have otherwise been mine solely because he's raising his hand first. Before I can even get a word in, he's already hopped onto the opportunity. He also said something pejoratively about giving me more time to acclimate to the role. Which feels like a dig honestly because I'm already proven to be well-equipped for this role - I don't need time to acclimate. I just need space to access opportunities. And he hogs all of the attention, space, and opportunities. So where's the space for me? I feel frustrated by all of this because I know that this is going to keep happening over and over again.

1f2pkoj,How do you go to school and afford to live at the same time? ,"I wanted to be an ultra sound tech or radiology tech for years. The program requires you to take all your prerequisites and then go to school full time for 2 years. 

I see a lot of girls on TikTok say they graduated school in 2 years and make up to $80k-100k a year. 

No matter what school I choose, it says you must attend class FULL TIME. 

I am 29. I moved out of my parents house and both raised and took care of myself since 16 years old. 

If I go to school full time then nobody is going to pay my bills. How can I afford a roof over my head, car payments, and food? AND SCHOOL?

Are these people being taken care of by partners/spouses? Family? Like what the FUCK is the recipe? 

How are these people able to attend clinical classes full time internship at a hospital/clinic for 2 FULL YEARS without help? 

I do not and have not ever qualified for financial aid. I‚Äôve been paying out of pocket for college for years and I had to keep quitting college because I wasn‚Äôt able to afford a roof over my head. I always have to choose between going to school part time and work full time, or just work full time. 

There is no fucking way I can just go to school full time for 2 years. I have nobody to support me, help me, take care of me. Nothing. All I have is me. 

What do I do??? How did you do it ???? 

There HAS to be someone helping them! They HAVE to be living with family or have their spouse or partner helping them? There is no way you can go to school full time and PAID the school knowing we all need a home, food, gas, school supplies etc you name it .

1f2piqn,Worth taking a new job if planning on moving within a year?,"Hey y‚Äôall! 

I currently work as a mechanical engineer and have one year of experience in the field, all with the same company. I am undergoing interviews with a new company in my city and if offered, would likely be a raise (from $78k to between $85k-$110k). The job has less flexibility with hybrid work but would be more oriented towards what I want to do.

The twist is I am currently planning a move to New York/Chicago/Boston next summer as I want to try a new city while I‚Äôm young. Is it worth taking a job raise with a high chance (over 65% chance) that I would be leaving within the year? The chance to stay would be landing on that higher end of salary range and really enjoying the work.

1f2pgtb,Post-grad life/help,"Hi, everyone! I have read hundreds of Reddit posts lately and finally thought it's time to ask a question of my own.

I graduated from college in December with a degree in French and International Relations. Since this time, I have really struggled to figure out what I want to do. I'm about to start a job as a newsletter writer with a local nonprofit which I'm excited about. I've interned/volunteered at nonprofits in the past and love the humanitarian aspect of it. 

Though I can see myself working in this field long-term, there's a big part of me that wants to go back to school. Recent career dreams have included pursuing a law degree to eventually use in the nonprofit realm (immigration services or representing international clients who are experiencing persecution in their home country). My concern is that I am not a strong debater and do not see myself handling arguments with clients very well (INFJ here). For those who studied and practice law, have you used your skills in the nonprofit sector (or know someone who has)? Is it practical to go to law school if you have no desire to become a general attorney? What helped you decide to go into law?

Another dream is getting a PhD and teaching at the collegiate level. I have experience teaching younger children and have loved every bit of it! I guess my worry there is the lack of stability and job security (especially when looking to teach at a university). That said, I'm willing to put in the effort, but would love advice on whether to pursue a PhD right off the bat or perhaps work in a middle/high school setting before pursuing more advanced degrees.

For anyone else willing to respond, what would you advise I do? How did you handle the overwhelming feeling you got when realizing the ""world is an oyster""?  I truly appreciate and look forward to your responses.

1f2pep4,Equity research career advice,"i currently have 7 years of work experience. For 5 years i was in a risk profile working for major US banks when i decided to switch careers into equity research. After a lot of trying i got into a mid-tier research firm as an associate. Soon within a year my analyst left and firm did not hire any one for the role and they transferred his roles and responsibility slowly to me. Based on my performance they promoted me not to an analyst but to an intermediate role between that and i have the opportunity to get promoted to analyst position in the next 2-3 years.

However i now have an opportunity to work for one of the best research firms in the country and under an analyst that was rated as the top 5 in asia money. However, taking the role might mean going back to being an associate and loosing on client relations that i have built over the past 2 years with slim chance for a promotion at least in the foreseeable future.

I have to show her how to do things multiple times like submitting a vacation leave request because she seems to always forget. I will also write her emails that are 2-3 sentences long and she will immediately call me to ask me a question I already answered in the email, or she will ask me questions that take one second to google (like what BOEM stands for). 

She also complains when people ask her to update reports because she thinks they are a waste of time. Another time, she had an offsite meeting and I emailed her driving/parking instructions, but she ended up calling me on the road panicking because she didn't know where to go. I also notice she constantly interrupts and rapid fires questions to everyone around us before people even get the chance to finish their sentences.

However, I‚Äôve hit a bit of a roadblock. The VP on my team is a complete prick. He consistently gives me all the grunt work, even though there are male analysts who joined the firm after me.

I‚Äôm a 27F and am thinking of changing career fields. I graduated in 2018 with a bachelors in criminal justice. Shortly after I graduated, I got a paralegal certificate. I initially was between  wanting to be in federal law enforcement or going to law school.

However, after working as a paralegal briefly, I learned that law school was not in the cards for me. Needing a new job and wanting to try something different, I went into the nonprofit sphere. I started out front line work, was then promoted to a supervisor handling contracts and data, and now am a project manager in our company‚Äôs data and tech team. I really enjoy learning about technology, especially since we primarily work with Salesforce. Our team creates new custom objects and/or features so that our staff (almost 500 of them) can do their front of line work, and have a mechanism to store and track the data. It‚Äôs here that I‚Äôm learning that I‚Äôm perhaps more keen/intrigued by software.

So here comes the part where I need a little help. I want to make a shift, or feel like a shift in this direction is calling me. I just don‚Äôt know where to start.

1f2jsp9,Should I leave my current company? ,"Hi all, 

I got a job offer recently and could use some advice.

I am a data engineer with 3yoe in a mcol area.

I currently work for a mid-size software company and have been there for 2 years. I make 92k + 10% bonus based on performance which I‚Äôve always gotten at this point and was also promoted 2 months ago (went from 85k to 92k) I did ‚Äúcomplain‚Äù about the raise because I thought it would be more and my manager agreed. They said they would reevaluate the number in December. 

My current workplace has great benefits, great team and manager. Also has flexible pto which I know isn‚Äôt the best, but I‚Äôm taking anywhere between 4-5weeks a year and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do that at any other place. Great work life balance. The cons: hybrid work policy. I have to go in 3 days a week. Commute is not bad at all. Takes me 20 mins to get to the office and I don‚Äôt have to stay there 8hrs. Usually I‚Äôm in between 9 and leave around 2 or 3. 

I got a job offer as a sr. Associate in data engineering at a fortune 20 healthcare company. Base is 100k with no bonus. 4 weeks pto which is fine with me, and it‚Äôs fully remote. I was told by hr the comp was 96-99 and took the interview anyways. At the last step, the manager told me the comp was 99-110. So now I think hr was trying to lowball me. I got the offer for 100 and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth it.

New company Manager was super open and honest, and basically told me he wouldn‚Äôt be able to promote me since it‚Äôs a smaller department in a huge company, but he said people jump internally all the time. He only expects me to be in this role for about a year and then he‚Äôd be open with me moving to another role.

Both jobs have good security and good benefits with equal 401k matching. The part I‚Äôm unsure about is: 

1. How much better does it look on my resume to have a huge company that everyone‚Äôs heard of? Even if it‚Äôs healthcare related? 
2. Is it worth leaving a job I like with a good team for slightly higher base pay? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd leave for 100, but for 105 I would. Bonuses get taxed way too much and I don‚Äôt wanna rely on my current company to give me a raise in December 
3. Should I negotiate to 105? ",kamisama100,1,1.0,0,1724772167,2024-08-27 15:22:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f2jsp9/should_i_leave_my_current_company/,8,2024

","So I‚Äôm a 27M ,with an engineering background and working as a data analyst at a custodian bank.  I have been working for 3 years in this domain but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable about my situation as pay is not competitive enough . 
I have so many interests but I have narrowed down to finance and bit of analytics consulting. 

The thing is for any of the these to work in favour of me I gotta take the next step and that is a masters or an MBA . 
Initially I thought I would straight away do a masters in business analytics but after joining this financial firm I started getting interested into financial stuff too . 
I took up a 7 month course in quantitative finance and risk management to understand all the different asset classes and how they are priced using python and machine learning. I‚Äôm still halfway through the course . I like it too .
Also , I read about financial stuff and all seem so interesting but at the same time I have experience in analytics so I wanna make something big out of it . 
After lot of wasted time I decided to take up GMAT but couldn‚Äôt score good and now I‚Äôm preparing for GRE as I took a mock and although the score is not good but encouraging enough to get going. I couldn‚Äôt score good in CAT but I‚Äôm taking exams this year too as I don‚Äôt wanna leave anything to chance . 
I‚Äôm focused on getting a high score for now . 
But if you ask me which program I‚Äôm gonna apply I have different answers . 
Right now all I see for myself is MSBA  , MSc finance or an MBA with finance as a major. 
I gotta keep in mind the cost too .

The new company places greater emphasis on sales performance and client acquisition. In terms of Life updates, I have my first child expected in December.

1f2j6nr,Can I make a switch or should I just do it as a recreational hobby one day?,"Recommend a field please

Hey

So I'm a Management/Finance major in a developing country right now and I really just picked my course because of its ROI and because pursuing what I really wanted took way too much money/risk/schooling that my family to be honest, didn't really have. 

I was through and through a Genetics nerd and I really thought I'd change my mind to wanting to be an Impact Investing fund manager or someone who's researching stocks or companies in the Biotech sector. 

Didn't really happen. Now my goals are to go back into what I really wanted to do all my life. My dream I had in my second grade ‚Äî to be an engineer. Which is hilarious because that's really descriptive of the sort of nerd I am. 

I always loved genetics and to be honest I did Robotics a lot in high school ‚Äî I was the president of my school's club for 3 years as well. I thought becoming a robotic engineer is more plausible than a genetic engineer. 

However, my thoughts are always coming back to the love of my life. 

Currently I'm looking for product, strategy and management roles and would probably do well in them, but as I start to venture into my first job, I want to have a light at the end of the tunnel. 

I'm thinking Masters in Bioethics from Harvard. There's also Computational Biology and Quantitative Genetics that I would love to do but I don't think I'll have the pedigree for that. 

Please, please help me out with this. Once I get my degree I don't really want to think about the career prospects after it. I'll definitely manage something. Right now I just want to save up to be able to study something I love as an academic. 

I just cannot bring myself to build a deeper interest than I already have for Genetics without academic intent. It's very depressing. I really want the degree. Or just the hope for it. 

Please help me out if possible. Thanks!",RedditGPT5,1,0.6700000166893005,8,1724770688,2024-08-27 14:58:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f2j6nr/can_i_make_a_switch_or_should_i_just_do_it_as_a/,8,2024

1f2h6yv,"Frustrated with management at current company, but extremely bad market for remote jobs right now, what should I do?","I'm currently working as an IT product manager at a mid-sized retailer. The pros are it's fully remote (minus 1-2 forced trips to the head office each year), and the people I work with EXCLUDING managers are mostly great. That's where the pros end. Cons:

* Slightly below average pay
* Very little chance for career development as Sr PM is the highest title this organization has in product management
* No emphasis on professional development either as it's 100% about getting work done
* Tech stack is extremely unstable. Constant P0/P1 issues filling literally 50%+ of backlog. Upper management/execs constantly putting pressure on team to solve EVERYTHING immediately, yet refuses to add any resources to the team. We literally have 1.5 developers, as the junior dev is extremely unreliable. Execs apparently have this expectation that as the PM I should magically turn this sinking ship around with no budget, no resources, and no time
* Irresponsible management who, instead of coaching me and protect me from upper management, just relays their messages and tells me to get shit done before a deadline
* Weird tradition that low level employees like me should do presentations directly to C-suite, yet the senior managers/directors just sit in the meeting. It's a good challenge I guess? But seriously frustrating

Normally I would switch jobs in an instant, but the job market is extremely bad for remote work at the moment, even in IT. I've been actively applying for a few months now but only scored very few interviews. Due to a couple of personal reasons I'm only considering remote positions.

I don‚Äôt even live in the same state as the corporate office and never have (where she resides). She even mentioned she doesn‚Äôt think this will be a problem. 

I‚Äôm pretty certain that I don‚Äôt want to be the next CFO. I like having someone above me so that all the responsibility doesn‚Äôt fall on me. I think I‚Äôm pretty good at what I do, but I know I‚Äôm not to her level due to her experience. She‚Äôs also like 25+ years older than me. I know there are things in this job I‚Äôm not the most sharp in. That‚Äôs why I like having someone who can handle that part (or speak to it with auditors/consultants). 

I‚Äôm also certain that if I were CFO, I would have to travel more often (to the corporate office, board meetings, etc). That involves schoomzing people which I hate. I also hate travel and don‚Äôt want to increase it (my travel is like 1-2 times per year currently). 

My next promotion (before she retires) is Director. I‚Äôm happy with pay. Content with the day to day as I know it won‚Äôt differ much to what I‚Äôm currently doing. 

I have not told her that I don‚Äôt want to be the next CFO since she could just be saying all of this and nothing is guaranteed until I see it in writing.

- enrolled in masters degree program graduating June 2025. 

- have a 20 hr, part time job at my university in communications department 

- interviewing for paid internships in my line of study , have done more than 4 throughout my highschool-college years. 

- living with parents paying $200 a month to them and paying $60 towards medical expenses. On mom's insurance. 

- don't have a driver's license (bad anxiety driving but I live in a big city with accessible public transport/ I manage my own train/bus commute/fare ) 

My parents think I should be further in my career. They want me to get a full time job in the next 6 months and get my own apartment by the time I graduate. 

Obviously I don't plan on living with them forever and I plan on working full time when I complete my masters degree , but they want me to do a 9-5 during the day and do my classes at night. 

I dont have the funds to move out right now and the experience for a lot of these full time jobs because of my short time in college (graduated early from Bachelor's).

1f2fe8s,"Miserable in my job... got a different offer, declined for good reasons, asked to be reconsidered 2 mo later, need to decline again.","I feel like a total jerk. I tend to make emotional decisions that really come back to bite me. Roast me. 

5.5 months ago I left a job that wasn't perfect but I loved my workplace & coworkers & it paid well... to take a job as a vocational rehabilitation counselor. It's ruined my mental health (which I've had challenges with anyway, but now it's the second-worst it's ever been.)
The work is very complicated & involves a ridiculous amount of self-management and organization. Caseloads are high because no one wants this job. We can't hire any clerical staff to help. I'm isolated. I don't have the skills/knowledge needed to even do the counseling bit effectively. Employment isn't my passion and I don't have any training in it. I've been letting clients down a lot, framing things negatively, and fumbling everything. I'm avoidant, lazy, and my attitude sucks, which doesn't help anything. I'm on a probationary/training performance plan until next April, so I can't get fired until then unless I do something absolutely heinous... But I also don't want to do a bad job, because I need good references & don't like being a shitty employee (yet that's not enough to get me to change my behavior significantly?)

Anyway, I've been trying to leave since June. I was hoping I could return to my last employer, but haven't been able to get hired back on yet, despite applying to a few positions. I think I was too honest and cringey with managers there, they worry I'll just leave again, or they know I'm not the right fit for the many community case management jobs available (which isn't all I've applied to.) One of my former roles, that I really loved, was available at the end of July. I applied but never heard anything, which gutted me. I think I was overconfident and didn't put in a good application, or they didn't hire me because I was asking for too much money, or they worried I'd leave. I would've stuck with that job for like 5 years. I was really hitching my hopes on it. 

I'm getting scared that I won't be able to interview effectively anymore. I feel like my skills have atrophied. I have serious doubts about my ability to be organized and prioritize tasks. I do too much role-hopping so my resume raises red flags. 

I want a job where I can reset and refocus, but I don't have any savings, I have a ton of debt, and my rent is too damn high. I can't afford to take an easier job that pays less to get my mental health back on track. My parents could help a bit, but I can't like, move back in with them because they live in the middle of nowhere.

I applied for a remote (but local) crisis call center position back in June and was offered a job. I didn't take it because the compensation was too low, I didn't think I'd be able to successfully separate work & life while being remote, and having in-person coworkers is crucial to my mental health. The position has been reposted a few times since then, which I know is a red flag, but I've been feeling desperate to leave my current job & hopeless about getting something else, so my friend convinced me to email them asking to be reconsidered.

They sent me another offer but could only bump up the pay $1/hr (which would be $1.87/hr less than I'm getting now.) I took a real look at the benefits and realized that I will only get 80 hours of PTO per year (both sick & vacation) and no holiday pay (compared to 272 hrs total I get in this role) and my health insurance, dental, etc. will probably cost a LOT more for way worse coverage. I also want a job that provides a state pension, because I'm not vested in it yet and will lose the last 4 years of employer contributions if I'm out of the system for a year.

I know the job isnt right for me, but I feel like such an ass for asking to be reconsidered only to turn them down again. I worry about burning bridges with the people I know at that org (who had jumped ship from a crisis center I used to volunteer for.) At the same time, I don't want to set myself up for failure and financial struggles and job-hop again. 

Is there any way to I let them down easy/gracefully? I was gonna ask chatGPT but also wanted your advice about my whole situation. 

How can I survive this? I just turned 29 and I feel like I'm a failure and an embarrassment and I hate myself. I'm acting like a child.

1f2dvaz,Thoughts on my situation at work - IT / Public Sector / Changes to Hierachy,"\*Career Question\*  
  
Looking for some advice on how to deal with a new situation in the workplace, based in the UK, and for this reason, looking to stay anonymous.



For context: I work in IT as a Service Desk Manager, in the Public Sector, and have some neurodivergent challenges that I face.



The organisation I work for, are currently going through a restructuring at the top - then, will come down to us within the next month or so. Everything for me, arguably, is ideal. However, due to the budget constraints we have (we're not Private Sector), they're looking at amalgamating roles or teams into one.



My proposed new role would be that of a Service Operations Manager, but titled 'Coordinator' - responsible for the Service Desk, Asset Management and Security Operations. However, that's the role that I'm currently doing, but just paid less (yes, that happens all the time).¬†



The one thing that does not sit well with me, is the potential change of line management. My current line manager, is arguably the best I've come across so far and is doing the same learning path / degree that I am.¬†



I'm also concerned about how this will affect the team, who are very comfortable with how things operate because it may also affect their lines or chances of progressional also.



The potential new line manager is someone who i work alongside and I think is a great individual and respect them - but I would never see them as a line manager as I do not agree with their style of management or operating.¬†My question(s) is/are:



* Am I the a\*\*hole for being quite negative?
* Do I have genuine concerns?
* Do I have anything else to consider, or am missing anything?

1f2dfgk,Market Risk Management: Banking or Oil&Gas sector?,"Hello, I currently work as market risk analyst for a Bank, but I am starting to realize that, a part from regulatory changes, there is no fun in this sector. The daily analysis is repetitive and the FRTB/Basel 4 is the only entartainment that have been seen. As soon as the regulation will be implemented, every process becomes repetitive. I think there will be nothing more in the next future.



Furthermore, in my country the biggest banks are retail ones, then the credit risk mangement is always prioritized. I have been started some reading about it on my own, but I dont find it particular amusing (technical enough, but with a domestic pov).

I enjoy everything that is around market risk topics. But maybe the banking sector is not the right choice, even if I have always seen myself working in a bank.

What do you thing is the right sector in which market risk management is central? Do you think the answer could be the O&G sector? Is there someone with some personal experience? What are the main differences for a risk analyst in terms of career/salary/job culture between banking and Oil&Gas sector?

1f2cvrd,Am i a failure? What should i do?,"Hello everyone,
I come to this subreddit for advice on a situation I‚Äôm currently experiencing. I graduated around two years ago with a master‚Äôs degree and started an internship in a company shortly after. I was very fortunate to be offered a job in that same company. At first, I was so happy about the offer and started work with a lot of confidence. However, now after 4 months in, everything has changed. While my actual job duties are fine and I kind of enjoy them, the situation with my manager has changed drastically. During my internship, my manager was very supportive and understanding. She guided me and taught me a lot on the job. Now, when I got confirmed as an official employee, she doesn‚Äôt communicate with me at all. If I have questions on a certain job I was assigned, she will tell me (harshly) that she doesn‚Äôt have time for any of it. If I actually do a job (I‚Äôm used to and know), she will criticize me on why I didn‚Äôt talk to her beforehand. Every time I send an email, 50% of the time she will reply to the email (with all the recipients in the email) and tell them to disregard my work/job because there is an issue (by the way, most of the time her corrections are wrong and she knows it) and she does this without notifying me first. Of course, that is infuriating as I feel like my integrity is being damaged and my coworkers will not take me seriously. I tried talking to her multiple times about what I‚Äôm doing wrong or what I could improve, but each time she refused to tell me and focused on criticizing other things. I‚Äôve had her comment on my outfits (business casual) for wearing sneakers or a certain color at work. I‚Äôve had her comment on going to lunch, saying ‚Äúyou can skip lunch most of the time, you don‚Äôt need it every day.‚Äù I‚Äôve had comments on being ‚Äúa robot‚Äù because I clock in and out of work every day at the same time and how I don‚Äôt stay for overtime (unpaid, by the way).
Now I‚Äôm very confused about the situation. I feel overstressed and don‚Äôt know what to do. Am I that bad at this job? If I was this bad, why would she even hire me? I love my job, but this is making me feel like maybe it‚Äôs not right for me. Is it really my fault or the company? Any advice on the situation would be appreciated.",Clear-Interview-4893,1,1.0,5,1724751345,2024-08-27 09:35:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f2cvrd/am_i_a_failure_what_should_i_do/,8,2024
1f2cjjz,Looking for a career transition ,"Hey, so I am 27(F) and recently graduated with a MSc in Counseling Psychology from a university here in India. During the course of my traineeship, I was able to see clients for about 1.5 years and as much as I felt fulfilled in the role, it quickly started to burn me out and had taken a toll on my health as well (I am 5years post KTx). It also doesn‚Äôt help that pay in this field isn‚Äôt that great.

I am currently looking to transition into something that could bring in more financial stability. However, considering my age and how much I lack experience in anything other than counseling isn‚Äôt helping the case here. I have considered HR roles and UX research but even for internships they require some experience/education. It‚Äôs been quite an overwhelming experience and I am looking to talk to a career counselor soon. In the meantime, if anyone here has any suggestions or has had a similar experience, I would really appreciate if you could share!

1f2c3lb,Exposing toxic boss via email on last day,"Is it worth it? My boss is incompetent, emotional yelling at subordinates, poor work ethic saying things like as long as A makes money I get bonus, always kissing ass to superiors, blaming others for his wrong doing leading to some getting fired, deluded taking what others did for his credit, always talk shit about previous employees pretending to be morally superior. Common and wise advice is usually to just move on. However I realize this kind of person never gets exposed and leach off other people‚Äôs hard work taking things for granted which he does not deserve. Somebody needs to speak out I believe.

Many would ask for what? Just for the short term immediate emotional gain at the risk of some legal issue or reputational damage? Maybe probably yes to a degree. Cannot deny I am fucking upset. But why does it have to be so risky to speak out. Even ex-Trump executives write a whole book against the one of the most powerful person in the world. For my case it seems like nothing but still afraid of the ramifications.

Fyi although my boss stole my work and prevented me from speaking directly to his superiors or peers, I have made arguably significant progress for the team/firm and was shown recognition from some C level executives and significant (compared to market but underwhelming compared to the actual gain I created) recalibration of base and bonus accordingly.

1f2aa2r,Career advice ,"So I‚Äôm currently working in the pro sports industry and have been at my team for 5 years. I‚Äôve grown immensely and gained the respect of everyone within the organization and specifically within my department. I started from the very bottom of the totem pole and have worked my way up to a pretty good position as of now. Nonetheless, my former manager left and I took over the majority of his workload plus my normal workload and a few other tasks. I‚Äôve always had a can do attitude and love the grind but it feels like I‚Äôm a little stuck as I‚Äôm trying to get more into general management and have my focus in that realm and not have to do as much day to day tasks that are important but feel like I‚Äôve outgrown at this point of my career. 

Everyone appreciates everything I do and with me at the helm, everything runs smoothly operationally, logistically, etc, so much that no one ever questions what I do since they know they don‚Äôt have to worry about my job being done. I feel ready to continue ti ascend and delegate more of these smaller responsibilities to someone else and take the next step. I‚Äôve had conversations about my future already and what I want to be involved more in but how would you guys approach next year in terms of asking for a high salary, more benefits and more responsibilities that pertain to what I want to do and let go of the mundane tasks so I‚Äôm not being held back? 

I say this also because I saw what perks other people get in their contracts and I feel like I‚Äôve earned similar benefits at this point after proving myself this many years. Year in and year out I‚Äôve shown that any added work given to me hasn‚Äôt been an issue, others get assistants and I‚Äôve shown I can handle whatever it is they give me. Nothing but growth and positive remarks each year. How would guys convey this so that I can position myself in a better way to feel like I‚Äôm being compensated for all that I do?

I interviewed for two clinic jobs (I'm a nurse). My dream job was clinic #2, but after interviewing with both I only heard and received a job offer from clinic #1. Being without a job and scared of waiting, I accepted clinic #1s offer of a job.

This past Friday, I received a call from clinic #2 and they offered me the position. The pay is better, the hours, it's my dream job. Problem is, I accepted clinic #1 offer of employment.

I asked certain people in my life what I should do, and they said I should go to my first day to see if I liked it. Big freaking mistake. Even without clinic #2 offer, I am NOT a good fit for this job. It is very fast paced, more like a small ER than a clinic, and I purposefully left my previous job due to that environment (wanted something slower pace due to health issues). I told the people who gave me the advice and they said ""oh man, we were hoping you would love it because we don't really like clinic #2"" (personal reasons).

So now, I have zero idea how to handle this situation. I should have told them last week, no. I live in a small town, everyone knows everyone, and now I'm pissed because I might miss out on my dream job all because I didn't wait. I also feel bad because I feel like if I stay, they will put all this effort into training me, and I will just be leaving. Regardless of job #2, I don't want to stay at the clinic.

1f25vwk,Looking for some direction in which PT job could be a good option for lower energy people. Does anyone have any suggestions? Money is not my biggest concern.,"I'm 27 in AZ and am looking for a small job just to get a little extra income. For context, I have worked in fast food. I've done cleaning jobs, worked for the city, for a school, done private tutoring, babysitting, dog walking, Uber Eats, and more. I quit fast food because I kept being pressured to work more hours, and I was worked well past my abilities health-wise. Uber Eats started taking a toll on my car. Babysitting, tutoring, and dog walking were all temporary. The other jobs I had ended because I've moved a couple of times and had to find new jobs.
I have very low energy and strength due to my health. I'm looking for a part-time job and as I have said, I'm not concerned about the amount of money I'll be making. I'm really only looking for something small so that I can have just enough to pay for my insurance and other small necessities. I'm open to learning a skill or trade. I'm also open to doing many different types of jobs. I just need something with a few hours and is something suitable for people with lower energy levels. I've applied for jobs in office cleaning, home cleaning, art instruction for children, lash technician with training, aide, assistant, etc,... I haven't heard back from any employer, even after following up on my applications. I feel I am starting to run out of options. Any suggestions? Genuine suggestions only please.

1f25q51,Feeling diminished and disrespected. ,"42 year old female in journalism here. I‚Äôve moderated panels at industry events my company produces a few times a year since 2022. I‚Äôve probably done about 10 total, with audiences ranging from 40, to 200, to 900 people, both in the city I live and internationally. 

While I‚Äôve never been fully comfortable with public speaking and don‚Äôt particularly enjoy it, I‚Äôve pushed myself and I know I‚Äôve improved since I started. I‚Äôve received only positive feedback from both my coworkers and our clients. I‚Äôve also asked for formal public speaking training many times over the years and have always been told ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not enough budget,‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou can practice with your colleagues internally‚Äù (we‚Äôre fully remote lol). Re: Not enough budget ‚Äì these events bring in millions of dollars to our company and account for 1/3 of the company‚Äôs revenue.

We have our largest and most important annual event coming up in a few weeks. I‚Äôve moderated panels at this event the last two years, again with only positive feedback. Today, my boss (who I really like ‚Äì he was put in a shitty situation) told me that the CEO doesnt want me, or the other woman on my team (this would have been her first panel ‚Äì we wanted to get her on stage to grow professionally and I was confident she could deliver), to moderate the sessions we‚Äôve been working on for the last 6+ weeks. The two white men on my team (both my direct reports) and my white male boss, have been kept on. So I‚Äôve been asked to step down and stay behind the scenes, even with my boss and the president of the company trying to convince him otherwise. He said they both ‚Äúfought for me,‚Äù but it was the CEO‚Äôs final decision. 

On one side, it‚Äôs great to know I can relax for a bit and not stress about going on stage in front of hundreds of people in a few weeks. I‚Äôve been really burnt out at work and have been wanting to step back. This is my sign to either start giving 75% instead of 110%, or start looking for a new job. 

But the way this was handled is pretty devastating ‚Äì I‚Äôve been with my company for 8+ years. I‚Äôm friendly with the CEO and have given A LOT of myself to this company. I like my job and love the people I work with. But I was essentially demoted, and also told ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good enough‚Äù at something I‚Äôve been really pushing myself at these last few years. It feels so shitty, humiliating, insulting how this was delivered weeks before the event, especially since I‚Äôve never received any negative feedback prior to this, have asked multiple times for them to invest in training, AND with my male direct reports being up to his ‚Äústandards.‚Äù

The point of this post is mainly the vent and hear from others.",froufroufoxxes,0,0.5,0,1724724109,2024-08-27 02:01:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f25q51/feeling_diminished_and_disrespected/,8,2024

I have a diploma in Business Administration and majored in Accounting, I plan to return to school to get my BBA in the next year or so.

I have been everyone‚Äôs go to person for EVERYTHING since I started. I handle a portion of the marketing side - social media posting, blog writing, and partnership emails. I handle website editing, video editing, updating email lists, literally true list could go on and on and on. 

Until a couple weeks ago for the financial side of things I was mostly handling posting revenues and expenses and the Financial Officer did the rest.  They had brought in another financial assistant as the Financial Officer is getting ready to retire. The person they brought in was to handle Payroll, Budget Preparation, and all other month end duties other than preparing the financials- these are all things I was willing and capable of doing to begin with and this was communicated.

Person they hired didn‚Äôt work out and they fired them within two weeks. After they fired them I was given all the extra tasks and they are super impressed with my work. Yay! No. 

I found out the had hired on this other person for $40 an hour, was given a full set up to work from home and was able to make their own hours. And I‚Äôm upset about it. It isn‚Äôt like they don‚Äôt know I see how much everyone makes?

1f23c4z,When to move on?,"I have been with my company for 9 years now and have worked my way up to the Director level on the operations side. It has been grueling, as the company has doubled in that time as well. Lucky me, I love change and change management. Since the beginning of my employment here, I have lost a work life balance. The company is extremely demanding. We were born a reactionary company due to our services we offer but have grown and that style isn't the most effective for a large portion of our business. Every few years I decide to call it quits but right over the horizon is the change I have been looking for. 

We have mapped our workflows, developed the tools and created the buy in to begin our latest change, which is required to hit the next revenue level. At a certain point in time an organization must grow up, plan, and have discipline. Over the past 3 years we have have high level management changes and each time we are pulled further and further from our process. With this, we have an arm of the business that lacks the leadership and disciple to follow our roadmap  that control the chaos. 

I have began thinking these are all poor calls from the highest level in he organization. We are lacking stability and discipline.

In addition to this, we cannot add or even replace resoruces as we see fit. As a director I have less control and influence than I have ever had. Things  have gone backwards and it is drastically affecting my mental health along with my team. My team is by the book and knows when by the book doesn't work, they adapt and execute. They hold each other accountable and refuse to accept par. I have managed to keep the team together for 5 years but they are done. My faith in the company is gone, no one knows this yet. My team has expressed their loss of faith in the company years ago. They tell me they have faith in us, not the company


I am paid great, great benefits, best team. I provide oversight and am responsible for P&L, Safety and all Operations for 20% of our companies revenue. 10 direct reports and 70 indirect.

Please excuse me- I am an absolute wreck. 

1- I have a good career, excellent reference letters. Have been promoted multiple times. If I do get fired because they found out, how do I spin that in the next job interviews (once they are dismissed).

Reason I put Personality Type is because its pretty accurate. Just the careers that are usually suited for those aren't appealing to me.

Always done bad at school. Got terrible grades. Went to worst rated university after applying late to a course I've never studied. Dropped out because I was terrible at it, had no friends and hated it. Worked the past 4 years in minimum wage jobs, 2 of which were 0-hour contract jobs during pandemic.

I have always wanted a purpose in my life, I don't want to work 40 hour weeks to just get by for 40 years. I want a career I want to go to, I do not care about the money. HOWEVER, you need money nowadays to do anything, I can't even afford therapy ffs. Anyway, I am just not interested in anything. I know I know, I'm young, I'll figure it out, I haven't tried much. Look, I know what I like and I know what I don't like. I have scrolled though hundreds of different job titles and not one has ever stuck out to me, none have made me think, ""Oh that's interesting, I wouldn't mind doing that for a few years."". It fucking sucks. I want a meaningful life and career, but no passion in anything enough. Its like an ache in my heart, its hard to describe. Don't get me wrong, I have interests, but nothing I would want to do as a career.

Other friends have gone to Uni, in a job they don't love but it pays well and they don't think about it other that to pay the bills and after work they have the free time enjoy their cash. I couldn't do that, it would make me even more depressed than I already am. I mean I work full time, don't make enough to move out, don't make enough to save much, can't afford anything and can't get a better paying job cause I don't have a degree. I feel like apprenticeships are a waste for me specifically as I won't care about the specific field. Besides I'm now almost out the age range for them.

I just don't know what to do ngl. Like what would be the point in going back to Uni for a degree I don't care about? Who is even to say I would even get it, I'm not good at academic study. If anyone has any advice I'm open to hear it but honestly I'm more just wondering if I'm kind of the odd one out, or do a lot of people feel like this. If so, then damn, that's really sad.

Recently I was in a job done in english as well, but I got sick and I missed 2 days of work and they kicked me out as well telling me I didn¬¥t passed the ""trial period"" which a lot of my acquantainces say it¬¥s BS since I was really good and I do have the certificates that says I was really sick and only after that they fired me. 

As for my studies, yes I¬¥m in college again, but it was only because my ex boyfriend (who ended up being almost physically violent to me and blaming me for it) practically coerced me into studying again, since he was at the time about to get his degree and demanded me to have a degree and because the degree would be a certification that I have plenty of knowledge of english language I barely had money to study and he said his mother would help me with it only to back out from it after his mother showed she didn¬¥t approve of me.

1f209bn,I grew from an entry-level position to a de facto digital marketing team lead. I was told to be patient and wait for my turn for a promotion.,"I \[26\]M joined the present group of companies fresh from volunteer experience and an internship.

In two years, I've grown tremendously in experience. I've gone from being a graphics designer to handling the entire Digital Marketing Unit for a mini-conglomerate of four companies. Before my boss left, I was responsible for the day-to-day operation of the unit while shouldering creative roles for three companies and supporting my other teammate for one. I helped with meetings and presentations, handled data collection and record-keeping, performed first-line customer support on 9+ social media channels, and was naturally both the content creator and social media manager. This meant working nights and weekends, pulling all-nighters on consecutive days and making up for poor planning. 



As you can probably guess, I was no stranger to falling ill. I've learned to pace myself now, and my health is better.

When two team members left for better opportunities (and needless to say, most of their responsibilities fell on me), their departure halved our already small team. I've grown dissatisfied with the need for more investment in the resources we need to meet the expectations placed on us. There are no plans to replace the lost talent in-house, and our digital marketing budget barely exceeded $500 for the past half year.

Yes. For. 4. Companies.



I've got a fantastic work relationship with my sole teammate and everyone I regularly interact with at the company. A lot of the things I do are activities I've learnt on the job through learning, discovery, or volunteering to solve problems for others. 

That said, my additional responsibilities have yet to be recognised with benefits, pay or solid strategy implementation by the management (despite several suggestions, presentations, extrapolations from data and real-world examples).



Before my boss left, he recommended me for promotion at every biannual appraisal cycle. It didn't happen. At our last appraisal exercise, the Chief Marketing Officer also recommended me for promotion. Still, nothing.

This year, I had a frank discussion with the CMO, asking what milestones I needed to achieve to bag a considerable raise. He laughed and said I needed to be patient. Promoting me would ruffle some old feathers...strangely.



An ex-colleague asked for my resume a couple of weeks ago, giving me a glimmer of hope. But her company turned me down because I lacked the 'experience' for a Digital Marketing assistant manager. 

This has shaken my confidence, and I'm a bit lost. It seemed like a natural step forward. From the responsibilities in the job post, I was confident I could learn what was needed quickly.

1f1zkg6,19 y/o aspiring UI/UX designer: choosing between University or jumping straight into the design industry.,"Based in the UK. I‚Äôve been passionate about design and creating visual components since I was an early teen. When I was 16, thanks to a friend of my dad‚Äôs, I got a summer job at a small to medium-sized company that designs mobile games and apps for some well-known clients that many of you will have heard of. Despite the initial opportunity coming from a cheeky bit of nepotism, the staff there genuinely liked me and appreciated my work from the start. The next summer, I went back for another couple of months, and last September, after finishing college at 18, I decided to take a gap year. I ended up working almost full-time for the company in what was basically a freelance role as a User Interface Designer with some Graphic Design work sprinkled in.

Now, at 19, I‚Äôve got way more work experience and some solid projects under my belt than 99% of people my age in the design field. The senior designers at the company have even said they‚Äôd love for me to stay on, and last week we had a formal meeting about keeping me on as a full-time employee. They‚Äôve had other freelance designers come and go over the years‚Äîsome twice my age with bachelor‚Äôs degrees‚Äîbut they still seem to prefer me for the role (probably because I'm cheaper, lol, but that‚Äôs beside the point).

Here‚Äôs my dilemma: Do I go to university and do a 3-year degree in Graphic Design, or do I take up the full-time job role and fully enter into the industry without a degree? 

Obviously, if I choose university, it‚Äôll take up a lot of my time and I won‚Äôt be able to work at the company in the same capacity as before (if at all). I‚Äôve always hated the idea of getting into huge debt and being tied to a three year course, but previously thought that going to university was simply something that everyone had to do to get a good job ‚Äî I obviously now know that‚Äôs not the case at all. However I‚Äôm aware that a bachelor‚Äôs degree can often be a prerequisite for landing higher-level jobs in the future, so I also don‚Äôt want to lock myself out of reaching that goal in the future. My dream is to eventually work as a UI/UX designer at a FAANG company. Of course that‚Äôs just a dream and it‚Äôs all baby steps at the moment, but I‚Äôm trying to make the decision with that in mind and will choose whatever will bring me closer to that goal.

Thank you if you‚Äôve taken the time to read this and given me some advice, it is much appreciated.

Currently it's where I should be. The scope of work is manageable and got a lot to sort.

Yes I do want to progress further up the chain to the next roles or get certified. I'm aware there is a wealth technical training platforms websites and rather doing external training learning new code or a new platform is there.

Suppose when they ask you where do you see yourself in 5 years that's where your roughly aiming towards.

So for me I'm thinking about Project Engineer Support or Jamf Administration or Intune Admin.

I'd like to mentor staff below me if they come into the business eventually. As I've been there only a matter of months and I'm still getting my head around the IT processes and procedures plus we are separating away and setting up our own shop as such I've been given the opportunity to utilize my previous experiences and skillset to develop.

My main question how should I research or come up with goals or objectives that would improve the person the business and the role.

I suppose I'm used to managers providing objectives for the year. Rather than which direction do I see myself in the first 3 months.

Although there's an opportunity for a new career making around 130k a year. 7k sign on bonus first week on the job. Which sounds too good to be true. Great benefits as well. Time in a half after 8 hours. Double time on your 1 day off. That's the catch. It's a mandatory 6 day work week for the entire year. I'm torn between on what to do. Considering I'm 24 and feel like where I'm currently working at. I'll never truly achieve my goals. I mean 800 a week after taxes and deductions truly isnt much in the grand scheme of things. Besides I could pay off all my debts with that sign on bonus besides my car in a week. Maybe some advice on how I should pursuit this ?

1f1ytoo,Next Steps after Company Layoffs,"My company recently announced that they are laying people off. I was not directly impacted by the layoff (I still have my job there for the forseeable future). I'm very concerned because these layoffs happened in such an discomforting way. We were told in July that due to a deficit there would be a hiring freeze across the company, but that layoffs werent an option. Then pretty soon after (literally a couple of weeks), people were notified that they were being laid off.  

Even though I wasn't laid off, I am still quite nervous about the future here. We're being told that after this layoff, no other layoffs will happen. Its hard to believe that given how rapidly things progressed. I've only been employed by this company for 1 year, so I can reasonably assume that if another layoff happens, I'd be next  - based on how decisions were made this time.

I've started looking for new jobs and have interviews lined up, but I am wondering if other people think I am overreacting here. I know a lot of this boils down to how risk tolerant one is ( I have very low risk tolerance in situations like this lol) but I don't want to make a rash decision especially given my short tenure here. 

Also: acknowledging this is a new reddit account created to ask this question here.  I wanted to be more ""anonymous"" since I used reddit quite often.

I've been wanting to get into any industry where i can I) make my own schedule  (similar to a courier or an independent contractor) & II) that wont require $1000s in school loans - only type im against is OTR (I wouldnt mind OTR but I'm not a fan of semis, i don't have the visual awareness for semis, box-trucks I could but not the semis, too big), 

Something i can get into quickly & doesn't require a ton of schooling or red-tape if that makes sense, my background: ive been in retail-management since i was 18, current TWIC card, working on the clearance card (AZDPS BLOWS when it comes to anything so I'm still working w/them to send it to me ugh) have BBP, HIPAA & CHEMO certs from an accredited logistics source, have recently applied for my CCW, I am in the works on obtaining a security card & taking either an EMT or advanced first-aid class so far. 

I'd be open to ANY suggestions no matter the industry as long as the path to employment isn't years long, the pay rate is at least 4-5K salary OR $23/hr+ & again, has an open schedule, I'm more social than average, i'd prefer ""blue-collar"" work like logistics but im not picky, I'd consider anything that isn't semi-driving or high-ticket selling, computer work, blue-collar, anything, I am desperate!

1f1ybfg,Quit before write-up?,"I work in the auto loan refinance industry and I can tell that I'm on track to be written up at the end of this month due to poor performance (PIP). I've been with my company for over two years and have never been PIPed in my life. Over the last couple of months, there have been a mountain of changes to the company, from day-to-day pipeline management of my clients to the parameters of being written up for poor performance. Only a month or two ago, I would have been considered a slightly above average salesman, but now I find myself struggling with the changes and new expectations that seemingly happened overnight.  
  
From my job hunting experience, I seem to remember that a common question that came up was whether or not you have been written up in the last 3 months, 6 months, etc. Do companies actually take the time to vet the answer if you lie and say you're not written up? Is that even legal? In in Colorado if that's relevant, I've heard (from unreliable sources) that the information the HR team at the hiring company can try and collect is pretty limited. Like, they can only basically ask about your starting date, end date, and maybe whether you were fired or quit, and if you gave 2 weeks notice before leaving. Just factual stuff like that. In my case, I'm currently able to honestly say I'm not written up, but I can't give two weeks notice before leaving.  
  
Assuming I will end up leaving the company that I'm with currently, what do you guys think my best options are? Should I leave before I sign any documents saying that I was written up? Should I sign and accept the write-up then give two weeks notice next month? How do I minimize the damage for the job hunt?

However, every single year I get overlooked for promotion. When I ask why, my boss always talks about my social awkwardness, my problems with social cues and how I can be hard to talk to. He says I need to work on these before I can be considered for promotion. 

The above issues are all part of my autism. But I can‚Äôt become less autistic. I‚Äôm not suddenly going to wake up one day and get better. I‚Äôve asked if there is a way for me to advance without having to become a direct manager but have been told that is not an option.

I am really considering just leaving my job. However, the problem is I will just experience the same issues at a new workplace. I just feel like I am stuck and I‚Äôm never going to advance because of my problem.

1f1x31w,can an MSME from a clean energy focus be applied to carbon dioxide removal? ,"I'm applying for grad school in December and plan to major in Mechanical Engineering.

Is there a subset of clean energy that could be applied to CDR? I'm thinking energy generation, energy storage, or even a general focus on pumps and efficiency? 

I've had several people look over my personal statement too and the feedback I get most often is ""how does ME help you achieve this? why not materials or chemical engineering?"" and honestly I don't know how to answer that.

1f1wyvs,Should I go for a master‚Äôs in the USA with work experience only in a different field?,"I graduated with 2 degrees in Brazil, Law and Computer Science. 

I‚Äôve been working as a lawyer for a year now and want to make the switch to CS. 

I have no previous internship in CS, only projects I did while in college. 

I‚Äôve been wanting to study abroad since high school so I have enough saved for tuition and a 2 year period (given I work part time), but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a good idea to go since I don‚Äôt have work experience in the field and it might make finding a job after graduation hard/impossible (I would need sponsorship, above all). 

Of course I will try to get internships during my studies, but I‚Äôve seen so many natives/permanent residents struggling to get even internships and that makes me a bit skeptical. 

Other than CS, I consider a master in Financial Economics or Financial Analytics - I have experience running the financial part of my family‚Äôs business and in tax law, that deals with finances a lot, plus experience during my undergrad in the financial part of projects, so it might be a safer option.

My one idea was to take something pre-med (health sciences) and go to med school. The only downside is I'm not entirely sure about committing 10+ years of my life to becoming a doctor, as I really want to travel and have personal time. Health sciences is also not a good degree on its own if I don't end up going to med. If this works out though, the pay cheque would be pretty nice

My other idea was to go into business, and potentially go into law school after. I am probably more interested in this career path.

The downside with this is that a lot of people say business/law are very over saturated rn, and the ROl for the average lawyer especially is very low in terms of income and work-life balance.

Overall, my career goal is to have a standard 9-5, earn a pretty good salary, and enjoy life.

My current foreman is quitting due age, and he has been teaching me for the last 4 months what he does behind the scenes.  How he handles certain things and all that.   The factory i work at has certain time to deliver certain things. If something changed priority the factory mananer lets me/current foreman know and i try to move things around so the plan goes smoothly, if something breaks or something isn't how it suppose to be i let the factory manager know.   If an employee who i'm in charge of is sick or late they will have to call me and i have to move people around so certain machines can be on time.   So far i'm making little more than 9300 usd before taxes, thats with working 173.3 normal hours a month and  30-32 hours overtime on top.  


I wil be in charge of 15 people,  if i take over the foremans job i  have to make sure everything works properly, that the machines are adjusted correctly, i would have to stay late to help fix or stay longer to adjust the machine before next wool goes through and make sure it's good before i leave, it has to be at certain weight and strength also has to be good.  Basically i have to be ready to deliver the wool at set time, the colour is correct and make sure people have something to and that they are working.  Also if the machines are not adjusted correctly the wool can be too thick, too light and not strong enough causing us to have to make it again which will make the company loose money.  It happened 1 time this year early when the foreman left on vacation for 2 weeks and 1 guy was suppose to change and make sure everything was good, it wasn't and the company who bought the wool resend it and we had to make it again and we lost over  140k usd



I  know by the law the raise is suppose to be 15% higher than the people i am in charge of, but i don't know how much some people make here.

I have been working in banking industry in the Netherlands nearly 7 years, first in treasury and currently as a market risk specialist, I stepped into this new position more or less 6 months ago and I realized I don‚Äôt really like it!
In general  the culture in this bank doesn‚Äôt fit with me, a lot of micromanagement, daily stands up, planning and planning and planning‚Ä¶all looks so ineffective to me plus I have like the feeling I‚Äôm just fixing all the sh*** they don‚Äôt want to do or forgot to do in the past.
I probably understand that at this point of my life I would like more having a job of communication rather than spend time every day on spreadsheets, but I‚Äôm a bit clueless about which positions and industries would be a good fit given my background (mostly quantitative but good communication skills)
Any suggestions? Thanks :)",Daniele0691,2,1.0,0,1724687647,2024-08-26 15:54:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f1rmt5/considering_on_switching_out_the_banking_industry/,8,2024

1f1rcbq,"Bypassed Promotions, Silent Rejections, and Harassment","This is a throwaway account since my coworkers know my main one.

I am at a loss. A real loss. I honestly don't know what to do with myself anymore. I've been working almost non-stop since I was 15. I started college around that time but gave it up because it wasn't teaching me anything I didn't already know (I'm in the USA). So, I've been working for almost 14 years now. I've been with this company for 3 years, and I've been passed up for promotion three times despite doing more work than anyone else. My specific group at this company hates men‚Äîliterally, I'm not kidding‚Äîand assigns all the work to them while they do nothing (I won't go any further into that, but there's a lot of harassment and more to it). All of my ""counterparts,"" whom I am assigned to work with, keep getting promoted despite me doing their work, and the audit trails clearly show this. I wanted to go to HR about the harassment, lack of promotion, being underpaid, etc., but I found out my manager is friends with the entire department.

Recently, a job opened up in the same company but in a different department. This job was supposed to be my way up since I could actually use my knowledge from outside work to apply it to my job. That means I could bypass the degree requirement and everything (Bachelor's degree or 4 years of equivalent experience). I was stoked, to say the least, since I had 12 years of experience in the subject. I had 4 interviews, with the final one going all the way up to the director. All the interviews went well. Then came the waiting game. I've been waiting months to hear back since the manager I initially interviewed with was trying to get 2 positions opened up. Not a word. This morning, I saw my emails and found out that one of the coworkers I do all the work for, who was just recently promoted, got the position I applied for. She has no experience whatsoever in the field. Seeing that honestly killed whatever happy feelings I had.

Before all of this, I reached out to a professional (a real professional, not some rando on Fiverr) to get my resume reviewed. They even said it was one of the best they've looked at in terms of people asking them for help. He said it was fine as is and asked me to show him my LinkedIn. Again, I did a great job on that. He asked if I had any questionable images or posts on my socials, and I really don't use any except Reddit. There's nowhere on them that identifies me unless I explicitly say it's mine, and even then, it's mostly video game related. So, I am all good.

What I want to know is how do I navigate this market that's so stagnant and dead? Should I just start being the total opposite of who I am as a person and start lying on my resume? As long as I get the work done the way it needs to be done, there shouldn't be an issue. I just can't think of what else I need to change about myself, other than the pointless degree, to actually start being accepted and promoted at places. Does anyone have any advice or guidance?",Consistent-Whole-651,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1724686926,2024-08-26 15:42:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f1rcbq/bypassed_promotions_silent_rejections_and/,8,2024
1f1qzja,What should I do as an analytics leader when I like my company and my job but I have challenges with my leadership and want to progress my career?,"I am struggling and need some advice. I have been with a company for close to 15 years between business operations, IT, and currently data analytics. I did business intelligence (BI) for about 4 years with 2 years as a manager of a BI team, my favorite job. 

My team and I were moved to a new department and now does data science. I've been in this new role for about 20 months. The work is very new to me and I have technical gaps but I enjoy it. My leadership team is challenging to work for though. They are not good at developing talent. When I asked for help to build a development plan I was told to Google it. I was also told to get higher education, i.e. masters degree, which is not realistic currently.

I am not being considered for promotions in my new org for roles I am qualified for due to politics. I am now being recruited by former colleagues in the business operations space. Should I push through challenging leadership that I don't trust to grow in data science, which seems it will push me to a new company, or do I take a lateral move back to the business and pursue promotions with less of a data focus?

Current in marketing. I have an opportunity (nothing in writing) with a start-up. They don‚Äôt have anyone in marketing right now (the hire ups are treating it like a side project) so I would own the strategy & execution and have a lot of responsibility and creative liberties. However, they‚Äôre adamant about the candidate being in the office 3x a week and I literally just moved 2 hours away from this office. 

I could drive the 2 hours down Monday mornings, then stay at my in-laws Monday and Tuesday night and drive the 2 hours back on Wednesday after work - but is it worth it? If they meet my salary demands it would be a 20k pay increase, and I would want it in writing that come spring 2025 (after their product launch) I would need to go down to 2 days per week. 

Any advice? 

I worry about my mental health as I really need routine to stay on track.

1f1qh2l,What should I do? Need guidance,"Hello everyone, I need opinions about my situation. I work as a plc programmer at a small company, salary not so high, sometimes we have to travel for projects in other countries and a little stressful.

Meanwhile, in my free time I prepare for a career change, engineer role to another one, towards embedded. I bought an oscilloscope, other electronics components, STM32, I prepared the setup in my room. I have all these at home, but what if I need to go in a different country as controls engineer and work 10h 6 days per week with shifts? I worked like this 2 months in a country and it was hard.

In my area there's only one company which may have an electronics engineer as a position, but based on the reviews it's not so good but it's much closer to home (15 min vs 30-35 min).

I can find other jobs in my area but it's limited and it would not be an engineer position. I don't know how much it counts vs if I gain knowledge and make projects on my own.

On Linkedin most of the offers that I receive are based on plc's and I'm tired of these. But if I have the gap, I don't know what to add or if my projects would be good enough to prove that I'm capable.

I don't want to move to another city because I plan to save up money and after when I will be prepared enough, I will apply and move to a different country for this field.

1f1qgnh,Student pilot with bachelors. Do I look or other opportunities or stay at Starbucks for now?,"For context, I'm a 28yr old shift supervisor at Starbucks and a student pilot (doing my CFI training so I'm almost done). My end goal is to become an airline pilot but also be prepared with a backup career if things don't workout.

Early this August I got my degree in Technical Communications (paid for by Starbucks) and I originally wanted to transition to a job doing documentation in an aviation related field while I complete flight training, but two things have happened.

* Documentation jobs in aviation require a governement clearance or require experience which I don't have (DITA, Agile, etc). And frankly, I'm burnt out from flying, doing a bachelors, and working. Also, most of these jobs have the typical 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule, which doesn't accomadate flight training.
* I was promoted to shift supervisor at a different store which perfectly aligns to my preffered work schedule (Fri-Sun). The store also makes better tips, so on top of the pay raise, I'm pretty comfortable money wise.

I've been thinking a lot about leaving Starbucks because I feel stagnant and I want to utilize my degree, but they've made my current situation very comfortable in terms of accomadating my flight training and finances. I've also gotten back into going to the gym regularly and seeing friends.

*However,*¬†if you're familiar with the FAA or flight training, then you're aware that there can be delays up to three months between exams or lessons for a variety of reasons (weather, maintence, illness, instructor leaves the country, etc). These delays with flight training is what allowed me to get my bachelors done in about a years time in the first place.

The big question I have is:

**Should I stay in starbucks and focus solely flight training, despite the time it might take?**

*OR*

**Should I begin taking certification courses to stand out as an applicant and look for that ideal, remote part time job? Possibly at the risk of lower pay.**

(I'm fully aware the current state of the economy doesn't help option two). ",EezyBake,1,1.0,0,1724684736,2024-08-26 15:05:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f1qgnh/student_pilot_with_bachelors_do_i_look_or_other/,8,2024

1f1p5oq,Can anyone relate my situation? Boss who is scared to manage employees and has no vision. ,"Advice - troubling situation at work

Hi all, 
Curious if anyone can truly relate or give advice.
I work at a corporate company and my office is located in Germany. My boss is American and sits in the US. I got promoted into a global position the same month that I notified my boss that I was pregnant. I was out of the office for 10 months maternity leave , so I never really got to jumpstart my new role. Now that I‚Äôm back from maternity leave it‚Äôs time to get started on my job, but the job is a new position in the company so we need to build it from the ground up. During my leave, there was no progression on my role and it was basically frozen. I‚Äôve met with my boss a few times since I‚Äôve been back, but he has no plan of action for the role and every time I try to suggest the way I see the role or where I think the role should go he totally dismisses me. He‚Äôs very distracted and starts every meeting with ‚Äúhey let me finish this quick email‚Äù and he‚Äôs always looking at his phone and not engaged in what I‚Äôm saying. He‚Äôs also a bulldozer when it comes to talking. He talks about himself non stop and doesn‚Äôt give room for me to task questions, elaborate, learn, etc. He‚Äôs also made quite a few comments about me being a short timer or a full on German mom (meaning that I will stop working or become a part time employee). My daily tasks are slim to none at the moment and I know he notices because he made a few comments but yet when I tried to raise tasks for myself, he seems hesitant and worried. I can‚Äôt tell if he doesn‚Äôt trust me or if he‚Äôs scared to move because the role is new and he‚Äôd have to explain it and promote it to other departments/leadership. 
He has no vision - he has no plan and meanwhile, I am feeling stuck. I thrive on output, organization, and wins and at the moment I‚Äôve got nothing. I feel held back and not sure where to go. I also feel as though I‚Äôm being a little bit, held back and penalized for being on maternity leave. Anyone relate?

First! The background 
I am currently studying for my last year in a polisci/philosophy combined bachelors in an unranked University in my field, I started during high school and continued during my mandatory service and it was a good fit due to being extremely flexible and accommodating.

I am considering moving to Europe for either the end of my degree or my masters as I have a dual German citizenship

I will likely pursue a masters in either public policy or international relations

Now the questions:
How can I improve my ability to move to a better university for either the rest of my bachelors or my masters? I feel this is critical to fulfilling my ambition and being successful in the future. 

Advice on career path:
If i pursue international relations I am unsure about career paths 
I keep hearing that there's a lot of jobs in the private sector but a lot of it is from Americans referencing defence contractors, I definitely will not get a US clearance as I served in my country (I do not have a clearance here)
I also don't understand the career paths available despite extensive research and am hoping someone with experience in the field will be willing to answer some questions

I just received the contract for the secondment (it‚Äôs only a 6 month cover while someone is on leave) and there is no salary increase. I queried it with HR (who sent the contract) who said they presumed it had been discussed during the interview (it wasn‚Äôt at all, which I now realise is my fault - though I‚Äôve done a secondment within my company before and was always properly rewarded for it, so I stupidly trusted/presumed the same would happen).

1f1l2m7,LIFE ADVICE PLEEEEASE - DO I STUDY LAW?,"okay so i‚Äôm currently in my 1st year of Business Management at UQ and i‚Äôm considering swapping into law or adding it as a dual degree starting next year. 
i had previously never considered studying it however i‚Äôve started in admin at a law firm and am actually quite interested. 
i have always felt very passionate about injustice and inequality in the world and i love the thought of being able to help people experiencing this and advocate for what is right. 
i am a bit worried though that i may have a glamorised view of what being a lawyer is really like as there is only so much i get to see being in admin. 
im also tossing up whether it is worth it to do a science degree (in a biology/animal area) or psychology as i LOVED biology in school and did very well in it. my only issue though is financial and job security as ik these industries are often not well funded by the government and jobs are very competitive. 
being financially secure in life and setting myself up for success is a massive priority for me because of experiences growing up - i‚Äôm thinking that law will provide me with this though hopefully?
LASTLY law may also be a smart move for me financially and career wise as my Uncle owns the law firm i‚Äôm currently working at and i have cousins who r also lawyers so im hoping that i could make connections through them. 
PLEASE give me so advice and tell me about your experiences!! <33",anindecisivelibraa,2,1.0,0,1724668882,2024-08-26 10:41:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f1l2m7/life_advice_pleeeease_do_i_study_law/,8,2024

1f1kepo,From ESCP Bachelor to MBB in London,"Hello everyone.

I am a 2nd year Bachelor's student in Management at ESCP. Spare the roasting, I've read enough reviews about the program. I had no idea what consulting was up until a year ago, or what a target school was, so I chose the BiM at ESCP for a multitude of personal reasons, although I had the high school grades for most if not all target schools in Europe. It is what it is, this stuff happens and it's not the end of the world, just trying to become as strong a candidate as possible now.

After a year at ESCP, I've decided to pursue a career in consulting. I did my first year of the BiM in London and would love to go back, so am wondering what master's degree to pursue in order to do that.

I've been told that pursuing a MiM degree after a BiM is somewhat redundant (does that rule out the¬†LBS¬†MiM for me?), but what other options do I have? I don't really want to do finance btw. I see¬†LSE¬†has some interesting degrees, like the MSc in Management & Strategy, or Imperial¬†has MSc in Economics¬†& Strategy for Business. Do they place¬†well in MBB? What are some other MSc degrees in the UK for¬†MBB Consulting in London?¬†Anything in Oxbridge? Could one, hypothetically, land a London¬†MBB¬†job after a master's degree from HEC, HSG or Bocconi?

Here is my profile if that helps. I have only completed one year of uni so it obviously is lacking in some aspects:

GPA: 3.8/4.0 (top 2% of my class)

Experience: recently completed a Project Management internship at a sports media company in Italy, also worked for a well-known Italian sports magazine for a year leading up to that

ECs: currently part of a consulting society at ESCP called ""JET"", and recently had an interview with 180 Degrees Consulting (which I gather is fairly well-known in the consulting world) and am waiting to hear back from them (fingers crossed). I'd like to combine the two throughout this upcoming academic year (provided I do get into 180 DC)

Languages: grew up trilingual with Italian, Russian, English. Fluent (C1) in French and have basic knowledge of Ukrainian (which I am aiming to become fluent in by the time I graduate from ESCP in 2026). Are there some English-speaking offices in Europe apart from London that are open to foreigners? I am an EU citizen so no¬†visa¬†problems btw.

As for GMAT, my goal is honestly the highest score I can possibly achieve. 735+? Is that realistic? If I graduate from ESCP in 2026 and¬†aim¬†to start my MSc straight after that, what should be my GMAT timeline and my general application timeline?

Just wanted to thank in advance the people that are going to respond. This is a long post with tons of questions. I am just somewhat lost. Your help is very much appreciated, thank you thank you thank you.",ciarsby,1,1.0,0,1724666323,2024-08-26 09:58:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f1kepo/from_escp_bachelor_to_mbb_in_london/,8,2024
1f1jrav,When Should I Follow Up on Rescheduling a Second Interview After My Contact‚Äôs Vacation?,"Question:
When should I follow up on rescheduling my second interview after my main contact (let‚Äôs call him Mike) has returned from vacation? Should I send the follow-up today or wait until tomorrow morning, or wait for him to reach out to me?

Situation:
I had a virtual interview for a Project Manager position on July 22nd with Mike. During that interview, Mike asked about my availability for a potential second interview if they decided to move forward. I informed him that I had commitments at the end of July, so he said the second interview would need to take place at the beginning of August. He also mentioned that this interview would be with his father (the company owner) and the team, as Mike would be on vacation during that time.

On July 31st, Mike emailed me with possible time slots on August 8th and 9th for the in-person interview. I chose August 8th, and the interview was scheduled and confirmed via a calendar invite. However, on the following day, Mike emailed again to cancel the interview due to a scheduling conflict and said he would get back to me as soon as they had new date suggestions.

On August 2nd, trying to be proactive, I sent an email asking if the August 9th time slot was still available, but I didn‚Äôt receive any response, and there was no out-of-office reply. Since the interview was supposed to be with his father and the team, not Mike, I considered contacting them directly about rescheduling, but I ultimately decided not to reach out to anyone else because Mike had said he would get back to me with new dates.

I waited a couple of weeks and followed up again on August 19th. This time, I received an out-of-office reply stating that Mike would be out until August 26th. Now that it‚Äôs August 26th, I‚Äôm unsure whether to follow up again today or wait until tomorrow morning.

I‚Äôm also worried because it‚Äôs been over a month since my first interview, and I fear that other candidates who were available earlier might have already completed their interviews and made good impressions. I don‚Äôt know whether I‚Äôm still being considered for the role given the delays and lack of communication. What would you do in my situation? Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.

Please be kind, I‚Äôve been under a lot of stress and pressure to find employment, and the anxiety is causing me to overthink things.",OkJaguar8043,2,1.0,3,1724663590,2024-08-26 09:13:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f1jrav/when_should_i_follow_up_on_rescheduling_a_second/,8,2024

1f1jfpn,Help me change job!! Business/Finance - Data Analisys - Career Advice,"Good morning guys, 

career advice looking here.

Ill try to be short. Basically Im 29M, 3 years experience in ""banking sector"" (1year startup digital bank - 1.3 years B4 - 1.5 (now) big investment bank). I started as a process analyst and prosecuted with PMO roles for Business Transformation. Basically now I help in coordination for internal bank projects (investment and not), supporting the transformation/digitalization of the processes/structures. Im not super happy of my job (it is not stressful, the salary is not bad) and I'd like to change, even because my study path is a bit different from what I'm doing, I studied ""pure"" statistics in my bachelor and ""pure"" finance in my master. I have knowledge and passion about coding, on my own I like to code in python, reports/analytics/data visualization and forecasting (I did many projects at uni) and I study during my free time ML and AI. I know implementing ML and AI in my career path it's almost impossible, there are thousands of graduates in the subject, but my question is, which is the better way to combine what I'm doing and coding? My thought was, if Im good at data analysis/data visualization and I have some experience in finance/bank industry at what kind of job can I aspire? I'd like to still be a PMO but also I'd like to implement my daily activities with something which require data analysis/data visualization in python, can you help me about it??  
Im also learning and sometimes utilizing other softwares like tableau/power by/SAS.

Now, at my job, on my own I automatized some data reports with python and SQL (and the dinosaurs of my boss and my colleagues have no idea how this things work), but nobody asked me to do it and I'd like more if this was my main job.

Also, with another colleague we are trying to build a model (NLP) to read specific contracts but also this is like a ""extracurricular"" project, when I would much prefer if this was my main activity, this really appasionate me, much more than coordinating ducking boring project about payments and transactions between the platforms/tools of the bank. 

Currently Im working in Italy, but would be not a problem for me to move abroad, what kind of company/firm should I look for? maybe start up/fintech? What skills/certification could I obtain to move faster to a new job?

In this period Im studyng a lot on kaggle, taking certifications and now I wanna start some competition/project s to add them to my cv, do you think is worth it?

1f1h0q9,Fashion merchandising B.A vs. Business B.S,"Is it worth it to get a B.A in fashion merchandising? Last year I finally went back to community college at age 24. I‚Äôve been busting my ass and it‚Äôs actually working. I never thought I‚Äôd succeed at going back to school! But I am! 

Since I‚Äôm older, there‚Äôs no fucking around: I‚Äôm doing this for employment opportunity. Also to prove to myself that I can and because I‚Äôd like the chance to get a higher degree if I ever want to. But I‚Äôll be in my late 20s by the time I‚Äôm done and yeah, I need to do something that will help me get a job. 

Until now I was planning on and have been working towards getting a business administration degree. **My goal is to work in marketing.** However, fashion and clothing is a huge passion of mine and it just hit me that I could be studying Fashion Merchandising, and potentially get the same outcome that I want while studying things that are a LOT more interesting to me. I have a very strong willpower to get my degree no matter what, but I cannot stress enough that I find my business classes extremely boring, and I am jealous of people who are studying things that make them excited to go to class every day. 

I don‚Äôt want to reveal too much personal information, but let‚Äôs just say that between NYC and LA, one of those cities is where I am born and raised, and one of them is where I have tons of close family and would be more than willing to move to, so yes, I have access to and plan on living the rest of my life in locations that have the best education and career opportunities in fashion. My community college has a fashion merchandising AA and it‚Äôs actually pretty good.

My understanding is that it‚Äôs easier to get fashion industry jobs if 1) you‚Äôre passionate about fashion, 2) you‚Äôve put time into working retail, And 3) you have sought out good internships. The first two already currently apply to me, and the third one (internships) has been part of my plan in terms of my business degree anyways. 

Obviously, a general business degree is going to be more secure overall, but how available are fashion merchandising/fashion business jobs? if you secure something, is it difficult to find something else? if I want to get a more advanced degree in a non-fashion subject am I fucked?

1f1ewly,"Fresh Grad, Lost and Confused","Hi, as the title states, I graduated in May with a CompSci degree from a decent US university. I'd say I did well academically (modest 3.8), but now that I'm out and pondering my future, I realize I still have no idea where I want to go. I'm having a difficult time finding an answer, and while I don't think I can't find it here, I'm hoping I can at least find a place to start.

To summarize, I spent my entire academic career soaking up knowledge and more or less 'going with the flow'. I took my classes seriously and greatly enjoyed the experience. However, I spent very little time networking, working on personal projects, gaining decent outside experience, and overall exploring the world of CS outside of classes. In hindsight, a really bad call, but unfortunately, not something I really took to heart until now.

It's clear to me my best option to establish a career is to simply do things related to the field I want. Work on some projects, connect to people in the industry, do what I can to establish myself as a competent and knowledgeable individual in my field. My issue is that my interests are still heavily diverse and fall into vastly different fields. I find myself leaning towards cyber, software, cloud computing, and ML&AI, all of which I have some knowledge in to varying degrees. I have no idea where to start.

I'm sure people have been in this situation before. What do people normally do in a situation like this? Where do people begin building up a decent portfolio? And most importantly, how do people truly decide on where they end up? I understand that people often wander around a bit before settling on a career, if they ever do, but it's these first steps that I can't seem to get myself to progress through and I'm not sure why. Any and all advice would be much appreciated. I've never really been much of a poster so please let me know if my inquiry should go somewhere else.",SenzaSordini,1,1.0,0,1724643747,2024-08-26 03:42:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f1ewly/fresh_grad_lost_and_confused/,8,2024
1f1eozw,My job responsibilities now meaningfully surpass what I was hired for. Is a raise worth asking for / will it cause red flags?,"I have been with my current company for 3.5 years - my first year was a foot-in-the-door entry level role, while the last two have been more intensive. I have about 2-3 years experience previously as an associate level analyst in a niche industry. This most recent job is where I really think I've come into my own. 

I was internally promoted to another team in my company (for about a 50% bump - I make about $78k now, was about $50k before) to overhaul their BI platform, which was previously run by outside consultants. It was a mess for a variety of reasons. I've developed probably 50 reports since and spearheaded efforts for company-wide adoption of the platform. My performance also allowed us to end our contract with the consultants early. So all-in-all, mission accomplished. I am very competent in regards to my abilities regarding reporting. 

Today, I still maintain and develop new reporting - that's sort of job 1A. Data Viz is what I own and what nobody in my team is able to build. It's not rocket science, but I own the platform. But, in the last 16 months or so, my work far outpaces the job description I was hired for. I'm labelled as a ""Viz Specialist,"" but would personally classify myself more as an Analyst. I work with a lot of teams in my company (most of which are not technically proficient, making our data-oriented team more valuable) to do ad-hoc work and analysis on billions of rows of data. Our value, or as it's been described to me, is ""risk prevention."" We see the outliers first, make findings digestible, put together plans for solutions, etc. 

For example, I remember in my original interview, when I asked if I'd be in SQL (which I love and was hoping for), my boss told me outright that my job was to work in the BI platforms and I wouldn't be using SQL often. Now, I'm in there all day every day analyzing all types of data. I also independently have taken on small projects to display my acumen elsewhere (i.e., building a social media sentiment dashboard in Python, which I never get to do). My knowledge has grown exponentially. The last year or so has been a bit of a learning curve learning all of our tables, how everything connects, and all of the considerations we need to account for when generating insights (i.e., international data privacy laws vs domestic, data governance in one company vertical versus another, etc.). I'm not a pro, I'm still under 30 and had an industry change, but I'm learning and putting a ton of effort in. A lot of people reach out to me daily for help on things and I meet all of my goals / have good turnaround times. 

All the while, I've also been completing my Master's in Computer Science (Bachelor's was in Business, immediate regret). I just finished up this year and during my time in the program, came to love Data Analysis / Data Science work. Getting through the program was a huge challenge for me as someone who isn't naturally gifted in CompSci. But, I did it. I finished with about a 3.8. 

This is all to say, honestly, I feel underpaid. I see Data Analyst roles for new hires in other parts of our business being posted for more money. I think, given my education and growth in responsibilities, I'm worth more than I make. I've mastered the visualization component and am still working on the data analysis side, but I think I do have more value inherently and my skills / knowledge base have grown compared to when I was hired. But because this team is new and very small, there isn't a formal process for promotions, pay raises, etc. I love my boss and really like my company - they've expressed my value and even let me relocate this year to live closer to home (while others got stuck with RTO requirements). And sadly, bills are due. Life is more expensive than it was, student loans are due soon, it's just a different climate than when I first was hired. 

The common theme I've heard about issues like this is that, you usually only find these raises externally. I've been looking and see jobs within my scope for over $100k. But, I still want to see if it is at all possible to ask my boss about a bump or some sort of reconsideration of what my job is. I don't expect the raise I really want, but even around a 12.5% increase would satiate me in the interim. But, is there a way to ask for that without causing flags? I don't want to jeopardize my current arrangement. I am speaking with my boss next week to do a mid-year performance review and was wondering if maybe then would be a good time to say something. We have a pretty good relationship overall, but I would like to be tactful in asking (if that's the right thing to do). Any advice?

1f1cjpq,Thinking of leaving a Contract-to-Hire Internal Audit role,"Hello all,

Any advice on my situation is appreciated.

Brief context:
I started a Contract-to-hire role at a fortune 500 company as an internal auditor (IA) back in May, and I obtained this job through a staffing agency. I was told that I‚Äôll be on a 90 day trial period before transitioning to a permanent hire. My performance has been great and I‚Äôve received nothing but great reviews from the managers. The IA director seems to like me too based on what I‚Äôve heard from the managers. However, when my 90 day period was coming to an end earlier this month, the director told me they want to extend my contract instead of giving me a permanent offer. I'm guessing they need more time to decide if I am a good fit. It‚Äôs extremely hard to stay focused and motivated without the stability so I am thinking of leaving. I was unemployed for 7 months prior to this role due to lay offs that happened in late 2023.

Advice needed:
Inevitably, I‚Äôll be asked in a job interview why I want to leave the firm. Any suggestions on how I can answer the question without seeming like I am an incompetent contractor? 

Thanks in advance!

I‚Äôve found this to be the worst job in corporate, to be a first line manager to low to middle level employees. Unfortunately, one can‚Äôt always avoid this aspect of the job. 

In my experience, in my profession (financial services), the employees will go behind your back to communicate directly with your boss. 

And on the flip side, your boss can keep you under thumbs by working directly with your subordinates. 

If you are too strict, the employees complain. 

If you are too lenient, the work doesn‚Äôt get done.

Now a few other team members have/are leaving due to dissatisfaction with leadership and more are planning to. I'm not that happy either but trying to stick around to complete my vesting period if I can.

My old manager and I were already having discussions about a promotion for me before they left, but since then - I've heard nothing about it from the new boss. I haven't fully brought it up yet as I wanted to work with them a bit first to demonstrate my value. Now it's coming up on year end reviews and I want to bring it up seriously now. 

Can anyone give me some guidance on how I should approach this? I am essentially the SME on the project now and was the one to create all process flows. I know I have the leverage cause they will be scrambling if I also leave. But I don't want to turn it into an ultimatum if I can avoid it. Any suggestions on how I should phrase my ask for promotion?

He receives no bonuses (I do), awful raises (his raise w/ promotion was less than my no-promotion raise), and in general makes less.

1f18k6v,Need Advice: How Can I Find Work After 3 Years of Struggling?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm reaching out for some advice and ideas. I worked as a senior software engineer for 4-5 years, earning around $4,500 per month. However, I lost my job three years ago and have been unemployed since. Despite applying to numerous positions, I haven‚Äôt had much success.

Currently, I‚Äôm not working at all. The web development field feels very saturated, making it tough to find new opportunities. I‚Äôve also explored AI, particularly Stable Diffusion, but the field is still emerging, and there are limited job opportunities with low-paying gigs on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr.

As a last resort, I‚Äôm considering driving my car as a taxi driver to make some money. However, my car is quite old, which complicates this option. I‚Äôd really prefer to stay in the IT field and earn in dollars. Moving abroad isn‚Äôt feasible for me right now due to financial constraints and lack of sponsorship.

When I lost my job, I tried to diversify my skills to find new opportunities. I delved into social media marketing, Google Ads, basic graphic design on Photoshop, and video editing with DaVinci Resolve. I also posted my AI skills, web development experience, and other freelance services on Fiverr and Upwork. Despite my efforts, I didn‚Äôt receive any offers over the past year.

I‚Äôm open to any suggestions for job opportunities, business ideas, or ways to leverage my skills in IT and AI. I‚Äôm passionate about technology and want to find a viable path that allows me to continue working in this field.

1f18ijl,RANT: Job Choice Regret Times Two,"In 2021, I had two competing offers.  One with a startup and the other with a 100-plus year old company with several thousand employees.  The startup was offering a sliver of equity but also a salary that was 35% less than what I was expected from the big company once I converted to FT.  I chose the larger company for the better salary and also for the title (Design Technologist).  I wanted the title in order to get away from just doing software engineering and do more design work, and I expected having that title and role would be marketable down the road.  Three months later the startup came back with a second offer that was 15% less than what I expected from my Design Tech job, so I turned them down a second time.

After a year, my company's salary offer to convert from contracting to FT was 20% less than what was promised - and less than the second competing offer I had.  I felt backed against a wall so I took it - assuming that I could leverage the job into something better with the same title elsewhere.

By the end of 2023, management strategy changes made that job completely toxic and miserable, so I accepted a new offer elsewhere.  The only catch with the new offer was that my new employer's client hadn't started a date for the new project.  I quit my Design Tech job expecting that I'd shortly be working on my new thing.  Instead the start date got pushed back to July and then the project was cancelled.

As a result, I've been without work since last year and find myself scrambling for anything in what seems like the worst tech labor market since the Dot Com crash.  And furthermore, the job of Design Technologist seems to have disappeared from everywhere except Amazon - and I have no wish to work at Amazon as they're hostile to remote work.

It's been humbling to have to struggle just to get an interview anywhere, and I keep thinking I made some extremely poor choices in 2021 when I had a better job handed to me TWICE and I made the wrong decision both times.

Anyway, I'm just venting.  But I'd love to hear from anyone else who can relate.

1f17y1c,Am I seeing things about my current job correctly? ($34.6/hr cuz of circumstances),"Hi everyone,

Tl;dr:

1. My company got absorbed by a larger industry giant. Bosses say no uptick in work for ""a long time"".
2. I started mid June, but it's apparently been ""light work"" for a couple of years now.
3. Before the transition, we used the ATP physical clock to clock in and out. Post-transition, we're using Worlday clocks on the mobile (changed names so that those two hr companies don't see this.)
4. Boss said to me in a meeting that he doesn't check if we're physically here when we clock out, that it's OK if we're not, and that he wouldn't want to work for a boss who DOES check.

So the story is, we come in at 9 (can come in at 8 earliest AM) and the work is usually 3 to 4 hrs long. So we get done at 1 or 2.

Before transition, I and everyone would stay until 8 hrs were up to physically clock out at 5/530. After transition, (I started it) everyone started serendipitously leaving and clocking out on their phones when not physically at work.

So, the employees at my level who have been there for 2 years have all fled and gotten jobs elsewhere with higher pay because they said they're not really doing anything.... ... and that they're not getting paid much.

I did my calculations and if I'm working 5 or 6 hours but getting paid for 8, I'm actually getting paid between $34.6 to $41.5 per hour despite being ""on paper"" $26/hr.

I realized that it's actually fuckong smart to stay because 1. I'm obviously being paid a LOT. Given the calcs. 2. I can always find other employment/ r/beermoney money opportunities during the remainder of the 8 hours.

But am I missing something? This job is a step above entry level, but I'm basically of the entry level immaturity.

Very respectfully, I told them I am more interested in the guaranteed income, and I'm not waiting on the success of the company to achieve what I should be valued at. Some of that bonus was directly affected by the success of the company.

The previous employees' salary was just below 70, and they want to offer me 56,160 lol.

1f17bs9,Tips for Relocating?,"Essentially, my goal is to move out of state. I'm 27 and single with basically no local family or friends, I have no current job and am seeking employment. I do have friends out of state, but it would be too much to ask to stay with them for an indefinite amount of time. I have more than enough money saved up to move, but not enough to live out of a hotel/airbnb for months applying for jobs just hoping. I assume apartments will want some proof of income or employment even if I could afford ex. a 6 month lease in cash..  
  
I'm curious how to accomplish this- Should I apply for jobs out of state? Will it be a negative I currently don't reside there, or I'll have to fly out for an interview most likely wasting money? Should I apply for remote opportunities and move during my employment? I know many want you to live in a specific state- unsure if jobs that don't care where you live handle relocating or how that functions in terms of tax. Should I apply for jobs that specifically relocate you and how can I locate more of these types of jobs? I'm not too picky about where I go, I have a few states or areas in mind. My hope was to find something like this as there may be less competition due to others not wanting to relocate. Even if I can just get there and then look for better opportunities once I have residence.

Because 3 days of the 5 they work at building that is far away a little from the city, so me i don‚Äôt even have my licence yet i have my final practical exam in September, and i saw in the maps if i want to go with the bus it‚Äôs gonna be like 2h30 that‚Äôs if there‚Äôs no traffic or accident in the road or if i didn‚Äôt miss a bus my mistake, i will take maybe three buses so if i miss just one i will not make it in time, even my friend told me it won‚Äôt be worth it to come here 3 days a week and with the snow coming up and everything it‚Äôs gonna be more difficult with the buses, so he told me if i could get a car after my driver licence exam i can re-contact him, the thing is that m thinking about is if it‚Äôs a good idea to stay l i am and build more experiences and maybe move higher ranks within the organization, or i should like get a car after my exam and go where my friend works ( i don‚Äôt even know if like m 100% in just because he refers me or m still gonna need to pass something) and also the car expenses and the insurance and everything, so i really don‚Äôt know what the best thing to do,or what the best choice for long-term,so if anyone has any ideas it will be so much appreciated, and thank you for reading all this, thanks again.

NB: i forgot to mention that i have a friend in my current work that work for himself too and get contract for clients and everything, so he told me i can work with him it won‚Äôt be much hours it would be like 13 hours a month or so and 40$ an hour, so it‚Äôs still extra cash.",Bitter_Shallot_9340,1,1.0,0,1724619904,2024-08-25 21:05:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f16vtk/what_should_i_choose_or_if_u_have_another_point/,8,2024

1f13pna,Is this me or the company?,"So i will try keep this quick. Started a hybrid job a year and 4 months ago which is basically like tech support but more complex then you are probably thinking. When starting the job i had no training whatsoever. I was told to shadow the next newest person and given a page to read on my first day which basically just highlighted programs and websites we are to use. After that it was a combination of working with that next newest guy and other team members to figure things out as i went.

 Half the time though most of the other team members couldn't even help me with a problem i was having and would point me to more senior people in another team. Those people were not always available and when they were they would solve my problem but that didn't always mean i understood the solution. Most of my actual learning has come from making big mistakes. 

Usually because i assume something that has always worked but it turns out in this particular scenario it doesn't and i had no way of knowing this prior. These mistakes have ranged from being unhappy customers/employees who made a ticket for a rather large change, i make the change but something goes wrong because its my first time doing it or its not my first time doing it but the scenarios was unique and i was not aware (At my job we have the ability to essentially do anything to the DB as long as you get a PR which no one seems to really do anyway besides click the button and then you get dba to run it in who also never question the change so i have to wonder what the point of either is) .  Anyway whenever i make a mistake like this its like all eyes are on me. The manager comes out of the woodwork and asks what i am doing every hour for a week or two and cant seem to understand why i dont understand certain things before disappearing and it all repeats again when the next mistake comes. 

  
The good news is it seems everyone kind of agrees he is an asshole manager. My question however is in general is this normal for jobs? Its feel incredibly disorganised from the beginning for me as i have felt like i was learning as i went and its resulted in a crazy amount of stress and anxiety as i never know for sure that i am doing the right thing.

1f139dj,Should I quit before PIP?,"Long story short, been under a lot of stress due to personal life issues, at a job that I‚Äôm underpaid and overworked for. I was told by my supervisor that he will have no choice but to put me on PiP by year-end due to various metrics, as well as poor feedback. 

I‚Äôm currently interviewing for better jobs, and am applying for disability (had some medical issues resulting in the performance drop). I‚Äôm concerned that my new potential employer may cancel an offer after a background check shows I‚Äôm on FMLA or on PIP. Should I quit before either of these things, so as to not jeopardize a new job?

TLDR;

Might be on PIP soon, and I‚Äôm currently looking for work while applying for FMLA to address health and avoid PIP. Should I:

A. Apply for FMLA to avoid PIP while interviewing? Will new employers know I‚Äôm on disability? Will they care?

B. Go ahead and get on PIP? I don‚Äôt want to work here much longer but need to cover family expenses. 

C. Quit, so that I avoid having a potential employer see that I was on PIP or on disability? Obviously money will be tight and I‚Äôll need to find something ASAP.

1f12z2x,"If you‚Äôd start today, what industry/track in tech would you choose to work in if you wanna stick to something and become a master at it? (Considering expected trends/demand/etc).","I‚Äôm a 32 Egyptian living in Cairo, got a mechatronics engineering bachelor's in 2016 (which I don‚Äôt remember anything about). Here‚Äôs my problem: in the 8 years since graduation I‚Äôve been unemployed for a total of 4 years (including 2 years now since my last job). I‚Äôve been doing all I can with the job hunt, networking, etc, with no luck. I guess this has been happening because I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù enough in anything and therefore don‚Äôt qualify for most jobs, meaning that my career and work experience are random/not consistent in terms of the positions/industries I worked in, plus I didn‚Äôt have any real ‚Äútechnical‚Äù role and so didn‚Äôt gain technical skills.  
Now that I‚Äôm SO sick of this situation, I needed to be more intentional in my moves (active rather than passive) so along with the usual job hunt (for any job I can do for now to get by), I decided I also need to start building skills on my own to eventually work in tech and just do that for life hopefully.  
I thought of tech as it ticks the most boxes for me, it‚Äôs in constant demand and growing, mostly has a clear career path & skill set to advance, has the potential for a good stable income/remote work/freelancing, or maybe even a chance in the future to move abroad through work (I‚Äôd love that).  
I think I‚Äôd be a good fit for jobs that require some problem solving/creativity/an eye for detail. After some research, so far I‚Äôm considering cybersecurity, software development, machine learning/AI, cloud engineering or data science (sorted from the most to least interesting for me). Obviously it‚Äôs not a simple decision to make at this point as there‚Äôre many factors to consider, for example I need to start having any income asap, so I believe data science is one of the fastest tracks I could land an entry level job in, while things like cybersecurity or machine learning require more time to build knowledge/skills, but might be more financially rewarding later on as it‚Äôs less competitive?  
So for now I thought I should just start learning skills and from there I can kinda feel what I‚Äôm more into or what I‚Äôm more likely to be best at. I subscribed to datacamp for a year and started a python beginner course. I chose it because I'm thinking I should learn skills that would be useful in multiple tracks.  
I wanted to write this post to see what other people who are in the industry or who are aware of the topic think. ANY hints or thoughts about how you‚Äôd go about it if you were me would be SOO much appreciated.

1f12p2i,What's the best way to request a change to an employment contract?,"¬†

TL;DR - I'm interested in a contract role supporting a well-known AI company. The contracting firm (my potential future employer) has extended an offer. However, they have a ""non-circumvention"" clause in their T & C stating I can't work for this AI client for 5 years. I'm looking for advice on how to approach them to remove this clause. Both the client and the contracting firm are in San Francisco. I live in Texas and would be working remotely.

My plan is to speak to someone in their legal department. Explain my interest in the role and the value they'd get from me. Then request they modify the clause and remove the 5 year rule. Does this sound reasonable? What do you think the chances are they'd make this adjustment? My unique work experience should give me some leverage here.

Additional details:

I have experience working in the Microsoft Azure AI group. Specifically on projects that relate to this new client. This is why they want me.

This is the non-circumvention full clause in their offer letter:

""Worker agrees that, during the term of this Agreement and for five (5) years thereafter, Worker shall not work directly or indirectly, in a paid or unpaid capacity, for any Client or other individual, company, or organization to whom the Company introduces Worker during the term of this Agreement, in each case without the Company‚Äôs prior written consent.

1f10tk8,Have a job offer an unsure if I should take it.,"I currently am a CNC Operator / Programmer and have been offered a CSR position in the office. I am on track to make around 59k this year with overtime (around 10-15 hours per pay period every two weeks). I have always been in manufacturing position and have never done any customer facing work aside from delivering finished goods at a previous job. I actually withdrew my application on Friday for the position because I was unsure if I wanted to take it and my two would be managers still requested we sit down and do a get-to-know-you type of 'interview'. Apparently, they both really really liked me and are hoping I accept the job. 

Some postives and negatives for each position exist for sure.

I run my own department so I don't have to really answer to anyone, have a ton of freedom and I work from 4:30 am to 2:30pm and then have the rest of the day off. But also, upward mobility it pretty limited. I am at the highest point I can go on the production side unless someone dies or retires pretty much.

Pros of being in the office are less stress on the body, I am already very familiar with the team that I will be joining as I work with them daily. Will be on salary so you know exactly what you're making every week but again no opportunity for any overtime which for me, makes a big difference in pay.

Also, the biggest hurdle for me moving to the office is complete unfimiliarity with the job. What if I get up there and suck or am terrible at it and become a failure and have to go back to the floor? Don't really want that to happen. But the office role will have more growth opportunities and probably be better for my career long term I think. 

Cons for the office job are different hours and I will be getting off right when rush hour traffic is starting and coming to work in rush hour as well. I quite enjoy arriving early and leaving early too.

It seems they really really like me so I might just swing for the fences and as for a salary of 60k and see what they say. It will give me my same current wage and also allow me to not work any overtime. What do you guys think?

I heard they pay really less for the analyst roles. I'm getting 7-9 lpa in my current role do you think I would get at least 10-20% hike after I shift to Big 4 companies.

1f0zrqi,What is my job title?,"TL;DR: I have a job that mostly consists of uploading pictures and descriptions of products onto the website of a retail store, and neither myself, my co-workers, or my boss really know what my official job title should be.

I work in the office of a retail store. My main duty is to put new products on our store website (i.e., when we receive new products to go on the sales floor, it's my job to go to the manufacturer's website and/or B2B portal and get photos, information, and specifications to put on our site). I don't do any coding; all of this is basically data entry in our website's back end.

When there are no suitable photos to use from the manufacturer, I'll either photoshop an unsuitable photo to work (e.g., we have all the shoes facing in one direction, but a certain shoe company only photographs them in the other direction, so I'll flip the photo and then go in and also make sure that the logos and text on the shoe are facing the right way), or I'll take a one of the products off the shelf and photograph it myself. 

When there is no available information about a product, I will write a short blurb about it, and then also measure/weigh it and publish those specs. 

In addition to the photographs and products specs/descriptions, I also am responsible for categorizing products on the website (e.g., a pair of men's pants is marketed by the manufacturer as being for hiking, so I'll put them under ""Hiking Pants,"" but they're also suitable for climbing and everyday use, so I'll also put them under ""Climbing Pants"" and ""Everyday Pants"").

Additionally, I also choose which products show up at the bottom of the screen under ""Related Products"" (e.g., if we sell a product called the Really Cool Waterproof Men's Hiking Shoes, I'll add a product relation so that when you're on the Really Cool Waterproof Men's Hiking Shoes page of our website, you'll also see recommendations for the Really Cool Non-Waterproof Men's Hiking Shoes, the Really Cool Waterproof Men's Hiking Boots, and the Really Cool Waterproof Women's Hiking Shoes). 

During times when there are no new products to be added to the store's website, I'll go into products that were uploaded to our website before I started working in the office, and edit their descriptions, photographs, categories, and related products to all be formatted the same way, so that our website looks neat and uniform. 

The store owner also sometimes tasks me with creating catalogs for our own store brand products, so that we can sell them to other stores. To do this, I measure, weigh, and write about each of our products in much the same way as described above, and then upload that information into a spreadsheet as well as onto our website. 

I also do a lot of data entry, so I suppose it could be something to do with that? Other ideas that have been floated by my boss and my co-workers include ""E-Commerce Specialist"" and ""Buyers' Assistant"" (since I work very closely with our store buyers).

Hello everyone!

I‚Äôm currently between a rock and a hard place at my workplace and after some of the things that have happened there, I don‚Äôt feel as though I‚Äôm able to think through this decision as logically as I want to. The people in my life I usually go to for advice are split 50/50 as well and it was recommended to me to try to ask for the opinions of reddit, so here I am. (:

To start with a bit of context, I‚Äôm 24F and I live in the United states.

To give some insight into my background, it consists mostly of retail / sales / customer service based, but in the past couple of years I‚Äôve started working at factories for the slightly better pay they offer. I have always excelled in any job I‚Äôve had as I'm an extremely hard worker and probably a bit of an overachiever as well. I was a top 3 sales rep when I worked for AT&T for example and even as a machinist at Caterpillar I was told by multiple supervisors I was the best person they‚Äôd ever seen on the machines I ran. I don‚Äôt say any of this to brag, just to show I have a history of being a top performer in any role I‚Äôve had.

Okay, now to dive into the reason I‚Äôm here.

So, as I said I recently moved to a small-ish town in Iowa where there isn‚Äôt a lot of opportunity for career paths.  My most recent job when moving here was a machinist and so my first thought was to look for something in that field. Despite having the last year of experience, There aren‚Äôt many machine jobs here and a couple I interviewed for didn‚Äôt have women working in those roles so I quickly realized I might have to settle for something else in the meantime. 

The company I currently work for has some machinist jobs, but no openings at the time I was looking, and unless you get a machinist or welding position here, everyone has to go through temp to get into the company. 6 months ago, I got brought in as a temp employee and was put on an assembly line. In orientation, I was told it takes between 2-3 months to get hired on full time, and as someone who worked at Caterpillar before this and had no issues getting converted quickly, I assumed being a good worker and not calling in / being late would get me brought on easily in that time. However, I‚Äôm here so clearly that isn‚Äôt the case. 

We‚Äôll call my supervision Angie for this post. 

Angie was the person who interviewed me and had me placed in one of her departments. From the beginning I started off strong as I usually do. I was put in a job building assembling one of the harder things this company builds. I still to this day have never been late, and my coworkers told me and Angie how quickly I was learning everything and that I was a really great worker. Two months came and went and my supervisor told me she had me at the top of her list and that full time would be coming soon. That whole month, she would tell me this and that she was extremely impressed with my work ethic, reliability, and good attitude. By the time month 3 was coming around, I had started to gently push more for full time as I‚Äôd been promised, explaining that I really needed the benefits. That‚Äôs when she asked me to move to a different department with more difficult responsibilities, a higher workload, and a slight pay increase. She and my team lead both led me to believe accepting this new role would get me full time, and so I quickly accepted.

Since then, every week or couple of weeks I was told that full time was the next week, at the start of the next month, etc. Annual shut down was approaching and anyone who was full time at this point would be getting paid vacation for a week and a raise directly afterward. I was now over 4 months in, and began to ask if there was a reason I wasn‚Äôt being hired on, and pressed a little harder for them to keep their promise to convert me as getting the shutdown week paid would have been really helpful to me. My supervisor told me she‚Äôd emailed HR and it was out of her hands. They were ‚Äúhalting‚Äù hiring anyone one on till after shutdown. So, everyone else got a raise and paid for the week while I didn‚Äôt. During this whole time, people with different supervisors were getting converted in their 2-3 months and all received their raises,  so I knew my supervisor wasn‚Äôt being fully honest at this point. Anytime Angie and I would talk about it,she would barely give me the time of day and was always trying to rush off to do something else so I never felt I was being fully heard. 

As month 5 began, a machinist role opened up at the company and I applied. My supervisor knew this and knew I‚Äôd been waiting for an opportunity like this since I started. I was interviewed and told I‚Äôd hear back within a week. I didn‚Äôt and found a few days ago (two weeks since the interview) that Angie was blocking the move and had been lying to me about me getting the job. She didn‚Äôt want to lose me and said we were too short staffed to let me go. 

At this point, I‚Äôve been with this company for 6 months with no benefits. I work overtime every day during the week and some saturdays. I am still a top performer and in the current role I‚Äôm in, if I really push for it, I can finish my tasks in half my allowed time to help us push production. I feel like I‚Äôve done absolutely everything I need to have my benefits and to be given this opportunity for a job that will give me a huge pay increase and my benefits but I‚Äôm being told the soonest she‚Äôll allow is two months from now, and given her track record of not keeping her word, I believe it will be longer and the position will be filled by then. 

I‚Äôve tried to keep emotion or personal bias out of this post up until now, but this whole situation has really been affecting my mental health and just overall wellbeing and I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs worth it anymore. I‚Äôve been having weekly breakdowns, I‚Äôm on a shift I hate, and this job is causing me to feel exhausted all the time. I feel alone in this as I have absolutely no support from my team lead or supervisor, I can‚Äôt really even afford to see a therapist given that each session is around $100 without insurance, and I‚Äôm now months behind on dentist / doctor appointments. I feel like I‚Äôm just being a baby here sometimes and that I just need to suck it up and be an adult but I also think I‚Äôm justified in wanting to quit and being done. I know there aren't a lot of opportunities right now with the job market and I don‚Äôt have another job lined up as the latest update just happened a couple of days ago, but I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this. I have started applying but as it‚Äôs only been a couple of days I haven't heard much from other companies. 

For additional context, the job I‚Äôm currently working doesn‚Äôt pay that well but, but for the small time I live in is on the higher end of factory jobs. Also, the machinist job I want here pays over 30% more than I make now and getting it would also get my full time / benefits. I  do have a decent chunk of savings to live off of for a bit and my fiance has a stable job so we‚Äôll still be able to pay bills until I find something else, but a couple of people have warned me not to quit right now with the job market and have said just to stick it out and just try not to rock the boat, so I need some fresh perspectives. 

Sorry this post was so long. Also please be kind in your advice, I want to hear your thoughts but I am being genuine here and don‚Äôt want nasty replies to read before work tomorrow. 

Thanks guys!

1f0v5et,Citing my professionalism during a grievance procedure as proof of resilience during an interview,"Hi all,

I'm considering applying for a TC at a law firm, and I'm at a stage where I'm brainstorming to find ideas and examples that demonstrate I have the right skills and qualities for the position.

I'm especially keen to demonstrate how resilient I am as I believe it is one of my strongest qualities. Truthfully, the best illustration of this is an instance where I assisted a friend & colleague during a grievance procedure and had to manage interpersonal challenges in the aftermath.

In a nutshell, a close friend of mine asked me to assist him and I agreed to a fact-find interview with HR to speak about various instances of discrimination which I had witnessed. Some of these involved colleagues and managers I worked closely with.

The grievance got resolved and my friend left the company, but I stayed for an extra year.

In theory, these procedures are supposed to be confidential, but it never really works out that way. Fairly quickly, the people involved found out that I had assisted my friend and provided evidence in their case. This obviously caused quite a bit of friction and I had a bit of a target on my back 

Despite this, I maintained professional relationships with everyone and rebuilt trust with my team (not that I did anything wrong in the first place but I could understand why they would find it difficult to work with me afterwards). I ended up becoming a star employee and was trusted with more responsibility.

I believe this really is the best example to showcase my resilience, but I'm worried this might come across as a red flag to my recruiter. Should I take the risk of bringing this up?

1f0trda,Burning a bridge because I was severely and illegally retaliated against.  What should I do?,"Someone at work purposely gave me an allergic reaction, and HR and a manager decided it was in their best interest to harass me until I quit to get rid of liability. When I complained the managers and HR people were reassigned. 

The bigger issue was a manager sabotaged a fundraiser for the American Cancer society, that I organized in support of a coworker dying of pancreatic cancer, by purposefully giving me a terrible allergic reaction the day before. 

I am legitimately angry and it happens like 4 years ago. I should have straight up sued. I did get this anger get the better of me, a few times. I should get therapy when I think about it it makes me livid.  That coworker died 3 months after the charity event.

I have a new job now, but I feel like I might have to address what happened, if I ever change jobs. How do I even explain what happened?  I feel Like that experience impacted my performance. 

Should I explain it as an assault?  Or not even bring it up?  Is it on record? Am I legally protected?

1f0ruh2,Had a job offer from a company in LONDON with a ¬£11k pay increase... ,"Currently living in Bristol, UK and earning a decent package of ¬£47,000. I own a flat and enjoy my job, it's very flexible and easy going and the people I work with are decent, albeit a little boring. (I'm 30 and they are 50-60yo). My manager is retiring in 2 or 3 years and I have been told I am in line for his job. Which is a good level line manager job and I expect the salary would he circa ¬£65,000-¬£70,000 with 5% bonus.

I have however recieved a job offer from a company in London for ¬£55,000 plus a 10% bonus. They're a young company, lots of social events, more my kind of people, it's in central London (really central) and sounds like a bit of me.

If I went with this new job I would give up the opportunity to become a manager in a few years and therefore potentially miss out on that decent salary. I would have to sell my flat and move to London permanently which would be a hassle, but potentially worth it.

I would however be living in a really cool city where alot of my friends live, and would be trying something new before I really settle down in 5 years or so. Plus I'd be in a new job and trying something new in life which I think is always good for, to push boundaries and to go out of your comfort zone etc.

I'd be grateful for any advice or thoughts on my situation üòä

1f0rsue,Crying after debating with strangers online about AI and copywriting,"
Hey y'all, so I've been working as a copywriter for the past two years. I don't have any professional degree or anything in copywriting. I became a copywriter accidentally because I was lost and still am; I don't know what I like or not. The thing is, I graduated in business administration and later COVID happened, and I was unemployed at home. I came across a list of marketing courses online and decided to pursue the copywriting one first. I finished it and at that time, I thought this is what I want to do. Mind you, ChatGPT hadn't hit the market yet.

After searching for jobs for six months, I finally got a job. I moved to the city and got familiar with agency life. I was writing for financial institutions and banks. The initial feedback I got was that my copy is too creative or quirky and they need something straightforward for banks. I started following that. I used to write mainly email copy. Most of my work was literally being edited by a senior in the previous agency, and I lost confidence in myself. ChatGPT hit the market, and I started using it a lot.

Then I got another job, and I'm working for a performance marketing agency now. The company is cool, but my work, I don't know, it's alright. It's been more than a year, but I don't remember writing anything substantial. My senior does all the work. It's like I'm hired to work on sideline jobs which require no creativity and project managerial roles. Like keeping track of the budget, hiring translators, and writing SEM copy and creative analysis of creatives. It's been more than a year here, and I don't know what I'm doing. I asked so many times to assign creative or big projects to me, but they didn't.

But somehow, my manager this Friday said she wants me to take creative jobs as well to add to my portfolio, etc.

I think I fail to write good copy, but I don't know, I feel they might have seen some potential, that's why I got hired.

But you might be wondering how strangers I meet online are playing a part in this scenario; I'll tell you now. So when I'm bored, I go to these Discord servers to talk to people randomly because I like talking and it's good for improving communication skills. Today there was this random guy who works as a brand manager, and his job requires him to collaborate with copywriters. He asked me a question about where originality and authenticity come from in this age of AI. And I just told him that a lot of creative geniuses do come up with original content, but ChatGPT is helpful to brainstorm. And anyway, I did this online course of copywriting, and the first thing they taught us is that it's okay to take inspiration from past ads. That's a method of writing copy. I was just trying to explain that taking inspiration is not a bad thing and people are doing that before AI.

He got too passionate and started telling me how originality is important and where it comes from. He started giving me examples of God and nature. Then I told him I'm a copywriter, not a writer or an artist. My job is to sell/market products. He was like, ""No, copywriting is part of writing, and AI will replace you. You are clearly not good at your job, etc., etc."" I had told him that my company people only encourage me to use ChatGPT. And he said, ""Because you are not a good copywriter, that's why, and people with no originality will get replaced and so will you."" I was like, ""Man, why are you being so passionate about stupid ads?"" And he was like, ""Ads are not stupid, it shows your mentality that you don't appreciate your job enough, you are just doing it for money."" And he started saying, ""Your ass is insecure, I'm not gonna be humble."" I told him not to speak to me like that and I was just trying to explain that taking inspiration is not a bad thing. He was like, ""I'm trying to help you, but you'll get replaced because you don't wanna listen.""

This is not the first time I have been attacked. This one time I was attacked for not using AI. I just said for fun that I don't use AI, and they were like, ""Yes, you will get replaced."" Even on Reddit, I have asked questions multiple times about copywriting, and I have been trolled on my writing style, saying, ""No wonder my work gets edited out and my English writing skills are terrible."" I'm not sure what to do. I feel lost and depressed. I'm too sensitive; I started crying after debating with this stranger online. I know it's stupid, but I don't know. No matter what I do, it's not good enough.

Also, I added one point, AI can be used as a boon for some people. People who have a good sense of choice or taste in things or good imagination but don't know how to put it into words. It can be helpful for those people as well.

I'd like to know your opinions about it. Whatever you say, this post's purpose was to seek help or to seek validation; I don't know.

1f0rl7w,"24M from India, really confused with what I should do next. What should I do next? What would you do? What have you done to come out of a similar situation?","Hi all, I am 24 M , I am Economics undergraduate,  had a good GPA 8.8+. Worked 2.5 years in market research (in a consulting firm with big Tech Clients), got laid off because I really didn't gell with my team leader...This happened after I realised I am being underpaid, overworked and constantly criticized and micromanaged. After which I lost interest in my job and was just dragging my way through. I was also preparing for Indian management exams and honestly fell short there as well. Didn't even get to the 90th percentile. I was honestly shattered (this was my first semi serious attempt, semi serious coz after job I barely was able to concentrate and study) 

I have aptitude of great leader, but I fall short in these papers... Never really was good at competitive exams, party because of a small retention and focus span...

I am good with most people out there, I think I have a better EQ. I also am a decent problem solver. I like to find ""Jugaads"" but I am not really sure how to and more importantly where to use my energy and skills.

After I got laid off, I was at my lowest since I had nothing to be proud about, no purpose, was depressed and couldn't even get out of my bed for days. I had to take therapy and after which I decided to focus at one thing at a time. I started thinking of applying outside India for MBA itself, so started with GMAT prep. It's been appprox 6 months and that's not going as planned either. I AM REALLY FALLING SHORT OF MY OWN EXPECTATIONS (but tbvh I am always the guy who puts it way above, so that I reach to a good level)  

To add to this anxiety some well-wishers of mine who is into numerology/ astrology told me that I should be focussing on something related to law, research, acting or something creative (he even suggested I will become quite great in such fields). He also told me business isn't really a great idea for me as well... I honestly really don't care about these things but I also think it's better to be insured if it doesn't really cost me much....also it's put me in dilemma of whether what I am trying to do is even right for me or not?

Here are my skillsets/ positives: 
Creativity - I write poetry and short stories .
Decent looking- Fair looking, 5'7, not fat or too slim, decent build
Decent personality- Extroverted and fun personality , often considered funny and cute
Technical skills: Excel, PPT, Docs, AI tools, market research, personal finance, investing in markets
Decent soft skills
Surprisingly amazing at remembering convos

Negatives: 
Overthinking 
Overestimating and underestimating myself, not at equilibrium...
Low attention/Focus span 
Not great retention (if I learn something, often need a lot of retention)
Need to be more confident and balanced 
Sometimes have self esteem issues
Take breaks often coz can't concentrate much

I need help in figuring out what can be a good idea to discover for me, I want to find a purpose for myself. I have been highly motivated by money and hence I am working towards my MBA ambitions...

1f0q3xd,"10+ Years in Full-Stack Development, Yet Unsure of My Expertise: What Should I Tell Recruiters?","

After spending over 10 years in full-stack development, I‚Äôm facing a challenge I never anticipated‚Äîfeeling uncertain about my own expertise. 
My career started in 2014 as an Angular developer, and since then, I‚Äôve worked with a wide range of technologies: React, Node.js, Meteor.js, AWS, Python Django, and more recently, AI-related tasks like regression and NLP.
I‚Äôve always been able to pick up new tools and frameworks quickly, moving from one project to another, learning just enough to get the job done. But now, I‚Äôm realizing that while I know a little about many things, I don‚Äôt know anything deeply. I‚Äôm not an expert in any one area, and this leaves me with a sense of insecurity about my professional identity.

As I think about making a move to a new company, I‚Äôm stuck on a critical question: What do I tell recruiters about my expertise? 
I‚Äôve never had the opportunity to build something from the ground up; instead, I‚Äôve contributed to ongoing projects, often receiving praise for my work, but always feeling like I‚Äôm on the periphery of true mastery.This lack of depth worries me. 

I work long hours‚Äîaround 12 hours a day‚Äîto stay on top of things, yet I still feel like I‚Äôm just keeping pace with other developers. My fear is that without a strong specialty, I might struggle to stand out or even meet the expectations of a new role.So, where do I go from here? Should I focus on developing deep expertise in a specific area? If so, which area would make the most sense given my experience? Or is there another way to position myself to recruiters that leverages my broad skill set without feeling inadequate?These are the questions I‚Äôm wrestling with, and I‚Äôm searching for the right path forward as I consider the next phase of my career.

1f0q3ek,Should I start something new?,"Hi! I‚Äôm 32F. I completed my BA in my 20s and then went on to do postgraduate research. At the time I was enrolling in my BA, I thought about combining it with a teaching degree, but was advised just to do the BA and see how I go. 

A LOT has happened since then and I‚Äôve felt quite lost. I‚Äôve worked in different areas but have sort of fallen in to two jobs that are unrelated to my degree. 

Teaching has been in the back of my mind for a while. I feel like I‚Äôd be good at it, and I have had a little bit of exposure (volunteer teaching, and I was a lecturer and tutor at university for a little while). When I was at school, my teachers were the ones who encouraged me and who supported me in ways my parents sometimes couldn‚Äôt, and I‚Äôd like to help other kids feel encouraged and capable.

What‚Äôs holding me back is work and life stuff. I‚Äôm getting married very soon and we are wanting to have a family. I want to be able to stay home with any kids we have while they are little. I know you can‚Äôt predict when that will happen, really, but I think about juggling work, study, and practical workplace experience that comes with the degree, and then add in a potential pregnancy and baby.

One option is to study part-time and have it completed in 6 years, which is more what I‚Äôm leaning towards. But I‚Äôd just love advice or suggestions. Thank you!

1f0q097,Should I go back into CS or try to explore my new major in aviation more?,"So I am feeling conflicted. In 2022 I got burned out from the CS workload and decided to drop out of my CS program. However, since then I still notice that I have a really huge interest in computers, how they worked, etc. and attempted to repair my own phone myself. I have dreams of working at FAANG to design phone software too, and I like being on my phone/laptop/tablet/etc. messing around with android and windows software and I've been thinking about coding my own software.

Right now, I am studying for aviation at my school, and I also really love the subject but I have no idea what's ahead for me in my major as it's more of a business degree. I also have an intense interest in aviation just not as strong as it once was when I was in elementary and middle school since CS took that role, but I still watch aviation news, look up what new aircraft Airbus and Boeing are creating, what airlines are doing business wise, etc. I am going out of state too so I want to make sure my aviation degree is worth it as well; I made a post in the aviation subreddit a couple days ago and I got worried when people were saying my degree is worthless. However I only started this major this past week so maybe I am worrying too much.

1f0oig3,Should I turn down this job offer?,"I've had 3 jobs since I graduated in college in 2019. Due to layoffs the last 2 were only 1 year long. The company I am considering leaving I have been at for 2 years. I work for one of the largest and ""Greatest"" employers in my smallish town. However, there notorious for paying low, and being a bit rigid and old fashion in structure. My position is hard, and has a high turnover but I mostly am content. I work as a buyer/inventory controller for a hunting goods store at the corporate office and have some pretty cool amenities such a gym, and a cafeteria. No WFH unless inclement weather.

  
Company B has been around for 20 years but really has taken off in the last 5. Has been acquired by 3 different owners in the last 3 years. This new owner equity group I am familiar with and know of a few well ran companies owned by them in the area. Essentially same benefits although more expensive, they offered me a 25% raise a bonus potential of up to 7% of my salary.

1f0ne7z,New Corporate Co took store tips,"Idk if this exactly belongs here, but please redirect me if not. 

I've worked at Company X (named so to protect identity, etc) a small, local dog boarding & daycare for 10+ years but it recently sold and now a much larger corporate business owns Company X. We'll call the corporate business Company Y.

Company X offers limited grooming for the dogs in their care...nail trims, baths, ear cleanings, etc. and often the dog owners tip for these services. This can be a little confusing, but the fairest way Company X has come up with to distribute tips evenly is the creation of what we've been calling ""All Tips"". The way the place is set up, typically nails are done by 1 person in the morning and baths are done by someone different in the evening so if an owner tips something that can't be evenly split by 2, then the excess tip money, after splitting it, goes into the ""all tips"". Mgmt will use that money to get food for all staff one day as an appreciation/moral booster.

Company Y's #2 in command discovered mgmt was using the company card to order DoorDash and pizzas for staff and he said ""no more"" and then even went so far as to deny anyone from using the remaining $500 (which also includes sometimes monetary gifts from clients around the holidays and general tips like that) that was in ""All Tips"". Can that legally happen? This is tip money that clients have given and thought was going to staff and now it's non-existent. I would think we should at least be able to use the remaining money we had.

Company X that was taken over is in Missouri, USA. Company Y that bought it is based in Connecticut, USA.",Safe-Poetry,1,1.0,0,1724557218,2024-08-25 03:40:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f0ne7z/new_corporate_co_took_store_tips/,8,2024

HOWEVER, i have not gotten a raise for any of the training i do while the location 40 minutes away (not owned by him) gives a $1 raise to anyone who trains.  i told the manager that im not comfortable with closing anymore as i barely make minimum wage to begin with and when i train someone to close i make even less than i would working alone because we have to split the already small tips. i also told my boss (the owner) that i would be happy to train as many people as he needs before i leave (i gave him my three weeks 2 weeks ago) IF he pays me fairly for it. he got angry and left me on read. 

i just checked the schedule for tomorrow and he has me scheduled for the same time as another barista meaning he expects me to train her which i told him no very clearly about.

1f0l8o1,Negotiating my promotion salary (Manufacturing),"I'm halfway through my 90 day probationary period of my recent promotion.  I was formerly a Machinist (floor guy) and was promoted to middle management as a production planner. 

Thus far I have performed ""very well"" in my new role even making the last guy ""look like shit"". It has been a blessing that the company hired me internally for a role that is a few steps up from my previous job. It is the type of promotion a blue collar guy like myself dreams of. 

I was making 61K before the promotion and was told we would discuss money soon. I am confident that the company is saving money by promoting me because an outside hire would come in at 85k out of college. I would like the typical 15-20% pay increase that comes with such a promotion but don't want the company to feel like I'm being ungrateful for the opportunity.

How do you explain this to recruiters in a way that makes sense for them?

For example, I was working for some years before pursuing a one-year specialization in my field, and when I came back I had a very rough time finding a new job as most recruiters will often question my ""one-year employment gap"", as according to them, education/training is not a valid replacement for working Explaining that I was studying full time and with a scholarship wasn't apparently a satisfactory explanation, and they'd often come back to the same question ""yeah, but why were you unemployed?"" to lowball the salary offer.

1f0h5xj,Work place outfit advice?,"I recently started a new job. Technically the dress code needs to be business casual with Fridays as casual days. Apparently no one at the office follows this and the norm is casual.

Part of me changing jobs was to change environment and follow things that fit with my image of myself. At my previous job It was all casual dressing, and I got sloppy and careless about my looks, it reflected negatively on my mood and personal health, I stopped putting in effort generally and it bothered me later.
At this new job I decided to always look good, I wear semi formal outfits Mon - Thur. Nothing too fancy, tucked dress shirts and dress shoes kinda thing. 

First week I got so many comments about that. It was flattering and nice at first, especially the first Friday when I showed up in my hip casual outfit.
The second week started getting uncomfortable, the comments kept coming, and while they were delivered light heartedly, it felt like some sort of joke, I kinda felt like I'm being made fun of. 

I don't want to compromise on working at my appreance, and all the benefits of looking professional at work, however I wonder if I'm overdoing it, especially now that I'm aware that their norm is not that.

1f0gqet,I'm finishing college next year and I don't know what to do,"I'm f17 (almost 18) and I'm going into my last year of college this September. I've never really wanted to go to university as, in my thoughts it seems like a big waste of money as by the time I finish university I could have already worked my way up into a job position uni would have led me too anyways. 

So basically I'm a bit stuck with what to do with my future. In the future I want to go into the film industry/ some kind of creative media  (I study film in college) Im fully aware that it's a difficult industry to get into but it's the only thing I've found interest in and I'm good at. 

I just don't know what other pathways there are if any besides from university or just some crappy job. Those of you who have gone to university and have done creative subjects is it actually useful and has it helped you in finding a job? Those of you who haven't and are still in similar industries, what steps did you take to get where you are now? 

Also everyone who I have had a chance to speak to about university has said even if I'm unsure about it it's better to go ""just for the experience"" but that's a lot of money just for an experience. I really want to be time efficient and have a cost effective way of getting to a respectable job position.

I might sound like a prick for saying this but I don't see a point in a future if I don't have disposal income (sounds really bad ik) but I'd rather go hungry then not be able to do the things I enjoy. If it meant scrapping the idea of film to have a job I absolutely hated for the rest of my life but paid better then I would have had otherwise I would just deal with it as the money means way more then enjoying a job. I would very much appreciate anyone's advice so I can avoid the shitty outcome I know I would have.

1f0gleg,Should I cut my losses?,"
I recently started a new job and have faced challenges affecting my performance and relationship with my manager. During my interview, I may have overstated my Excel skills because I was eager to secure the job. While I have experience with VLOOKUP, Power Query, and advanced formulas like SUMIFS, this role is more Excel-intensive than I expected. The team feels I misled them, but they knew I had less experience than their ideal candidate.

I've occasionally worked from home when my manager wasn't in the office, I was unwell, or I'd worked long hours the day before. My manager is unhappy with my WFH days, even though they were limited and for valid reasons.

I'm doing my best to perform well, helping colleagues and responding promptly to their questions. A major task involves working on a Massive File that starts at the beginning of the month with a set deadline. I've missed this deadline twice because it's my first time handling this responsibility, and I have many questions or am unsure where to find answers. My manager provides occasional help and often postpones meetings to review the file. She went on PTO before the last file was due, leaving me with only 20 minutes of guidance the day before. I had to get approval from her manager to release the file, but she ignored my requests and went on PTO herself, causing the file to be a week late. When I expressed my frustrations, my manager didn‚Äôt acknowledge my concerns.

Smaller issues add to the tension. My manager criticized me for using ""Hello Team"" in emails, insisting I use ""Hello All."" She doesn't like when I respond with ""It's okay"" to apologies, snapping at me even though it's my default response. She reprimanded me for tagging her on Teams, which caused her name to be highlighted in red, something I can't control. She raised her voice at me when I admitted not knowing something and mocked me during a review for saying ""I don't know,"" even though I only say that when I'm genuinely unsure. She insists I call our director by her shortened name instead of her real name and found it disrespectful when I used her full name once, even though it was just a slip of the mind.

In a meeting I was leading, my manager motioned with her hand for me to hurry up, even though I was only a minute in. Later in the same meeting, when I wanted to provide clarity to a team looking for data understanding, she motioned with her hand for me to stop talking. This behavior undermines my credibility and makes it difficult for others to have confidence in me.

These, among other nitpicks, are really affecting my confidence.

During our review, I mentioned that I only have three months of experience in this role and am doing my best to learn, but I don't have all the answers. My manager dismissed my concerns, pointing out that she also has projects she doesn't know everything about, but she has 15 years more experience than I do.

1f0d871,Software Engineering Manager advice ,"Hi everyone, I recently made a change from being a Sr Software Engineer to Software Engineering Manager. While I‚Äôm finding easy to find and address pain points within my team, I‚Äôm finding it hard to place myself in a room with upper management or those at the same level as me. I feel like they speak a completely different language altogether. I feel like I‚Äôm the odd one out because everyone is talking and thinking differently. While it is so easy to fit in with my team, and they love me cause I‚Äôm able to understand and speak up for them, I‚Äôm needing help and guidance to the other part of this job.

I guess what I‚Äôm trying to ask is a three parter:
1. What is your experience/advice for someone that is moving from a tech role to a manger role?
2. Are there are any resources you can guide me to help me become a good manager that‚Äôs not just a tech guy that became a manager, but a useful manager from my teams‚Äô pov?
3. Are there any resources you could point me to so I can be a good manager towards upper leadership?

1f0d05d,Informal soft PIP (6 months) with a pivot option?,"
First time ever posting here.

I read all about the PIP performance improvement plans and the horror stories. Hopefully my situation is different? Need some guidance or just general opinion.

So I‚Äôm around late 30s, working as a senior delivery manager for a SaaS company. I‚Äôve been a project manager in SaaS for about 6 years due to a pivot of career from similar roles outside of SaaS.

I guess given my experience I was hired as a senior and the sole delivery person for the regional team.

It‚Äôs almost one year now(I really likes my company and worked really hard) and I just had a meeting with my manager and been told that I‚Äôm not meeting expectations and had mixed feedback from others.

I juggled multiple projects and the biggest one was not in a great place when I joined and took over. It was a difficult project and I admit that there were areas where I could have done better or differently. To keep it short I didn‚Äôt meet what they expected for a senior in terms of delivery tracking and customer management. Other projects I received positive feedback.

So I was told to be put on a 6 months PIP or try the other role which my manager said he thinks it‚Äôs better suited for me, it‚Äôs a sales type role. During the 6 months I can improve while explore/understand what the other role is about and if it‚Äôs a better fit for me.

What do you guys think of this? It‚Äôs not the: here is your PIP we want you out story I keep reading about.",xshingox,2,1.0,5,1724526485,2024-08-24 19:08:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f0d05d/informal_soft_pip_6_months_with_a_pivot_option/,8,2024

I am currently employed at a company but was reached out to by a recruiter for a sure fire promotion in both title and 50% increase in salary. Very excited about the opportunity. Had a phone screen in early August followed by a virtual interview two weeks ago and an in person interview on Tuesday afternoon. By all accounts everything went well in all three interviews and seemed to hit it off with the hiring manager and the two other panelists. 

In the virtual interview the hiring manager mentioned that there was another candidate having an interview in person the day after my virtual (aka further along in the process) but still invited me to the interview in person. In the office I was shown around the building and he mentioned benefits etc and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll need too much convincing.‚Äù Felt like I had it in the bag and asked about next steps in which he told me he was hoping to ‚Äúhave HR things wrapped up by the end of the week.‚Äù 

Well the end of the week has passed, and I am worried that I haven‚Äôt heard anything back. Does it sound like I am the second choice in this process? Or is it an overreaction and I need to be patient?

1f0ajyp,Hold out for interview or take the sure thing? ,"So here‚Äôs my situation:

I‚Äôve been in the same role for a while and I‚Äôve since outgrown the responsibilities and the team. I dread going to work every day and I‚Äôve been job searching for over a year. 

Recently, I got asked to interview for two different internal roles. 
‚Ä¢ One is basically a sure thing - I have a friend on the team who has spoken highly of me and my interviews went really well (basically alluding to me having the role). I am also friends with the recruiter for the role who is confident I‚Äôll get it. Issues: it‚Äôs not ~exactly~ what I want to do with my career, the salary increase might not be significant. Pros: it‚Äôs quite a chill job and I feel that I can outperform + move up quickly. 
‚Ä¢ The second role I have not interviewed for yet. The hiring manager is out of office until mid-September and an interview wouldn‚Äôt take place until then. Issues: I am not familiar with the team/have no connections with anyone there. I would need the interview to really assess what the vibes are. Pros: I know for a fact the salary increase would be significant, it‚Äôs EXACTLY the type of work I‚Äôd want to be doing and may set me up better for the next step in my career. 

The discussions for the first role about the offer is taking place on Tuesday, well before I‚Äôm interviewing for the second role. If they extend an offer, should I hold out to interview for the second role or just take the job? 

TLDR: I have two potential job opportunities. One is a sure thing that‚Äôs not exactly what I want to do and I‚Äôm unsure of the pay, but it‚Äôs a very chill job. The second is guaranteed higher pay but I am unsure of what the team is like. The first jobs offer is being made next week and I haven‚Äôt interviewed for the second job. Should I hold out?

1f09yua,Thinking about quitting job after a few weeks but fearing backlash,"Some context I‚Äôd been laid off and searching for a job for about a year - two offers were extended within a few days of one another. 

Both were competitive offers - same-ish salary, bonus, employer paid health insurance, etc, etc. The only difference is that one is hybrid (1-2.5 hours one way pending traffic) and the other is in office (20 mins one way). I went through the conditional offer phase before reneging my acceptance (job 1) and accepted another where my old manger (who really like) is the head of the department but not my direct/hiring manager (job 2).

I had an extensive pros and cons list and the only con with job 1 was the inflexibility, however, it‚Äôs in an industry I care about. Job 2 is in an industry I don‚Äôt care for but was flexible and this was important to me because my entire family lives in another state and I was told I could work from there every so often when I decided to visit. My previous manager knew the flexibility would be a game changer for me and stressed this pro and that basically won me over. 

I‚Äôve been in job 2 for almost two weeks and am finding that while the perks of working hybrid are great, I‚Äôm uncovering a lot of clean up work and a lot of strange behind the scenes things that I can‚Äôt elaborate on. Internally doesn‚Äôt look or feel great. To be fair this was made transparent to me but I didn‚Äôt understand the extent of it. I mean who understands the extent of anything when starting a job? Old manager was happy with whichever direction I went with and would not have held it against be should I have decided to go with the other company. So I know it‚Äôs all my fault and feel guilty for wanting to leave asap.

When I accepted job 2 I nearly immediately regretted it to begin with and had quite some anxiety within two hours of saying yes.  Felt like I had made a huge mistake but couldn‚Äôt decline now especially because I know the head of the dept. I had made it up in my head that I would reevaluate at 6 months and then 1 year and hopefully be able to leave. I‚Äôm not in the greatest mindset for this role if I‚Äôm thinking of a game plan. This isn‚Äôt to say I wouldn‚Äôt be my best in the role I‚Äôm given.

Job 1‚Äôs manager told me to let them know if I ever changed my mind. It‚Äôs been three weeks since that conversation but I haven‚Äôt reached out to see if the role is still available or if it‚Äôs now filled. I plan to do so just to see but don‚Äôt wanna keep my hopes up and am really nervous.

I guess I‚Äôm asking what to do if I want to leave the job with my old manager after such a short period of time because I know it‚Äôs not going to be a good look on them. I feel that this will ruin my professional relationship with them. They were my professional reference for job 1. üò´üò©

Apologies if this doesn‚Äôt make sense and would be happy to elaborate where I can. TiA for your help. I know I‚Äôm really lucky to have landed a job at all and am grateful especially with how things are going in the market.

1f080zr,I need career advice ,"
Hello everyone, it‚Äôs Sameer.

Three months ago, my FSC exams were completed, and I faced one of the most crucial and challenging decisions of my life: determining my career path.

To start from the beginning, during my matriculation, I was very eager to become a doctor. This wasn‚Äôt due to a deep passion for the profession but rather because of the societal reverence for medicine. My desire to become a doctor persisted over the next three years, leading me to pursue FSC Pre-Medical. I performed well in both matric and the first year of FSC, which made my parents thrilled with the prospect of me becoming a doctor. However, things began to change.

At the start of my second year (12th grade), I began to realize that becoming a doctor wasn‚Äôt aligned with my true interests or abilities. Despite these realizations, I continued with my studies, trying to ignore these growing doubts. Eventually, it became clear that this was not the life I wanted. After extensive research, I decided to pursue a career as a Chartered Accountant (CA), which seemed more suited to my interests. I started sharing my plans with friends and teachers but kept this decision from my family until after my FSC exams.

My parents were very pleased with the idea of me becoming a doctor. Thus, when my father asked about preparing for the MDCAT entry test on the night of my last exam, I requested a day to consider my options. The following day, I informed him that I no longer wanted to pursue a medical career but was interested in becoming a CA. His reaction was severe and unexpected; he was extremely angry and told me that if I didn‚Äôt become a doctor, he would not fund my education in any other field. Under this pressure, I reluctantly joined MDCAT coaching.

Despite achieving 95% in matric and 92% in the first year, and likely performing well in 12th grade, I find myself preparing for the MDCAT with minimal interest and am concerned about my potential failure. Initially, I planned to pursue CA, but after further reflection, I realized it might be more challenging than anticipated. I am now considering taking the SAT and aiming for top universities for Computer Science, which offers strong future prospects and aligns with my skills.

I also have a deep passion for cooking and love culinary arts, though I understand it might not be the most financially viable option. Additionally, I am a skilled artist and excel in this area, but my parents are not supportive of me pursuing fashion design or fine arts as a career.

On top of this, I have an entrepreneurial mindset. My ultimate goal is to start my own business and launch a startup. While I‚Äôm still uncertain about the exact nature of my business, I am confident that entrepreneurship is my true calling. I believe that a degree in Computer Science is a strong option for me. It offers a broad range of skills, including marketing and website development, which are valuable for running a business. Although I come from a medical background and have limited knowledge in this area, I am committed to learning and adapting. A degree in Computer Science not only supports my entrepreneurial aspirations but also provides a solid backup plan, ensuring that I have a reliable career option if needed. In contrast, degrees like BBA might not offer the same level of career security or flexibility.

All these factors have led to significant frustration and regret for missing out on this year‚Äôs university admissions. I am now open to exploring other degree programs that offer promising future prospects where I can achieve success through hard work. I am eager to hear any suggestions and will carefully consider all options available to me.

I was a working professional for a year left my job, now preparing full time. It's been a month.

These days I'm not able to study even a single thing. Idk what to do.

 Sometimes a think of writing CAT this year (but I don't have enough time to prepare), sometimes I think of writing CUET (planning to pursue MPH from TISS) as, I've enough time to prepare for it. Idk what to do, I feel guilty of myself and my decision making ability. I'm reconsidering my decision to aapear for UPSC I already gave prelims this year scoring miserably In GS(around 40 and 55 in CSAT).

 I'm thinking of some back up and preparing alongside or may be getting into masters and continuing with a decent job only. Because I don't want to sit at home for long time. My current qualifications won't allow me to take up a decent job as of now.

1f05eri,New Software Sales Role - Should I leave or should I stay?,"Reddit,

I‚Äôve been at an industry leading, best in class software platform provider for nearly 3 years. For the most part, I‚Äôve really enjoyed my time here and had more success than most as an Account Executive. It is a challenging sales role.

However, there has been a lot of change after our company was acquired by private equity. Leadership changes have had a huge impact, and my VP (who became one of my best friends) and his SVP (also a friend) both left for new leadership roles. Many of my friends I was hired with have slowly began to leave.

This has caused me to take recruiting calls, where 6-9 months ago I wouldn‚Äôt have.

Now, both of the executives above have offered me new roles at their company. I am so torn on what to do. I‚Äôd love your guidance/advice:

1. Stay at current role

With all of the AEs leaving recently, my pipeline has more than doubled. I have the chance to absolutely crush my quota, which is very difficult to do here. I‚Äôd say less than 10% hit quota. This would put me on the fast track to leadership, or an even better role outside the company. I already have a great ‚Äúbrand‚Äù here, and I know the existing leadership and sales organization likes me quite a bit.

2. Leave for a role under my former VP

I‚Äôve already been offered this role, and could start Oct 1 if I choose to. It is a competitor, but not an industry leading solution. However, while the sales are smaller more than 70% of AEs hit quota and quickly get into accelerators. Also, many from my current company have moved here so I‚Äôd be very familiar with those around me. It would be about a $5k bump for my current base, and I‚Äôd get equity.

3. Leave for a role under my former SVP

This role would be handling the biggest Strategic Enterprise Accounts for a best in class solution. The SVP said he would ‚Äútake care of me‚Äù in terms of assuring I‚Äôd have a good pipeline. The company has been open that they plan to sell in 2-3 years, and I would receive equity that‚Äôs vested after 1 year. This would also be a $5k raise from where I am currently, and would be a slightly better title.

This was all while also trying to jointly care for her with my spouse who is also employed and my mother who would have to come help. Many times I did not feel that I had the luxury to take a sick day and not fall behind at work or miss deadlines. I have always been a very dedicated employee and have worked for the same company after college for almost 10 years. I have been promoted within my role 4 different times and have always had positive performance reviews. None of this excuses the behavior, but I wish to think perhaps this is a fairly benign reason to be fired with cause. 

My question is how do I address this with future employers? I was very open and honest with HR at my current role regarding this situation and I want to maintain a level of integrity with my future employer, but I also don‚Äôt want to hurt my chances at securing a new position.

1f03leb,I think my job is going to fire me next week. ,"Any advice would be helpful. 
I‚Äôve worked for my company for five years. 2 years ago, I landed a WFH position with the company. I joined when they were transitioning to a new system. We have to get at least 120 transactions minimum and I usually aim for 160-170. All my scores are high, KPI‚Äôs are exceeding. 
I skipped a few files over the last couple weeks. I had dental work done and these files included me having to make phone calls. I still hit exceeded my expectations. I also assumed it wasn‚Äôt as a big of a deal because they never stressed that we couldn‚Äôt skip files. We get maybe like 100 a day. 

My boss called me in to a meeting and asked me why. I told him about the dental work and me not wanting to seem incompetent or using my very few PTO balance days that I have left. (I get outages in my area alot and just last week they implemented that internet outages would be taken from our PTO balance.) But I apologized and said It wouldn‚Äôt happen again. It‚Äôs not like I made zero calls those days either, it‚Äôs just Dental pain is no joke. He said he would let HR know that we had this conversation and get back to me with the notes. 

My friend called me and stated that in her division they fired like 5 people for the same exact thing. (Everyone skips a few files here and there but they are really hammering down on it now.) 
I‚Äôm worried about Monday, I‚Äôve been reading on forums that‚Äôs when they usually fire folks. 

I‚Äôm nervous that they won‚Äôt give me a second chance. I‚Äôve also been applying to other jobs for the past five months with no real luck anyway. How would you guys handle this? The nerves are wrecking me. I‚Äôm a mom of 2 toddlers and my husband was just diagnosed with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (he won‚Äôt be working soon at all) so it‚Äôs a lot on me, especially with the worry of everything.

","Hi everyone! I'm 17 F, entering grade 12 this fall. I‚Äôm studying at an American-accredited school outside the US and taking AP courses. I really need some advice about what I should major in, especially since applications are opening soon, and I‚Äôm still pretty clueless.

**Countries I‚Äôm Considering:**  
I‚Äôm thinking of applying to universities in the US, Canada, and the UK, with Canada being my top priority. My family plans to immigrate to Canada if I decide to study there, so staying close to them would be ideal.

**Seeking Advice on Biomedical Fields:**  
Can someone explain what it's like to work in Biomedical Engineering, Biomedical Sciences, or Molecular Biology? I'm curious about the job prospects and salary differences among these fields. What kind of work do you typically do in these careers?

I'm particularly interested in genetics and DNA-related fields. I‚Äôm also considering pharmacy, but I know that in Canada, it takes 8 years to become a pharmacist, while the US offers a 6-year accelerated program, and the UK has a 4-5 year pathway.

1f02ggs,Key Strategies to be Indispensable at Work,"Being an indispensable employee or an efficient businessman is the key to professional success and career security. Here are some strategies to become an invaluable asset to your enterprise:



¬†**Be an Expert**

Develop a deep expertise in a particular skill or domain that is relevant to your enterprise/business. This could be a specific technical area, an industry-specific knowledge, or a specialized workflow or process. Become the go-to person for such expertise.

¬†

**Share your knowledge**

Never hoard the acquired knowledge - share it with colleagues or in any industry level meet-ups/forums etc. Offer to train, mentor, and collaborate with others. This will build your reputation as a team player and thought leader.

¬†

**Don't over-focus on Promotion**

Rather than constantly angling for the next promotion, focus on delivering exceptional work and providing value. The promotions and accolades will follow naturally.

¬†

**Build Relationships with Decision Makers**

Cultivate genuine relationships with key stakeholders such as customers, employees, and executives internal to the enterprise/business. Understand their priorities and find ways to support them.

¬†

**Follow Directions**

Demonstrate your ability to execute any given top-down instructions, precisely and efficiently. This shows you are reliable and trustworthy.

¬†

**Treat Everyone with Respect**

Be kind, courteous and helpful to all your colleagues, regardless of their position or role. This will earn goodwill across the organization. It is a quality/attribute that serves as your asset outside work too.

¬†

**Be Honest**

Always strive to be truthful, even if it means delivering difficult feedback or admitting mistakes. This builds trust and credibility.

¬†

**Generate Ideas/Solutions**

Proactively come up with innovative solutions to problems. Be a creative problem-solver who is always looking to improve processes, and outcomes, as applicable.

¬†

**Look for Ways to Increase Productivity**

Identify opportunities to work smarter, streamline workflows, and boost efficiency. This will make you an invaluable asset.

¬†

**Be Positive about Change**

Embrace organizational changes and transitions with an adaptable, solutions-oriented mindset. Be a champion of progress.

¬†

**Focus on Important Tasks, Not Easy Ones**

Prioritize high-impact work over quick ""easy wins."" Demonstrate your ability to tackle the most critical and challenging initiatives.

¬†

**Offer Solutions to Problems**

When you identify issues, come prepared with thoughtful, actionable solutions. This shows that you are proactive and leverage strategic thinking.

¬†

**Gain a Competitive Edge**

Continuously learn new skills, stay up-to-date on industry/market trends, competitive landscape and look for ways to differentiate yourself.

¬†

**Make Your Boss's Job Easier**

Anticipate your manager's needs and find ways to lighten their workload. This will make you indispensable and recognized a go-to employee.

¬†

**Take the Initiative**

Don't wait to be told or instructed on what to do. Identify areas where you can step up and take the lead independently.

¬†

**Be Reliable**

Consistently meet deadlines, deliver high-quality work, and follow through on your commitments. Build a reputation for dependability and become reliable.

¬†

**Do not Gossip**

Avoid engaging in office politics and negative chatter. Maintain professionalism and integrity at all times.

¬†

**Accomplish More than the Minimum**

Go above and beyond your job description. Seek out opportunities to contribute beyond your core responsibilities.

¬†

**Focus on the Bottom Line**

Understand how your work impacts the organization's overall performance and profitability. Make informed decisions with the big picture in mind.

¬†

**Show Enthusiasm**

Approach your work with a positive, energetic attitude. This will inspire others and encourage them to work with you.

¬†

**Ask for Help, if you are in Need**

Don't be afraid to seek support when you need it. Admitting limitations and asking for assistance demonstrates self-awareness and humility.

If you neeed to negotiate the terms of a contract, discuss a scope of work for a consultant or otherwise do something important that could take perhaps half an hour on the phone, isn't the standard these days to schedule the call in advance, so that you can ensure that the other person is free and give time to prepare?

Or do you still just call out if the blue, unannounced and without scheduling it, even for a 30-minute call on an important topic?

I'll do my best to stay concise, but I'm worried about my ability to find a suitable job and I'd like some suggestions
I'll start by saying, my doctors have been recommending I go on disability for the last two years or so
I have intermittent psychosis, seizures, a few major brain injuries, my organs are paralyzing themselves one by one, and I'll probably be legally blind by the time I'm 30
I have yet to cope with the fact that I will never be allowed to get a CDL or join the army
I would really like to be able to go on SSI instead of full disability though, so I can work part-time, I would be too bored otherwise
Every career I've wanted to pick, I have not been able to do because of my disabilities
The most successful job I've had has been as a retail merchandiser, as a statutory employee, where my own schedule was completely up to me, 100%
But it pays like $10-15 an hour and I'd like more
I also really want to go through the process of getting educated/certified and taking classes and such, it's a real staple of life here in America and I don't wanna miss out (besides that people are really mean when you don't have an education or a job)

So does anyone know of anything regarding short education to part time role?
I'm great at math, I like being outside, and I wanna find a way to help people

1ezuukj,What to do with unfulfilled contract (salary but not really) ,"What to do with unfulfilled contract (salary but not really) 

Started a job (GA,USA) back in November. Met the owner of the company through a friend and did a in person surprise interview and then he asked for me resume. Sent him my resume and got offer a position. 

The proposal/contract stated the following: 
Salary: $60,000 
Pto: 120 weeks. 
90 day probationary period. 
Once 90 days is reached they decide wether to bring me on full time. 
I got hired. Benefits started 

Benefits are the following: 

120 hours of PTO (30 hours of PTO earned at the beginning of each quarter). 
7 federal holidays off 
Company vehicle or $800 a month vehicle allowance. 
Matched 401k 
Health 
Dental
Vision. 

Long story short I hate confrontation and this is my first office job and it still freaks me out to this day to talk to my manger and boss/owner. 

PROBLEMS:

VEHICLE/ALLOWANCE: 
Anyways. I got ducked around for 5 months with the company truck(which I choose). But during those 5 months I was not given the $800 a month allowance for using my personal vehicle. 

HEALTH BENEFITS: 
It‚Äôs almost September and they are now telling me I may not be given health benifits until next year due to enrollment period. (I was late handing in the documents due to life drama going it. Handed them in April/may. 

SALARY: 
The contract states salary but on my pay stub it says 80hrs a every 2 weeks at a hourly pay rate. If I miss a day due to being sick or something urgent I get docked pay. From my understanding im not supposed to under salary unless it‚Äôs a vacation. 

TIME OFF: 
I moved to the USA from another country and for me to go back is really expensive and I generally take 2 weeks off a year to go see my family back home. It‚Äôs not stated in the contract but appernetly is company policy that I can‚Äôt take more then one week off of my PTO at the same time. They allowed it once this year but not ever again. 


Please throw me advice on what I should do. Should I confront my boss or go find another job. I‚Äôm worried about not finding another job with the same salary and benefits.

I work pretty closely with managing partners and our associate directors, they all tell me pretty constantly how smart they think I am and how competent I am compared to my peers (I‚Äôve been told ‚Äúthere are people who have been here for a few years that haven‚Äôt figured out what youve figured out‚Äù) 
I will say sometimes I do get reallyyyy lucky and the right opportunity just falls in my lap and I usually deliver on it. 
There is a pretty high frequency of me getting bored and just staring out of the windows most days - I typically ask my manager for more projects which typically result in me putting out ‚Äúmini fires‚Äù which take like 20-30 min to complete 
Other times I‚Äôll get small data files to clean which usually takes 1-2 hours (the point I‚Äôm trying to make here is that I‚Äôm mostly bored out of my mind lol) ",PrestigiousTip47,0,0.33000001311302185,2,1724465192,2024-08-24 02:06:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ezubxn/am_i_under_paid/,8,2024

1eztco9,Career Choice Guidance,"Career Choice Guidance

Hey Everyone,

I‚Äôd like to get some feedback/opinions on my career trajectory/outlook. I‚Äôll preface this post by saying, I understand Reddit may not be the most ideal place to seek career advice. Unfortunately, I come from a very poor background and a poorly educated family that I don‚Äôt have much to do with anymore. All that to be said, I don‚Äôt really know who else to turn to for sound advice. 

Some background on myself. I graduated from a ‚Äúmiddle of the pack‚Äù State University with my B.S. in Construction Management. I‚Äôm currently a Project Manager with a commercial construction company in the Raleigh, NC area. The financial aspects of my role are great, I make around 110k a year at 26 years old. The downside to this is that I‚Äôm absolutely miserable in my job. It‚Äôs constant stress followed by a never ending cycle of ‚Äúputting out fires‚Äù. My day is mostly spent either playing hardball with a subcontractor or having to explain why we‚Äôre ONLY a week ahead of schedule to the ownership team. The commercial construction industry is extremely unrewarding when it comes to credit being given where it‚Äôs due. I‚Äôm married with three children. My wife works a shift here and there at a local pizza place as a server while finishing her BSN degree. She‚Äôs expected to graduate in three years. 

Now that you have my background let me explain the options I‚Äôm considering for a transition.

My true passion and joy in life is sports. I always wanted to be a coach growing up but quickly learned that high school coaching/teaching doesn‚Äôt pay the bills (at-least in the RDU area). I‚Äôve strongly considered doing the TOT program with the state which gives the opportunity to individuals with Bachelor‚Äôs degrees to earn their teaching licensure in a very short amount of time. Obviously in doing so I‚Äôd be cutting my pay quite literally in half. I know in doing this it would completely mitigate my work related stress but may cause financial stress at-least until my wife is working. The good side to this is the pension and long term stability of the role. They pay increases around $1,500 per year with state stipends awarded as well, so eventually I‚Äôll get to a place where the money isn‚Äôt so bad. 

The second option I‚Äôve pondered is starting my own construction related business. I started in the industry with a commercial paint company and understand the business model very well. Although I don‚Äôt enjoy my job I‚Äôm considered ‚Äúvery bright‚Äù and good at it among my peers. I‚Äôm one of the youngest APM‚Äôs in my company and have always been assigned to the toughest/largest projects. I have a fairly strong pipeline of people in the market between residential and commercial work that I could leverage to gain contracts. I wouldn‚Äôt mind this as much but wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as happy as I would be teaching/coaching. My success in my position gives me the confidence that I‚Äôd be successful in business as well which is why this is a strong consideration. This obviously has the highest upside for earnings but is also the biggest risk of the three, especially with my family obligations. 

All this said, does anyone have any similar experiences? I‚Äôm sort of at a loss with what I want to do in life but know my current situation isn‚Äôt sustainable. This is the third construction company I‚Äôve worked for in 7 years and have found that it‚Äôs just an industry stigma I don‚Äôt enjoy rather than the company itself. I know this post was super scattered, but hopefully you guys can help with suggestions. 

Thank you, ",Zestyclose_Dare6628,3,1.0,0,1724462174,2024-08-24 01:16:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eztco9/career_choice_guidance/,8,2024
1ezt5bp,How to Get Into a Small Company w/o contacts,"Hello,

I need some outside perspective on my infatuation with a company and the reality of working for it, and how to approach the company. 

I have about 15 years of experience in my field (oil and gas).  It is very cyclical and I've been laid off enough to value a steady paycheck. I've never been a big fan of the way U.S. (oil) companies are run, so I started to complete an MBA to better understand them and just to learn (in general). (It's an online MBA that I do while performing my day-job simultaneously- it's not a game changing degree.)   

While I cannot envision doing anything else for a living, it turns out that I greatly care about what I work on and the nature of the company for which I work. As part of my MBA coursework, I ""compared and contrasted the strategies employed by your chosen company"" and yadda, yadda yadda about Company X which bore some notional interest for me. 

After going through many years of its' annual reports, I was smitten (first time ever). Company X's risk tolerance, patience with long-term projects, and decision to not lay off people during CoVid really, *really* struck a strong chord in me. (I hate ""corporate speak"" but in this case it is absolutely true.)

As I near completion of my coursework (\~6 months out), I'm starting to put out feelers and even get interviews.  I *think* I'd like to work at Company X, but I have 2, possibly 3 problems.

Problem 1: I don't know anyone in the company (personally). I have matched with some of their Board on LinkedIn, but really, I don't know anyone there. It seems like a bad idea to just email someone on the Board of Directors and say ""I really like what you are doing, what can I do to be involved?"" (My skills match several ongoing projects.) 

  
Problem 2:  This company has offices in several places in Europe and operates in several countries in Africa. I am U.S.-based but have lived in non-western countries and travelled in Africa. I kinda don't care where I'd live (and yes, that is some of the appeal). 

Problem 3: All this might be in my head. I don't actually know anyone that works at Company X.  I am viewing their gross headcount on annual forms. They may have laid off half their staff and replaced them all in a given year. I'm going on what was reported, and there are always things that don't get reported.  

So, am I completely off-base in my thinking? Given that I only have connections on LinkedIn (notional at best) with the CEO, CFO, Board members, it is a suicide mission to email these people directly, right?",YourSemenSommelier,1,1.0,2,1724461556,2024-08-24 01:05:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ezt5bp/how_to_get_into_a_small_company_wo_contacts/,8,2024
1ezsrn8, Navigating Financial Compensation for Uncovering Critical Security Flaws as a Student,"I'm a second-year cybersecurity student who also works at a sales company managing their system. During my time there, I discovered a critical vulnerability in the accounting system provided by ""Company S,"" a significant entity in medical sales software. This type of vulnerability could allow an attacker to access and manipulate the company's database without proper authorization, potentially leading to data theft or loss or manipulation , i guess you would know how dangerous this could be and how much money it would cause them in lawsuits if it leads to loses in the company .

Here's where it gets complex: I didn't find these issues because I'm an expert. In fact, I'm not well-versed in the database language used or deeply experienced in cybersecurity. My discoveries were purely due to my problem-solving skills, using knowledge sourced from books and the Internet and connecting the dots using what i newly learned. 

After finding the vulnerability, to my surprise I learned that my father is close friends with the owner and manager of Company S. Thinking it was safe, I bypassed legal precautions and directly reported the issue, hoping for goodwill due to the familial connection.

The owner was interested and had me demonstrate the problem. During this process, I also examined a newer system thats double the price and more secured .i tried what i found in the cheaper system and it didnt work but one day later I found it was susceptible to another kind of attack, which could allow malicious scripts to be injected into the system, compromising the integrity and confidentiality of user data.The team seemed impressed, and I spent hours helping them understand and address the vulnerabilities. This involved dedicating 2 entire days to them, during which I neglected my own job and upcoming exams.

However, when it came to discussing employment or compensation, I hit a wall. The response was vague, hinting at future possibilities but nothing concrete. They even sent me the part of the source code that they fixed for me to review their fixes.

In my country, it's common for computer science students to get part-time jobs in their field while studying, which allows them to apply their growing skills in a real-world context and continue learning while also helping the company they work for . I was hoping for such an opportunity here because, although I'm not a database expert, I possess unique cybersecurity knowledge that no one in the company has. I'm confident I can identify and fix more vulnerabilities while learning more and mkre about the database language they use .

I'm now unsure how to ask for payment or formal recognition for my work. As a student, I don't see myself as an expert, which seems to be how the manager views me ‚Äì just a young guy who stumbled upon something or just a friends son.

How should I proceed in negotiating compensation or a position? I want to ensure my efforts are adequately valued while recognizing my current educational and professional stage.

Any advice or personal experiences in similar situations would be greatly appreciated!

1ezsdx0,Lost 26 year old unsure what steps to take ,"Hi everyone,



I‚Äôll tell you my whole life story post-uni‚Äîso consider this your warning in advance!



I‚Äôm 26 years old, and I hold a Master‚Äôs degree in Management (with Merit) from a reputable university in the UK. My undergraduate degree was in Politics and Business. I‚Äôd like to share my journey so far and seek any advice or guidance you might have because, quite frankly, I‚Äôm feeling rather lost at this point.



After finishing my degree, I began applying for roles in September 2020 (I officially graduated in September 2021 due to the COVID delays). For the better part of 8 months, I went through various interview processes, which ultimately led to me failing quite badly at an assessment centre for one of the Big 4 firms. This was one of the lowest moments I‚Äôve had post-university; I was woefully unprepared and felt genuinely inadequate, questioning whether I was even cut out for the career I was pursuing. Looking back, it seems a bit silly, but at the time, it was devastating.



In June 2021, I took on an internship at a small company to ensure I was at least doing something. This internship lasted until October 2021. Following that, I spent around four months (September to December 2021) preparing to move to America after receiving a job offer through my network. Unfortunately, the offer was pulled because the company‚Äôs owner turned out to be a crook and apparently had a breakdown‚Äîabsolutely ridiculous, I know.



During this period (June 2021 to January 2022), I was also going through a tough breakup, which made things even more challenging. While dealing with this, I didn‚Äôt apply for many jobs except for one assessment centre with the same consultancy. Although I performed better this time, I just missed out on the role.



From January to June 2022, I was job hunting again. In April 2022, I attended another assessment centre for a major consultancy, where I needed a score of 3.5 out of 5 to secure a place on their graduate scheme. I ended up with a score of 3.4‚Äîjust my luck, right?



After more failed attempts to secure a graduate or entry-level corporate role, I eventually took up an admin position with a big exam board. It was a decent role and allowed me to keep looking for jobs in the meantime. In September 2022, I finally secured a job with an expert network, starting in January 2023. However, it turned out to be the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had. The role was essentially a glorified call centre job, and I despised it. After falling quite ill, my employers pressured me to resign, and when I didn‚Äôt, they terminated my contract during my probation period. Although I considered legal action, I was advised it wouldn‚Äôt amount to much due to being in my probation period.



After losing the expert network role, I accrued significant debt, including loans I took out for some failed business ventures. Financially strained, I had to pause my job search and focus on paying off this debt. From September 2023 until the end of the year, I worked 60-70 hours per week to get back to normal. By January 2024, I finally managed to stabilise my finances.



I resumed my job search in January 2024, but at this point, I‚Äôm utterly confused about what to do next and how to even get on the career ladder. Am I damaged goods? How do I even start over at this point? Many graduate roles won‚Äôt accept applications from those who graduated before 2023, which is further limiting my options.



If anyone has any advice or guidance, I‚Äôd be incredibly grateful.

1ezqnlo,Should I put in a 2 weeks notice or just quit?,"A little bit of venting but I‚Äôve (22M) been working as a detailer for a well known car company for 6 months now. I was fired from my last job and needed something quick. The interview was a phone call with one of the upper management and I got the job after a 10 min conversation. I was already skeptical about the job but I accepted it and went in. Everything was fine for the first few months until my direct manager quit. We were given another manager in charge to report to and it‚Äôs been really difficult to talk to her to point that I‚Äôm uncomfortable to be around her. She has said smart comment, out of pocket statements, and has lied to my team many times. When I called her out on this, she of course was not happy about it and it led to us going back and forth. She recently even threatened to terminate for trying to make it seem that I was out on lunch longer than I was supposed to. It was Proven I wasn‚Äôt. Yet she still tried to make it seem I did wrong. However, I saw her while I was out on lunch at the mall (the mall is 5min away from my job) and even came back before her. Nothing was said about until a week later when she started having issues with two other coworkers on my team. I heard from my team that she made a smart and very unprofessional comment about them, which led them cussing her out. 

Ever since she been our manager we haven‚Äôt been treated respectfully, no thank you, or any type of events. Other departments get 4 days off near holidays, have events, and are acknowledged. My team are pretty much unappreciated and we‚Äôve had many altercation with other departments over stupid things. When one department doesn‚Äôt do their job, we‚Äôre expected to pick up the slack and if we don‚Äôt, we‚Äôre the ones they try to discipline. They rely on us so much yet treat us very poorly. The people here can be very nasty and I hate to say this but I also feel there is a bit of discrimination going on with issues involving racial slur and behavior arising. I can‚Äôt even speak to a lot of people without them having some type of attitude. Lastly, but not all I don‚Äôt have the motivation no longer, I just don‚Äôt see myself making it past next month without something happening. 

I‚Äôm noticeably more irritated, purposely make myself unapproachable, and find myself being like everyone else. I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable being there anymore. I think about reporting to HR before leaving but I don‚Äôt even think they would care if things are this bad and been going on for so long. I‚Äôve been applying for jobs all over and been talking to friends and family about being put on to something. Once I find something, I‚Äôm done. I just don‚Äôt know if I should put in a two weeks or just up and leave. I don‚Äôt find myself coming back or wanting to be around any of these people at all.

My Area Director finally suggested I apply for a Pathways Internship, which would train me in all aspects of my agency.  I am doing almost exactly the same thing and not getting any additional training.

My mentor lined up a series of talks with folks in Public Affairs and Marketing positions.  The first was with someone who is basically over most of the PA folks for the agency.

It was amazing, enlightening, and showed me aspects of the job I'd never even considered.

I enthusiastically told my Area Director about it.  He got red in the face and asked, ""Why are you even in the internship if you don't want to be a Loan Specialist?""

I gave an answer of, ""well, at my age no one is going to put me in a public affairs position.  Plus, my wife doesn't want to move and you can't do those positions remotely.""

1ezo985,I can‚Äôt focus at all in meetings and I feel like it‚Äôs close to impacting my ability to be successful. Advice? ,"

I‚Äôll say upfront that I do have ADHD. While I have been able to successfully find strategies for getting my work done in a timely manner without distraction, being on time in general, and making my thought processes coherent to others, I really struggle to focus in meetings. I‚Äôve looked into using medication to help, but unfortunately the doctor I spoke to about it said ‚Äúmedication didn‚Äôt help‚Äù her ADHD and so she refused to prescribe it.  So I feel a bit at a loss there.

The issue is that I cannot seem to focus specifically in meetings. One on one, 3 person conversations I‚Äôm completely fine. As soon as discussions start where I‚Äôm not expected to respond back right away it feels like I immediately start to drift away. I start thinking about other things and can‚Äôt focus and then I slowly start to feel like I‚Äôm falling asleep. Unless I‚Äôm being spoken to directly, my mind powers down. Inevitably someone will ask me a question and I‚Äôm desperately trying to grasp onto the words I‚Äôve heard but not processed in the last few seconds before they asked the question. If there‚Äôs a slide deck I have to reread it after and email follow up questions to the meeting leader. Then I feel like an idiot because half the time the questions were asked in the room but I couldn‚Äôt focus enough to hear the answer. I honestly leave meetings (even ones with interesting topics) feeling zapped. I feel like I have to slap myself to wake up.

I only drank or used THC socially, just on weekends, but I‚Äôve completely stopped both of those as well in an effort to not impede my mind in any way. It‚Äôs been months now and it still hasn‚Äôt helped.

I‚Äôve tried note taking but then I‚Äôm distracted by the notes I‚Äôm taking because I end up getting behind since I can‚Äôt write as fast as everyone speaks. I‚Äôve moved into a new position and in a field I really like and I still just can‚Äôt focus. It‚Äôs very embarrassing and it‚Äôs only become worse throughout my life.

Does anyone have any advice or strategies they use to stay focused?",mcqueen415,1,1.0,0,1724448317,2024-08-23 21:25:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ezo985/i_cant_focus_at_all_in_meetings_and_i_feel_like/,8,2024

1eznxd1,Can my work as a manufacturing operator translate into something better?,"
My story: I‚Äôm 25, about to be 26. I‚Äôve worked in manufacturing as an operator the past two years. I do have a degree, but it is in something unrelated (communications) with a horrible GPA (2.83) and no connections. 

I do not want to be an operator and get dirty forever, so I was wondering what sort of role I could transition into, that would get me into a position I could do longer.

Some ideas- 

Logistics: a certification could help me land a supply chain job, and maybe my work experience would be a plus.

Management/Supervision: maybe could also get some training or a certification, it woulf be nice because I like working with people. I know people respect managers who have been through the trenches. Supervisors at manufacturing firms make good money.

What are some other ideas? Or are my two ideas above not good

I really enjoy my coworkers but the company is very small and the CEO is extremely hostile towards his employees in a way I just have never felt comfortable supporting. I've stayed there as long as I have to build my resume as I started in a different field and worked my way to this position but I recently got my Master's and started putting out resumes in February.

I've had 3 initial interviews, 1 technical interview, and 0 offers not including the opportunity I'm about to dive into because that's kind of my whole point of posting. But all this is to say, it's a really competitive market out there right now and these positions are getting literally hundreds and hundreds of applicants.

I have a friend that left his previous position at a company I've wanted to work at for YEARS. The position is remote, the team seems really nice, and the pay would be the same if not more than my current position. He gave them my name and told me to apply and I did and since then, I've had 3 interviews where the people just seem over the moon invested in me because they liked my friend so much. I truly felt I absolutely BOMBED the technical interview. I didn't even finish the problem. But they were so nice about it saying they just wanted to see how I worked through a problem. 

They've called me back for a final round interview and obviously I said yes but now I'm getting all in my head that they're not really taking into account my skill level and I'm going to show up and not perform to their standards. The job market is so volatile right now I truly believe if I was fired, I'd be out of a job for potentially years. I'm just so scared of messing this up and having to pick up the pieces....

My question is if they make an offer; should I take it despite my hesitations that I might not meet the criteria for the job? I'm comfortable where I am; despite my distaste for management. And again, being thrust into a job search without income sounds like a fate worse than death right now.

When I resigned, i honestly did expect some backlash from my manager but they were really good about it! Congratulated me and told me Im infact not burning a bridge and if things don‚Äôt work out at the new company my manager would take me back.

I‚Äôm in a bit of a crisis and could really use some advice. Here‚Äôs the situation: I‚Äôm 27, Canadian, and feeling completely lost in life. Back in 2021, I was living in Berlin and struggled to make money. I went through a coding bootcamp with high hopes of landing a job as a web developer. But after two straight years of job hunting with zero success, I completely burned out and quit coding altogether. I ended up moving back to Canada and taking a job as a flight attendant, which, to be honest, I‚Äôm hating. The pay is terrible (around $15/hr), and I feel overworked and abu\*sed by the wage + physical demands. I tried to get a simple job as a barista to make ends meet but there are layoffs in the service industry and it seems everyone is trying to get a serving job with the job market these days, so since aviation is desperate for Flight Attendants right now, its all I could get.

Now I‚Äôm thinking about going back into tech and pursuing a CS degree to finally get that diploma I‚Äôve been missing for so long and I've developed a lot of shame around this. But I keep hearing that CS degrees are becoming useless, and I‚Äôm torn. I‚Äôve been trying to decide on a bachelor‚Äôs degree since I was 21, and here I am at 27, still with no direction.

Should I go back to school and get a CS degree? Is it worth it, or am I just setting myself up for more disappointment? I feel like I‚Äôm running out of time and options, and I don‚Äôt want to make another mistake.

I understand the industry right now is in shambles, trying only to hire ""unicorn"" senior devs with specific skills in certain technologies, as they don't want to train a single person due to a lack of job loyalty in the current market. I'm lost.

1ezjuti,From $65K to $177K in 6 Years ,"Hey Fam,

I wanted to share my journey over the last few years ‚Äì how I went from being an overworked electrical engineer to landing jobs at some of the biggest companies (Tesla, Oil & Gas, #1 Data Center company in the world) out there,  Hopefully, this inspires some of you and gives you a few tips on navigating the job market during this horrible time

**Year 1-3: Grind**  
I started my career as an electrical engineer making $65K base with an extra $20K in overtime pay. I was putting in 60-hour weeks. I *loved* the work but *hated* the balance. I knew this wasn‚Äôt sustainable for me in the long run.

**Year 3-5**  
I began networking like crazy and made some great connections at an EV charging startup. I had zero experience in that specific area, but they took a chance on me, and I took a chance on them. My starting salary was $75K, not much of an increase, but the potential was there. After six months of hustling and showing my impact, I negotiated my salary up to $110K!

**Year 5-6:**   
Referred some friends to the company, and we were doing great... until we got bought out. Everyone was laid off except me and seven others. I saw the writing on the wall and decided it was time for a change. 

I spent hours tweaking my resume, networking, tracking and practicing my interview skills. Landed an interview with Tesla got the job at after 8 rounds of interviews. Offer was $145K plus stock options and great benefits. 

**Year: 6+ (2024+)**  
Only lasted one year at when they had layoffs, and I was back on the market. I targeted a new and exciting industry to me that I had no experience in. I submitted 78 applications had 5 interviews and two offers that took about 3 months of hard work. I ended up accepting an offer at the biggest fish in the sector, focusing on data centers. They offered me $165K and I negotiated that up to $177K, no stock, not the best benefits. 

**My Key Takeaways:**

1. **Network Like Crazy** ‚Äì Your network is your net worth. Make genuine connections.
2. **Know Your Worth** ‚Äì Always negotiate. If you don‚Äôt ask, you don‚Äôt get.
3. **Keep Learning** ‚Äì Every job has been a stepping stone to the next.
4. **Adaptability is Everything** ‚Äì Don‚Äôt be afraid to pivot.

I‚Äôm sharing this because I want you all to know it‚Äôs possible. With hard work, dedication, and applying strategically, you can get where you want to be. I‚Äôm happy to help if anyone needs advice or tips.

1ezjpj8,Should I go back to the corporate world?,"Hi folks!

Here's my deal (40M, married/no kids in a MCOL city) - I was laid off from a high-paying position in corporate sales a few years ago. While I spent a decade climbing the corporate ladder to arrive at this position, I maintained a side gig performing music.

When I lost my job, this side gig ended up becoming my main source of income, and has since become enough to cover all the essentials (mortgage, car, insurance, utilities, food), for which I'm extremely grateful. I've managed to grow my network considerably and play more/better paying gigs, as well as teach on the side.

While working and earning a high salary for years, I lived very frugally, splurging only on the odd vacation and meal out (savings tip: most anyone can cook a better meal than most restaurants for a fraction of the price) - I'm comfortable with this lifestyle, as I don't desire material items like designer clothes, a big house or fancy cars - as long as I have a roof over my head, a functioning vehicle, food in the fridge, and the ability to travel every year or so, I'm not wanting for much.

I'm also not afraid to get my hands dirty by working any job needed to pay the bills - I worked my way throughout school as a line cook, which paid for my school/apartment/bills and allowed me to graduate debt-free, as well as purchase a used car and spend a month travelling abroad after graduation, all with no financial assistance - not sure that's possible anymore in this day and age.

As such, I've managed to save a solid nest egg, mostly invested in a diversified portfolio with the assistance of a financial advisor - the portfolio seems to be doing well enough, despite a few recent rocky years. While I consider myself mildly financially literate, I'm generally quite risk-adverse and see value in paying an expert to help guide me.

Here's the thing: I've recently been approached by a former colleague to work for him at company he recently joined (it would be similar role in a relatively niche industry), which would pay a high salary. I really do like and respect this colleague, and could see myself doing this type of work again - I was very successful in my prior role and am confident that I can do well in this new job. However, sales can be quite stressful and I'm rather prone to anxiety - I had frequent insomnia and overall poor health/diet throughout my time working in the corporate world.

Since I was laid off, I sleep much better, and have much better health overall - I have far more time to exercise daily, and have managed to lose 80lbs. I also really enjoy the life of a musician - while the pay is only a small fraction of what I made before, I've never been happier doing something I genuinely love within an amazing community.

However, given the current economic climate, I'm candidly unsure what to do. I have almost 25 years until retirement - various retirement calculators assure me that I've saved more than enough to benefit from compound interest/savings to live comfortably to age 95 (most folks in my family make it to their 80's), and that I have enough to pay off the mortgage and absorb a few financial hits along the way (eg: replace my vehicle a few times, emergency repairs for my home - I live in a country with universal healthcare, so this aspect fortunately isn't a concern).

However, like most of us, I'm concerned about the skyrocketing cost of living, and the insecurity of working a self-employed musician (gigs can suddenly dry up, I can get injured, etc.). While I don't want to pass up on a good opportunity to fully secure my future, I also don't want to go back to a stressful job just to make more money that I'll potentially never need/appreciate, and don't want to go back to working 60-70 hours, 6 days a week (I would definitely keep the music side gig on the weekends).

Apologies if this comes across as overly-privileged or insensitive to folks having a much harder time these days - I have many friends struggling, and am always rooting for the underdogs out there - I'm curious about this community's thoughts, and whether I'm potentially making a big mistake. Life is short, and nobody knows what tomorrow brings.

He told me he'd get back to me in about 2 or 3 days but I didn't hear anything back. I texted him the following Monday the 19th about where they were in the hiring process (because he contacted me via phone call in the first place, and we communicated about the 1st interview through text. I don't have his email). He said he was out sick a few days that week and still needed to get with the head office about scheduling those zoom interviews, and that he would get back with me by the end of the day. It's now Friday the 23rd and I still haven't heard anything. I know he's super busy but how do I ask, without seeming pushy or annoying, if they have filled the position or if/when they'll be scheduling the zoom interviews.

1ezj7qg,What do I do if I can‚Äôt afford to pay my bills on a single salary?,"TL;DR , today our big boss came out of his office and started yelling, ‚Äúif you are found working multiple jobs you will be fired on the spot‚Äù - as the title reads I work a second job because I can‚Äôt afford to pay my bills on the salary I am currently paid‚Ä¶
Someone (not me, because I was scared and kept my head down) asked ‚Äúwhat if you are really good at your job‚Äù to which the big boss responded ‚Äúwe can then discuss growth opportunities‚Äù - should I tell them I work 2 jobs to pay my bills?


Not that much more detail is needed but I‚Äôve been here for about 3 months - I work as an associate consultant, the work we do is really not hard, most days I feel like I just stare out of the window until 5pm (mainly because I use to work on other things of my own during downtime and was told not to bring my personal computer back into the office - so now I just ask my direct manager for extra projects to just pass the time and try my best not to lose my mind) 
I work in tandem with some of the associate directors on various projects, they tell me I am very good at analytics and build things or use functions they‚Äôve never seen before (I went to school specifically to do this type of job because I really enjoy what I do in practice). There have been managers hired above me since I‚Äôve been here and the associate directors will tell me in our 1 on 1 meetings that I am currently doing things that people who have been here for a year don‚Äôt understand how to do.

I say this all, not as a humble brag, but as a qualifier that these associate directors are managers often tell me I am really good at what I do, and I do truly enjoy what I do - but I‚Äôm bored as heck most of the time and don‚Äôt make enough to pay my bills (mostly because my student loan payments are crushing my finances - along with my rent are the two highest bills I have) 
For reference I‚Äôm almost 30 and make 75k annually 
I have a BSc, MBA, and MPH - I have a handful of certifications and am doing a post grad program through Wharton currently (on scholarship) I have almost 8 years of experience mostly in drug development/ project management within biotech (boutique biotech firms) 

Is this typically the pay range for my qualifications? 
Did I just rack up too much debt I just have to have two jobs because a single job would never pay me enough?

1ezib06,Is my job expecting too much from me on such a low wage?,"I took on a new job a month ago however I accepted my low pay (as I needed a full time job) and I accepted knowing that my role meant working under for two attorneys (whilst not knowing that I will also be taking on another solicitor in the future who is still giving the odd piece of work to do every so often and assisting other attorneys on top of it all - despite they have their own secretaries already).
They made it seem promising at my interview because the attorney I mainly be working for is only part time and that the other attorney has a paralegal who works for her.  However....

Although this post will seem like I'm complaining for even doing work but its the amount of work I am expected to push out within the same day). There isn't even the option to slow down. However if I bring this up to my office manager, she will think I'm not working quick enough or question if I'm cut out for the job. I feel my job requires at least one more secretary to take the load off.

What is really worrying and stressing me out, is that not only do I feel under pressure already, but I'm expected to assist the paralegal who works mainly for one of the same attorneys I work for as well and also bearing in mind I have my own attorney to deal with. This paralegal is going on vacation for 3 weeks and I have no idea how I am expected to cope. I've raised this in advance to my own attorney I work under for and she will speak to the other attorney as well how we will manage. I already have to type out very long letters at times. The paralegal has it somewhat easier for her because not only does she have me as well to help her (and there's times I feel guilty or not good enough if I'm short with time) but she is the only one who has a licence for audio recognition speech for her attorney so it takes her half the time and she starts her day an hour earlier than me, which leaves me to having to pick up her urgents once she's gone home.

Basically I feel overwhelmed with my job but I have no one sympathising with me as they simply assume that it doesn't seem too bad. 

Meanwhile in the other department in the next room, they have two secretaries each for each attorney. 

I could look for another job but feel utterly guilty because the paralegal has put a lot of enthusiasm on training me and clearly doesn't want me to desert them so soon as she is expecting to go on vacation.",HikingCityUrchin,1,1.0,2,1724433387,2024-08-23 17:16:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ezib06/is_my_job_expecting_too_much_from_me_on_such_a/,8,2024

Your manager might try to convince you to stay, he might bump your salary to encourage that, but as a rule...you NEVER accept their counter offer.  

The moment you threaten to leave, a target gets put on you. You'll piss off somebody and the budget being blown to pay your new salary puts the expectations on you. Besides, if quitting is the only way it takes for people to take notice of your efforts and to realize you are worth keeping then that company seems something unsavory to stay with in the log term. 

If you are a contractor, for certain do not look back when you are leaving the current assignment.

1ezg80z,Is it a good idea to have a proper stable day job and having art as a side hustle until it becomes successful enough that I can then switch over to do full time? Or should I go all in on art to have a chance at making it a good career?,"I would absolutely love to have a full time career in art. But there are several risks and uncertainties that make me not want to go into full time such as:

-Reliable pay

-Success

-Ending up being a career I don‚Äôt want

-Being burned out from art because it‚Äôs a job

-Time and stability

Because of this I don‚Äôt have a degree in art though I do have an education and practice in it. I plan to work a normal day job with stability and good pay while practicing my art after work or free time and getting it out there/networking to turn it into a success. And if it ends up making as much or more than the job then I‚Äôll just switch to art full time if I feel I am not being burnt out. 

When I am not working(and apart from maintaining relationships and health), I‚Äôll focus and work damn hard on honing my art, comics and programming video games to make a potential art career a success. And if that art career(side hustle?)after 5-10 years doesn‚Äôt work out at least I got a normal career to progress on make money while also still having art as something to do. By then my art portfolio should be big and good hopefully that maybe it can land me some art jobs(do I need an art degree to get art employment though? Bonus question).

Things that worry me though is that if this is a practical solution? Because will not having an art degree prevent me from getting success as an artist? If I train regularly and practice hard at art(comic making and games in specifics) during my non-work time could it lead to a success in an art career? I would like to know. Is this a reasonable approach to getting an art career while having another career to fall back on if things don‚Äôt work out?

1ezfurm,How to get over the bitterness and the frustration?,"Context: after a series of failed attempts, and at a relatively old age (30), I land a ""prestigious"" internship in a large international NYC-based NGO - one of those you hear of every day. I'm not from the US, so it felt like ""THE opportunity"" for me.

It was two of us and we both did a great job according to our boss. At the end of our contracts, the office published two positions that were clearly meant to hire us both (they cannot hire people directly due to legal procedures). My colleague applied to position A and was hired. I applied to position B, and wasn't. I was the second best after another applicant who clearly had more qualifications than me. My boss apologised personally and said they would help me as they could in the future, but they couldn't just publish other positions for me at the time (there are budget constraints).

Now my colleague's career is skyrocketing. I became stuck because the way these things work, once you're outside the system it's immensely harder to get back in. At the same time, I watched others getting ahead and ahead and landing the positions that I would have wanted, mostly because other than being good they also happened to be in the right place at the right time. All of that got to me and instead of accepting it and moving on, I just grew increasingly bitter and angry.

I am now unemployed and penniless, working random jobs just to keep myself afloat, and going nowhere. I know I'm not entitled to anything. I'm not here to say that life is unfair or whatever. It's just how it is. I guess it was the real first time I had to face the fact that things don't necessarily go the way we want, and there's other people who are going to be luckier than me, more successful than me, and there's nothing I can do about it. The adult way would be to try and find ways to cope, but I can't. I am stuck in a wallow of stupid self pity obsessing over how a very very very slight change in luck and timing would mean today I'd be happy and thriving in a career I like instead of being a complete failure. And it's not even because I didn't do a good job, because I did, I know I did. It's just that things didn't go well.

I‚Äòm currently wondering if I should take an offer I‚Äòve received. It‚Äòs for a Team Lead position in my field of work (Supply Chain). I‚Äôve worked in Fashion before, but haven‚Äòt been too happy with pay and working hours, so was looking for a switch in industry and this position would be just that, switching into a healthtech startup.

In my last position, I was working for a fashion tech startup that was building up a supply chain platform for brands to connect with manufacturers. I was the Operations Manager and tasked with overseeing said supply chain.

In this new position I would be the Team Lead for their supply chain team, consisting of under 10 people.

Would this be considered a step forward in a career focused on supply chain management? I had less leadership and people management in my role before, but it feels like I had more influence on strategic company decisions, but it was also a smaller company.

All the other factors like pay are definitely an improvement, and the last company I worked for is also not existing anymore, so I‚Äòm looking for a job anyways - Should I take the offer or look for another role with more strategic decisions to set me up for a good career in supply chain management?

1ezfehn,Putting in my 2 weeks notice,"I‚Äôve been working at a small law firm for 3 months as a legal receptionist. Although i am just the receptionist here, i have a lot of other duties i perform such as the role of a legal assistant, etc. It‚Äôs a lot that comes with this job, which is why i feel the way i feel and why i am writing this.

I recently graduated with a bachelors degree before i got this job however this job does not directly align with my goals. I got offered a job as an investigator in another state where basically all of my family is as well, and I accepted it. This position is directly my career goals, pays better, and ill be closer to family. I accepted the job offer and have been waiting on putting my 2 weeks in at the law firm until the background check got processed and such. 

Yesterday, the name partner attorney‚Äôs called me into a meeting to tell me basically I have been working here for 90 days, they wanted to do a check in and see how i like the job and they also gave me a $1 raise to reward me for being a good employee. Of course with my timing, TODAY, the new job i accepted the offer for is now asking me when can i start. So now i feel fucked. 

I just got the raise yesterday, probably should have just been transparent and told them yesterday i have plans on quitting. I dont like this job i do way more than what i get paid for so im trying not to feel weird about it but I am human and an empath and they are nice to me so i feel bad. I told my new job that i need 3 weeks so i can put in my 2 weeks and have 1 week to travel to the state. Should i put in my 2 weeks today after just yesterday they gave me a raise? Or should i wait it out the weekend and tell them next week on monday or tuesday?

I just feel so weird about this. Im not the type to leave a job after 3 months, I know i need to do what is best for me, but it is a very small law firm and took a lot to learn. I dont want to leave on a bad note. I also do want to mention, coincidentally, the whole law firm had lunch together yesterday and we have a new hire, and one of the attorney‚Äôs asked him how did his previous job take leaving in such short notice, and he said he had been there for 3 months and he left because it wasnt a right fit for him, and the attorney‚Äôs were telling him that he had to do what was best for him - so im hoping they will understand my situation considering it‚Äôs the same.

1ezf6iv,Clinical research position at Emory ,"I applied for an entry-level clinical research coordinator position at Emory. I had a phone interview last Wednesday, a Zoom interview with HR and the clinical team manager on Friday, and a final interview with the principal investigator this Tuesday.
Yesterday, I received an email from HR asking if I was available for a few follow-up questions in the afternoon. She emailed me around 12:15, and I responded at 12:30, indicating that I was available after 2 for a call. I sent thank you emails after each interview.
However, HR did not call me Wednesday for the follow-up questions. I sent another email Wednesday night letting her know I am available anytime tomorrow and that she can call me at her convenience. I have not yet received a response.
Should I be concerned about not getting the job? As an international medical graduate who has passed USMLE Step 1 and has some research experience, I am also a U.S. citizen, so I do not require a visa. I am eager to network with doctors and advance my process to match into residency. Should I send another follow-up email, or is it best to wait for a response? She still hasn‚Äôt emailed me back and it‚Äôs Friday. Did I even get the job? Please understand it‚Äôs so hard to get a job since moving to this country this is my first interview after applying so I‚Äôm just over analyzing.",Outrageous_Pain9808,1,1.0,0,1724425795,2024-08-23 15:09:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ezf6iv/clinical_research_position_at_emory/,8,2024
1ezep6i,What are my choices?,"I'm a senior animator (30F) and work from home. I was diagnosed with De Quervain's (will call this DQ) in my right hand (which is my dominant hand) about 3+ months ago and have been getting help for it (physiotherapy, braces, etc.) However it is not getting any better and recently just got much worse.

I'm in a lot of pain as I work and I don't think I can continue doing this for long. My partner is laid off but he's getting EI (employee insurance) for now which is like 70% of his pay.  I earn about $85K and its slightly more than his regular pay and we've been doing okay for now. We have mortgage and bills to pay and honestly this year has just been really stressful mentally and financially due to unfortunate life events. If we keep going on as we were we should be fine for 2 years (which is the end of my partner's lay off. He works at a car factory). We do have some savings but I don't want to run it to the ground. It's possible I'll have to take cortisone shots or get surgery for my DQ...but I'm worried about keeping this profession.

I've only ever worked in retail before, but that income won't even be close to paying our bills. What career can I move onto? Preferably one that doesn't destroy my right hand...I can't grip things or even open a water bottle or write with my right hand atm.

I don't think my work does any medical leave.....like I think I can ask for it, but it won't be paid and there's not even a guarantee my right hand will even get better. I feel really trapped. But I also feel that I'll stop working forcefully due to this injury at some point. I don't want it to be a permanent injury. I also don't want it to get worse. I don't know what to do. I need some help and perspective.",FauxPinkCat,1,1.0,0,1724424621,2024-08-23 14:50:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ezep6i/what_are_my_choices/,8,2024
1eze93y,"Biomedical Engineering, Biomedical Sciences, Molecular Biology or Pharmacy?
","Hi everyone! I'm 17 F, entering grade 12 this fall. I‚Äôm studying at an American-accredited school outside the US and taking AP courses. I really need some advice about what I should major in, especially since applications are opening soon, and I‚Äôm still pretty clueless.

**Countries I‚Äôm Considering:**  
I‚Äôm thinking of applying to universities in the US, Canada, and the UK, with Canada being my top priority. My family plans to immigrate to Canada if I decide to study there, so staying close to them would be ideal.

**Seeking Advice on Biomedical Fields:**  
Can someone explain what it's like to work in Biomedical Engineering, Biomedical Sciences, or Molecular Biology? I'm curious about the job prospects and salary differences among these fields. What kind of work do you typically do in these careers?

I'm particularly interested in genetics and DNA-related fields. I‚Äôm also considering pharmacy, but I know that in Canada, it takes 8 years to become a pharmacist, while the US offers a 6-year accelerated program, and the UK has a 4-5 year pathway.

I‚Äôm looking for a career that would make it easier for an international student to work after graduation and eventually gain permanent residency (PR).¬†

Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

1ezdp0n,Having trouble deciding which job to take,"I am currently transitioning out of the military. I put in a good amount of applications with a variety of companies was given a job offer from one of them for $31 an hour, this job is in the industry i want to make a career in and I'm already very familiar with it. On paper seems like a great company (9/80 schedule, 6.5% 401k and every other Friday off.) I will also be going to school and they offer 7k a year tuition assistance. yesterday i got a job offer from a company i interviewed with about 3 weeks ago, i assumed they ghosted me tbh. The offer is 80k a year, however the position is much more involved and requires travel around the New England area and parts of Canada. Im not super fond of being away from home often because i would need to find care for my daughter. (single dad) but the pay difference is so enticing I'm not sure which to pick. 

Job A

Pros:

* Closer to home (20 mins)
* 6.5% 401k
* 9/80 Schedule (every other friday off)
* Already familiar with the industry
* Industry I want to make a career in  

Cons:

* Lower position/title
* less pay 
* more ""grunt work""

  
Job B

Pros:

* Higher pay
* Higher position/title
* Be your own boss/individual work

Cons:

* More involved work (on-call, lots of travel)
* not familiar with or really enjoy the industry 
* 3% 401k and no tuition assistance 
* 9-5 M-F 

  
I feel in my heart Job A is the correct choice but the pay from Job B keeps pulling me back. I have about a week to make a choice so I wanted some 3rd party opinions, thank you all in advance.

1ezdhp0,Would getting a new job be a better option?,"

Basically I‚Äôm 19F with no car so my only form of transportation is basically uber. I live with my parents during the summer and my dad takes me to work in the morning, but I pay around $21-23 to go back home. I‚Äôm getting paid $15/hr and work around 70 hours per pay period at this office job (every 15th and 30th). 

Though now, I‚Äôm starting back college again and they extended my internship, but due to classes I‚Äôll only be working around 26 hours each week. The uber costs for both to and from work would be $12-16 despite the fact that I am considerably closer (ubers until my next paycheck would be around $330 and my actual paycheck would be around $500-750)

My parents think I should just deal with it until I get my car in December, but trying to have money for college, ubers, and saving is starting to pile up, is staying worth it?",Tall_Dog1668,1,1.0,0,1724421592,2024-08-23 13:59:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ezdhp0/would_getting_a_new_job_be_a_better_option/,8,2024

I'm an Italian - British student that has been living all of his life in Italy, but has always dreamt of living and working in London.

So, I'm currently finishing my BSc in Mechanic Engineering in Italy, and I'm starting a MSc in Computer Engineering soon.
The only problem is that I'm a bit late with my studies (in fact I'm 25) and so I'm going to finish my MSc at the age of 27/28.

Will this, and the fact that English is not my native language (even though I should be around C1 level) be an issue for my career in UK?

1ezbld2,"Statistics master student, I don't know what field to pursue","**TDLR: Should i pursue a more business/marketing field since there it seems more job opportunites or could I pursue more statistical heavy feilds evn though it might be nieche. Italian, but able to move to other european countries.** 

Hi everyone! So, I am quite stuck in what to field specialize with my master degree, I have a couple of options and already know where not to specialize.

Granted that I already have a bachelor degree in statistics and already studied some statistics regarding economics (finance especially, even though i only saw a part of the statistical modelling of it and portfolio management theory, I do not enjoy it a lot) I would like to shift from this field. 

My goal would be to be able to combine the following interest: 

- Machine learning techniques in business and marketing: mostly because I know there are many applications of statistical modelling for many purposes and there seems to be more jobs opportunities in this field than others, so even if business and marketing are not my main interests, i see many opportunities to apply tools that i enjoy; 

- High dimensional data ""management"": mostly because it is related to machine learning and it specializes, as per definition, in data set analysis and modelling where the number of variables are far greater than the observations. I asked chatgpt in which field this kind of data sets are predominant and mostly genomics, finance and image recognition (this last field I might be interested, but I do not know where to start to see how statistics is involved), so it poses the question again which field to pursue; 

- Computer vision/image recognition medical field: nothing to say here onestly, but it is strictly related, again, to high dimensional data, this seems way more interesing that other, however I dont see jobs opportunities with this (I would love to be proven wrong), my university does not really provide computer vision classes, I will attend a class that speks of statical modelling when it comes to high dimensional data and image recogntion is a topic (but not in depth);

- Healthcare statistics: so basically machine learning/statistics applied to human data, which I believe is related to high dimensional data to some extent and of course statistical modelling for forecasting; 

- Data simulation: Again, I see it only as a tool for many purposes, but I do not know hnestly if this skill set is applicable to the fields mentioned previously or if there any job opportunities. 

So I guess it is coming down to: 1) I take classes in business and marketing since, at least in my country (Italy),since there seems to be more job opportunities; 2) I take classes that seems more reaserch oriented. 

Is there anyway that I can have a great grasp in these both macro fields so I have more skills when it comes to joob seeking? Thanks in advance!

1ezbckb,Here's the career advice I wish I had earlier,"I want to share my story in hopes that it could be helpful to someone seeing this‚Ä¶¬†

Today, I'm an HR leadership coach and VP, but I started my career as an unpaid intern. The most demanding challenge in my career was my time as an HR department of one.¬†

No matter how many levels I reach, I can never forget how it felt to feel unprepared and downright insecure in my skills and abilities, but I'm so grateful for the journey. Looking back on the experience, I've learned several valuable lessons that I want to share.¬†

First, spending too much time worrying about what I didn't know was a waste of time. I got further when I actually took action to identify and fill the gaps.¬†

Second, even when working alone in HR, I learned the power of community -- both inside and outside the organization. This helped me build a network of allies with whom I could collaborate to benefit us both.¬†

And finally, I learned that there's never a time when I will know everything (which is hard to conceptualize when you feel like you don't know enough already). Understanding that it's important to celebrate the journey and not the final destination helped me gain a new perspective and get me where I am today.¬†

If you‚Äôre going through something similar, please reach out to me. You‚Äôre not alone, and I‚Äôd love to help! I truly hope that sharing my story is helpful to you.¬†

1ezaj4s,No jobs getting back to me or my partner,"So, this is mainly about my partner. He finished his degree in 2022 in graphic design and he had been applying for 50-100 jobs per week ever since. He always writes great cover letters, his CV has been reviewed and approved by 3 professionals and he is stuck in the same part time job that he started during his college days, as a temporary thing. He has been there for 7 years now and it is definitely a toxic environment (won't go into that) but I've had to watch him get depression and he is no longer the bubbly person he once was.

  
I have my own business but I'm hardly earning anything from it, I also have a degree. I have BPD, anxiety, OCD and depression myself and this job stuff is just really getting us down. We are having to live on 700 pounds (UK) a month between us because he can't get out of the job he's in now as no jobs he apply for get back to him or he gets an interview and they ghost him and the job he's in now haven't got anymore hours for him. He's stuck on a 16 hour contract. It's been going on for 2 years and its all we can think about and we just feel like things will never change for us. I worked my a\*\* off in school, kept my head down, got top grades, went to uni and did the same and hardly anyone is getting back to me either so I know its not him personally, doesn't make it any less frustrating for him though.

  
It doesn't help that he keeps getting his new hopes crushed. He met an estate agent who guided him through a new CV especially for estate agents and said they could get him some work experience to get him into estate agency. It never worked. Companies wouldn't even agree to give him unpaid work experience, its pathetic. We just want a chance and we are running out of patience. We cannot help but feel the whole world is against us or we are cursed as people around us seem to walk in and out of jobs easily, within weeks. We are 25 and don't even have our own home yet because we'd be homeless within a month on our wages, we are having to live with his parents/my in laws which is why a new job is literally a must but we keep finding ourselves at dead ends. If anyone has any advice or knows of anyone that could help us, please do so. I don't normally come to these websites and beg for advice but I actually am. I've been suicidal in the past because my mental health got that bad and I don't want to go back to that dark place again but I can feel myself slipping because it makes my mental health worse seeing him so down all the time.

I was getting verbally assaulted at work by someone that I was friends with and frequently joked around with a lot. I got a promotion and she started insulting me quite a bit questioning my intelligence and basically saying I shouldn‚Äôt have been hired for the job. I assumed she was being deadpan with her humor and joking as she usually would, but apparently she wasn‚Äôt, but I didn‚Äôt know at the time. I made the terrible decision to playfully retaliate and poke her on the shoulder, then at one point I did a sexually provocative dance. I was clearly joking. 


We had been laughing and talking a bit afterwards.

I was then informed by management that she told them I was asking her several sexual questions (she wrote a letter for them and she made over exaggerated quotes up that sounded movie like) and cited the video as evidence. Sadly there‚Äôs no audio to the videos at my job. 

Since she‚Äôs a girl and claiming potential sexual assault management took her side. I also found out she claims this pretty often about people. But all witnesses attested that I didn‚Äôt say the things she said I did, and that she was bullying me. Basically everything ended with it being put on my file with a link to the videos.

1ez9nct,Should I accept a high salary job offer in a field I moved away from or continue in this newer role in a different field where progression isn‚Äôt clear?,"I‚Äôm sure that this is a question that has been asked several times over the years but I had to lay it out so that I could have a few opinions on this. 

I am 25 female living in London. 

Option  A - ¬£53,000 including car allowance plus bonus and they are also considering including medical insurance for me. Three days in the office, there is a push to move to a senior level in a few months as that was the role I originally wanted and that would mean an immediate jump to ¬£60,000 in half a year. 


Option B  - currently on ¬£37,800. No car allowance no bonus I was pretty happy about finding this role as it was a pretty good pay for a starting role. The intention is to move into being a project manager but there is no clear part outlined by this company for some reason they said this is something they can talk about after a year, but I am motivated by having a clear path in front of me which is something I have conveyed. However there are lovely benefits like I get to work from home every day and going to the office once in a week or once in two weeks. We get to travel to different locations for work 3 to 4 times a year.

The problem with option a is this is something I worked within since I was 19 and only this year moved to a role in project management to try something different. I had no issues staying in the role but they didn‚Äôt want to promote me unless I undertook some qualifications that I didn‚Äôt want to do but in this role there is no push to do those qualifications and also there is an immediate jump to that level in option A without needing the qualification .

The problem with the option I am currently in is no clear steps on progress and also I do not have the same level of value that I did in the previous role that I was in. This role is unfortunately a bit too admin and I feel like a PA. I made peace with the fact that this is what I needed to do to move on to project management, but it‚Äôs made me nervous that there is no outline. 

Whatever I do in the corporate world will never really engage me or stimulate me because my true passions are writing for humanitarian causes, painting and volunteering which I‚Äôm trying to do on the side but it hasn‚Äôt picked up yet so I‚Äôm having to try to bring in that stream of income so I can pursue my passions.

1. Digital Marketing - no experience with PPC, paid ads, social media, or B2B
2. SEO - no experience with PPC, SEM, off page 
3. Product Manager - I feel out of my depth here because I only did this unofficially, so no experience with PRDs etc
4. UX Research/Data Analytics - again, since this wasn‚Äôt my focus at my last role and just part of it, feel out of depth. 

Copywriting is always an option but it‚Äôs never in the salary range I want, and most of the roles are for training AI. 

So just wondering if anyone had any advice about my situation. Cuz I‚Äôm really feeling lost. ",Iocomotion,1,1.0,0,1724396241,2024-08-23 06:57:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ez68jk/unsure_what_career_path_to_pursue_after_layoff/,8,2024
1ez5nx8,Should I accept counter offer from company I just recently joined?,"TL;DR: I am a software developer in Texas who recently joined (it‚Äôs only been 3 weeks) a startup-like business paying me $79,000/year with little benefits. I got an offer from a larger company that builds HR software for $95,000 with benefits. As I was informing my current employer about my departure, they offered me $100,000. What should I do?

For starters, let‚Äôs create some clarifying language and give some background to clear any confusion. 

Some Background:
I recently accepted a job offer (software developer) from a staffing company. We‚Äôll call this staffing company ‚ÄúCompany A‚Äù. Company A contracts me out hourly to another company that does sports hospitality, ‚ÄúCompany B‚Äù. My current employer is technically Company A (W2), but I work for Company B. The goal is to get hired directly by Company B after 6-12 months (C2H). I recently received a new job offer from another company that builds HR software, ‚ÄúCompany C‚Äù. 

Starting off, companies A/B offered me $79,000/year with little benefits, but promised me that I have a 99% chance of getting hired to company B within 6-12 months where I will have great benefits. Currently, I have poor healthcare that only covers me (as opposed to me and my spouse), no PTO, no holidays, and I am billing company B hourly, which does give me a bit of flexibility when it comes to work schedule. Putting compensation/benefits aside, Company B works with cloud computing (specifically Azure) which I have a bit of experience in and have always wanted to keep learning about. I see this opportunity as a great one to jump into the exciting world of cloud computing, learn many new skills, and grow. However, after working here for a few weeks, I‚Äôve realized just how small our team is and how a lot of the learning would have to be self-taught. I get a lot of ‚Äústartup‚Äù vibes from this company. We move fast, everyone pulls their weight, does their work, and moves on. I feel more pressure on me to learn and complete tasks. Everyone has been nice so far, but all my colleagues always seem so busy; almost too busy to give me any true mentorship. I have to set touch points and knowledge transfers myself, which I don‚Äôt mind too much, but I definitely would have preferred more formal training. 

Within the last week I received a new offer from Company C. It‚Äôs a direct, full time position for $95,000/year with healthcare for both me and my spouse, 9 holidays, 19 days PTO, a free Pluralsight subscription, and $1,500 in tuition reimbursement per semester. Compensation and benefits aside, the company has more of a ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù feel with more procedures set in place and is more of a Full-Stack role which is what I have more expertise and knowledge in. It feels more secure, however, the technology used by Company C is not the latest like Company B. Company C has 100s of developers and 8 managers. I feel there is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù classical mentorship and resources at Company C, but I am worried about my long term career goal of learning cloud computing fading if I choose Company C. Company C uses .NET 4 and is upgrading to .NET 6/8, which is what I actually was doing at another company before accepting the offer from companies A/B. 

Obviously, I was ready to accept Company C‚Äôs offer but I reached out to Companies A/B and they surprisingly were willing to counter for $100,000/year with little to no benefits for now, but benefits after getting directly hired. This comes as a complete shock to me and now I am torn between these two offers and what to do next. I have asked multiple people for feedback and have gotten much mixed responses. Some say to try to get Company C to counter back, and then make my final decision. Others say to just accept Companies A/B counter and hope to be directly hired soon. What do you think? I understand that the scenario of a counter is not extremely rare, but I feel this specific circumstance is. Any help would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who has been in a similar position.

1ez4645,Should I quit/voluntary resign?,"So I'm an international student who graduated in Korea. After a long job search period, I got hired in Korea at a Biotech company working in overseas sales. It's been about 6 months now and I haven't really done much or learnt much yet. This is because while others in my team work for countries where they have set up business already, I'm working for a country that the company is planning to enter (seems like the company isn't sure for themselves yet if they want to enter or not due to the high initial investment). So, for the 6 months, other than a short 2-3 week period of discovery meetings, I've been very free. And by very free, I mean I've done maybe 2-3 hours of work in the whole week. 

The issue right now is, the company is at the verge of bankruptcy. So they recently had an announcement that they will be laying off some people and will be accepting voluntary resignations. I'm not sure if I'm part of the lay off (atp I hope I am) but if I am not, then I was planning to just go for the voluntary resignation. But the thing is, some of my coworkers were saying that there is a chance that the company might ask me to stay and work for a different country where business has already been set up (since they need english speakers to do business overseas). But tbh, the way work and company life has been for the past 6 months and the way the company is removing all benefits for the future (they even said they might free salaries or ask some back if things go bad), I don't really want to stay much. But if they offer me the option to work for a different country and I still say that I want to go for the voluntary resignation, I might not get the 2 months salaries that they are giving to the people getting laid off/voluntary resigned. 

I'm just a ball of confusion at this point. Idk what to do. 
If I do quit/get laid off, I won't be staying in Korea. I want to go back to my country. Plus, either way, I'd be going to the US in Sep 2025 for masters. So do I go back and find a different job or do I just accept the change of position in this company and continue working if given the chance? 

ANY advice would be appreciated please ü•≤",Sherbert-Chance,1,1.0,0,1724388245,2024-08-23 04:44:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ez4645/should_i_quitvoluntary_resign/,8,2024
1ez45ei,What do i do next?,"okay - SO i recently applied for a job that i am directly qualified for. I got a request for interview the next day and did the interview a few days later. 

An ex-co worker of mine works at the place i interviewed at and he put in a good word for me. The interview went AMAZING, felt like a 100% done deal, talked salary and next steps (coming in for another interview) However, the guy interviewing me said i would be a good fit for a couple of different roles including the one i applied for. 

I said i was open to any position they might have for me since i REALLY want to work at this place. The next business day i followed up with a ""thank you, i remain enthusiastic"" email. But since then its been radio silence. I expected not to hear back from the thank you email..but its been a week now with no follow up whatsoever.

regardless of if i got the job or not, I would be shocked if they didn't at least send me a ""thanks but no thanks"" email...especially since my friend vouched for me, the interview went well and i sent a follow-up email. 

Its a pretty big company so i wouldn't be surprised if it took a while to hear back etc.

oh - and of course i completely forgot to ask when i should expect to hear from them at my interview..so i have no frame of reference as to when to expect any sort of reply.

So here is my next question - I've seen that they have posted one of the jobs that they mentioned i would be a good fit for....should i apply for it to show my enthusiastic interest? or just cool it and be patient?

1ez3yg9,How do I decide what kind of work I want to do?,"To start, I am a mathematics and computer science double degree with a 4.0 GPA. I'm set to graduate in about a year. There was a time when I liked coding, and was pretty good at it. My data structures and algorithms class wasn't terrible. I've built websites and such too (hated it after a while because websites are LAME). Now, I don't like coding anymore because learning new languages is just involves obscurely similar function names that have many input parameters in different orders. I'll spend a good chunk of time learning something I think I'm interested in, then I find myself just memorizing these dumb functions that I may or may not use. There are so many damn languages out there, and it's so frustrating to find that the languages I learn are either obsolete or not enjoyable. I've considered SO many career paths. I tried data analysis. That requires Power BI/Tableau. I tried learning Power BI for like a month or two on the Microsoft certification learning modules, and kind of liked it, but it's so unnecessarily complicated at times with DAX formulas, power query, the software's weird layout, etc.. I found it pedantic. Then I was getting super BORED forcing myself through it. Staring at tables of data is mind numbing, especially if it's data that I don't give a shit about. I thought about academia. I could teach math... if I gott a PhD that takes another 4 years of excruciating work, only to get paid low and teach the same things for the rest of my life, as well as deal with shitty students. What's more, I could hate research and find myself trapped. I got heavily into writing. I decided to write everyday for years. I have journals stacked with my writings in it. Turns out that after all these years, I like writing, but hate making myself sit down to do it. I also seem to hate making myself read (despite having read a fair amount in my life), which is just as important as the writing. Plus, jobs with writing suck. What am I gonna do, write for a newspaper? Video game journalism? No thanks, I don't want to make playing videogames a chore. OK. I currently have a role at an engineering and surveying firm. They told me I could become a professionally-licensed land surveyor. It involves math. I enjoy doing it from time-to-time. But working with geographical maps and physically collecting data is not my thing.  The reason I even chose computer science was to become an SWE. Due to the terrible job market (and I mean TERRIBLE. Qualified individuals can't get jobs and it's saturated with hundreds of thousands of new CS graduates) , incredibly difficult job interviews, the need for hobbyist projects on resumes, and my grown distaste for coding, I can't stomach being one. I remember when there was this networking event with all my CS professors speaking with others, and holy hell. Corporate America is a steaming pile of dogshit with all the fake smiles, awkward conversations, and inauthenticity. I wanted to get the hell away from that. Okay, so maybe my own business? I can learn anything I want, so why not something cool like a lawyer? I could eventually have my own law firm where I can create as much of a work/life balance as I want. I would make all the money and don't have to give it to managers above me. I could maybe help others and find fulfillment. So here I am, studying to be a notary in the state of Louisiana just to dip my toes in the water. There are times where it's interesting, but overall, I hate having to read and make myself learn it. And after all, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MATH. I'm starting to get desperate at this point. Going to college, my #1 priority was to get myself a career that I enjoy. That's all I care about at the end of the day. I hated all the jobs I've had in the food industry. Hated seeing all those people in their 50s forced to continue their back-breaking physical labor. Today, I was playing OldSchool Runescape, and found myself doing calculations with the markets, money making methods, planning out goals, etc.. Do I really want to be a lawyer? I'm having so much fun with computations! But I hate coding! Even Actuarial work involves staring at excel sheets and dealing with R. I am having the hardest time figuring out what kind of work/problem solving skills I want to do for the rest of my life, and every time I switch my learning to something else, I am wasting precious time. WHAT DO I DO? Here is my job checklist. It needs to be: something I enjoy, care about, absent of physical labor, pays well, doesn't COMPROMISE my authenticity/sense of self, and has a good work/life balance. In summary, I know that I can learn anything I set my mind to, but I'm paralyzed after years of exploring my options. That's gonna conclude my rant. If you made it this far through this unorganized post, thank you so much, and leave me some advice.

1ez25qk,"Feeling lost at my job, what‚Äôs my next move?","I work for a large company which will remain unnamed. I‚Äôve worked there for a few years now and I‚Äôm currently at the highest level individual contributor position in my department that I could be in. It pays decently (mid-upper 5 figures) but after the years of work I‚Äôve put in to get here, the pay feels like I‚Äôm starting back at square one with the way the economy has turned. I‚Äôve also recently had a son so my goal is to get promoted to a supervisor position ASAP as the raise would put me well into 6 figures and change my life as well as my family‚Äôs life. 

I‚Äôve only been in the senior individual contributor position for 10 months and the company requires a year in that role to qualify to apply for supervisor. Prior to me starting in this role there were 8 supervisors all of whom had occupied there position for a decade plus each and somehow over the course of the last 10 months each of them have chosen to retire, promote to an even higher role, find employment elsewhere, or make a lateral move to a separate department. This means that there are now 8 new supervisors 3 of whom were hired today and the one with the most tenure being 6 months in tenure as supervisor.

I‚Äôm very frustrated that circumstances happened the way they did. I‚Äôve been spending the last 10 months grueling away. My metrics are better than any of the other senior contributors, even the ones promoted to supervisor. I‚Äôve started multiple projects that have made organizational impacts on metrics for my peers, none of the recently hired supervisors have done the same. Ive completed supervisor training and am one of the few people that act as a supervisor substitute when one takes PTO. And I even have years of management experience from a prior company which my leadership is aware of. Essentially I‚Äôve carefully made myself extremely competitive so that way when the 12 month mark hit I would have the strongest case for promotion.

Now I‚Äôm not quite sure what to do. Leadership has been quite candid that it will likely be years before someone leaves since tenure is now new across the board and I feel like I‚Äôve been working so hard for something that may never come to be. My only real option that I think I have is starting from square one in a new department but I also don‚Äôt want to squander all the work I‚Äôve put into my own department in the off chance someone decides to leave.

But I felt like if I want to get a job in an advertising agency probably digital marketing would be the right way to go but I'm not sure anymore I'm confused.

I don't know where to start from. Recently I gave an interview for an internship for digital marketing but it was for 6months and even the stipend was low (6k pm). By the end of this year my goal was to be financially dependent and if I take this internship I won't be.

While I'm not in dire need of financial help but I do need the money. The Business development (sales) job I mentioned certainly pays more than the digital marketing thing but I'm just scared because I do not want to get stuck in a job I don't want. I also want to pursue higher education but that would need job experience atleast for 2-3 years. Was also hoping I could save some money by then for my education as well.

Can anyone assist me here ? ",leviohleviii,1,1.0,1,1724380613,2024-08-23 02:36:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ez1swl/i_dont_know_where_to_start_my_career_from/,8,2024

1eyzrcc,27F Is it advisable to pad my resume after being out of work due to getting chronic health issues under control and caretaking family?,"Hello!

Background is basically I got sick 5 years ago and my body didn't really recover so I've got some autoimmune stuff that is a bit better managed but still has some limitations and concerns with doctor visits and medications in my 20s vs as older age.

With that in mind, I've got about a semester left of my BA I hope to finish next year, although I need to get back into the workforce now.

My work history is spotty between school, with retail, child supervision at a charter school, and insurance but most were shorter term jobs/temp positions. My dad passed last year when I was caretaking him for several months after he had complications from covid and his unexpected passing took a toll of me mentally, health wise and delayed my degree again.

Overall I'm more stable, I did move states to see better doctors and have been able to do more like when i was working and doing school part-time, minus the fun stuff like going out to eat and trialing every day stuff for what's not an issue for my allergies /immune system. It's been harder to build a social circle with what I can do for fun, so networking hasn't been my strong suit.

Because of my health,  I'm only looking at part time office or admin work, something where I can be helpful in the background really.

I don't plan on disclosing my health concerns as with being chronically ill its just a spectrum issue that I just have to work within my limits. 

With that explained, I'm wondering how/if to pad my resume timeline just to get my foot in the door. Besides basic training on specifics, working in an office setting isn't new to me and quick to pick up on, I just dont have the smoothest resume to have a chance to prove that.

Is it wrong to pad my resume these days knowing what I'm able to keep up with and having to still support myself?

 They're entry level positions, so I'm hoping there aren't calls but there's really not much else I can do at this stage to prove myself.",Sad_Calligrapher9395,1,1.0,0,1724374605,2024-08-23 00:56:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eyzrcc/27f_is_it_advisable_to_pad_my_resume_after_being/,8,2024
1eyzr20,Having a crisis of conscience while considering applying for a new job,"Posting anonymously as I have coworkers who use reddit.

I (32M) live in Canada, have been working at my current employer for several years. I enjoy my job, its not too stressful, my coworkers are pleasant to be around, my boss is flexible with time off etc. I currently make about 57k a year 4100/month take home. Plus a company vehicle. Its a really good gig, but its also somewhat of a dead-end as there are no opportunities for advancement, though they do offer a cost of living adjustment raise every few years. I work 7am to 6pm 4 days a week for a total of 44 hours per week. 

I've come across a job opening for a position with my city which pays about 73K/year for 35 hours a week. (est. 5150/month take home) It does not have a company car, which would require me to purchase a vehicle. I have figured the cost to be approximately $800 per month for 4 years then $400 per month afterward for gas and insurance. So, overall, I will be about $350 per month ahead, all while working 9 less hours per week with a similar commute, and working towards owning my own vehicle.  
  
I feel conflicted because I have grown so comfortable where I am now, and I'm not certain this new position will offer me the same flexibility and low-stress environment as my current position, and I'm not sure the additional income would be worth enough to risk losing those qualities in a job. But there is also the prospect of opportunities for growth within the new position to consider. I'm not sure what sort of advice I'm looking for exactly, but I've come here to try to talk things out and see what people think.

I did an undergrad in Political Science and Business and a specialization in International Relations, I graduated 2 years ago.

1eyyxl6,How can I reach a C-level position by 30?,"I'm a 20-year-old male, recently hired at a tech company where I build high-tech servers and cyber kits. Our company works as a defense contractor and also serves big corporations like Boeing.  I don't want to come off as too much of a try-hard, but I‚Äôm driven to outperform and rise quickly in this industry.

Before diving in, I want to clarify that I understand the basics: showing up early, working hard, being reliable, etc etc. I quickly became a general manager at a fast food company in less than three months by working overtime, sometimes even for free, just to get things done. I genuinely enjoy working, and it's my only hobby outside of school and the gym. So, I'm not looking for basic advice‚ÄîI'm after strategies that will give me an edge.

For example, I‚Äôm always looking for ways to add value, even in areas that aren‚Äôt strictly my responsibility. Some of the higher-ups occasionally grab things from the warehouse and use a forklift, so I figured, why not get my forklift certification just in case it ever comes in handy? It wasn‚Äôt something I needed to do, but now I have that skill in my back pocket. Similarly, our company places a strong emphasis on ISO 9001 quality standards. The quality manager was searching for a good Udemy course for onboarding, so I took the initiative to complete a few ISO courses and suggested the best ones to her. I also noticed that some of my colleagues are skilled at soldering, even though it‚Äôs not part of my role. I thought, why not learn it myself? I reached out to the right people, got all the necessary equipment, and now I‚Äôve mastered it. I am trying to find those little opportunities to contribute more, even if it‚Äôs not directly expected of me. I‚Äôm not mentioning these examples for recognition of what I‚Äôve already done but more so to illustrate the kinds of things I‚Äôm looking to do‚Äîways to add value that go beyond the basics.

I‚Äôve already reached out to our CEO and others on LinkedIn for advice, but I‚Äôm looking for more out-of-the-box tips to skyrocket my success. How can I become astronomically successful in this company and beyond, without stepping on toes or seeming like I‚Äôm trying too hard? What certifications or skills should I pursue next that might not be directly related to cybersecurity but are still valued in this industry? I‚Äôm also three years into my cybersecurity master's degree and have the trifecta (A+, Network+, Security+), soon adding CYSA+ to my list.

My goal is to reach a C-level position by 30, and I‚Äôm willing to go the extra mile‚Äîjust need guidance on how to do it smartly. I‚Äôve already maxed out my 401k and don't need financial tips, but I do need advanced strategies that can push me further up the ladder.

Any advice on how to become extremely successful, while keeping it low-key and professional, would be greatly appreciated.

1eyysks,"Laid off two weeks ago, and just received a job offer today for a position not completely related to my career. Should I take it?","I currently work in the events/hospitality industry. My last job was working as an event coordinator at a non-profit and I was laid off two weeks ago due to no fault of my own, but rather due to the financial situation my former organization was in. I had three interviews this week already (one company already rejected me) and a company got back to me today with an offer, though it's not completely related to my field. It is more of a sales job in the hospitality industry working for an A/V contractor within a hotel. 

The base salary is $2k less than my last job (I may try to negotiate to get it higher), but I would have an opportunity to earn $10k-$15k in commission each year. I'm reading mixed reviews about the company on Glassdoor, and the job does seem like a may be a bit thankless. I told the hiring manager I would give him a decision by Monday.  

I am tempted to take the offer since the job market is terrible right now. I have seen many stories of people who have been out of work for months/even up over a year. I also got along well with both of the hiring managers and they seemed like good people to work with. The commute would also be really easy for me. My Dad had mixed thoughts about me taking the job since it doesn't completely fall within my career goals, and I should hold out for a better quality offer. However, it seems like in this economy I should really take what I can get. Who knows, I might even be good at this job.

Through my experience working in retail and medical facilities, I have come to find I work at a slower pace and do not do well in busy, chaotic environments. That being said, I do however like busy work (using my hands, always having something to work on or do).

I did a certificate program to be a Certified Medical Assistant and found that it did not suit me. Previously to this, I worked in a grocery store bakery for 3 years and I did seem to enjoy that. I liked that I worked alone, doing my own thing for the most part. I did not stay because I did not see much opportunity for career growth with that company. 

I am also an introvert and find I work better when I am alone. I think when I was an MA, I felt very anxious all the time because I worked closely with medical professions and I guess I felt intimidated by that.

  
I do not do well with school. I struggled with not only the subjects, but being motivated. I am not completely opposed to the idea of going back to school if I knew what direction I wanted to take. Essentially, a purpose for going.

I am a self taught Front End Dev that thought they had broken into Tech through a consulting firm. I am aligned to the Tech area, but I've been told by HR earlier this year that I will be pigeonholed into project management.  I joined really to gain the tech skills and got them within my first year here. 

Fast forward to now, its been about 2 years with no real tech/programming work. I have honestly been pretty depressed about it and have not kept up on my skillset. I am under under someone that is director level. and that has its challenges in and of itself. There is no manager between us.  Recently I had a family member pass away, when I had spoken with the director he was just like ""I'll be on vacation, there is no one else to cover, can you enough to cover running these meetings?"" I felt a bit pressured and said yes.. I ended up working these half days.  After working this job, and knowing that in the future, I will have to work through a bereavement or Personal time. I have just felt beyond anxious and out of sorts. I still am pretty upset about this as well. 

I ended up making my plan to exit the company. I Signed up for a bootcamp as I need to polish my portfolio and refresh my skillset.  I am working on building out my resume, building new projects, leetcode, and trying to network and apply to 2-5 jobs daily. I'm just kinda worried at this point that going through this bootcamp to fill in my knowledge gaps. This is all in the hopes of trying to keep pushing forward, Ive gotten maybe an interview a week for a few weeks.  Trying to break into tech again at this point is going to be a bit pointless. The competition is truly fierce and I don't think I can elevate myself to the level of the competition that is currently out there.  I think I have trouble keeping my eyes on the prize and dont know what my best option is. I know that doing a bootcamp doesn't get you the job, I have a bit of work experience to back my current experience up and leverage my resume. 

I know that I have to keep my job to pad the emergency fund, but I feel like Ive succumbed to the sunken cost fallacy of spending so much time teaching myself these skills that I wonder if any of this ever really was worth it.

1eyu32l,Help with resignation after two months on the job,"I am set to start a new job on September 9. I joined my current company on July 1, and I plan to submit my resignation tomorrow, giving two weeks‚Äô notice.

One of my colleagues quit 10 days ago, and I‚Äôm unsure how to approach my boss. He has been very supportive, literally guiding me through these past two months. However, my reasons for leaving are compelling:

	1.	Visa - The most important reason is that the company will not be supporting my visa beyond December 2024. My colleague had to resign for the same reason, and I accepted the new job after learning about her situation.

	2.	Career - I realized that this job is not aligned with my desired career path, and I don‚Äôt see myself doing this in the long run.

	3.	Commute- The train commute takes up 4 hours of my day (2 days a week), and I anticipate it will be even more challenging during the winter.

1eytt52,Am I asking for too much?,"I am currently 20yo and have been working as a warehouse associate for about 3 years as their top performer. Recently the company was bought out and the warehouse I worked at is being relocated to another state with no chance of employees following. This is fine as we are receiving lots of money as a ""retention bonus"" to finish out and empty the warehouse, although before the meeting we had discussing all of this I was going to ask my manager for a promotion into a leadership position to start gaining experience. Since that was no longer an option I finished out my last few months as an associate and am currently unemployed but looking to get into entry level management for warehousing which has proved very difficult without a degree or 5 years management/supervision experience.

1eytn6o,Thinking about college but I don't know what to go for,"I'm writing this out partly to help sort my thoughts and partly to seek advice. For years now i've wanted to go to school for something and do more but I never know what to go for. I had an awful experience when I went after highschool. I tried to take 3 classes while juggling a part time job because my mom needed help paying rent (and I wanted some money to spend too). Ever since I was a kid I wanted to be a game designer but as I got older I got into computers more and have heard horror stories about the industry and can't imagine not having creative freedom. (working for an indie company would be nice but unlikely.) So I decided to go more into Computer Science because I liked coding and seemed to pick it up pretty easy even though I had little to no highschool math education (due to my teacher speaking very broken English and moving on way to fast. I could only ask him to repeat once or twice and still not understand sometimes so I gave up trying by my second year). So when I got to college I decided to go for Computer Science and I took CS101, English 102(I scored good back then), and Math. I aced CS101 and even helped the teacher teach the other kids Python. English was okay, it wasn't fun but not too difficult. Math though, they had us use some online software to learn it and it started me out at 1st grade level. It was humiliating and agonizing to go through stuff I knew already. They also required us to attend class even though it was online so the professor could help us but it felt humiliating asking for help with trivial stuff. I started falling behind on math due to the sheer amount they wanted to cover. The end of the semester came and I was a section or two behind where I was supposed to be so they said I could make it up next semester or in homework. They wouldn't let me take CS102 without finishing all 3 semesters of that math course to be up to Algebra or something so I took the second math class over summer and everyday I kept leaving depressed and left earlier and earlier just to stare at the sun setting off campus. Not to mention during all the college time social anxiety was bearing down on me like a huge weight. I just stopped going one day and haven't gone since. I always feel awful and regret it when I talk to people going through college or friends with a degree.

I spent my years going through a few jobs, first was print & marketing at staples where everything was easy and they relied on me to fix machines or software issues sometimes. Then I got a job at a company fulfilling orders and keeping track of inventory using excel. It was easy, I soon got experience placing orders and then they even paid me to learn Microsoft Access to develop a tool to manage their tickets and afaik they still use it to this day. I had to learn SQL, Access VBA, and Microsoft Access but I got it done and I had fun learning it and studying database methods to be honest and then going to code functions and seeing them work. I put in Easter eggs for coworkers I liked too which was a lot of fun. That passed and things got rough at the job. It was clear they were looking for someone to fire when they started putting rules to blame people in place. I opposed the rules and ended up parting ways with the company. Ever since I've been doing remote work for a hospital and I now have knowledge of EPIC. I spend my productive free time (as opposed to unproductive video games), using Blender, Unity, and Photoshop to customize my avatar in VRChat. Its a lot of fun learning about that stuff and modifying mesh and making textures. Just being creative with it. I also recently picked up Davinci Resolve and have been messing with small video edits and want to try bigger things. Its fun making effects for that too. I miss coding sometimes to be honest but have no ideas for projects and when I'm not getting paid for it, its hard to have that sense of duty/focus (working on ADHD treatments after getting the depression one sorted out). I feel like I'm at a dead end with the hospital job and I want to do more, something else. I don't think I can juggle a full time job with college especially going off my past but I really want to get an education and do more. I don't even know what I want to go for. I've taken several Career tests and nothing feels right. One was for a front and back end designer which seemed okay and interesting for a while but the math hurdles of CS is just....daunting to say the least. I really like the content they cover in Computer Science too. Programming clicks with my brain but Math doesn't for some reason. 

I just took the O\*Net test today and the only interesting job it recommended was Audio & Video technician which isn't very interesting. It did offer game design too. I don't know what to do and I feel very lost. Thinking about it too long makes me want to break down, cry, and just give up. I'm at a real loss. For a bit I was even trying to learn math on my own at Khanacademy at my own pace instead of paying for a course but its so hard to keep myself doing it in my free time.

  
I honestly don't expect any real answers because I realize I seem kind of like a mess but I needed to also put this out somewhere.

1eytm8l,Would you choose your dream job or dream house?,"I'm very lucky to have this problem, but basically I have to choose between my dream job and dream location. 

I have the option to transition from part-time to full-time & in-person at a place that I've wanted to work since I was little, and many people would go to extremes to be here. Also (for anyone else with a math background) it's common knowledge that very few jobs (if any) pay you to be in a math-oriented research role if you don't plan on being a professor. Essentially, there is no other job that would let me do what I love. Most importantly, the people I work with are the kindest people and I'm very happy working there; I even choose to go in person when I'm off from school just because I love being there.

The place I have is a very large apartment right in the middle of a central city and it's rent-controlled, meaning I can live comfortably no matter what job I have. Pretend it's a 4 bedroom in LA for only $1500/month, except the location is even better. There's nowhere like my town, people move from all over the world to be here, it's walkable to many places including great gyms, food places, etc., and it's overall very easy to be a healthy person here. Many people here are wealthy, so I guess that's why it is easier to have a nice life here.

The issue is that both of these things are across the country from one another, and it's a tradeoff either way. The location of my job sucks so bad (because of the nature of it, its in the middle of nowhere) and I feel really down when I'm there, plus it's harder to be healthy and happy with every amenity being hours away. If I were to stay in my dream apartment, I would not be able to work this dream job once I graduate, and I'll have to join the rat race of jobs in finance/tech which will make me miserable career-wise, especially since I already worked very hard to finally get a dream job like this.

Between dream place and job, which would you pick? ",giraffestheory,3,1.0,3,1724358362,2024-08-22 20:26:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eytm8l/would_you_choose_your_dream_job_or_dream_house/,8,2024
1eyt44r,How can I find a grad program that opens my options for both an academic and professional career without sacrificing one for the other?,"I graduated with my bachelors (dual sociology + econ) a couple weeks ago, and honestly I don't even feel proud or accomplished or anything; I just feel scared. I've known for awhile that I wanted to go to grad school eventually, but I was hoping a bachelors would be enough to get me some work experience and allow me to save up to pay for it. Not so. A pile of rejected applications later and now I have pretty thoroughly learned how naive that was. Bachelors degrees are worth nothing and my resume isn't good enough to pick up the slack. I'm stuck in the cycle of ""can't get a job because I can't get a job because I can't get a job."" You know how it goes. Bottom line is I basically have no other option at this point than to go straight into grad school and take out a mountain of predatory loans from corporate yuppie pedophiles that probably worship satan just so I can get one singular fucking job. It is what it is.

So that's one thing. But my ultimate goal was never to climb some corporate ladder; it was to become a social scientist. My research interest has been infuriatingly hard for me to describe, but the best way I can put it -- I think -- is that I want to study social systems as emergent structures. I want to map them out and understand how they emerge, how they respond to threats, how they evolve over time, what they optimize for, what their ultimate attractor states are, etc. I want to study them from a detached, objective, purely scientific standpoint, in the same way that a biologist might study slime molds or termite colonies. The structure and function of social systems is endlessly interesting to me. Call me a nerd or whatever but that shit is cool as fuck in my opinion and I would love nothing more than to get paid to research it. But I also know how competitive academia is and how long it takes to reach that point, and I don't want to go climbing up a mountain without ropes. 

Which finally brings me to the actual reason I'm posting this: I need some idea of how I can pursue both options without sacrificing one for the other. How can I pursue my actual goal while at the same time accruing credentials that would be relevant to a non-academic career if need be? I'm not asking for my hand to be held or whatever, just looking for some recommendations/ideas. Something to point me in the right direction from people who -- unlike me -- actually have some idea of what they're talking about.

My second question is more specific to an academic career. I've already outlined my research interest, but -- due mostly to how interdisciplinary and personal it is -- after four and a half years I still cannot for the life of me figure out which field of study I need to go into to get there. Everything I've been able to find so far has either been too broad or too narrow. Any kind of help here would also be invaluable for me.

If you know of someplace better to post this or somewhere else to go for help, please let me know as well. I'm really trying to get this figured out asap so I can finally get started with my life.",locket-rauncher,1,1.0,0,1724357120,2024-08-22 20:05:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eyt44r/how_can_i_find_a_grad_program_that_opens_my/,8,2024

1eyreuo,I feel bad about leaving my first sales job.,"I've come to realize sales isn't for me. This is effectively my first sales job, as a medical inside sales rep. I was given a great opportunity to start my career with this company, but I hate it. My managers and co-workers are some of the best I've ever had, super laid back and extremely supportive, gives me all the freedom I want (for example, if I need to step out for like 2-3 hours for a doctors appointment or for anything outside of work, no need to let anyone or my manager know, its fine). Absolutely no micro managing whatsoever, and no pressure at all on meeting my quota.

But I just hate the actual job. Mind you, the training in this role was horrendous, basically non-existent because its a role that never existed in the company before. I was kind of just thrown in here and after a couple of months I was expected to start dialing away. Never received any training on cold-calling or shadowing any other person that cold-calls (no one else on the team cold calls because the role never existed and I'm the only one).

Before getting the job offer, my manager told me that when he finished school, he struggled for so long to get a job because no one would offer him one without experience. He said that although I don't have much experience, he saw the potential in me and wanted to be that guy that gives me the opportunity to start my career.

But I really don't think I can do this job. It's starting to affect my mental health, lacking sleep, and every time it's Sunday, I start to hate my life because I know Monday the cycle starts again.

I just feel really bad leaving this role because I know how much my team has riding on me being successful in this role and the opportunity I was given.

I work at a large oil and gas company. 

My director (my boss‚Äôs boss) asked me to meet with him last week, very short notice. 

He told me that I‚Äôve done really great work for the past 8 years in PM/reporting/analytics, and wants to move me from my current department to a new team that he is forming. He was asking me if I am interested in joining this team, where the role would be less focused on PM work and more of a true analytics role. 

They have not yet hired a manager for this team, but that person would eventually be my boss. 

Initially, I told him that I was very interested since I wanted to go to a data analyst specialist role. This new role seemed to fit that. 

However, after the meeting, I sent an email asking what the new title would be and if there was an associated bump in pay. I was told that there would be no title change or bump in pay. 

I went ahead and asked to schedule another meeting, where I would now like to tell them that I‚Äôm not interested in this role since I don‚Äôt know who the team would be, I love my current remote job, I love my current manager.

The new role would be more days in office, higher responsibility, but same pay. To me, this is a downgrade. 

I am thinking it will go one of three ways:

1) they will go back and discuss increasing the offer. 

2) they will mandate that I take the transfer

3) they will accept that I want to stay where I am.

I studied political science at a university in the QS rank 200 in a 3rd world country and during this time I worked on a fullbright funded project about failed policy integration and a social responsibility project for orphans. And as a side job, I made around 40 thousand dollars in 5 years from e-commerce, which I invested only with the stipend I received from school, and I earned my pocket money (re-selling designer clothes), and I had nice friendships. I wrote my dissertation on the financial burden of lack of coordination between public institutions and was accepted to UCLA for my master's degree, again to work on this subject. My visa appointment was given for 3 months and I waited excitedly, I dreamed of the things I would do in LA, Jim Morrison, Jazz and a beautiful library, but my visa was rejected, it was rejected after a 20-second interview without much explanation. Why this program? Because I worked on projects in this field, my graduation thesis is on this subject and I said I want to continue my studies there and unfortunately they said I am not eligible for a visa. They were reaping people, the acceptance rate is below 50% and most of the people who were accepted were women who went for undergraduate studies, most of the men were getting rejected a lot. There is no time left to reapply; the deadline for payment is August 25th and the urgent appointment request for the visa I got again was rejected. I reached out to the mayor, a member of parliament and a bureaucrat but they replied that there is nothing we can do. I cried a lot in the first few days, I accepted that there is nothing I can do. But I do not want to stay in this country anymore; it only drags me down and traps me, there is no welfare and freedom and it prevents me from even getting my visa for some reason I do not understand. I briefly explained my bachelor process above, and what I am asking for your advice is: what can I do at this point? Where, how should I start my life, where is the future? Until 1 month ago I had a very clear career path, now I do not have the slightest idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat to do.

1eyqamn,What to do after my termination Young Adult Male,"Hello everyone yesterday I was let go by my a medicine company but I work as a contractor for a different company (hope not too confusing). I was let go due to my tardiness which is reasonable however I felt there was more to it. 

Before I worked there. I  recently received my bachelors degree in logistics I had experience as an operations assistant manager for a small business and worked as a part time server for a big restaurant company for 5 years. I have built a great reputation for being kind, honest, and hardworking. 

During my time with this company my first week there I experienced inappropriate behavior from a gentleman and spoke to my manager about it. Where all she did was just give him a warning which is acceptable but over the next couple of weeks he became aggressive and push another person out of a truck which a bystander reported the incident to that lead which I assume got back at the manager. But all they wanted to know was if I was present and around when it happened and they dropped it. 

Over the next couple of weeks I would get bullied by my colleague who would call me ‚Äúspecial‚Äù since I received that nickname from the manager. He also would call me an idiot and stupid and would ask if I could win a fight against my harasser in front of other colleagues; more info he is male that is in his early 30‚Äôs. I just ignored what he said and continued to work. After the next coming days I would be late but had reasonable excuses but was punished for it even though certain people that ever come in late never get disciplined. I  would receive an email from an account executive about him wanting to talk to me and was open to talking with him and even reached out to him the next day with no response. Then after the event that we finished up was complete I would get a phone call around the time I was heading for lunch of my recruiter telling me they will cancel my contract and told me to leave my equipment. I left my equipment at my managers desk and even wrote a heartfelt message to her but got no response. 

Overview: I feel as though the company cared more of the attendance than my personal well being. Everyone that I worked with at this company had already had collaborated or had some connections in the past which made it unfair. I experienced inappropriate behavior, retaliation, delay in my termination, being in a hostile work environment.

Now I don‚Äôt know what to do after this and feel a bit lost and confused. I already wrote a letter describing my experience to people in hr along with the parent company that owns the company I was working for.",Vega22x,1,1.0,1,1724350145,2024-08-22 18:09:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eyqamn/what_to_do_after_my_termination_young_adult_male/,8,2024

- Ask them zero personal questions unless they ask you those questions first.

Way B:
- say ""hello"" to coworkers when you walk by them sometimes
- ask them a couple questions unrelated to work sometimes

Way C:
- say ""hello"" to coworkers frequently in general
- ask the questions unrelated to work fairly often

1eyp0dn,Can My Job Do This??,"I'm employed at a local municipal water board in the state of Alabama. I was hired under a 2 year apprenticeship that has quarterly raises with no benefits. Apart of my job acceptance letter, in writing it states, ""eligible for RSA retirement benefits after year one of emplyment"". I was hired January of 2024, which means, according to my acceptance letter, my eligibility for RSA benefits will be January of 2025. 

Yesterday, I was told by HR that they were initially given incorrect information regarding RSA and that I am required to have it from day one of employment. They follow up by saying that I have to repay everything that's accumulated from January 2024 to date and that effective immediately, I will have to pay RSA going forward. If I don't sign the RSA paperwork, that is a response that I no longer wish to work at this job. One mess of an ultimatum.

When I accepted my job as an apprentice, I did so considering my lower pay would be offset with the fact that I didn't have to pay into any benefits until at least year two, as my acceptance letter stated. I already work paycheck to paycheck. There's no logical way for me to back pay for the last nearly 9 months plus the new monthly RSA payments. In my opinion, this is not my problem. 

This is an error on my company and those over this mess. I signed my name on eligibility for year two going forward, not ear one. This seems unethical and illegal. Due to this being their issue, the company should eat the costs for year one..not just the back payments. Because that's not what was in my acceptance letter and not what I agreed to.

These include a spelling error on something I reprinted in house within a few minutes, filing something incorrectly (despite the fact I know she gave me the incorrect filing code, something she denies) but again an easy fix), sent an email newsletter of 25+ pages with 1 incorrect date for an event in 3 months time, not ideal but resolved within 5 mins of being alerted out of hours, and tbh I don't remember the others but they were of equal severity.

This morning I received quite a stern talking to about how 'my lack of attention to detail is becoming a habit' which felt massively overblown if I'm honest.

Obviously I don't want to make mistakes, and do my best to avoid them and am disappointed if they do happen, but equally I'm not sure anything I or anyone else in our team does is up to their standards. They also make errors all the time (spelling, word choice etc etc) and I just correct them without bringing it up - the newsletter for example is a whole team effort, I just collate it, and all of the other errors that were spotted where her doing, but I just corrected them without bringing it up because imo spelling errors etc are just minor errors etc. Whilst I don't think she thinks that she is perfect, but I get the impression she thinks this is happening because I'm not trying or something, and that it's not because she throws curveball after curveball at me all day long and I rarely get time to complete a thought, let alone a task!

I can just be given some basic paramters or apply my own and then pour ideas out of my brain easily and find it really fun to do, but I struggle to work on ideas or follow through projects myself. 

Is there a career anywhere for idea generation? How could I get into a job like that? I find it so fulfilling but can't find a way to make this work for me.

1eync6o,Job for a fixed 12 month contract,"Hi all

My dream job has come up at the dream employer too. I have bagged an interview, the only thing is that it‚Äôs a 12 month contract.

Can anybody share any advice? Questions I could possibly ask in the interview? The one thing I don‚Äôt want is to ask if there is any possibility for it to turn into a permanent role, for them to ask ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt you read the job description ‚Äú

1eyn769,Health informatics/data analytics cert?,"
Hello,
I have a MHA( masters in health administration) from an accredited university. Graduated in 2020. I initially wanted to go into data analytics in health care, but due to the pandemic etc I was not able to. I was only able to start off with entry level operations jobs/ customer service jobs in health care companies (managing appointments, talking to insurance companies etc )

But I still want to transition to health informatics/health information management and data analytics side of healthcare. Not sure how to go about it since I already have a masters. So I did not want to do another masters. 
Can anyone suggest the best route? I was also thinking a certification but unsure which one would be best

They really like people to be in person but have made some exceptions for remote employees. I got a new job offer in my desired new city and took it.

My old boss reached out to me the other day via text to say she misses having me there and hopes I‚Äôm doing well. I alluded to things not going well and she said I could always come back.

1eyjzvs,"Do not worry about ""job hopping"" on your resume!","So many posts on this sub are people concerned about taking a great offer because they haven't been in their current job for very long, and they don't want future opportunities to reject them because they see the short tenure at prior jobs and worry you won't stick around. Here's why this is silly:

1. Rejecting an offer for fear of missing out on a future opportunity means you are trading a *real* opportunity for a *hypothetical* one.
2. Many hiring managers barely glance at a resume, and they are looking for the competencies they require, not analyzing dates and locations. They lean much more on the interview, not the resume. Just be prepared with a simple explanation, ideally along the lines of ""I quickly outgrew the role and wanted more responsibilities"".
3. If you ever get to a point where your job hopping is so severe that you have a reason to believe that it's the one thing holding you back from getting offers... **congratulations!!!** This means you have advanced your career by 3 or 4 meaningful steps in a short time rather than stagnating in that first role. Now all you have to do is take a break from applying for a year or two, which you were debating doing at the outset anyways, but now your salary is 10s of thousands of dollars higher while you wait (but even then, don't be afraid to keep applying if you have the stamina for it!)
4. If you are worried about your employer suffering from losing you, don't. Companies won't think twice about cutting you the moment the numbers are looking shaky. You are the ONLY person looking out for your success, if you want to spend your life making other people rich while you stay poor that's on you.

Happy job hopping!",GoBuffaloes,46,0.7900000214576721,21,1724335047,2024-08-22 13:57:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eyjzvs/do_not_worry_about_job_hopping_on_your_resume/,8,2024

1eyjctv,I 26M feel directionless and I'm not sure wjat I should be doing next to secure a job,"I finished university three years ago with a game development bachelor's and I've been uncertain of what I should do next the whole time. The first year was almost like a break for me though I was volunteering at a foodbank to get something on my CV. Since then I've had a small job as a social media assistant on very very low pay and I've been volunteering on a couple of game projects. I still live at home and we are barely dragging ourselves along. The problem is that I live in a small town that isn't exactly a hub of tech jobs, I'm still learning to drive (it has been taking me forever), and I have a disability which prevents me from doing jobs that involve standing up or walking around for long periods of time. 

I really don't think I'm going to get a job in games and have lost the drive for it to be honest. So I've been applying for IT apprenticeships as my friends have found work that way, and I think this could be a good option for me too as I have quite a broad knowledge of computers, but I don't feel like my knowledge goes deep enough to secure a specialised job yet. I think this is probably my best option but there arent many apprenticeships around me. I also have been applying for any job that comes up that I can physically do, but once again my options are slim. 

This past year I've also been working on my self esteem and confidence to try to get better at networking. I pretty much just force myself into as many social situations as possible.

I'm still not really sure if I'm moving in the right direction though, or if there's anything else I can do to get a job or increase my chances of getting one. I feel like I should've been learning to program this whole time but my aimless uncertainty has held me back. I get very stressed out about all this and I don't really know if I should be frantically applying for everything or if I should just chill and focus on getting driving done first. 

I also have a cooking tiktok with a twist on the side that's picking up a bit of steam and to be honest I would love one of these side projects to become a source of income one day even if it takes time. I'm not really sure what the best next move is in my situation though, so any advice or even where to get advice would be appreciated.

1eyj6ym,"Unexpectedly received a GREAT offer with benefits, but only been with my current employer for 6 months‚Ä¶ ","I am a young professional just starting out- I just got my first ‚Äúreal job‚Äù post college, and so far it has been amazing. My coworkers and supervisors are kind, empathetic, and all around genuinely great people. They‚Äôve been nothing but kind to me! I love my job. That being said, it doesn‚Äôt pay well‚Ä¶ at all. Honestly it‚Äôs hardly what is considered a ‚Äúliving wage.‚Äù

A little while ago I unexpectedly received an email from another company within the same field for a position I had applied for last year, and never heard back from. They invited me to interview. I did, and learned that I would be paid over $15k more annually - it would be a comfortable salary, especially given I am single and live alone. I‚Äôll be transparent and say finances have been a big stressor in my life thus far. To add to that, they will sponsor my graduate degree in the program I‚Äôve been wanting to pursue! Amongst other great benefits. 

After thoughtful consideration, I know it would be such a disservice to myself to take this offer. This unexpected opportunity really has the potential to offer me much more financial freedom, and also a direct pathway towards reaching my long term career goals. I accepted the position, and am working through the pre-hire paperwork now.

I‚Äôm incredibly nervous to tell my current employer that I will be leaving- especially because the role I am in has seen a lot of turn around, due to the low pay. The last person in my position left for the same reason- they received a much better offer, and my current employer won‚Äôt match that. 

I just feel awful because I know this has been a consistent issue for this position, and it was expressed that they want someone for the long term, when I interviewed. I had every intention to stay for at least a few years, or more. Just worried about tarnishing my great reputation at work (especially because everyone really likes me here, and I do work hard), and breaking the tough news to my employer. In doing so I plan to emphasize that this decision wasn‚Äôt one made lightly, and is not at all a reflection of my experience here, but rather one that is more in alignment with my financial and long term career goals. 

I‚Äôm naturally an anxious person, and I don‚Äôt know what kind of reaction to expect from my bosses/colleagues. I feel like I‚Äôm letting them down. But also, I‚Äôm really excited for this new opportunity that will open doors for me.

I wanted to share a bit about our situation and seek some advice. My fianc√©e arrived in the U.S. on a K-1 fianc√©e visa this past May, and we got married in June. She‚Äôs currently going through the process of obtaining her green card. Our long-term goal is to help her settle down here, find a job, make friends, and start this new chapter of our lives together.

She holds a bachelor‚Äôs degree in industrial design from a university in Taiwan and has around 7-8 years of work experience in the field.

Given this, we‚Äôre wondering if it‚Äôs possible for her to secure an interior design job here in Columbus, Ohio, without being fluent in English. She‚Äôs a native Mandarin speaker, so if there are any Chinese design companies in the area, that would be an excellent fit as well. Online positions, such as CAD drawings, would work too.

I have a degree, Bachelors in Computer Science but never got into programming/coding...strictly the business side of things outside just admin stuff (mostly front end) on a few different software's we support.

Over the last 48hrs I have been looking at jobs near by that fall into my system/business analyst niche and the pay seems pretty shitty compared to what I make (55-85k) and a lot of them require you to code/know the niche software their company uses, etc.

1eyg7lw,Autistic career help,"Hi guys, I'll try keep this short 

I have Autism and possibly ADHD, I studied as a product designer and spent 8 or so years in the design field, from 3D printing to furniture design and prop modelling and 3D Art. I then changed career in the pandemic to become a firefighter and loved it. But I struggle socially with the career, spending 48 + hours a week with the same 8 people and feeling like an outcast.

I can apply myself to the role and then am very good at it, but I found working in design easier as I could put my headphones in and work. My issue with getting back into design though is my portfolio is all over the place and design companies want to hire people with lots of experience in 1 field.

My strongest attribute is definitely idea generation. I am always able to help people come up with ideas or help them develop pretty much anything. Like books, characters, art, products, branding, anything really. I can just be given some basic paramters or apply my own and then pour ideas out of my brain easily and find it really fun to do, but I struggle to work on ideas or follow through projects myself. 

Is there a career anywhere for idea generation? How could I get into a job like that? I find it so fulfilling but can't find a way to make this work for me.

1eyg4wj,Fresh grad - Job with 4 hour commute worth it?,"I recently graduated in May and I‚Äôm torn as to whether I should accept this job. It‚Äôs on average (at most) a 4 hour commute by transit each day as I can‚Äôt drive.

This is the first place to offer me a job, however they‚Äôre paying $4-5/hr less than average for what other companies pay in this position. I‚Äôm hoping to leverage the higher position to jump ship after getting a year of experience, but I don‚Äôt know if I would be able to hand a 4 hour commute everyday. The company also gives a lot of 2-4hr overtime depending on how busy they are (lab job). 

The wage isn‚Äôt high enough to be able to live closer and commute. I‚Äôm planning on learning to drive soon, but I would also have to be comfortable driving on the highway which I think would take time. The commute by car would be about half the time of transit.

Should I take this job for the experience and tough it out?

1eyfanr,"burnout, stress, exhaustion, I just want peace","I started working for my current company almost a year and a half ago.

I left my old horrible, toxic job (where I was in a management position) after hitting a breaking point. I used to work at least 6 days a week, was always on call, with no overtime and zero work life balance.

I walked into my new job through connections I had in the industry, and kept my rate of pay (which was not much). I absolutely adored this job. I had a great work life balance, and genuinely excelled in my position.

About 6 months ago, I was recommended for a promotion (supervisor role). With this company being so much better to work for, I went for it. With little surprise, I got the role.

I now make more money than I ever thought I would (no degree) in my industry.

However, since then, we have had a major shift in management, and a couple of big operational changes.

I have taken on more responsibility than expected when I accepted the role. I am being given tasks far above those at the same level as me.

Yet, I go between feeling I am doing too much, to feeling I am never doing enough. 

I am beginning to feel even worse than I did at my last job. I am burned out, stressed all the time, and even the days off I consistently have, I can't stop stressing out about work. It's gotten to the point that I'm praying for an injury or minor illness so I can take time off.

I want my old job back, but I don't know if telling my managers that will be a good idea, for a few reasons.

1. I would take a significant paycut (and life is expensive)
2. That job might not be available anymore
3. What if it's just teething issues and I regret it later?

I am so tired of feeling this way. I just want a peaceful existence.

1eyf9a4,I started a job last week and I already feel like I‚Äôm going to get fired ,"So I started last week as a junior legal secretary at a law firm where there is just two lawyers and me, that‚Äôs it. The position is two days a week, so I‚Äôve worked 4 days so far. I am a 20yr old law student at uni (in Australia) and I have no legal experience or admin experience at all. 

The principal lawyer is like an 85 year old grumpy man, the other lawyer can attest that he is grumpy. He gave me brief instructions for a task in a way that didn‚Äôt make sense to me, so I tried to clarify but he just got mad at me instead and said he would the task himself, and then he started talking to the other lawyer about how useless I am, and that I‚Äôm incompetent and don‚Äôt know how to do anything, out loud so I could hear and it felt pretty awful. The other lawyer, didn‚Äôt say much to that. 

Which is ridiculous, because I haven‚Äôt made any mistakes to my knowledge yet, I‚Äôve been completing my tasks in a reasonable time and did a good job in them. But now this makes me think I‚Äôm going to get fired. I‚Äôm honestly dreading going back next week and I would rather leave before I potentially got fired. 

Keep in mind, they knew they were hiring someone with no experience, and in the interview experience I made it clear and they said they just wanted someone ‚Äúhappy to learn‚Äù. I‚Äôve received very little training, after 10 minutes on my first day I was already doing things by myself, and I‚Äôm expected to remember how to do things after being quickly shown once. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I‚Äôve got anxiety and I just feel like this job is going to do me more harm than good. I don‚Äôt really have room to receive feedback/more communication as it‚Äôs just the two lawyers and they are both very busy and usually always in meetings so I work autonomously. Even at the end of the workday, the lawyers are normally in a call so I can‚Äôt chat to them about this if I wanted to. 

Money isn‚Äôt an issue for me, as I still live at home and have another job. So I‚Äôm happy to leave if it‚Äôs the best choice, I just feel like I need legal experience as a student already in my third year and I am more worried about it looking bad if I don‚Äôt last in a legal job.

1eyf2gf,Thinking of Resigning: Should I Hire a Career Coach or Start My Own Business?,"I'm at a crossroads in my career and will definitely resign within the next three months. Here are my current options:

1. **Resign without an Alternative**: My job is incredibly toxic, and I desperately need a break. However, this means I'd be without a safety net.
2. **Find a New Job Before Resigning**: While this might seem the safer route, I'm worried about jumping from one bad situation into another. I'd prefer to approach this with more mental clarity.
3. **Hire a Career Coach**: Although it‚Äôs expensive, a career coach could help me identify my strengths, understand how to market myself, and explore job opportunities that don‚Äôt lead to the same stress and dissatisfaction.

Here‚Äôs the bigger picture:

I'm also contemplating starting my own business. I‚Äôm not sure if hiring a career coach would be worth it if I decide to pursue entrepreneurship later on this year or in 2025.

Another important consideration: I don‚Äôt feel financially stable at the moment, so money is definitely a concern.

1eyf0z1,"I was ambitious and hardworking, but my mental to-do list was crushing me. Here's what helped.","I had big goals and a seemingly endless list of tasks to achieve them. But there was a problem: most of that list existed only in my head.

Every day felt like I was carrying a massive mental checklist. I'd wake up thinking about tasks, go to bed worrying about what I forgot, and spend my days feeling overwhelmed but unsure what to actually work on next.

If you're in the same boat, here's what helped me: Getting Things Done (GTD).

Here's the gist of it:

1. Capture everything on your mind - tasks, ideas, worries. Get it all out of your head. I use the Sunsama app to capture everything. It's very intuitive.
2. Clarify what each item means and what action it requires.
3. Organize tasks into categories - next actions, waiting for, projects, etc.
4. Actually do the tasks. Again, I use Sunsama to put timeblocks in my calendar and get things done.

The key is to stop trying to remember everything and instead use a system you trust. It frees up mental space and reduces anxiety.

Some tips that helped me:

* Do a ""brain dump"" before bed to clear your mind
* Break big projects into specific next actions
* Review your lists weekly to stay organized

If you're overwhelmed, start with first step - Write down 3 things on your mind. Build momentum and get things done.

1eyad7q,"Work from home, no video, 80k per year stable income, 50 hours a week max","I want a work from home job, I want to make a minimum of 80k per year, I want to work no more than 50 hours per week, preferably only working overtime in the busy season for a few months. I do not want to be on camera. Like ever. No zoom calls with the camera on, no video interviews, I want my employer to not know how my face looks. I've tried commission sales, I'm good at it. I've done call center work, social media marketing, and office management for about 10 people for a small business. I'm autistic and maybe also adhd and I do best with clearly defined roles, goals, and a results oriented work environment. I don't like sitting idle for long periods of time with nothing to do, I prefer a steady pace of tasks throughout the day. I've been told my whole life I have an excellent phone voice and I'm good at writing emails. I prefer a job where I get paid more with bonuses and stuff the harder I work, but I'm nervous about going into something like life insurance or something because it's so hard to tell what companies are scams and what companies are legit. I'm willing to pick up new skills, especially stuff like certifications, but my life has been so much better since doing work from home. I've been kinda stuck in lower level office jobs despite having a lot of experience because of anxiety from sensory stuff in open plan and small tight cube farm offices and not having the right body language my whole life. Working from home has significantly helped me, but someone is harassing me out of my current job, and it's not the kind of job where I can report them to anyone or block them or anything.

1eya075,Im tired of trying to find a good job,"
I need advice, or someone that went through the same thing and succeeded. Im 28, have a bachelors in accounting and masters in international financial and political relations. I have certifications in excel, data analysis, and management consulting. I got these certificates while working so not before i start my jobs. Ever since i graduated my bachelors, i got an internship in finance for 3 months and literally nothing good after. I tried looking for a job for 2 years but nothing ever came, all weird opportunities saying its in accounting but turns out its a warehouse job or something. So i decided to start my masters. 

I got a job in quality assurance after my masters and as soon as i started the manager said im a receptionist actually, for 6 months he was the worst person to ever deal with, a pervert, verbally and emotionally abusive, and ended up firing me after i spoke up. He made me do SO MUCH and always told me im just a receptionist when i ask for a raise or a change to my job title. I lead audits, managed sales, did his whole marketing and web development, i developed 3 quality manuals for him and as soon as i said this is too much and asked for a raise after 6 months he fires me. That was beginning of 2023, i got nothing out of that job. I left that job and was looking for others, had an opportunity for quality assurance again with a small company but it was good pay. I passed the interviews and on my last one, the manager asked for my number so we can ‚Äúchat‚Äù sometimes outside work. Dont come at me for leaving that opportunity, i was already traumatized by the previous manager and there were only 7 employees in this one with the manager as the director of the company or something so there was no way id be comfortable with this job. I left it and got a job as admin just to get by because it was a temp job. 

The only jobs that seem to contact me are receptionist and admin jobs. Not after i started this job, before all this, im only getting admin jobs‚Ä¶ Why??? Im not stupid, i dont look stupid‚Ä¶ as an admin, im actually helping other departments with many things because people trust that i know how to do things, most of my job right now is managing expenses and our budget, not in my job description but my manager isnt good with numbers so i do it for her, i attend meetings the Finance team on my own and they always tell me i shouldnt be doing this because its more than what i earn. I cant say no because i need the experience and no one else wants tk hire me for it. I fully took on digitizing our service, i had several meetings with IT to make a digital platform for us and now made everything easier for our service. Theyre always happy with my work, i know im good at many things. But no one wants to give me the chance, im good at interviews because whenever i ask for feedback they say theres not much they can give me because i did really well but its just not this time or wtv. 

I hate to say this but all my friends and the people i grew up with are now managers, started their own businesses, settled finally. All im doing is struggling so much and moving every 6 months, not getting paid enough, etc.. my job is also temporary and extends every 3 months so anytime i could lose this and idk what will happen after. I do a lot of horrible part time hours so i could have money on the side just in case i lose the job or have to move again. All yhe part time jobs i do are with people way younger than me‚Ä¶ I feel like i deserve so much more that this. 

I even tried starting online businesses, i built digital agencies and just had the weirdest and worst luck at everything i do. 

The worst part is i dont know what i should be applying for. I accepted so many jobs just because i needed them and now my cv is confusing (accouting, IR, quality assurance, admin‚Ä¶) with all the extra certifications. What am i doing wrong? Is it just bad luck for me? 

Genuinely i get so much bad luck, if i book a flight to travel and have some time off the stress im getting, something will happeeeennn. Once had my passport stolen on my way to the airport, train delayed for 3 hours and missed my flight so lost the money on the trip. Literally have a trip booked next month and had to pay $450 cancellation fee because my manager is traveling and needs me to do something that week. 

Im very patient and i try my best but my god im so tired. I need to settle down i need to be able to figure out where ill be next month or the one after. Im genuinely tired of trying to stay positive and cant complain to anyone around me because no one gets it. They think its me, could be me though but i dont see it. 

Was anyone ever in my place?

1ey9yth,Recent CS Grad Can't Find Job,"I graduated with a applied computing: Software development degree, similar to Computer Science in May 2024. I did not have an internship while in school.

My mother had passed at the second year of college and my father had passed before her, but my big thing was making sure I graduated on time, sort of ignoring the advice of my friends and professor to prolong my stay for internship experience.  Also my remaining family instilled work work work, thus my summers have been filled with not career related jobs just for some extra cash and to say I was always working or doing school, but looking back I probably should have been more focused on Internship Experience.

I have been considering many options, I was considering doing another degree very similar to mine like Computer Science or Information Technology just to get another chance at getting another chance at an internship.  From my research the job market is a little harder to get a job in software development, I think if I had one really good internship experience I might be able to get rehired.

I recently had a strong referral get me an interview somewhere for an Information Technology Specialist position but was then soon ghosted.

* I am planning to move next year but am not set on where, I am open to moving to any metropolitan or regional areas within NSW, Vic or QLD, but would be open to other states
* My experience; I have worked in disability support work for the past 3 years, mostly supporting participants with neurodevelopmental (i.e., learning diabilities, ADHD, Autism) and mental health conditions
* I love the job and my role as a support worker. Specifically, I find it rewarding working one-on-one, hearing the stories and experiences of people, developing an understanding of their goals and outlook on life and building rapport 
* Although I am applying for 4th year psychology studies at various universities, I am unsure about whether I will get in. Even if I get in, I am unsure if furthering my studies is the best option for me
* My primary interests are in psychotherapy, art therapy, EDMR, person-centred approaches, mindfulness

I need some help with something I have been struggling with for a while now. I am a mother of two young kids. One is 2.5 the other is just under 3 months. Prior to having kids, I was working as a consultant in the capital markets space, which I loved! However, since having kids I have taken a break and hesitate to get back into a full time job. This partially has to do with leaving my kids, but a big part of it has to do with how do I get back in? What roles do I consider? I do realize I want to be in middle office/back office roles (nothing with client management such as sales or client relationships). 

I graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs degree back in 2016 with a psychology major and a biology minor as I was initially in the pre med track. I have over 2 years of experience in the finance space. Any pointers on how to get back in? I am currently planning to enroll into some college accounting/financial courses as I never took such courses in college. Are there any certificates out there that I can get that can make me more credible? I eventually plan to get an MBA, but not sure if right now is the best time.

I manage a regenerative, organic farm in Ohio. I'm about the leave the farm because my boss is wack and earlier this season the entire team quit except me only because the crops would otherwise die and I can't let that happen lol. I will part ways end of growing season. Which will be the start of an entirely new chapter. I'm both scared and excited. Right now, I'm trying to listen in on what my desires/needs are. Because truly I have no idea what's next. What's come up so far is the idea of some educational program. Or training. I want to deepen my understanding of plants on a scientific level. I'm so curious about the science behind what I do. I've of course read books on organic garden and farming, but I'm looking to understand the field in a deep and meaningful way. So the idea of going to school for botany or possibly horticulture is intriguing, but also highly intimidating considering I only just recently got into plant science and did horribly in the sciences back in high school... additionally, I'm attracted to the idea of the sciences or plants somehow merging with the arts. Idk if that's even a thing. I'm into experimental, alternative, even hands on ways of learning. Liberal Arts colleges come to mind. Or maybe there's just a 4 week training program that's out there for me. Idk. I'm clearly lost and without much direction. I definitely want to earn money in this field. But don't know in what capacity. Farming could be in the cards, but I'm also open to doing research or something more niche.

All profane and aggressive (meant to be humorous). I dropped several f bombs, made a few mean comments about things not related to work. I did briefly in a few sentences comain about a past patient but there was no identifiable information.

Realizing my phone hadn't rang for a few minutes I returned to my desk to find I'd left about 2 minutes voice mail of my conversation with my husband. 


Again, this is something I did by mistake. It was not intended for anyone to hear. I did it because I thought I ended a call and all was private for me. I can only equate this to someone having a bad day and taking a moment to walk to their car to call family and have the same meltdowbn I had and then pulling it together to return to worm and be professional. 


I love my job! Does anything thing this mistake can get me fired? I'll take a write up and being under a microscope. Does any one know if I'd be able to please with HR if the voice mail is reported?


It CAN be traced to me. I just am not sure what exactly was heard or if the person would care enough to report my voice mail! There's a slim chance they thought may be it was a patient who forgot to end call and wad cussing.

1ey3t1d,Advice on switching my major ,"Hello,

This is my first time writing anything on reddit so please bear with me, and I‚Äôm a bit skeptical about putting all my business online but I‚Äôll try to make things as clear as possible.

Basically I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing with my life, I‚Äôm a 3rd year chemistry university student and I‚Äôve been thinking about switching programs for like 2 years. I picked chemistry on a whim, it was the last day of registration and in reality I was thinking of taking a gap year but I just bit the bullet and registered (immigrant parents and societal pressure). I‚Äôve always liked sciences but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything out there that I‚Äôm really passionate about enough to do it for the rest of my life.

Ive always like arts but it‚Äôs hard to have a stable career with this so I would prefer to just keep it as a hobby. I also always wanted to pick science because, as much as I hate to say it, there‚Äôs a certain amount of respect and prestige that comes with anything that‚Äôs in stem and at the end of the day I just want to make as much money as I can to live comfortably. I also do like sciences I remember when I was a young i would enjoy reading and learning about the different sciences but I digress. It may be a bit superficial to say I just want money, but I don't really aspire to work a day in my life. I have other underlying issues such as mental health problems that have greatly plummeted my motivation to do certain things and I feel like I‚Äôm often just going through the motions. I don‚Äôt want to drop out because I‚Äôm too far in and I‚Äôve spent too much money, and i feel pressured that I won‚Äôt finish my studies in 4 years like everyone else.

With all this in mind, I was thinking of either switching to Biochemistry or Biomedical sciences,these are the two programs that I think have been recommended to me the most. I don‚Äôt really want to be a doctor (or go to med school) but I heard that biomed still opens quite a few doors even if it is competitive. I do somewhat like writing research papers or searching things up online and so I thought maybe I‚Äôd like biochemistry, and it also has a small amount of transferable courses with my chemistry major. I also do like animals and so I thought maybe I could become a vet, but this is a very small and insignificant idea in the grand scheme of things. Not long ago I was on academic probation and while I do like to study (or at least I thought I did) my grades don‚Äôt really show for it. Things like lack of motivation and my depression (I'm not diagnosed so don't take my word for it) I think have probably led to this, I also place a lot of importance in academic validation which can be crippling in some ways.

I did end up taking a bunch of elective courses (in this last year) so I could boost my gpa again and now I‚Äôm kind of in a standstill (and I now dont have all the credits I should at this point in time), my gpa is still not high enough to do an actual switch but I can still take whichever courses I would need for the switch. Chemistry may be too difficult for me, but if I can somehow get the motivation to continue and discipline myself I might as well give it a try.

Ultimately, I‚Äôm looking to switch to a program with a high success rate, one that pays well and one that I can realistically do well in given my situation. I know for biochemistry I would probably need to do a PhD but then again I don‚Äôt really know what I would do, and so I‚Äôd be open to hearing others experiences or views on this. I‚Äôm honestly just kind of tired of not knowing what I‚Äôm doing and often times I get told that since I‚Äôm ‚Äúyoung‚Äù I still have time to figure it out but I am really at a loss. I‚Äôd be open to other major recommendations but I would prefer if they were in STEM.

1ey3pz9,Is switching industries worth it for an easy remote job,"In a short summary I am currently a project coordinator for a wellness startup. My team is awesome and honestly great to be around. We‚Äôre all under 30 and have a cool office vibe. 

Where I am struggling is the pressure of the work environment and work life balance. Since it‚Äôs a start up a lot of us are wearing multiple hats trying to get things done and daily it feels like a fire drill. We don‚Äôt ever plan ahead at the company because we have things that have been so far pushed back due to work load that we all are extremely happy even having a week notice for an entire campaign or deck. 

My boss has also started to give me more project manager tasks because he‚Äôd like to promote me to a manger. Truthfully, it‚Äôs a shit show and I have 0 training in project management so I know I‚Äôm really going to struggle. I am already having sleepless nights since starting out because of the constant stress and worry. It‚Äôs honestly made my anxiety worse and self confidence plummet.

I‚Äôve told him my hesitance but he insist I am ready (I‚Äôve only been at the company for 7 months). I see how many hours my boss works and how insanely busy he is during the day.

He is very intelligent (like beyond average smarts) which I think allows him to get the job done every single day. 

Long story short, my friend offered me a role at her company. We‚Äôd be in the same department but different teams. It‚Äôs in the health space doing revenue cycle management. It‚Äôs very different from what I‚Äôm used to and I would also be taking a 9k~ pay cut. But I‚Äôd be fully remote so I would technically be making about the same (my commute is 3 hours in LA traffic). My friend had this job a few years ago before she was promoted and she said it‚Äôs extremely chill and easy. I‚Äôd like to travel and focus more on growing my side business in marketing and creatives. I‚Äôm not very technical at all and I hate that it‚Äôs my job. 

Not sure what to do here. I feel like I‚Äôd love a restart and thinking I can go back into the creative industry if I change my mind. Has anyone been in a similar position?

1ey3kqy,"Made a few mistakes at work, how to get my boss to trust me again","I work for a very small arts organisation, and was recently, after being offered another job elsewhere, was offered a promotion to stay, which I accepted. I used to work for them 3 days a week, and now I do 5 and have much more responsibility.¬† TBH I was already trying to cram in 5 days work into 3, and already had those responsibilities unofficially though.



My boss is generally excellent, but very type A / perfectionist / workaholic which I am not.¬† She previously regularly stated she couldn't run the organisation without me, but now I get the distinct impression she is regretting her decision to promote me.



In the last 2 months I've made a handful of small mistakes. These include a spelling error on something I reprinted in house within a few minutes, filing something incorrectly (despite the fact I know she gave me the filing code, something she denies) but again an easy fix), sent an email newsletter of 25+ pages with 1 incorrect date for an event in 3 months time, not ideal but resolved within 5 mins of being alerted out of hours, and tbh I don't remember the others but they were of equal severity.



This morning I received quite a stern talking to about how 'my lack of attention to detail is becoming a habit' which felt massively overblown if I'm honest. She made me feel really small and pathetic and made it quite clear she's lost all trust in me and my work.¬† Now I can't get anything done without her obsessively going over and over things before they're finalised.¬† As mentioned, we're a small organisation and it's just not feasible to do this longterm.¬† Obviously I don't want to make mistakes, and do my best to avoid them and am disappointed if they do happen, but equally I'm not sure anything I or anyone else in our team does is up to their standards. They also make errors all the time (spelling, word choice etc etc) and I just correct them without bringing it up. Whilst I don't think she thinks that she is perfect, but I get the impression she thinks I'm not trying or something, and that it's not because she throws curveball after curveball at me all day long and I rarely get time to complete a thought, let alone a task!

1ey1ndp,Independent Contractor to FTE -- need insight on managing my expectations lol,"Hi all, I'm working as an independent contract for a mid sized B2B advertising agency as their UX and UI Designer. I have about \~2 years of actual work experience. I was contracted to just two projects, the agency was impressed with my work and are discussing bringing me on full time and are re-asking for my salary expectations.

I am their sole UX designer and the UX maturity (or even web maturity) is very low--so I would be heavily involved in building up a relatively new department for the agency. When I first gave them my pay rate, I honestly feel like I lowballed myself too much (as is common with little confidence haha)

But now that I've worked with them for a while and have a feel for the workload and expectations, I would like to ask for a higher salary that I feel is representative of the work and value I bring. Currently I'm making something like 33/hr for contracting. Hours are very low as they are project based.

Reasons why I feel like I deserve a little more, since I am the only one in my field of expertise, I am completely responsible for every task under my jurisdiction. I really can't hand off anything to anyone else should I ever fall sick or something. I would be taking on more responsibilities and more projects and intend on providing a much much higher quality of output of my work than I am now (still quality, but won't be limited to like max 20 hours contractually so I can invest more time with setting up workshops/meetings, more detailed and time intensive deliverables, etc etc).

I know it's more common to expect a lower salary with FTE conversion than contracted due to the full compensation package, but it's hard to ignore knowing I've lowballed myself due to lack of confidence--but my confidence has built much more.

Basically, would love a little insight. Quite frankly, salary negotiations scare me and I really struggle with knowing a fair range to ask for. I was thinking of giving a 75k-85k range and go from there, but even I feel low confidence with whether I'm still lowballing myself. I'm not sure what the compensation package would entail.

1ey0knu,When is too early to quit!? ,"I‚Äôm about 2 months into a new job. I‚Äôm in a relatively senior role and also manage people. The pace of the role is something like I‚Äôve never experienced before and it‚Äôs looking like it will increase based on some upcoming projects. 

This isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing as I‚Äôm learning new skills and working on things that will look good on the CV. The issue is that my bosses boss is a micromanaging, control freak with zero personal skills. He seems to have free rein to micromanage and pick holes in  everything people do in the company. You can see colleagues are scared to talk on calls because he grills them in front of everyone. 

I‚Äôm not a kid and have been in the world of work for over 20 years and have never come across someone like this. My role is so busy but he constantly has unreasonable demands and just keeps coming up with things you already know about but haven‚Äôt had the time to work on because he‚Äôs mentioned 10 other things in the past 24 hours. 

I can‚Äôt switch off from work at the moment, I feel depressed and miserable and it‚Äôs impacting my relationship with my kids as I end up being short with them. 

Sorry for the long post, I think I just needed to vent and don‚Äôt even really know what I‚Äôm asking. I‚Äôm basically weighing up my options on leaving. I think this will look bad on my CV and hard to explain why I‚Äôm not happy in interviews.

1ey0iy0,Money is the Bad Motivation,"Hi good fellas  
I made a wrong move in my career transition. About 2 years ago, I started my career as a DevOps engineer, my first company was good for stating career \[I've realized that later\] but I was very unsatisfied with my salary then and tried to switch early with a higher package. After 9 months, I got another offer to a big company and double salary package, so I did not think for a second time and joined here \[my biggest wrong move\]. By back then, I thought that big companies will practice better culture and I would get the opportunity to learn and earn more by grabbing this job, I never researched the role and responsibility in the new company \[they overglorified the role but it was actually a Support role\], yes I act like a fool. After one week of my joining, I figured out that this job is only about to communicate and relay back emails, I have nothing to do by myself, no code, no command, no implementations, no architecture nothing but to acknowledged client request and make a call with developer team and forward make the fix and cause analysis to client and managers. No work life balance was there, I did not know when would my work finish as the other team used to reply late and I had to wait for their reply, making my work hour 10-14 hours in a regular basis. Everyday my daily routine was, check and write emails, schedule and attend meetings, I was frustrated from very begging but then tried to remain in that job unless I got anything better.

  
Soon my morale becomes more and more down and I was never a performer there \[honestly I am not the guy to communicate in emails and attend meeting, I am a bad engineer but I am an engineer who loves to build\] and constantly feeling suffocated in this role, I decided to leave the job asap. Now for last 3 months I am jobless but my mental health and confidence grow back high again.

Maybe I have turned my career upside down as now I see, getting a job becomes more and more difficult for me but I had to take the risk. I always wanted to share this story of mine as in the past my belief was ""money is only true motivation to work"" but I have now realized in the hard way that I was wrong, our satisfaction depends many things. We have to trade off, find a balance point as we can not have all at a time.",sudipto03,0,0.5,0,1724273129,2024-08-21 20:45:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ey0iy0/money_is_the_bad_motivation/,8,2024
1ey0f2s,Should i change teams although I'm currently very good at what I'm doing?,"Hello, I'm a 22 year old girl who's currently working as a business analyst for a telecom company. I mostly do operational stuff and I had actually organised the whole operation of my section which is taking care of new offers and getting it to function properly (sfcc) and etc. It was a heavily messy process that I took care of and put in order in a way that the company has never seen before, in doing so I became a crucial asset to the whole operation being the most efficient worker in the segment in 8 months of working there as a true employee (I was an intern before). Truth is I really like what I do but I don't think I picture myself doing this forever. So the thing is, my current boss is being moved to a new team and he's very interested in getting me in his new team. It's going to be in a more business/marketing strategist position and less of operational stuff. I really love my boss and he's always trying to get me promoted and stuff. To be honest, I've been picturing my career in following a more strategic position, being more of a business analyst than a doer of tasks, but I feel very conflicted since I'm very good at operations and executing demands and I've gained some recognition from it.

Can anyone give me some advice on what should I do? Should I accept the unknown in a more strategical segment and position in which I don't really know as much as I do know in my current position. Will it look bad if I chose to abandon my current position that I am basically the best worker? I am yet so young and feel very stressed about choosing it wrongly.

1ey04a4,Got a better job offer after being promoted,"For context I am in my late 20s, and have about 5 years experience. I have been working with a large company (we‚Äôll call it company A) for about 2 and a half years. After about 1 year 9 months I was given the opportunity to join a small data analytics team that supports my old team in financial operations. I have been a part of this analytics team for about 10 months and love it. The move to the analytics team was lateral, and didn‚Äôt come with a bump in pay or title change.

I did think that I would be promoted in our companies last promotion cycle, but that never happened. The company‚Äôs compensation package is not amazing, but it is predominantly a remote position only requiring one onsite visit each week. Being pissed off with the lack of f recognition in terms of financial compensation within the new role (or even my old role) - I decided to reply to a recruiter that had reached out to me via LinkedIn.

The opportunity he presented was for a similar role at company B(combination of analytics and financial operations) with a smaller one of our competitors. Intrigued, I decided to apply and see how I got on with interviews. I had completed 3 separate interviews over the span of one month when someone at company A reached out to me to apply for a full data analyst position on their team. This team works very closely supporting the product that my old operations team uses, so I am very familiar with all team members - it was essentially mine to lose. I completed 2 interviews very quickly with that team and was ultimately offered the position within a week of the interview process to start September 1st and get a 15% increase from then - they are calling it a promotional move. I tried to negotiate more, they refused and I ultimately accepted the role as company B were very slow in progressing me to the next round (despite the recruiter telling me I am the preferred candidate).

I tried to withdraw from company B but the recruiter convinced me to do a final onsite interview with three people. It ultimately went well and I am expecting an offer in the coming days that would be in the range of 60-70% more than my current salary. The only thing is that they are moving to 4 days on site - but I think I could try to convince them to create an exception for me to 3 days as part of the offer. Their tech stack also doesn‚Äôt seem great and I reckon that I will be starting off back in excel land and minimal sql for a bit - they‚Äôve been pretty vague on what exactly they use bar these two.

The only thing is, i really like the people I work with and know my old boss will struggle to replace me on my old team and was relying on me training someone up as I move team. My new boss at company A has communicated my move to the wider department and team and has informed other applicants that they have been unsuccessful. I also know that I will be given a list of responsibility and room to learn with company A in the new role which will stand to me. 

The industry is not the biggest so I am worried that by moving to company B now would potentially burn bridges, and come across as a bit of a shitty move on my behalf. I don‚Äôt think even if I was to stay with company A that I would match the base salary that company B are offering in 5 years so I‚Äôd probably be moving in the next 2-3 anyway. Any advice?

1exzw0w,Is this a red flag comment from hiring manager? ,"I had an interview last week and hiring manager started telling me a story. It didn‚Äôt really relate to anything I said or asked so I‚Äôm not sure how it came up. 

He said someone at his company was telling a colleague frustrations they had with the organization and said colleague eventually went to HR and tattled on this person, we‚Äôll call him Jim.

Hiring manager and HR coaches his employee to go back to Jim and nudge him to talk to hiring manager directly about his concerns. This doesn‚Äôt work. Hiring manager calls Jim into his office, starts asking pointed questions, and eventually admits employee snitched on him to HR. Hiring manager fired Jim. 

Hiring manager tells me that Jim was creating a toxic workplace by isolating himself and saying negative things about the company. 

I personally am verrrryyyyy mindful who I share frustrations with at work, if anyone. But I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs toxic as most people have frustrations about their workplace and some workplaces are far worse than others. Sometimes commiseration is helpful.

It also suggested to me that Jim didn‚Äôt felt safe sharing his concerns with hiring manager which makes me wonder what type of boss he is. It‚Äôs even worse that instead of taking concerns into account, he fired Jim instead pretty much confirming his fears and suspicions.

1exzezz,My job evolved to be something that was never on the job description... How much is normal to stray from the job description?,"I started working for this organization around 9 months ago, and I was hired as a Project Manager. Most of my role is pretty straight forward, but a one large chunk of the role is working to roll out a large marketing campaign. This isn't on my job description, and it's not something that was communicated to me in the job interview around the role, but it is one of my main deliverables for the project I am managing. We have a large-ish marketing team that typically handles things like campaigns, but for some reason, my role is one of the only ones outside of marketing that is handling a marketing campaign individually. When I first saw that this was on my plate, I was surprised that the marketing team wouldn't be managing this and just looping me in when needed.

 I spent the last 9 months feeling incompetent and anxious around everything to do with the campaign, most of this stuff I've never done before and have never been trained in and was kind of ""rolling with the punches"" and asking a lot of questions to try and figure it out. I have a degree in sociology and have worked in charities, so this is all entirely unfamiliar to me and feels like I'm drowning. Although I'm told to manage the campaign (along with the company we've hired to create it, etc.), there are multiple levels of approval it needs to go through, and every move needed to be approved by our marketing team anyway. The process has been confusing and frustrating. When I do reach out to our marketing team for help, I often feel that I'm adding more work onto their plate and asking too many questions. When I've tried to speak to my manager about how I feel (in a professional way, of course), he has essentially told me that we need to keep pushing on how it's pushing on and not be afraid to rely on the marketing team for assistance. The entire thing feels really messy, and I keep thinking ""why did they not leave this job to the marketing team?"" and I just can't understand.

  
I am relatively new to the working world. This is my first real role. This leaves me feeling- is everything okay? Is this normal? It just feels extremely confusing to figure out how to essentially manage social media channels, moderate comments appropriately, ensure I'm using all the functions on the business accounts directly, ensure all translation is done, and that doesn't even involve the 9 months of work and research that went into creating the campaign in the first place.

1exwsul,Got my first ever job in 2023 - Never had any work to do since then,"This is a relatively long post. I have added a TLDR at bottom.

I'm a Software Engineer from India. I joined a popular MNC through college placement. They gave me 3 months training, out of which only 15 days had actual training, and made me full time. The training was on SAP BASIS, which I have no prior knowledge of. I requested my manager to change the training as it doesn't suit my skill set. I'm fairly proficient in ML and Data Science. I've proven my expertise to my manager in those by building a model he asked. But even then my request was denied and said that it's only WFM's (Work Force Management) responsibility and not his.

This caused me mental stress, which caused an already existing medical condition to flare up and a 6 month hospital stay. After I recovered, i found out that it's impossible for a fresher to change domain internally unless they have 1 year of experience in a project. I've also found out that any surplus hires will be allocated to SAP domain in this company, regardless of their skill set. I've been trying to get into a project since then.

But in all my interviews with project teams, they said they want people with at least 2 years of experience. So, I've been on the bench (taking pay but doing no work) ever since. I'm trying to get out and find another job but you guys know how it is in this market. It's been one year. I have no practical experience. I'm currently building an ML application, hoping it might make me stand out in interviews.

I posted about this 3 weeks ago in developersindia subreddit. I have gotten really good advice on what to do regarding my situation. I started working on improving myself in other technologies. Before two weeks, I've gotten multiple project calls. I've talked with all of them and explained my situation. Most of them said they'll provide training if required. After 5 different call like that in a week, I was very hopeful. However, there was no follow-up or update regarding those calls until yesterday. Turns out none of them wanted me because, my profile is not suitable for SAP. Shocking. But I kinda expected this and was not that much disappointed.

However, I got a call today from someone in my company informing me that I was allocated to a new role. I wasn't aware of this change. After few meetings, I got some clarification. They assigned anyone on bench for hiring assistance. Which means, I'll have to use a ATS software, screen candidates for internal projects in SAP, inform them that their profile matches the job, and forward their profiles to whoever is in-charge of me. According to them, my profile isn't suitable for SAP but I'm capable of shortlisting people for SAP roles. The irony. I don't know how, but I managed to call 14 people today. Submitted my report and just broke down. I don't even know what is the purpose of doing anything.

The cherry on the cake is, a HR called me today and said she doesn't believe my medical conditions are legit. She says no one can ever be continuously sick for more than 10 days. I submitted all the necessary medical records long before. Now she is asking me to dug them out because she wants to show them to a doctor of her choice and confirm if I was truly sick. That conversation was very depressing.

So here I am short listing people as a software engineer for roles that I'm eligible for but can't be considered for. On top of that being accused of fake medical issues by a HR. I just want to resign. I know it's not a good choice in this market, but I don't know how much of this I can take.

TLDR: Fresher in software industry with YOE = 1, has no practical experience. Assigned to short list people to do roles I'm eligible for. HR calls my medical condition fake and wants confirmation from a doctor she trusts.

I recently accepted a job offer that is with a respected corporation with an almost 60% wage increase, title increase and is a slight career shift into something with more growth opportunities. 

The problem I am having is I LOVE my current team. It is very small and I have been in the position longer than most of my teammates so I hold a lot of knowledge, so I am worried that the they are going to struggle for a bit when I leave. Additionally, my boss is taking hard earned PTO right after my end date and I was going to be the point person for my team and cross functional partners while she is out.

I was able to get a start date 3 weeks out so I have the ability to give them a little more time but I am also burnt out and want to be able to take a week off to start my new job fresh.

1exvji2,Should I accept this new job offer or keep my current one?,"Title. I am currently working as a retail associate at Ross and need to make a decision. I was initially accepted as a temporary employee during the summer and have been offered the chance to stay as a permanent one. However, one job at a souvenir shop in a casino in the Las Vegas strip offered me a position there with an extra dollar an hour (I get paid $14 at Ross). 

However, I am having doubts of accepting the position. 
- 1st, even though I would be working at a more prestigious place, the commute* would be worse. 
- 2nd, I am already well established in Ross,have my work rhythm, and get along relatively well with my coworkers. I would be starting over from zero without knowing how it could possibly go down. 
- 3rd, I will possibly be more exposed to smoke and other hazards that are in a big casino that aren‚Äôt present at Ross. 
- Lastly, there isn‚Äôt much of a change in terms of benefits. The only big ones are getting paid a dollar an hour more and free parking (which I won‚Äôt really make use of since I don‚Äôt have a car yet, hope to get it this year). No real difference besides that.

My commute*: Currently, I take the bus to go towards the strip from home. It usually takes me around 40 or 50 minutes to get the strip, followed by a 15 minute walk to Ross. The other job is up north, so I would be taking two buses instead of one. That commute would be an hour and a half, possibly.

1exv3pi,Fake Boss,"I‚Äôve been working as a teller for a little over a year now, worked 7 months at one company and moved over to a different company after we got a new boss at Company One who was emotionally toxic and essentially dismantled the whole team. After i left Company One, all nine of the other team members left shortly after. Now I‚Äôve been with Company Two for over three months, and when i started it was amazing. Good hours, decent pay, friendly team. My boss was very friendly and chatty, even helped me find a place to live after I went through a horrible breakup. The thing is, recently I‚Äôve been feeling like there‚Äôs kind of a double standard. We‚Äôre allowed to be on our phones at work, but not allowed to read books. Which is whatever, but also i consider being on our phones to look much more unprofessional compared to books. But anyways. My boss has been critiquing my work a bit more recently, where she‚Äôs pointed out that I should count my money a way that she prefers (nothing is wrong with how i count, as i count underhanded and she counts overhanded). She‚Äôs told me that I shouldn‚Äôt be on my phone when there‚Äôs people in the lobby, yet when our manager (one step below boss) spent ten minutes blatantly ignoring a customer because she was on her phone, nothing happens. My boss at one point invited me out with her and her family, and implied that the event we went to was mandatory. So of course i went. The whole time, it felt like she was trying to get me to talk with her son, almost like she was trying to set us up. Even told me how her son thinks i‚Äôm pretty, that they‚Äôve talked about me at family dinner. A few weeks later, she came up to me and said ‚Äúi was never trying to set you and my son up, it would never work. You‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ way too different and I wouldn‚Äôt want that, at all.‚Äù so i said ‚Äúokay good, cause i literally just broke up with my ex, and im not ready for a relationship.‚Äù and since then, my boss has been kind of‚Ä¶ weird. Like, as if I did something wrong. Idk maybe it‚Äôs all in my head but I don‚Äôt know how to deal with my boss. The thing is I will be renting from one of her family members, and I worry that if my boss doesn‚Äôt like me, that could jeopardize my living situation. I just come to work and do my job to the best of my abilities, I usually journal instead of being on my phone now, and I don‚Äôt engage in small talk with anyone except two of my coworkers. I thought I‚Äôd found my dream job, but now because of my boss, I‚Äôm considering just packing up and leaving. I don‚Äôt really want to do that though because I enjoy the actual work that i do, and plus finding another job can be a long process.

1exuyty,Reminder: know how the match for your 401k works!,"I just wanted to clarify something about matches as someone that works at a 401k provider. Earlier today there was a post by u/TheDisagreeArrow where they claimed that a 50% match on 6% would be worth 6% of their salary. They also thought that employer matches counted toward employee contributions. The person blocked me after I told them this was wrong so I am unable to explain why on that comment thread.

So, why is this wrong?

1. The IRS says that employer matches don't count as employee contributions.

2. A 50% match up to 6% of salary will always mean 50 cents for every dollar you contribute up to 6% of your salary. The ""up to 6% of your salary"" refers to your contributions they will match, not the dollar amount they are giving as a match. So in this plan, which is a super common one, if your pay was $100k they would match half of your contributions until you had contributed over $6k.

PLEASE people, read the plan documents in-full and utilize resources like Investopedia and the IRS website.

It was not mentioned but special attention should also be given to the vesting schedule. Some matches might not vest for a while especially if they are super good matches.

1exuleb,Would it be uncouth to reach out to an old coworker to see why I did not get called?,"So this requires a bit of a background here:

From Jan 2023-Dec 2023 I took a temp job covering for someone. The best way to describe the work is service related, but in a semi-public institution. So think union, bureaucracy, etc, but in a role that provides stakeholders service. I LOVED the job. I got excellent reviews. One of my coworkers, who was the most senior coworker, just adored me. But being temporary, I sought other permanent employment. I got a permanent gig elsewhere, in a different city doing something very different. But I wished, and had expressed my desire, to pursue a career in the service related job.

Since I left my old coworkers would reach out every month to see how I was doing. We were on great terms. I even got a motion of appreciation award 5 months after I left. 

Two weeks ago I saw the old job posted, but this time permanent. The person I was covering for left for something else. I reached out to a couple of coworkers to ask if anyone internal was applying, to which they answered not to their knowledge. The senior coworker was on vacation.  I sent them an email expressing my desire to apply, but obviously did not get a response because they were on vacation.

The job posting closed Sunday night. They ideally wanted the candidate to start their duties August 26th. I applied last Thursday and clearly outlined in my cover letter that I could move back and start on short notice at a time that works best for them. 

Given that they want a candidate to start ASAP, I honestly thought they would call on Monday. Monday came and went, Tuesday has come and gone, and now it is approaching mid day Wednesday. I think that it is more or less a certainty that I will not even be getting a call for an interview...

I know that I really want this job, and that maybe that is clouding my reasoning on this. However, I am floored for the following reasons:

1) I got nothing but glowing reviews. Was told several times during my tenure there that they wished they could keep me but they couldn't afford two of that position. Got an award for my service several months after I left. No performance issues to speak of - and I would always ask for feedback on that front as well. Nothing but positive feedback.

2) I know for a fact that I am the only candidate with direct experience. It is a very specialized role, and over the past 20 years there have only been three people who have been in it - the person I was covering, someone who retired 5 years ago, and me. They would have to train someone else for several months up to a year. They would not have to train me. 

3) I made it very clear in my cover letter that I could start on extremely short notice at a time that worked best for them. I made it very clear that I still have a residence in that city and that moving would not be an issue on short notice. 

Not even a phone call is just really perplexing me and it is making me really question things. I honestly cannot understand why. Especially since they evidently did not have an internal candidate - and even if they did that person would absolutely not have direct experience. 

I am on very good terms with the senior coworker who would be the one training for that position. So my questions to the crowd:

1) Would it be uncouth to reach out to them to inquire what is going on?

2) If it would not be uncouth, what would be a tactful way to bring this up?

1exuc19,"How to change career in mid 30s?  Feeling defeated, and hopeless.","Im almost in my mid 30s, and my motivation/will to work is almost completely gone.  It seems like if you‚Äôre not intelligent, or don‚Äôt have any idea wtf you want to do in life, it‚Äôs going to be a life full of just barely getting by and shitty jobs.

I‚Äôve been working physical labor jobs most of my life.  From 18-28 years old, working up to 70 hours wasn‚Äôt uncommon for me.  I loved getting the extra money and staying busy.  I currently work as a Shift Lead Material Handler, and have been quiet quitting for the past year or so.  Ever since they gave me this lead position, they‚Äôve given me shit workers.  Drug addicts, kids fresh out of high school who couldn‚Äôt handle their weed, and stared at their phone all day.  And during this most recent busy season, I had no help , and had to do the work of 3 people for almost a year now.  I don‚Äôt ever want to lead again.  People are too stupid and unpredictable, and my patience is thinning the older I get.

The real problem is, I don‚Äôt know what I even want to do for work.  I don‚Äôt want to do this physically intensive work any longer.  I‚Äôm tired of being physically exhausted, and not having energy outside of work, all while destroying my body and breathing all sorts of dust and god knows what.  I went to college for Sociology/Psychology, but have no interest in pursuing either.  I only went because I felt pressured by adults who told me I‚Äôd be homeless if I didn‚Äôt ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Most jobs I see posted in my area have lower pay than I‚Äôm getting, which doesn‚Äôt work because rent/CoL keeps going up, and I can‚Äôt move right now, while I‚Äôm helping out with my parents.  My rent has gone up more the last year, than I‚Äôve gotten in combined raises for the last two years‚Ä¶

I guess my question is, are there any careers that pay well in entry level, that don‚Äôt require leadership positions to make decent wages, and have a decent amount of advancement, and aren‚Äôt customer service?  Ideally I‚Äôd like a well paying job, where I work by myself, and don‚Äôt have to kill my body everyday.  I don‚Äôt want to sit all day either, and would like to have a variety of tasks.  I hate doing the same thing every day, over and over‚Ä¶

Sorry for the rant.

1exu8ig,Legitimacy of losing my job (possible) ,"I'm having some job security anxiety lately. I work at a place that requires a drivers license. When I applied and got hired, I didnt have one. I was upfront about it at the interview and even knowing that, they still hired me. When I got hired there was 2 others who didn't have a license, and a year after me working here they hired another person without a license. The deal was, we weren't allowed to drive cars since our job wasn't driving intense. Recently, the place has been going through some changes. My team was given some new job responsibilities and some of the things we've been responsible for has been stripped away.(basically my job just became a lot more redundant since most of the time I'm sitting around, doing nothing, waiting to move a car). I was told, over text by a coworker that the boss(verbally) told her he expects those of us without a drivers license to get it ""within the next month"". Which gave me a heck ton of anxiety. Going from never driving a car on the road to suddenly having to learn to drive in a month is terrifying. I was also given permission to move cars around but only in the parking lots and not on the road, until i pass the test. Anyways, I managed to practice and scheduled an on the road test and take it....but I failed by a few points. Now I have to wait for another test to be available, let alone have the money to pay for it. And im scared im going to get fired. 

Things that are sort of saving my mind on this matter: 
1) They KNEW I didn't have a license when they hired me
2) I dont have any other reason that would call for me being fired. I AM trying to get a license, things are just backed up at all locations at the moment. 
3) I haven't heard anything about a drivers license from management since that day i was told I needed to get it soon. (2 months ago now)
4) if some of us were to be let go, they would be understaffed for sure.(not that a lot of places care about this anyways)

Things that are scaring me
1) my state is an ""at will"" state. So I guess me boss doesn't really need a reason to fire me. 
2) him giving me permission to drive cars around the lot without a license is surely a liability issue and I don't know how to feel about it. 
3) I'm scared I'm being looked at as lazy but they took a lot of the teams responsibilities away so we really don't have a lot to do on really slow days. 

I guess what I'm asking is: can I get fired for not having a drivers license if they knew I didn't have one when I applied and they still hired me?

1extpj0,Intern to FT employee,"I am getting a two-year degree in architectural drafting and this summer I got a fantastic opportunity to intern at an engineering firm -- this was not the path I initially thought I'd go down but now that I'm here I see the potential and I want to stay in this industry.  

My internship ended after 10 weeks but now I'm working as needed doing only billable work until my last term begins in September. This job has been incredibly supportive and I've learned so much -- I really like everything about this company and I feel comfortable here. It's also hybrid -- I have an office to go to that caters meals but they also dont mind if I want to be 100% remote -- which is perfect for the inconsistent work I get right now.

Since I have no set plan for the future I've continued to apply for opportunities that I'm qualified for -- and because of this internship, I look very qualified. I now have THREE job interviews for FT positions in a similar field and while I'm not trying to get the horse before the cart, I do have questions about how to move forward without burning bridges.

1.  I want to be upfront about my PT availability. My portfolio and resume both state that I'm finishing my last term so they have set up interviews knowing I'm still in school. I feel like transparency is so important but I dont want to jump the gun -- I also dont know their WFH policy. When do I bring all this up? I kinda want to get my foot in the door (or past the phone screening.)

2. The two jobs I'm interviewing for on Friday pay significantly more -- up to 75% more. (I did the math) I know lots of people say go for the money but I'm just starting out. If something were to progress and I'm offered a role with much more pay -- I could potentially be losing the support systems I've created at my current internship. I'm already making more money than I ever have in my life but a 75% increase would be life-changing.  I need to have support and a good point person until I get comfortable in my career -- is it ok to ask about this?

My program is really great but I dont think a lot of people think about going into this adjacent field. I think I hit a home run landing this internship so as far as entry-level people who know my trade, I think I got an advantage with my summer experience. I just want to know how to navigate this so I'm not walking away from a supportive job but I'm also making good money. Of course, I have no offer letter from my current job and have no idea what/if they will offer me. I did see a junior position with 5 years experience at my current company that's offering 12/hr more than I current make but it's still $5/hr less than what the job i'm interviewing is offering.

Any advice on how to navigate these big interviews would be helpful. One is meeting with several members of the team and one is a phone screening. (if that helps!) I feel like I can talk a pretty good game because of my little experience but I'm still new and have so much to learn -- so I dont want to get in over my head and lose a good situation.

1extop1,Best course of action to pivot careers or roles.,"Hi folks, 

I wanted to get some advice on the best course of action to pivot. I currently, and for the last 3 years have been working in digital marketing. Helping small businesses show up more on Google. I never went to school for that. I was applying to jobs and the opportunity was presented. Before that i worked as an operations manager for buy sell trade stores. Helping with inventory, training buyers, learning trends etc.. i have always wanted to go into buying. I resigned in March due to burnout, had a few stressed induced seizures, and company structure. I thought i was creating strategies and campaigns for businesses to increase their visibility. Turned out to be a sales role where they only really cared about the amount of products you can add to the stack and prevent them from canceling services. 

I lost my way to survive. But i really want to get back into the fashion work and specifically merchandising roles. I have the experience however it‚Äôs not as current. 

My question is what would  you do if you wanted to pivot into a different role. I didn‚Äôt get my bachelors which seems to be very much needed in this role. I am currently in the process of getting it at WGU online while i find something temp to pay the bills.

1exs3n6,40k dollar pay-cut for career transition into sales from UX Research,"Hey, all I'm currently making about $120000 at my UX research job. This has been my career since graduating about 4 years ago. I work about 10 hours a week, and there's no job growth, it's slow. It's dead-end. The work is very boring and not fulfilling at all. I don't get to use my personality and the role is completely remote. I'm completely burnt out and checked out, but the market has been so brutal I can't get anything else and truthfully I don't want to get another research job.

Most people would kill for a job like this, no?

So tell me, is it completely brain dead to throw this role away, for a sales role making 40k dollars less in salary (~10k dollars less including potential commission) for significant opportunity of upwards mobility, more job opportunities in general, and more opportunities to work in sectors that are interesting?

1exrfsz,Lost and Confused: What's Next for a Fresh Grad? ,"
Hey everyone,

I am a recent graduate of BS Management Accounting with some experience in the BPO industry. I am currently facing a significant career crossroads and seeking guidance.

I have been offered the opportunity to pursue the CMA certification and subsequently law school. While the CMA seems promising, the financial implications are substantial, and I am hesitant to rely on someone else's investment. Law school, on the other hand, does not align with my current interests.

I've been applying to jobs like crazy, but most of them seem to be BPO stuff. I'm not against BPO, but I'm worried about getting stuck in that rut. I've even thought about moving abroad and becoming a caregiver.

I have no idea what to do! Any advice or personal experiences would be super helpful. Thanks in advance!

1exrcb1,How do I deal with feeling like I‚Äôm being treated unfairly at work? ,"I work at a fairly good company with good benefits and I get compensated decently. I hold a marketing position on a lean team, and I‚Äôve been feeling plain ignored for a while. I‚Äôm at a point in my career where I need to learn and grow and eventually move on to something new so I can pursue a different but related career path. I was mislead into my position, mostly because my job was originally one position that got split into two. I thought this job would be good exposure for me and even picked it over another slightly less paying role in another more prestigious company because I thought it would challenge me in a good way and allow me to be more creative in my assigned role. Instead I feel like I glorified intern, and my counterpart (we hold literally the same title), gets 85% of the work load while I get given the rest of the less that no one seems to want. I can‚Äôt tell if my boss dislikes me or if she‚Äôs just a poor manager and this is unfair/bad distribution of labor, and when I do get given a good work opportunity, my managers will redo all my work to a point where it‚Äôs impossible for me to distinguish it as my own. Ever since I‚Äôve joined, I‚Äôve found that I can‚Äôt figure out what I‚Äôve been hired for, I‚Äôm being paid for my time but I spend a majority of my time at the office not even really having much to do, but I hardly feel like a part of the team. I get less than fulfilling grunt work that no one else cares about, my hands are tied on all my potentially creative projects because they‚Äôre not decisions I‚Äôm allowed to make at my low level position, my coworkers and immediate team are all ‚Äònice‚Äô but I feel like the most expendable individual on the team. Even after expressing to my manager several times (even spinning it in a positive way), that I‚Äôm looking to do more and contribute more, she agrees in the moment and then nothing changes. Rehash repeat. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve expressed it multiple times and been met with dismissal. My two other coworkers somewhat at my level on the team get multiple 1x1 meetings with my boss, most are 1 hour long, while I only get one meeting that lasts 30mins or gets cancelled. And just idk if it‚Äôs favouritism or all in my head, but I feel really left out on both a professional and personal level. Like a barnacle on the hull of the boat rather than a part of the crew. 

They won‚Äôt even pay for me to learn new skills so I could better contribute, though they throw the notion around all the time. Honestly this post needs way more context so I can more accurately explain all the specific instances that have led to me feeling this way, but I don‚Äôt want to write you guys a dissertation. Should I stay in the job and just ride it out and do my best and make the most of it? It is a great job asides from the fact that it feels like I could vanish for 3 weeks and it would impact nothing. I want to do well in my career, even if I don‚Äôt love any job that I do.

Eventually my financial situation got bad so I had to accept the first job offer that I got, which was for a job designing solar PV systems.

From what I've read, it seems like these design jobs don't require an engineering degree generally and focus less on analysis and design and are more or less jobs plugging stuff into software and then modifying the end result to suit the customer need. Basically, a job that doesn't actually require an engineering degree nor would an prospective future engineer benefit from.

I apply to jobs that fall within my skillset (I have 8 years of e-commerce and logistics experience, worked with Walmart in their warehouse in various of positions and promotions) and a year of legal assistance experience. 

I update and tweak my resume all the time to see if theres different keywords to use, i paid for a 'professional' to update my resume, I had my friend's boyfriend who worked as a recruiter for years change my resume and yet I'm still being rejected for basic warehouse positions and office positions that are either about what i was doing before or levels lower than what I was doing. 

Im currently working at a law firm, which I would have thought would look good on my resume after so 8 years of working in a warehouse and that it would show I can do more than just warehouse work (even though the work I was doing there was not the basic grunt labor and more of the technical side). I got this job after the layoffs that happened at Walmart and the new schedule that Sam's club offered me was not gonna work with daycare at all, but it took me 3 years of basically job applying monthly (I knew I wanted to leave before the layoffs but NEVER got an offer for a job) 

I know its probably not personal, all the rejections, but BOY it really feels personal when I open my email every morning and see more rejections coming in.

1exq536,Need Advice on Choosing Between Two Job Offers?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm a fresher and stuck between two job offers in AI/ML. I could use some advice! Here‚Äôs the rundown:

# Job 1:

* **Training:**¬†3 months (with stipend)
* **Salary:**¬†‚Çπ15,000/month (goes up to ‚Çπ21,000 in Year 2)
* **Bond:**¬†‚Çπ50,000 with last semester's marksheet ( 2 year )
* **Distance:**¬†4 km from home
* **Hours:**¬†10 am - 7:30 pm (fixed)
* **Leaves:**¬†12 paid

# Job 2:

* **Training:**¬†6 months (unpaid)
* **Salary Range:**¬†‚Çπ12,500 - ‚Çπ31,250/month (up to ‚Çπ39,000 in Year 2, based on performance)
* **Bond:**¬†‚Çπ1,00,000 ( 2.6 year )
* **Distance:**¬†9 km from home
* **Hours:**¬†10 am - 7 pm (flexible after training)
* **Leaves:**¬†18 paid (with leave encashment)

# Concerns:

* After training, there‚Äôs a chance I might not even get the job in Job 2.
* in Job 2 I got Salary info from others who interviewed with HR because HR on the phone is not providing any info, and not even scheduling for the HR round for some of us.
* Not financially stable, so breaking a ‚Çπ1 lakh bond is a no-go but can manage 6 months with no stipend.
* In Job 1, I might get stuck with a low salary and may not be able to leave after 2 years if the job market is tight.",youyoi,1,1.0,0,1724248193,2024-08-21 13:49:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1exq536/need_advice_on_choosing_between_two_job_offers/,8,2024
1exq4bk,Does circling back to a job you left ever work? ,"I worked as a sales tax auditor for my state department of revenue and left after 6 months. Below I will list the reasons I left and the reasons why I feel like I could go back. I suspect they would allow me to come back because I left on good terms and they are always desperate for auditors.

Reasons I left

1. Burnt out from training 3 months straight staying in hotels and driving back home on the weekends
2. Micromanager for a boss who was rude and didn't know how to speak politely to people
3. I'm introverted and dealing with taxpayers stressed me out as well as giving them bad news (owing money) was awkward

Reasons I feel it would be better if I went back

1. Recovered from burnout and I feel they would maybe make me redo 1 month of training, not re do all 3 months
2.  I would know what to expect this time, going into something blindly is always stressful and know I would already be prepared
3. I've worked in public accounting the last 9 months and gained a lot of experience and confidence that I feel helps me in the position. I hated auditing people  feeling like I had no idea what I was doing or talking about and it gave me anxiety feeling like I would be asked questions I didn't know the answer to. I feel that the first time around I was like a meek little mouse but now I would assert myself better.  

The main reason I want to go back is because I live in a LCOL area with horrible wages so I would like to go back for the pay and benefits. 

Has going back to a job you left ever worked out? Any advice appreciated? ",popcorn_boss,1,1.0,1,1724248138,2024-08-21 13:48:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1exq4bk/does_circling_back_to_a_job_you_left_ever_work/,8,2024

1exnkc1,Stick to current startup or join a public company ,"TL;DR: Stuck between staying at my current fintech startup with a toxic CTO but a loyal founder friend or joining a fast-growing public company with a dynamic role and better ESOPs but a lower salary. What would you do?

I'm based in India and currently lead the product team at a fintech startup in its early stages (Series A). I have around 9 years of experience, including a successful exit from my previous startup, so my background is pretty dynamic.

Right now, I‚Äôm earning about $50K annually, plus stock options. However, the ESOPs are basically paper money for the next 4-5 years at best. I‚Äôm starting to hate the work environment here, especially because the current CTO is incredibly toxic, frequently blaming me for delays and issues that are actually his own fault. The founders, unfortunately, don‚Äôt have a strong tech background, so they aren‚Äôt able to intervene effectively and often just tell us to ""sort it out.""

To make things more complicated, the founder is a good friend and has been pleading with me to stay. He‚Äôs promised to replace the CTO once he finds the right person. On the other hand, I‚Äôve got a job offer from a startup that went public last year and is experiencing rapid growth. The offer is about 10% less in terms of salary, but it includes a significant amount of ESOPs. Since the company is publicly traded, these options aren‚Äôt just paper money‚Äîbut the catch is that I can only sell them after completing 4 years with the company. The role itself is in the founder's office, so it would be pretty dynamic, which I like.

I‚Äôm struggling to decide on the way forward, so I‚Äôm here on Reddit to hear some opinions. What would you do if you were in my place?

Recently, I was offered a position in an international company. It is a company that provides FinTech services to banks and processing centers in different countries (almost worldwide).

Pros:

* It pays 95% more than I am getting now.
* It has annual bonuses based on KPIs. It reaches up to 2x of the offered salary.
* It is remote.
* The head of the regional project management office is a person that I know and communicate with.
* It has advantageous medical insurance coverage.
* They buy you a laptop.
* I will end up learning and comprehending ISO, VISA, and MASTERCARD standards.

  
Cons:

* Systems are very sophisticated.
* I have to pass 3 exams during my first year of employment. 2 general knowledge exams, and 1 technical exam based on their systems.
* I must also legally confirm that my English is at least at the C1 level.
* I have to be visiting their HQ for a month in another country. (Everything covered by the employer).
* I have no idea about the ethical and social environment there.



This info sums it up pretty well. I will add more points if I remember anything worth mentioning. 

  
I was not planning on leaving my current workplace (bank) because everything was fairly fine.

On-site job.

Above average salary.

Good social and ethical environment.

So, I would love to get an external insight into this situation. Because another perspective can be helpful. 

  
FYI, I'm 24. If that matters.

1exlik9,First time being fired!,"I‚Äôm 22, just graduated a few months ago. I started working at an education company and my job is to half teach English and half write private school applications. There is a three month probation period and I was just told I didn‚Äôt pass the probation period.

On points that I felt they were fair about, I am often lethargic and have been found sleeping on my desk for five minutes. I felt that was a fair enough reason; you‚Äôre not meant to sleep on the job. They asked why I was performing like this and if anything is going on in my personal life - which there is, my personal life is a mess right now and I try not to let it affect me, but it does. I‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt pry further.

They also asked why I wasn‚Äôt being punctual, but I have never come in late. I started out with a work time of 10-7, and have never come in later than 10. I would leave at 7 on the dot until colleagues asked me why I wasn‚Äôt going at 6:30 when everyone else had left, so I started going along with that. A few weeks later, my boss tells me that my office hours have shifted from 9:30-6:30; I wrote this down on a sticky note immediately after she said it, and I‚Äôve never been to the office later than 9:30 since she said it. I should say that it is encouraged that you come in an hour to half an hour earlier than stated and that most people do, but I don‚Äôt do this often since it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre paying me overtime. Otherwise I‚Äôve never been late.

My boss asked me later if I was supposed to be 9-6, and because I wrote it down so quickly after she said it I highly doubt that this was what I was told. Maybe that part is a misunderstanding.

You are allowed to leave earlier if you come in earlier, and most people leave en masse by six, so I‚Äôve been historically peer pressured into following but began staying until 6:30 once I was told by a friend that I was probably being watched. Leaving early is my fault, I get that. But it was extremely confusing.

The main reason though, I believe, and also the other main reason they gave me, was that they didn‚Äôt feel like I was trying hard enough to meet the standards for writing. I‚Äôve always had good feedback on my teaching, but they‚Äôve never liked my writing. I don‚Äôt feel like this part was fair: they were happy with my applications until one of the higher ups decided she had a problem with me and began pointing out ‚Äògrammatical mistakes‚Äô in my essays where there genuinely weren‚Äôt any. They would advise me not to write too complicated, then when I simplified it they would tell me my vocabulary was not good enough. The comments were always rude and unprofessional, never constructive, so I never knew what to fix. It was not possible to please them, but I tried very hard, I would comb the whole essay for any errors and tried to take on board what they said, even if I disagreed. 

I‚Äôm trying not to think too much; jobs come and jobs go. There was simply a lot of miscommunication and the working environment is notoriously toxic in this company with a very high turnover rate. However, with my father‚Äôs health problems, recent retirement, parents divorce, mounting fees I need to help them pay, etc, I am very stressed out.

1exlc97,Career coach/counselor/mentor? Help!  ,"
I am looking for some advice. I have an MS and I work at a nonprofit completely unrelated to my interests and the job is so unfulfilling and slowly eating away at my soul. I started looking for jobs 1/23 and this was the only one I landed. I‚Äôve been applying ever since and have never been offered another position. 

On top of it, I feel like I need some direction on what path to even choose at this point in my career. Do I need more schooling? How to i pick between interests and making money? I need some real guidance. 

Due to being deeply depressed by endless application rejection and wasted time in multiple round interviews, I have paused my search. I‚Äôve had to go to therapy and she suggested seeking professional career guidance. I would like to potentially put some time and energy into finding someone to guide me through my next moves and overall picture. 

Do I needed a career coach, a career counselor, or a mentor? How do I get one and know they‚Äôre legit? How much do they cost?  I don‚Äôt have much money to spend, so I can‚Äôt try out a million people.  If I had a job with enough money, I wouldn‚Äôt need help. But, I‚Äôm taking this very seriously ! I‚Äôve tried networking on LinkedIn and asking people to connect, but I‚Äôm always ignored. Networking always fails for me. Even messaging alums about job opportunities fails, I still always get passed up, and often becuase they choose someone they know.

Fast forward a year exactly later. My gf lost the baby through miscarriage. 

We are now at another team offsite and the exercise is framed ‚Äúyour values from last year may have changed‚Äù
  
The person beside me goes first. He shares: ‚Äúmy wife is pregnant so family is my top value‚Äù and I just feel so sad. 

I asked my boss (who knows about the miscarriage) if I could step out and not participate as this is bringing up things I‚Äôm not ready to discuss with work people.

1exjthg,"Finally received a job offer, but something about it feels terrible or am i being dramatic","For context: I have been job searching since February and graduated college this past December. I accepted a part-time job in April that I am feeling pretty good about, it is not great hours and pay but for the moment I still have some help from my family for the foreseeable future. I also get bonuses for signing up new members, so an extra hundred or two a month is nice. But, it is giving me experience in a sector I would not mind working in, as well as allowing me to volunteer under operations for a nonprofit organization where I am learning about entry-level non profit skills.

Anyways, after many rejections and not making it to second interviews for jobs, I have finally received a full-time job offer now, but it is in an industry I have no interest in pursuing (logistics and shipping) and the managers candidly told me it was stressful due to a high volume of orders. It is an office job, and they gave me the job offer only two hours after my second interview. The pay is hourly with two weeks PTO and two weeks sick pay and Fridays are half days. Something about this job doesn't sit right with me, but it would be a lot more money than I am making right now and is the only offer I have gotten in months and the hours are pretty good. Granted, there is a lot more effort I could be putting into the search right now, that I am committed to doing if I reject the offer. When I think about working there, I just feel dread, and can imagine myself just being exhausted all the time since I am sensitive due to a high volume of monotonous and repetitive work in an office that looks very depressing. I have experience from a few gigs in college doing monotonous data entry and I wanted to rip my hair out.

1exjrh4,Stay with my current employer or leave him high and dry? ,"Unsure if this is the right place to leave this, but I'm needing an outside opinion. 

I work at a medical office and I just hit five years. My boss is great. I make good money, super laid back, doesn't feel like a 9-5 (Even tho it is + in a windowless building) never a dreadful day of work. I work in another building but the office is in it's own area. Small so the atmosphere is never negative. I get raved on by patients and my boss for being superb at my job and I genuinely enjoy what I do.
Before working at my boss' practice, for years I watched his kids, house/dog sat - that was until the end of 2023 when his wife had felt I invaded her privacy for a reason I'm still unaware of!! She's disliked me ever since.
Today my boss calls me after I lock up the office to casually mention per his wife and a happy life, he's gotta let me go BUT he needs me to stay for another month until WE find ME a replacement.
I guess his wife thought I had no longer worked there and my boss never mentioned it. How I understood this abrupt, unfinished call - she had found out in a taken a back way, a toll on their marriage. To me, it seems like I maybe was a common topic and there was some distrust finding out months later.


I‚Äôm obviously understanding marriage comes first, no matter the situation but I‚Äôm unsure what to do. I loved my job, it sucks because of why I‚Äôm being let go.   
Im wondering is it wack of me to stay through the next month just because he needs time to 
1. Find someone who meshes well 
2. Im needed to train a replacement
All the while knowing I‚Äôm being fired for a personal matter and not because of my physical work life??? 

I know there‚Äôs room for interpretation not sharing all the details but I‚Äôm also wanting to avoid getting too specific in case anyone in my life happens upon it :s 
I don‚Äôt know what conversations have happened behind closed doors between the two, but I know I‚Äôve never crossed a line, not even come close. 

Long story short. Do I (26F) stay at my current job of five years on a ticking time bomb to ensure he (58M) is still able to run daily operations? Or should I stand up for myself -while still being polite and professional- and leave at the end of the pay period ( 8/31 ) knowing the office will 100% be in shambles.

1exjpus,"Finally received a job offer, but working there feels dreadful","For context: I have been job searching since February and graduated college this past December. I accepted a part-time job in April that I am feeling pretty good about, it is not great hours and pay but for the moment I still have some help from my family for the foreseeable future. I also get bonuses for signing up new members, so an extra hundred or two a month is nice. But, it is giving me experience in a sector I would not mind working in, as well as allowing me to volunteer under operations for a nonprofit organization where I am learning about entry-level non profit skills.

Anyways, after many rejections and not making it to second interviews for jobs, I have finally received a full-time job offer now, but it is in an industry I have no interest in pursuing (logistics and shipping) and the managers candidly told me it was stressful due to a high volume of orders. It is an office job, and they gave me the job offer only two hours after my second interview. The pay is hourly with two weeks PTO and two weeks sick pay and Fridays are half days. Something about this job doesn't sit right with me, but it would be a lot more money than I am making right now and is the only offer I have gotten in months and the hours are pretty good. Granted, there is a lot more effort I could be putting into the search right now, that I am committed to doing if I reject the offer. When I think about working there, I just feel dread, and can imagine myself just being exhausted all the time since I am sensitive due to a high volume of monotonous and repetitive work in an office that looks very depressing. I have experience from a few gigs in college doing monotonous data entry and I wanted to rip my hair out.

1exjabt,Is a Political Science degree worth it?,"I'm going to university in the fall next year, and after that, I plan on taking the LSAT to get into law school and become a lawyer. Through research, I found that having a Political Science major/degree is considered the safest choice to prepare me for law school. However, I have seen other people online expressing their opinions on how the choice of major/degree will not majorly affect the path to Law school since the LSAT scores and your grades during university are the determining factors in getting into law school. I have also seen advice from other people who graduated with a Social Sciences degree who say that it's extremely difficult to find a job or get a stable career with their major (such as Political Science, Philosophy, or Psychology). 

Though my main goal is to get into law school, I still want to be prepared for whatever happens, like if I change my mind and not take LSAT. However, I'm not sure I will be assured of a job if I graduate without going into law school. 

What is the best major can take? Is pursuing a Political Science degree worth it? How should I go to university with the assurance that I'll have a stable career with or without law school?

I'm a 23-year-old female who completed my Honors in English Literature in 2022. I briefly pursued my Masters but dropped out after 4 months. Since then, I've been focusing on preparing for civil services and SSC exams. However, I'm starting to feel the need for a backup plan to enhance my job prospects.

Some key considerations for me:

- Flexibility to balance with exam prep
- Relevance to the job market
- Affordable fees
- Recognition and accreditation

1exhpjy,What should I do about my new job‚Äôs training?,"So I work in furniture sales, I just started my new job this month and technically only have been actively working for 7 days there, I‚Äôve had a day off due to not being able to leave the bathroom, then I had to take a weekend off that was planned before I started this job, we also had really bad weather which made us close one of the days. So I‚Äôm a little behind on the training currently, which is fine, they said it didn‚Äôt really matter as much (days off) because it‚Äôs just the training. 

So basically, they‚Äôve been training me by role playing and having me memorize the different parts of recliners (they‚Äôre a recliner based furniture store,but they carry so much more), and I have to memorize some other things. I‚Äôve also been looking through papers to learn. Outside of that, the training hasn‚Äôt been the best. My one manager is honestly kind of rude when he trains, but the SM has even been there while he‚Äôs training. It‚Äôs not necessarily what the man is saying, just HOW he says it & his facial expressions too. Again, I‚Äôve only been actively working for a week now, they‚Äôve put me out onto the floor to start engaging with customers and start selling them. Their process is really big, I don‚Äôt have it all the way down. I don‚Äôt have all the information down to give customers. I feel like everything being thrown at me at once has really taken a toll on being able to memorize ALL important information & is causing a big stressor. 

How do I tell them that I‚Äôm not ready to be on the floor engaging with customers & that I definitely shouldn‚Äôt be closing with 1 person, being forced into something I‚Äôm not comfortable with yet? They only require 2 closers. They never asked if I was ready to start taking customers, they said ‚Äúyou get the next‚Äù, I thought it was maybe just to get me comfy, but now I‚Äôm seeing that it‚Äôs an expectation without them getting a feel for where I am due to the schedule saying I close with 1 person on multiple days. However, they should KNOW where I am in training, they are the managers afterall. They have been a short staffed location (4 people actively there, 1 helping a different location), but i don‚Äôt think that would be an excuse to rush my training, regardless of missing a couple days. Training shouldn‚Äôt be rushed & managers definitely shouldn‚Äôt be rude during it if they‚Äôre trying to create success & employees wanting to stay. I just don‚Äôt know really how to confront this and there not be any negatives. I don‚Äôt wanna be the person who comes in & just starts complaining, but I don‚Äôt want to be taken advantage of & out of my comfort zone unless IM ready to be out of it ya know ? 

Side note - I worked in a furniture store before this one for 4 years & nobody new could start helping customers until their training was completely done & they took a quiz which can take weeks, at minimum 2 weeks usually. I understand it‚Äôs a different store (a lot LESS information you needed to grasp, pretty simple and straightforward, so I feel that speaks alone), but very rare do you go anywhere & not have complete or mostly done training before you can start the actual job.

1exh1uj,Business or Engineering?,"So I(19m) am going into my sophomore year of college and switched my major but am narrowing down on Business(Informations systems/Business Analytics) or Engineering(Mechanical). I am currently at a university that does not offer engineering so I am looking to transfer this fall. Overall, I feel that I would want to pursue something I have passion in and engineering does seem like the best route. However, I am not sure about my math skills/level to if I would even be able to make it through undergrad so it is really stressful for me. Work life balance is really important to me and I feel that engineering although very tough will be more bearable career wise because it is more reliant on ability/knowledge than what seems like mental labor(business), along with my passion towards it.
On the flip side, I also have an interest in Business Analytics and I know I will be good at it and have a better time in undergrad. I took business classes and the material comes easier to me and is easier overall. I am not much of a people person and am a little introverted, but the social aspect and confidence in the courses makes the major look more attractive in that aspect. It feels more practical and realistic to me and something I could do well in.

1exgd50,I feel like I am overlooked and not treated fairly at work.  Long post!,"I have been with my current company for 3 years. I work in a remote call center from home which I love (wfh part) I have over 25 yrs customer service experience as well as call center experience, have done just about every position in a call center from phone rep to team lead, supervisor and operation manager. Have a college degree, fraud experience, document review experience plus was writer and editor of my own blog for 10 years. I am still on the phones taking calls. I have made it clear to my supervisor and manager my goal was to get off the phones and I know there are positions on my team for this to happen.

I am the oldest team member (62)I made a lateral move to another team still on phones taking calls, still taking calls. Last year I was asked to be a part of a specialized team with no increase in pay and no real advantage to me. Would still be on the phones taking more difficult and complex calls. After taking one of these calls I was on for over 2 hours , I let my supervisor and manager it was too much for me at the time and asked if we could revisit this in a month or so. I was removed from the specialized team, no problem I asked to be removed. 

Let me back up I have exceptional KPI‚Äôs and a great work ethic, I am told over and over again ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt worry about you, you‚Äôre always here and your stats are fantastic.‚Äù

I can say this everyone that has been moved off the phones to offline tasks,(this is a promotion without the benefits) have less experience, less education and less seniority than me. How do I know this? I ask, and I am authorized to look at PI and resumes. Unethical maybe but what is done is done. 

This last month I met with my supervisor and created a SMART goal with timelines and key points (this is a goal to move to a offline team) it is dependent upon my supervisor creating meetings with other team members for training and side by side work. Call volume is extremely low right now but will go crazy in November. So we set the completion date for training the end of September. It is now almost the end of August and no sign of any training being set up or formalized. 

Yes I am looking at other position but I‚Äôm tired of being invisible. I have friends that swear I‚Äôm being overlooked and pushed under the table because of my age but that is a hard one to prove. I just want to be treated fairly and given the opportunity to reach my goals and move off the phones. I don‚Äôt understand what I have to do at this point.

1exfg5n,Be Aware of Family business,"I have a good friend. Let's call him Mr. J. We've been friends for 10 years. We play, we joke, we fight...

After Mr. J graduated, he was forced to get into his family business by his father while he was feeling lost in life. The worst part of the Mr. J. family business is working six days a week (even though it is not 9‚Äì5, it is still extremely stressful and tiring). I moved to another city near where Mr. J lives because of my job, but it's just a 20-minute ride. I tried to catch up with Mr. J, but Mr. J kept pushing me away, and that made me feel strange. He never did that before.

There's one time he finally said yes, and we went to our favourite place, the top of an abandoned train. Mr. J opened up to me and said, ""I got depression and anxiety; my health is terrible. And I still need to face a bunch of people and fake a smile for them. My dad and my family knew that I had mental health issues, but they just feel like if I'm not in a coma, I'm fine. My dad took me to a psychiatrist, but he stopped a few months ago. I have no money to pay for psychiatrists, therapy, etc. I had no money for a car, but my parents kept telling me to go out more. They don't treat me like their son, they treat me like a working robot. I really hate my life. Now, my heart has some problems, but I can't take a leave. Because my father won't let me and we don't have a contract, I don't have those employee benefits, medical leave, etc. I don't want to keep doing this anymore. My father kept emotionally blackmailing me. I'm tired of this man...""

  
I don't know what to do, but all I know is that if a family business requires you to work and you can't take a day off, that is hell.

  
I tried to comfort him, even though I don't really know how, but I tried my best. Two days later, Mr. J took his own life. Mr. J also left me a letter; it's about how he felt, his life, and how terrible his parents are (I won't disclose much).

That makes me drop my tears.

If you're young and your parents want you to get into their family business, think twice. Make sure that is what you like; you could take leave, and you won't feel too much stress. Have a nice day.",unknown-0I0,2,1.0,0,1724210782,2024-08-21 03:26:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1exfg5n/be_aware_of_family_business/,8,2024
1exffkg,"Stay at current role that I like- no raise, or move on to role where I can make a bit more but I don‚Äôt like the role. ","
**Current Job:**

Salary & Benefits: Earning 50k CAD with 2 weeks vacation and no benefits. After expenses, I only have just under $200 left each month, making it difficult to save or invest in my future.

Workload: Initially worked 50-60 hours weekly, including 10 hours at home for tasks like brainstorming and data analysis. Since being denied a raise, I‚Äôve cut back to 40-44 hours. I believe I should be paid 60-65k for what I am doing.

Challenges: Sales are stable but fluctuate by 5-10%. The business is in a new, volatile industry and a poor locations, compounded by the pressures of a Canadian recession. Despite these challenges, I increased sales by 30% and made the business profitable in one area that 99% of like business are not profitable what so ever (I confirmed this with a sales manager at a large company that runs the platform). I helped open a franchise & provide ongoing support (more support than they have ever provided).

Management Issues: I feel disrespected and micromanaged, especially after cutting back on overworking and returning job perks they initially offered. My communication has also been pulled back as they weren‚Äôt reading my detailed reports. Their inability to read the reports I was providing led to them being confused on very very basic things the business was going through but was informed on via reports & prompt texts. 

Employee Turnover: I‚Äôve had to rebuild teams at all locations due to previous lack of management, leading to ongoing turnover. One location is now solid, and the other just needs one more strong hire. It took about 1 years to get to this point which was stressful for me - constantly having to fire, interview & train while keeping labour low. 

Job Satisfaction: I love my team, and the job itself is ‚Äúeasy‚Äù (I‚Äôm heavily experienced in it despite being in my mid late 20s) but very time-consuming. It often feels like I need two bodies to manage everything. The role keeps me connected for future opportunities, but I‚Äôm too exhausted to apply for other jobs. Networking is the key to getting jobs nowadays and this role keeps me networked despite being exhausted. 

**Job Offer:**

Salary & Benefits: The offer includes a 5k increase, 3 weeks vacation, and benefits (likely a basic plan but better than nothing, including much-needed dental and therapy). This would leave me with $450 at the end of the month, improving my financial situation.

Job Nature:  The role is less appealing, with less control and more grind. It was brought to me by a recruiter; I didn‚Äôt seek it out. The job is described as challenging, with a need to grind for sales, but I could gain skills for future roles.

Concerns: The position feels like a step down from my current level of responsibility. I‚Äôm not passionate about the role and worry it will be harder to find happiness and success there. Interviewed informed me it‚Äôs not an easy role and again would need someone to grind to finish sales.

**Dilemma:**

Current Role: I‚Äôm underpaid, overworked, but love what I do and feel successful, especially having stabilized the locations I run. However, my financial situation is strained, and I can barely save.

New Role:The offer provides financial stability and benefits but might make me less happy and successful in the long run. I‚Äôm struggling to decide if I should stay in a job I love that undercompensates me or move to a better-paying role that I‚Äôm less passionate about.

Job Search: I‚Äôm too busy to apply widely, only sending out 2-3 tailored resumes a week. After 3 months, I‚Äôve had 3 interviews and 2 recruiter inquiries, leading to this one offer. This makes the decision even more difficult.

1exed52,Leaving job too soon?,"I recently started a full-time role after graduating college, joining a data team after interning there for two summers in a row. I had been excited about this opportunity, expecting to step into a role that would allow me to focus on data analytics, but still get financial exposure to eventually pivot into financial analyst role.

However, on my first day, I discovered that the situation had changed significantly. Most of the team I was supposed to join was on their way out, and the role itself had shifted away from data analytics and was folded in to a more back-office data engineering team. This change was disheartening, as it felt like a door had closed on the path I had been working toward.

After that I began looking at other opportunities. Not very seriously, just throwing applications in randomly at firms that caught my attention. But, now just three months into the job, I‚Äôve received a nice offer from another company‚Äîone that aligns much more closely with my long-term career goals. But I‚Äôm torn. Conventional wisdom often suggests that it‚Äôs best to stick it out for a while, especially early in your career, to avoid the appearance of job-hopping. But, my introductory months left a sour taste in my mouth and I feel that if a company can make decisions that suit their best interests, I should be able to do the same for my career.

Is it way too soon to consider making this move? How do I weigh the risks of leaving so early against the potential benefits of aligning my work with my career aspirations? I want to make the right decision for my long-term growth, and I‚Äôd hate to burn bridges.

Hi ###,

I'm glad to hear that you're excited to join the team! I appreciate you letting me know about your availability. Unfortunately, the training sessions are mandatory and can't be rescheduled.

However, I can offer you the option to start a bit later, as I have another student beginning in a few weeks who also couldn't make the initial training. I understand this might not be ideal, but coordinating these sessions individually would be quite challenging for both myself and the team.

Please let me know if this option works for you. Once I have everyone's availability, I can provide a more specific start date.

Thanks ####

Turns out they clicked so fast (this 24 year girl started working there 2 weeks before me) and they talk like friends all day, sometimes even kinda bothering me because i can't focus while listening to chit-chat. The problem is: I noticed she is way more patient and talks to her new friend a lot and somethings about the routine she doesn't tell me - I have to not miss much - .

When her friend makes mistakes she's all supportive and when i do, she is like: ""You didnt write that down?"" Like she has been telling me every thing and it is all my fault. She expects me to do things on my own when I am in a moment where i don't know anyone in the company and well, she was the one designed to lead the way to us.

I hate the fact that im working only for the purpose of other peoples entertainment, my job is meaningless to me and i can't see myself doing it when I'm 30 or 40, when I compare myself to other people e.g baristas, at least they enjoy what they are doing, sure maybe they won't have a future (neither will I) and a good paying job but they are doing what they like and doing physical work...

And I'm a hard working guy, currently working about 16 hours a day, but the pay is not that good and again, I don't see a future for myself...
I was planning to change my major to software engineering, I could see myself doing that it has almost everything I want from a job,  meaningful, has a future, good pay, and is hard enough that not every dumb person who just installed photoshop can do it... but it will take a long time for me to find a job in that field, since I have to learn it And find a job in the current job market...

once again, I want my job to be relativity hard (Not medical - hate that) future rich and purposeful...

would love to know if you have any job/ career recommendation other than programming. ",Alert-Ad2833,4,1.0,0,1724198285,2024-08-20 23:58:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1exb3ax/looking_for_a_purposeful_job_as_an_artist/,8,2024
1exazhp,Underpaid contractor: what would happen if i ask the staffing company to pay me more?,"So I am a contractor working through a staffing company. The contract is contract-to-hire in this case, but I am only halfway through. I took the job out of desperation so I did not request higher pay, and I am quite underpaid. Probably make 60% of what I should make as far as total comp (i get no benefits as a contractor).

I believe it was to my staffing company / recruiters advantage that I did not negotiate a higher pay, as they  receive money for every hour I work. Basically the staffing company marks up my work lets say 10-20% and they take that for themselves.

I am shopping around for jobs to get a better pay, but I figured in the meantime, it might be worth telling the staffing company I feel underpaid subtly. Something like ""how can I get paid more, I feel that I am underpaid?""

They will get the message that I am not satisfied with the pay and the implication that I may leave the role at any time, in which case they would stop earning money also. Therefore, to my thinking they may want to change the contract to lower the percentage that they take off of what the company pays for me. That is, if the staffing company currently takes 20% of every dollar I earn, they may lower to 15% to keep me happy.

What are the chances this will work? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? The alternative is going to the company I am doing work for and asking for a raise, in which case they would need to shell out money to the staffing company to break the contract which may not be likely.

1exayyx,I need some opinions on a potential career change..,"Hey everyone,

I have a bit of a 3-way road divergence in my career and I would like some outside input on what to do.

I currently work in furniture sales and make about $80k/yr doing so. I‚Äôm commission-only W2 and could probably break $100k my 2nd year out but the company has been going through a bit of a rough patch. To be frank, I don‚Äôt think furniture sales will be for me long-term. My kid will be starting school in a couple of years and I have to work all weekends and most holidays. I don‚Äôt want to miss out on his life because I have to make a living for my family. So, I‚Äôve been interviewing quite a bit and I have two job offers that I like:

The first is P&C/Life insurance sales. W2, $36k base salary, renewals each year and full benefits. The agent told me $60-$70k is realistic your first year out and it‚Äôs entirely possible to hit $100k/yr after renewals start rolling in. Commission rates are 2-6% based upon your sales volume and the environment is corporate. I‚Äôd work 8-5 Monday-Friday and have my weekends to myself. I‚Äôd cold call a lot at this job but referrals and other warm leads are offered as well. I was told they are always hiring during my interview and they hire you if they think you‚Äôll be a good fit. At first this feels flattering but my Dad a good point: it could be a high-turnover position.

The second job is a roofing company. I like the environment, it‚Äôs a veteran-owned company and I(being a veteran) had a good connection with the individuals who work there. Commission rates are 10% and I was told 2-3 sales/wk are not uncommon. Breaking $100k your first year out is expected and a lot of the guys there are making $200k. There‚Äôs a small stipend during training and then you‚Äôre 1099 commission-only. This isn‚Äôt so much of a problem because my family has health coverage through other avenues. This position is high-risk, high reward. At first there‚Äôs a lot of door-to-door but they provide warm leads as well. Most of my family has told me this is a bad idea but they also said that with every other commission job that I‚Äôve taken.

So, essentially I‚Äôm looking at 3 options:

1. Stay in furniture. It‚Äôs not my favorite thing but I‚Äôm doing decent enough at it. I‚Äôll be working when my kid is off of school and on most major holidays.

2. P&C/Life insurance. It sounds steady and there‚Äôs still the potential to excel and make a good living. I‚Äôm a bit concerned about the market being so saturated and the smaller income-earning potential.

3. Roofing sales. Small company, nice guys and they seem to care about their community. There seems to be a higher income earning potential but there will be a bit of risk when I first start out as the stipend will only cover a portion of my bills.

Thanks for taking the time to read and any input would be greatly appreciated!

Should I stay in furniture, move to insurance or maybe roofing sales?",Quirky-Bar4236,1,1.0,0,1724197949,2024-08-20 23:52:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1exayyx/i_need_some_opinions_on_a_potential_career_change/,8,2024

Instead, review your employer. Glassdoor and Indeed are places you can make reviews for.

If you cannot say what you want to say, let it be known that the company and job is a thumbs down. The more recent comments you out will help others learn about that company, and maybe think twice, about accepting interview requests and employment offers.

1ex8vy0,"Unemployed tech pro for a year. Suddenly, two job offers, one ($) completely remote, the other ($$) hybrid.","I got laid off a bit over a year ago, and while I've had a couple of interviews here and there over the year, nothing really panned out to more than a 2nd interview. Well, they say when it rains, it pours, and so suddenly, I've advanced through the final stages of interview with two opportunities. Both very similar in the work, and both in my career path, both with career growth potential. So, what's different?

 | Job A | Job B
---|---|----
Pay | 180k | 210k
PTO | 5 weeks | ""unlimited""
401k | 50% no limit| 50% up to 6%
Bonus potential | 15% | 20%
HDHP premiums | 0$ | 20$ per pay period (individual)
Commute | bed to desk | fuckin' brutal, 2 hours with traffic

Both companies offer your standard fare of perks: tuition reimbursement, charitable donation matching, ERGs, mental wellness resources, etc. 

I've got the first offer JobA in hand, and just finished up final interview with the CTO of JobB, who told me to expect an offer after HR puts it together. I've also got a question out to their HR about details on their WFH policy on JobB: I've gotten nebulous answers on it so far, seems like they may have recently gone through a return-to-office or a onsite-only to hybrid model. I've asked how often do people normally come in, what is expected of me. I'm trying to figure out if it will be worth it for me.

WFH is very important to me, even though I have no kids or wife to take care of, just a couple of cats, so I have a decision to make. Once a month in the office? No problem. Once a month I can work from home? No thanks, that's not worth the extra salary.

I'm also contemplating negotiating the salary on JobA, as it is a bit lower than I was targeting (200), though everything else seems great. Thoughts?

1ex8q7z,What masters degree would be ideal to study? ,"Looking for a masters degree to change careers but am not sure what program to get into. 

Like the title says, I‚Äôm wanting to go back to school and major in something like but am unsure what. I‚Äôm in mid 30s and have a bachelor degree in architecture. I‚Äôve been at it for almost 10 years. The problem with this is that I don‚Äôt ever feel fulfilled. Nor joy. Like I dread it every day. But I make ok money (mid $90k ish) and although I should feel grateful, the work is mind numbing. I‚Äôve worked from a small firm, to a corporate firm, to an engineering company with arch dept, and residential firm, back to small firm that does commercial work. All have been more or less, boring. Only thing I have enjoyed most is doing renderings. But looking for jobs like that, it‚Äôs massively underpaid. I tried my hand in studying for my license but my god, the amount of studying just makes me feel discouraged. 

Also, I‚Äôve been wanting to venture out of my own doing side projects, it‚Äôs slow and the clients are basically just shopping which barely any contracts or proposals get signed. It‚Äôs been super slow and stressful. I guess it is what it is. 

What I do have is some amount of money to try to get back to school for masters degree but I‚Äôm unsure in what. I am unsure if I want to pursue a related field of architecture like engineering or something. Or go for a different route like mba, supply chain management, ai machine learning, data science, game design, whatever. I‚Äôve also considered doing udemy for UX/UI design.

1ex8pcf,Torn Career decision ,"I'm (M 35) currently having trouble deciding if I should go back to a job I really loved and felt appreciated at (worked little over 1y 1/2.) And left it less than 5 months ago. 

 So I ended up leaving this job I loved because I was offered a position to go back to a City job (large metropolitan City) where I have over 8 years put in along with a vested retirement plan that I never took out when I left in 2022. Even though I loved where I was currently employed, the city offered me quite a bit more $$ than I was currently making, so I took it. Ultimately believing I made the right decision because to me it seemed to be the smarter choice for my future, with all the benefits and opportunity that comes with being employed by one of the largest growing cities in the US.
 
So the point to this long-winded search for advice is last week I was offered to go back to the private job I loved for the same hourly rate that the city is currently giving me. And I can't decide whether I want to take it or not, I mean sure I loved that job but it's not like I hate the city job that I'm at, its just this city job doesn't bring me the same satisfaction that the private one did. I definitely don't want to be hopping from job to job especially at my age. I know if I stay with the city I can retire young before I'm 56 and definitely make more money in the long run. And at the same time I can honestly say I felt more satisfaction working for the private company. It's like I know what I'm getting and what the future may hold by staying with the city job. But will I regret not taking a job I loved for some uncertainty of what the future may be... Anyways if anyone's been through this situation and it's not like it's a bad one to have ; I know I'm basically having the biggest first world problem but just wanted some advice to see if anybody has ever been in this type of situation and what day ended up deciding? And do they regret it or not?

I've asked HR multiple times to verify my job titles held with the company from external email but they all confirmed the same except for one who came back with my original hire job title. So I'm thinking unless they do a deep dive (which I doubt since they are very slow and incompetent in my company), I think I can swing it when I apply for a new job.

1ex7pf3,Think I'm about to be laid off going into maternity leave. How soon do I need to start my search to land something? ,"I think I'm about to be laid off right before my scheduled c-section/start of maternity leave (about 3 weeks from now). It's the same date (unless I go into labor before, in which case it will be sooner) since I had planned on working right up until delivery. 

Backstory:

For all intents and purposes, it would be a layoff, but the situation is more complicated than that. Basically, my original company was acquired. I was granted provisional employment with a contract end date to help with transition. The company found some other areas that I could effectively help with besides integration, so before my contract expired I was given an extension. 

Then I was encouraged to apply for an internal role and had to go through a formal process. Post interview, I received great feedback, but there were some internal things to work out, which delayed the decision. Instead, they granted me another extension, then another. I was told it was all a formality, and to wait another week. Now coming up on the expiration date of my 4th contract, they are saying it's less of a sure thing. So it's looking more like I will just be given another contract until I deliver the babies, then be effectively terminated. I should mention that I was upfront with my pregnancy since almost the beginning. 

Question/Advice Needed: 

For financial reasons, I don't have the luxury of not working, but can probably float 8 to 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave if needed, but would need a job ASAP. I think three months is the absolute longest I could go without a paycheck.

I work in tech, which is bleeding jobs right now. And the economy as a whole doesn't look promising despite what politicians are saying. 

Knowing this, at what point should I start the job search? Do I start talking to recruiters/applying to jobs almost immediately after giving birth? I'm assuming pregnancy makes me ineligible for unemployment...

1ex6ah8,Tipping point in job; do I pick a side,"This was going to be a wall of text but I think I can pare this down and still get the point across. My boss is terrible. I'm his only report. He has terrible management skills, and shoddy technical skills at best. He wants to become a manager (he's not now, we had the same title when I was hired but he demanded his be changed so I was lower and under him), or even a sudo-director, and he's using me like a pawn to get there. He offers no room for advancement, autonomy etc. He offers only micro-management, meltdowns, lies and inefficiency. He takes medication for..let's just say a severe behavioral issue (he mentioned to me). There is an entire cadre of people at work, inside and outside my team, who will do anything possible to work directly with me and avoid him. Higher ups are aware. My director (boss's boss), who is a great guy, has been advocating for me for almost 2 years now. Boss has been getting worse and stirring the pot and my director has had enough. He's been patient, tried to work with boss, but he's done. Director is actively pushing (to our VP) for me to report directly to him (director), and reduce boss's responsibility. Director has also shielded me from boss by making this all come from him. 

The tipping point - We have a major project coming up that was supposed to be mine, but boss has injected himself and taken control (as of now, keep reading). I have zero confidence this project will get completed if boss is included because he cannot handle the stress. He shuts down, will not take suggestions, will not answer questions etc. I have seen it firsthand as have others. I also cannot overrule him on anything and am at his mercy on completing the tasks needed.

Picking a side - Director has kept me completely shielded up until now. I've been able to keep my head down, claim plausible deniability, and continue to shine. With this project looming however, he's asking me to put my concerns in writing. He swears he will not forward the email and I believe him, but he wants to basically show it to VP (boss's boss's boss) over a zoom call to hammer in that this project is in jeopardy and I should be working directly for director.

My concerns - For one, I know my boss is in VPs ear. I don't know how close they are, but there is some relationship there, and it's possibly close, possibly not.. I don't know if VP favors director or boss. I do know that VP has seen bosses meltdowns, that he is not totally against me moving to director based on what director has told me, but I also know boss sucks his ass like there's no tomorrow. If I write this email, I have chosen a side. I have injected myself into the situation at least somewhat. I can encrypt the email so it cannot be forwarded or the text copied, but VP could potentially screenshot the zoom screen share of the email. If director wins this battle, it doesn't matter. But if director loses, or VP is more in favor of boss, not great. However, if I don't write this email, director may not be as favorable to me in the future. He may take this that I'm flaky etc.

1ex63xz,So Stressed Out. In Need of Serious Advice PLEASE,"Hey everyone,

I'm reaching out for some advice and support as a recent college grad who‚Äôs just passed all my FINRA and NASAA exams (SIE, Series 7, Series 66) and started as a financial advisor at a boutique wealth management firm. I knew the role would demand long hours, but I‚Äôm finding it challenging to manage the workload and maintain a balance in my life.

Here‚Äôs a rough outline of my current situation:

* **Daily Routine**: I wake up around 5:50 am, get ready, and leave for work by 6:00 am. My commute and walk to the office takes about an hour, so I arrive by 7:00 am. My workday typically runs until about 9:00 pm, including group meetings, cold calling, client meetings, and preparing for the next day. I usually get home around 9:30 or 9:40 pm. In total, I‚Äôm working and commuting approximately 77.5 hours per week, or about 15.5 hours per day.
* **Personal Time**: Due to the long hours, I struggle to find time for personal activities. I can‚Äôt make it to the gym, do grocery shopping, or run errands during the week. On weekends, I try to spend time with my girlfriend and family, but personal time is still limited. I‚Äôve been considering starting a faceless YouTube channel as a side gig, but I‚Äôm unsure how to fit it into my current schedule.
* **Compensation**: My compensation package includes a low base salary that covers basic expenses (food, car, phone) plus 75% commission on deals like selling insurance and fees for assets under management (AUM). I was offered a full commission role at 175% but opted for the salary + commission option due to my financial needs.
* **Current Struggles**: I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed and exhausted, with only 5-6 hours of sleep per night. While I appreciate the mentorship and support from my boss and colleagues, I‚Äôm struggling with the lack of personal time and the demanding schedule. I haven‚Äôt yet secured a client, and I‚Äôve heard that once I build a larger client base, I might be able to reduce my hours, though I‚Äôm not clear on how that works.
* **Future Considerations**: I‚Äôm curious if larger wire houses offer more manageable schedules compared to boutique firms. I‚Äôm also open to exploring other career routes within or outside of finance, as I want to ensure that the effort I‚Äôve put into studying and passing these exams doesn‚Äôt go to waste.

I really enjoy the work and the people I work with, but I‚Äôm concerned about my well-being and long-term sustainability. Any advice or insights on managing this demanding schedule, or suggestions for alternative career paths, would be greatly appreciated.

1ex63gj,Boss Won't Meet With Me,"Hey all,

I work at a nonprofit organization in Philly and have been here about a year. My supervisor left about a month ago to pursue higher education and I have seemingly filled her role. I say seemingly because nothing has been communicated to me whatsoever. I have requested multiple times over the past 2 months to meet with my new supervisor and COO (who she claims needs to be in the meeting) and have not gotten it. We had a meeting scheduled about a month ago that was put off for an emergency and has not been rescheduled. I sent an email a few weeks ago requesting again that we meet and was grilled by my new supervisor for being ""abrasive"" and told that they are busy and will find time. When I see her she keeps saying ""I know you still want to meet to so we'll try to find time"" but it's been 3 weeks since my previous supervisor left and I've just kept going with things as usual. She's communicative and will support me when I ask but I am in the dark on if they plan on hiring someone else and would like to discuss a raise. I don't want to be scolded again for being pushy but at this point I'm unsure what my options are. I like my job and would ideally like to stay but I feel very put off and ignored. Any advice for this situation would be very helpful.

1ex5u79,What should I do as the next steps in my career?,"Hello everyone, so as the title says, I am debating about a path to pursue in the coming years. I have (somewhat) narrowed it down, but still have far too many options on the table. Seen as the economy is now in a state where 150k a year isn't enough to rent a studio apartment anymore, I don't even know what is worth doing, like I am seriously considering how to make living in a tent work after school when 150 square feet costs 4k a month.

I am currently going into my sophomore year, and have pretty much only done general education classes and Intro to CS. I have my majors declared as Computer Science and Business Management, but I will be changing them because Management seems to generalized for my interests, and CS is becoming very useless as it becomes massively over saturated at the entry level. Additionally, I am a baseball pitcher at my school, so after scholarships, I am paying about 5k a year for school.


1 - Bachelors in Computer Information Systems & Finance with plans to get an MBA degree and CPA.

2 - Bachelors in Computer Information Systems and / or Finance with plans to attend Law School.

3 - Something else? Really wouldn't want anything too heavy in commissions like sales, but not opposed.


Initially, my plan was the dual major, but it would take be 5 years to get my undergraduate requirements, & my 150 credits for the CPA licensure in Missouri (33 hours in accounting, 27 in general business). I feel like my entire life would pass me by if I was spending 5 years in school for an undergraduate, 6-7 for an MBA, 8 for a JD, or 8-9 for a DDS or DMD. I really would like to be completely done, or at least be fully capable of getting my education remotely while I work by the time I am 24 or 25.

I am also quite concerned about the rise of artificial intelligence, outsourcing jobs, and the failing economic situation. I would prefer to stay away from jobs that could easily be wiped out, like bookkeeping for example. Lastly, and this is a strange one, I have been single my entire life and want a job that has a title and salary good enough to attract a girlfriend someday. Sorry, I know this is a lot of information, but I wanted a few additional opinions on what I should do as a career, any information or opinions are so much appreciated, and if you've read this far, thank you.",Melodic-Ice6115,1,0.6600000262260437,4,1724185108,2024-08-20 20:18:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ex5u79/what_should_i_do_as_the_next_steps_in_my_career/,8,2024

1ex5fqr,Confused about my career choices in future? (More in description),"My career journey is something like this. After graduation in 2012, I joined in to a semiconductor company as an analog circuit designer. Worked for 3 yrs in that company then joined another EDA software company. Since 2016 I am in this company so I have a total 8 yrs of experience. I joined as a technical product leading handling some part of the EDA software. Gathering requirements from different users, creating specification such as UI, utilising my circuit knowledge to bring in some new improvement in existing flow. I worked with customer support engineers helping resolve bugs, plan enhancements in tools and so on. (I am trying to summarise my role as brief as possible). So, in nutshell after working in this type of role I am equipped with knowledge of creating a software, preparing road map, project planning, delivering demo/presentations to potential clients. My analog circuit knowledge have become more theoretical than practical. I am more of technical project/prodcut engineer now. 

I have very basic knowledge of scripting, python ...basically when I need to write a script to resolve a problem at customer end I can spend few hours to look at internal sites and write up few lines of code, APIs that does the job. So I would say I am not very proficient. I have a passion to learn python but my work hours are so hectic due to several projects deadline and so on (this does sound like excuse and I apologise). 

I am also hearing about layoffs at the office and people with similar role as me got axed so I am also very stressed and it affects my work.

I want to know about the type of role I could apply or what are the different career choices available for me best on my daily job descriptions I mentioned above. 

I briefly worked on a project that involved AI/ML but in that project my involvement was mainly bringing the idea and creating a roadmap about the different tasks we would be solving. Main work that involved coding was done by software engineers ofcourse. 

Kindly help me ease my mind and prepare a game plan. I would like to be prepared in advance. Thank you for your help. ",UrbanPundit69,1,1.0,0,1724184138,2024-08-20 20:02:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ex5fqr/confused_about_my_career_choices_in_future_more/,8,2024
1ex5eho,what would be the best way of quitting without giving a two weeks notice?,"So for a bit of context, the place I am currently working at has been an incredibly anxiety-inducting and unprofessional atmosphere, they have a very high turnover rate, and I have concluded that it would be best for my well being to leave this job as soon as I have another one secured (I have an interview on Thursday, fingers crossed!).

This facility is notorious for changing employees schedules without alerting them, and not providing any room to have a discussion about it, so if you get that session time, that‚Äôs that until they decide to change it. Very recently, they switched everyone‚Äôs schedule without any warning, and have left a lot of employees with either an incredibly long work day with no breaks, or basically no hours at all. There‚Äôs a lot more to it, but that would be a bit too much to read.

Normally I would give a two weeks notice, but they are notorious for taking you off the schedule entirely or overwhelming you with work up until your two weeks are over, and I do not plan on utilizing this

So with all of this in mind, what would be the best way to essentially say ‚Äútoday is my last day‚Äù (or at least much shorter notice than two weeks).

1ex46oo,Engineering vs dentistry??,"So long story short, i'm 25 from eastern eu country and used to work in a completely different field ( illustration and graphic design). Turns out turning your hobby into a job is not always a good idea and will 100% do a career change.

I was almost set on doing dentistry next year (it's a 5.5 years degree where i live, tuition is almost free, but cost of living is not great compared to the salaries) I was mostly interested in it, because i really enjoy working with my hands and i actually find the work kinda artistic, there is also so much technology and science behind it ! The results of your work are also immediate. I like that it doesn't involve corporate office culture. However i have a few concerns, mainly that this particular uni is famous for being brutal ( they don't even provide you patients during your study, so you have to search for them yourself ! i've heard horror stories how straight A students fail the year, because they had no patient for the exam) Also if you start your practice you are basically chained there. I really don't like my country and don't see my future here.

So a few days ago i found that there are a few positions that are not filled in the engineering uni here, so i can just fill the papers and start this year. The one that seems the most interesting is mechanical engineering. I've heard that it's the most versatile as well. I like science and i'm not great nor terrible at math, the curriculum seems interesting and nowhere near as hard as the dentistry. Engineering usually pays shit here (as almost everything else), but i know a scandinavian language at b2 and german at b1 already. Also i feel that the degree could take me to very unexpected places and opens more doors than dentistry.

Im stuck because im unsure how to progress. I could get my bachelors either in IT or business. I want to transfer to IT but thats been a rough endevour. 

I‚Äôve led projects and have good soft skills, and I like to move around and talk to people, so I think being a PM would be nice. 

I‚Äôm also trying to build a business but between school/applying for new jobs and learning/the family I just am unsure how much time I can/want to sink into those areas(family is #1).

So do i:
 -go back to school

- transfer to IT which would set me back on income and career path but ultimately have a greater chance to lead to higher salary 

-Try for a PM Job and/get certs(pmp/lean)

-Just try to get a teamlead/manager position for biomed

The thing is, I‚Äôve applied to three different roles within this department already. The first one I didnt get and that‚Äôs ok. My interview was rusty, and I didn‚Äôt think the role was a great fit anyway. The second one, I didn‚Äôt even get an interview for. I never followed up to find out why.

1ex1mff,Struggling at Work: Is It Time to Move On?,"I'm looking for some advice about my current job situation. I've been in this role for about a year, and things haven't gone as planned. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like this line of work might not be for me. I posted about this in another subreddit several months ago, and I followed the advice to stick it out for a year. While there have been some minor improvements, the core issues remain unchanged.

One major problem is that my ""mentor"" has been largely absent. When they do offer assistance, it often goes poorly, to the point where I've had to minimize contact with them. I'm frequently tasked with responsibilities that I have no idea how to handle, and when I ask for help, the responses are dismissive, like ""You should know how to do that"" or ""Figure it out.""

My boss has also shifted from being extremely hands-on to completely uninvolved in decision-making. However, they still get angry when they don‚Äôt like the outcomes, even though they weren't part of the process. I've been blamed for things outside my control, and even when I prove an issue wasn't my fault, I still get reprimanded.

I'm really struggling and feeling deeply unhappy in this position. This was supposed to be my dream job, something I thought I‚Äôd love, but it‚Äôs become a source of constant stress. I've tried everything to improve‚Äîlearning on my own, attending seminars, and networking with others in similar roles‚Äîbut it hasn‚Äôt been enough.

To make matters worse, there are issues at home, and this job has been taking me away from my family. I‚Äôve started updating my resume and looking at other job opportunities, though I haven‚Äôt applied to anything yet. I haven‚Äôt told my wife about this, but she knows how frustrated I am. She's concerned because leaving this job could mean losing a significant education benefit, which is important with our kids heading to college in a few years, unless I find another position within the company. We would also have to cut back as my pay would more than likely need to be cut.

I realize this might sound like a downer, and while there are some positives, I'm not sure how much more my mental health can take.

1ex1bq6,First full-time job but I'm really struggling to cope. I have no idea what to do.,"I know that I'm a pretty fragile person. I struggled with unemployment for around 20 months so finally getting a job offer felt like a blessing but I'm now a month into it and I am back to feeling incredibly suicidal. 

For context, unemployment also made me suicidal at times but the freedom I had with my personal life kept me going and searching for a job. I hated the lack of purpose I felt. Now I am working 8:30-5 in an office and I hate it.

-The department is full of workaholics who don't ever take any breaks apart from the 30 minutes unpaid lunch. 

-Onboarding has been hell with days where I had nothing to do and others where they wanted people to do some 'homework' (do the rest of our work from home with no pay). Frequently they would teach me things in 4 hours blocks with no breaks and it was exhausting. I don't even know if I took any of it in.

-If you finish early, pretend you're busy. If you are bored, smile. All this to 'make the department looks good'. It seems ridiculous to me. 

-I feel like a DEI hire too. I'm mixed, neuro divergent and mildly physically disabled. Despite knowing this, I feel incredibly unheard and when I'm struggling with something related to my barriers to work and need a reasonable adjustment (even when I tell them my ideas) I am just shut down before I can even bring things up.

-Most of my PTO is predecided. I only have about 10 days annually I can pick although they still haven't told me how to call in sick so idk if I even get that (even though I'm disabled and ongoing physiotherapy, which I am having to put on hold because I can't make time for it or even a doctor's visit anymore). 

I feel like nobody ever tells people how difficult it is to adjust to a 9-5 or similar routine and what is reasonable to expect. I don't know if I'm expecting too much but I feel like even if I'm doing well at my job so far, I'm not a good fit for it or really anything. What if I quit and was unemployed again for another 20 months? I don't have any savings left! I'm not even being paid well for this. I barely make above minimum wage when you work out my salary per hour. I don't have a degree so maybe I can't expect much but my qualifications are great otherwise and it's not like most jobs don't just train you anyway.

I hate life. I hate capitalism. I hate my job.",CinnamonBunV3,0,0.5,2,1724174262,2024-08-20 17:17:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ex1bq6/first_fulltime_job_but_im_really_struggling_to/,8,2024
1ex19iu,Is doing a masters in the US worth it for the US jobs as a Canadian?,"Hello! I'm currently debating what masters program to do in the U.S. as a Canadian who graduated in 2022 with a BBA from the University of Toronto. My GPA was mediocre at a 3.4/4. I have 12 months of coop experience and 2.5 years of full-time experience with no career gaps since I graduated. I have mainly worked as a business analyst for both product development and now in the IT field. I would not consider myself to be technical and have only worked with technical teams.

Due to my undergrad, I believe I won't qualify for the TN visa to work in the U.S. and therefore considering doing a full-time master's (science based this time for the TN visa qualifications) in the U.S. so that I can stay in the U.S. post graduation for better work opportunities.

The programs I'm considering right now are:

* Masters of Science in Information Systems
* Masters of Science in Business Analytics

1ex187w,"Switch from l health major, debating on a finance, statistics, or supply chain degree? Which is the best option?","Hey guys so quick backstory,

I graduated high school around 4 years ago and I decided to work a full time warehouse job since then since I decided to make some poor financial decisions. I‚Äôm ready to focus solely on my education with working full time during my time at community college than cut hours at university. I do live at home, so not a lot of bills just groceries, insurance and car payments.

 I always wanted to become a nurse or related careers like firefighter, x ray tech etc but I fell out of passion for the subject especially since my grades are not as competitive as others to join a nursing program. But I‚Äôve worked at Amazon for a while now and I don‚Äôt mind the work and I‚Äôm good with management. I‚Äôm thinking about getting a supply chain degree since the manager position at Amazon starting is $68-$72k first year but I was thinking about other opportunities and career paths. I want to leave Amazon (maybe) in the future and land a career in some sort of analytics for logistics or a well known business. I would prefer to find a job maybe state or federal job that has a good pension or benefits aswell

Which degree would help me have more opportunities and not just stuck to one subject or job category. I don‚Äôt mind the 9-5 life, to be honest that would be my dream but with my math knowledge I‚Äôm not the best student in terms of understanding formulas and memorizing formulas but I didn‚Äôt really try in high school in terms of math but my highest math classes was Algebra 2. I‚Äôm pretty good with statistics.

1ex09ik,Trouble deciding between staying at current role or moving into a higher paying new role,"Hi all,

Just wanted some outside perspective on my current situation. I work as an entry level analyst. Take home is roughly 60k ish annually and i've been here almost 2 years.

Quick notes on current role: I have been promised a promotion is coming for the past 8 months, and it seems its finally slated for next month at a 15k pay raise.  The work is fine, and its relatively chill but we have new leadership that has slowly been changing the pace of that (as well as the culture) and a couple of my close co workers have already made it clear that they were looking for new opportunities - which has prompted my search.


The new role starts at 85k annually with maybe some budge room to get me to the 90k mark with some salary negotiations.  The thing being obviously with the pay bump is more added responsibilities. For this role I would be the sole analyst for a department and it seems there's a ton of work to be done, which is fine, but one concern is that with that precedent if the work life balance will be hell and its hard to really gauge that in an interview setting as I don't think any company will flat out define that for you.


**Pros/Cons of both**

Current role has stagnated salary wise a bit, but seems more realistic I will get a large pay bump next month. Comfort obviously is way higher if I stick it out, and there seems to be more leeway for me to continue to grow professionally just based on tenure but my co workers are thinking of jumping ship the team will change a lot and it might be a more miserable workplace in the future based on present indications.

New role is an incredible pay bump, but obviously the risk is a new environment with new challenges which I'm up for, but I still feel like I have a ton of room to grow and I don't want to maybe overshoot where my current level is at. I tried my absolute best to not fluff anything as this has been a 5 stage interview process and just speak to what I know and conservatively inform them where my level is at.  Not sure if this is in my head but also why I wanted some outside perspective.  It seems to be a lot of people facing, meeting focused while also speaking to things in real time where that is not my absolute strong suit. This is the major thing thats giving me pause.  I work really well when I can fully explore a project, understand its nuisance, and I speak through the quality of my work better than heavily presentation focused. 

My current team has been really gracious with allowing me to make mistakes which I can turn into learning opportunities and while I know its good and helpful I can understand where it might breed a bit of complacency. I've relied on them for advice and help (this is not a case where they are doing my job at all its just nice to have open conversations on projects where there are things I don't know and there is no judgement to providing some assistance or advice)


**TLDR: Would you take a new role under this scenario: Current role 60k projected to go to 75k or new role at 85K+ with a ton of its own changes and challenges. Comfort vs taking a risk. Both roles are fully remote.** Happy to elaborate more if necessary, I realize its kind of hard to encapsulate the full work environment(s) with all pros and cons without this being a massive post.",Intrepid-Shallot-754,1,1.0,7,1724171809,2024-08-20 16:36:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ex09ik/trouble_deciding_between_staying_at_current_role/,8,2024

The work culture here is what they call ""lean and mean"" and they work their employees here like slaves because they don't want to hire additional staff. I constantly have to work overtime. I feel super stressed out on the daily and dread coming into the office. I have no work/life balance and all of my former passions and hobbies have fallen by the wayside. I have also gained a lot of weight because I tend to overeat when I'm stressed out. Recently a new opportunity has presented itself at a non-profit organization for a similar role but it's entirely WFH and it's a good organization that helps the local community. The only issue is I would be taking a $30K pay cut and would go from $95K to $65K per year. Am I stupid to take such a drastic cut in pay? Or does have more peace of mind, a better work/life balance, and less stress justify a cut in pay? I'm torn and don't know what to do.

However, reflecting on it more I realized that I'm the only direct report who is not present. It just feels makes me feel a bit excluded, and I'd have been okay with even being told a reason why I wasn't included.

I‚Äôm 24 and have been working in this job for about 9 months now. I work as an EMS dispatcher for a major metropolitan area on the west coast and work midnights. This usually is not an issue for me, I am normally not the type of person to get stressed out easily and I was already the type to go to bed at 5am so the shift time worked amazing for me. I love the job itself I find it fun and rewarding.  The downside is that we work 12s and always seem to be at minimum because of high turnover which means lots of overtime. At my age though, I love the pay and saving money even at the expense of 96-120 hours over two weeks.  

On the base level everything is amazing, and mentally I feel the same way. 

On the physical level though my body absolutely hates it. At around four months in, I had difficulty sleeping due to having a lot of energy, and had to start sleeping pills. At five months I started having not high blood pressure but high for me (I‚Äôve consistently been 100-110/75 my entire life from what charts say, now I‚Äôm at 125/80). Three days ago I started having chest pains. Turns out my blood pressure got higher and caused it. My doctor put me on  a blood pressure medication for what he said is hopefully temporarily. Outside of this I‚Äôm a perfectly healthy person. I‚Äôm lean, workout daily, eat right there should be no reason for this to be happening from every lab my doctor could tell, and he said it‚Äôs probably work related stress. All my co workers just are like that‚Äôs how the job is welcome, but I refuse to kill myself 40 years early from a heart attack because of my job. 

The only common connection I can quite honestly find is the job I‚Äôm working. And I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know I probably need to leave this job, but I have no idea how to market myself to the private sector. I don‚Äôt know how or even what type of job to look for.

Hello, I‚Äôm feeling so lost in my life right now.

So looking into UX design, I love the capability of working from home in a creative tech roll, though I know it can be a tough career to break into. But it really seems like every career is hard to break into besides workforce rolls right now. 

Right now i‚Äôve been looking at ways to learn UX design through online resources and potentially a course/Bootcamp to jumpstart. I think to succeed I would want some sort of structure to help me stay on track learning and practicing. I feel ready to tackle and start projects to build a great portfolio.

On the other hand, in other direction, I have been looking into a massage therapy program at a tech school near me. Pay obviously not like tech, but doesn‚Äôt seem awful either. Appears to have a decent work life balance, but you have to build your clientele to make proper money too. Going into though I know would basically guarantee a job straight out as it is an in demand job. Probably wouldn‚Äôt make great money at first, but could build up. Another con would be any injury would put me out of work. Plus healthcare and benefits are usually on you to get not under a company. 

UX: Pay, in my degree field, remote rolls, travel, creative, healthcare/benefits > hard to break in, bootcamp/course expensive 

Massage Therapy: Calm atmosphere, jobs galore, flexibility > relicense every two years, moving states would mean having to get that states license, healthcare not included, hard on body, pay could be stable

I‚Äôm thinking with UX on my mind right now, just very hesitant as I read so many things about how it‚Äôs hard to break in.

Immediately after graduating, I moved to a smallish town and had trouble finding a job. So, I took one working for the state. Didn‚Äôt really have anything to do with statistics, just some minor analysis work using excel.

 

From there, I took similar jobs and team lead positions. I was in charge of doing a lot of reports (both federal and state), but mainly using summary statistics. Along the way, I have worked occasionally with SAS (last time a couple of years ago) and most recently with SQL. I will do occasional statistical analysis and have been the contributing analyst on several published papers in the last few years, but all of that involved heavy research into what I should be doing. That knowledge that I had when graduating is just gone now, from lack of use. 

 

I am finishing up a federal term position that will end at the end of September. It involved using SQL and running reports out of a huge data warehouse. I hate it, I hate just staring at a computer all day. I have lost so much knowledge over the years, from not working with my actual degree.

 

So now, when applying for jobs, despite 20 years experience in the field along with a masters degree, I almost feel underqualified for entry level positions, much less anything near my current salary. 

 

I feel like I have imposter syndrome. I have no idea what to do. I feel sort of lost. Any suggestions? I am not sure there are any, maybe just wanted to vent a bit.

I have been applying for a ton over the last few weeks. Haven‚Äôt heard back from any. ",balderic,1,1.0,1,1724163971,2024-08-20 14:26:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ewwyo9/masters_degree_with_20_years_experience_job/,8,2024

1ewvoyg,30yo male with too many ideas and lack of skills,"Hello everyone
I‚Äôm 30yo male living in Scotland as a Polish foreigner with wife and 4yo daughter.
I wasted my early years to addictions ( not a degenerate but been in dark places for long, currently only cigarettes addiction left which I‚Äôll be tackling soon ).
I‚Äôm tired of working for someone else and always dreamed of being financially free but never had enough discipline. Being financially free is a quite distant goal but earning anything above 4k ¬£ a month would make me happy at this point. 
Work experience : 
4 years + fast paced kitchen in chain restaurant covering all sections with confidence 
Car valeter/detailing 3 years+
Manufacturing production - different roles in different places food, sterile and lab environment, warehouses 3 years+ altogether
I make around 2.3k a month before taxes at current valeting job 

4 years ago I started drawing and tattooing and started from absolute 0 to point where was tattooing people for decent money at my flat for like 3 years every weekend or two, moved to studio to get more exposure and been doing this for few months on weekends but it was too much (job mon-fri 7.30-5, taking care of my daughter while wifes working 5-9 so had around an hour for myself at night and tattoos on weekends)

I stopped tattooing completely and I‚Äôm not sure if I want to get back to it I enjoyed it but it‚Äôs very time consuming.
At the moment I‚Äôve got time to be used for learning new skill/building some business between 8.30-10pm mon-fri and probably around 6-8h total through the weekend.
I enjoy working out (10years exp), sports, love nature and wild mushroom foraging, food - can cook really well imo
Some ideas what I could be doing

Car interior repair services - never done any research on demand
Web development 
Graphic design
Digital marketing
Cyber security 
Career in green energy?
Health and well-being 
Massage therapist (sports/soft tissue)- seem to be quite common where I live so demand might be low

Id be grateful for any other ideas

From the list the last two feel most like me but I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve made salary 4K+ a month.

I feel like it‚Äôs now or never moment, if I don‚Äôt do anything about it I‚Äôll be stucked at jobs I don‚Äôt enjoy doing with shit salary",Jgruszka94,0,0.25,1,1724160812,2024-08-20 13:33:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ewvoyg/30yo_male_with_too_many_ideas_and_lack_of_skills/,8,2024
1ewvnt1,Reference Problem,"Hello,

Can you guys help me out? I just graduated, am currently applying to internships and some of them require 3 (!!) references. I have two pretty good references from professors but I am struggling to find a third. 

The only boss I had is not answering my e-mails, so I can't use him as a reference, and I don't know anyone else there because it was a really short remote internship. I was in clubs during uni but I didn't know the people running them and they definitely do not remember me. I even asked the university career advisors but they said no way because they ""aren't familiar with my work""

I did work at a part-time restaurant last summer and was wondering if a coworker there, who is also my friend and I trust him, could be a good reference. My other option could be TAs but I feel that would be way too academic.

1ewuwq7,Plan to Resign - Be Truthful or Lie?,"***Skip to the last paragraph to jump to the main question.***

I'm a subconsultant assigned to a new capital project every 3-5 years, working with new teams each time. Since November, I've been on a project that isn't a good fit, and I'd like to resign from the company I've been with for 13 years.

I have minimal interaction with my company during projects and report to the main consultant. Early on, the supervisor removed two inspectors and asked my company to have me temporarily fill the role, despite my lack of experience in that area. I declined due to liability concerns and because I already had my own job's responsibilities. Other issues include micromanagement, an inexperienced team, and a low raise.

The main problem now is the lack of flex time. I can't make up time by working through lunch or staying late and must use PTO instead. However, I've witnessed multiple instances of other employees who come late and leave early without issues to the point that I got tired of documenting it. I confirmed this via our daily sign in log book. Everyone signs in our normal start time whereas I'm the only one who has to write any time I've come in 10-15 minutes late. I reported this to my company and their response was because we're a subconsultant on the job there's nothing we can say or do. Basically ""be quiet and show up.""

I've dealt with a long commute - 1 hour in the morning, 90 minutes to 2 hours in the afternoon - because previous projects didn't mind as long as I did my job well. But these issues have convinced me it's not worth staying for another 3-4 years. My company will likely try to convince me to stay, but I believe it's too late to fix things. I requested transfer to another project twice and they've told me there isn't anything available, but will consider me when there is.

***Main Question:*** I'm considering lying about receiving a better offer with a higher salary and hybrid schedule because they wouldn't be able to counter it. If I tell the truth about the project not being a good fit, they'll keep trying to ""fix"" the situation, even though past efforts were half-hearted. Is there any problem with lying about getting a better offer?",dresssock,1,1.0,2,1724158816,2024-08-20 13:00:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ewuwq7/plan_to_resign_be_truthful_or_lie/,8,2024

1ewty8m,Leaving a 155k IT job,"After more than a year and a half of getting rejected and lied to by companies and recruiters, respectively, I finally got the ‚Äúdream job‚Äù in IT. Remote, 2.3k a week, constant dread that I will get fired any second, Slack messages that start at 4 am, Slack messages that arrive at 1 am, requests from non-technical salespeople that aren‚Äôt tethered to reality, yaddayaddayadda. I wanted this job because I thought I could work in Spain with the high salary of an American IT worker but now I know that you can‚Äôt work W-2 and get a foreign visa. So now I know that the thing that I struggled for so long for isn‚Äôt even something that will get me what I want in life.
I‚Äôve been working with the company for almost a year. Before August 6th, I had a disgusting salary agreement with a third-party company that gave them 60% of my salary. I was with them because they suckered me into believing that they could help me get a job. Fast forward to August 6th, and I paid 15 thousand to buy my way out of the revenue-splitting contract. That company was supposed to help me with the job once I started. They did but after a while it became obvious that I had more knowledge about how to solve my problems just because I was exposed to the companies unique problems far more than the people who were supposed to be helping me.
I‚Äôm not optimistic that my current company will allow me to work 1099 and get a visa to work in Spain. So now I think I‚Äôm just going to have to teach English over there, make no money, and ask people in Spain if I can get a job (preferably in IT but anything would suffice) so that I can stay long term and make a liveable wage. 
So now I‚Äôm just thinking that I have to stay at my current company and build up savings. Paying the people who had me in a revenue splitting contract took out every dollar in my checking account. I know that it‚Äôs unlikely that I will find any job that pays remotely close to 2.3k a week (after taxes).

My first option was to become a psychiatrist (or a psychiatrist and psychologist at the same time) as psychology is a subject i am interested in. It makes good money, but takes 12 years just to officially become one! I don't want to spend 12 years studying as I want to enjoy my 20s too. 

Same goes for my second option: a dermatologist. Good skin is beautiful and i guess it is a something I'm interested too. Makes good money (more than a psychiatrist but doesn't make much during the starting years) but it takes 12 years to officially become one too. 

My third option is to become an investment banker! It takes i think up to 7 years to become one and the salary gradually increases through the years. 

I have also thought about doing something business related but i am afraid that it won't suit me very well.

1ewpo21,Should I pursue an Accounting masters degree or just apply to jobs with my finance degree?,"Let me explain some background on here. I graduated from undergrad in 2021 and I haven‚Äôt been able to find a job in the finance industry because of the state of the job market, the fact that companies for some unforesaken reason require experience for entry level jobs and because Covid happened when I sss supposed to be getting an internship and everything shut down. 

That being said, I am in a precarious situation where everything seems to be tumbling down. I am about to no longer be covered by my dads really good insurance anymore, I am still stuck working a dead end retail job, and I am in debt from my undergrad. 

I strongly feel that networking with alumni and companies at a pretty good sized university for an accounting masters is one of the only ways at this point to find a job. 

I have chosen accounting because of its stableness, it‚Äôs relation to finance and the earning potential. I think that given the right price, the ROI of getting my CPA and finishing the classes required for it will be well worth it.

I accepted the new position without fully understanding the pay due to a miscommunication (longer hours & inclusive of government mandated ‚Äòsalary sacrifice‚Äô which is usually omitted here when an employer advertises salary pay) When I got the paperwork it turned out to be about a 10K USD paycut to my previous job but I figured it was worth it anyway, even if it was just an interim job while I looked elsewhere. 

For the first year I made 28K USD (after tax). I also received the credentials to be certified for the role (paid for by my sister, about 1k I think). However, according to the government the minimum wage for the role should be about 32K (enforced by workers rights). 

 I asked for a salary negotiation once I hit 12 months. 

When I brought this up to her she was initially very frustrated. She explained that she is generous already and that the business isn‚Äôt profitable yet, already ‚Äòowing her‚Äô 30K. I told her I understood, but that I was still being underpaid I couldn‚Äôt afford to live on such a low salary in this economy. She agreed to raise my salary once I finished my accreditation in line with the government minimum, but overall seemed angry I‚Äôd asked. she told me not to worry about my current wage because I won‚Äôt be on here forever and that the business gets more profitable every year and i will increase in line with it. 

It is important to note she gifted me her partners old car (worth about 13K) after she upgraded him to a BMW. She is also very generous with family dinners etc. While I‚Äôm incredibly thankful for this, I find frustrating to try to seperate my sister and my boss.
I‚Äôm very grateful for the car (it‚Äôs like the perfect car) but I didnt need it, I had to pay 2K just for the insurance on it (which is a lot to me!) and obviously I didn‚Äôt feel I had the option to sell the car and turn it into a direct profit since it was a gift. It was never mentioned in relation to work or in lieu of salary.

At her primary company, my role pays about 80K usd. I‚Äôm not expecting those numbers, but I do feel a bit spread thin at the startup and underpaid. I‚Äôve taken a step back and tried to work more in line with my pay rate and my sister hasn‚Äôt complained. 

But a contact in the arts just asked me to come in to interview with them for an upcoming contract. 

At this point, I‚Äôm at a crossroads. I‚Äôm not sure how much longer I should be considering working for her when I know I could make more inthe field I studied for.

I like WFH, and I don‚Äôt mind my job most of the time, but I definitely do not enjoy it enough to sustain a low wage. I don‚Äôt know if I should be basing my career decisions off or ‚Äòmaybe my rich sister will help me get a good position‚Äô. Especially since I‚Äôm not sure how well I would be able to get a high paying career at another company since I do not have an undergraduate degree in finance. Each year outside of the field I studied makes it harder for me to get back in. 

Would you stick it out, knowing there could be a good position in the family business waiting for you? My other sister also works in the same field with no degree making about 200k.

1ewodhg,Controversial career take?,"Controversial take

Here is a throw away account because I really need to get this off my chest.

TLDR: Networking goes both ways, if you didn‚Äôt help someone at their low point, don‚Äôt expect any kindness when you need help

Here‚Äôs my story: I was job searching the entire time while I was in my MBA program. One of the things I did in hopes of landing a job was joining a professional networking group while I was applying for jobs. The networking group was specific to the concentration that I was studying for my MBA and i met so many professionals during that time. Everytime I go to one of these events, I would have a stack of my resume, introduce myself and hand them out. During this time I met a guy whom I‚Äôve seen in several events. He runs a company where he offers workshops to companies, I still remember telling him if any of his connections is hiring, then please help look out for me. I also sent him a LinkedIn message with a pdf version of my resume where he left me on read. 

I later interviewed with another company for an entry level position. The hiring manager took me around the office after the interview and introduced me to all of the people that worked under him, told me the room where I would work, I left the building thinking I got the job. Two weeks later, I got a rejection email. 

There was also another instance where I happen to have met this guy who worked for a medical device company that I really wanted to get into, he completely brushed me off at a networking event. Didn‚Äôt make an effort to continue the conversation that I started with him. 

Anyways, after all of this struggle, I ended up finding a job at a much larger company in the same industry as the guy who showed me around the office. I updated my LinkedIn and the guy that interviewed me sent me a message and told me that I ‚Äúlanded a gold mine‚Äù with this job and not to ‚Äúforget the little people in the industry‚Äù. I proceed to get three more promotions within several years at this company and every time I do, this guy messages me. I finally left the industry and got a job at a FAANG. He then messages me again of something similar.

The guy who owned the small business finally messages me for the first time after all these years and told me how he uses my new company as an example all the time of being the leader in the industry. How he may ‚Äúbe able to support my work‚Äù. Told me he‚Äôs still running workshops.

And then there‚Äôs the guy at the medical device company. He got laid off in 2021 from that company and proceeded to get laid off two more times with the other two jobs he got after. Karma is hitting this guy hard because I‚Äôve seen him on LinkedIn literally commenting on every single post he sees that‚Äôs hiring for a position with his website that contain his resume. He also made a post about how he is looking for a position and his network is his most ‚Äúvaluable resource‚Äù. I often wondered other than me, if he had also brushed other people off throughout his career as well. And if he didn‚Äôt, would he have landed a job through his network by now? 

All these three instances I shared had one thing in common, they all waited till a rainy day to start networking and it was too late. Networking are like relationships in life, it goes both ways and you can‚Äôt expect people to only be there when you need them and you were not willing to be there when they needed you. I know they were not obligated to help me. But the fact that they only come crawling after I became something of value is kind of sad. 

On the other hand, let‚Äôs talk about this pragmatically. Because I can also understand people who don‚Äôt want to refer others because if they suck then it can tarnish their name. Here‚Äôs my take on this mindset: referrals are the same as resumes. It‚Äôs supposed to get you into the interview. The rest is supposed to be on the interviewee and the hiring manager. Theres very few exception to this rule, but most should never hire another person based on someone‚Äôs words. 

On a value perspective: referring someone can help you gain a lifetime loyalty from that person most of the time. People will always remember that. And as a college grad, you are literally starting from zero, your career can only go up from there. I can understand if you don‚Äôt want to help someone in their mid or end of their career because you feel like you might not gain value from that. But with college student, you almost have nothing to lose since they are starting out from zero.

Anyways, moral of the story is: always remember where you started and a little bit of kindness goes a long way for the other person and your future self.

1ewnp14,My boss treats me different as compared to my colleagues ,"I (25f) recently joined the marketing department of a insurance company as a writer. It's been 5 months and everything has been good. My manager has been great and we get along. In these 5 months things have been healthy. 

The rest of the marketing team feels overworked. It seems he contacts after work hours, on weekends and even when they're on leave. The other people arent writers, so they're roles are different. During my interview, I made sure to ask about all these things and he told me that it wouldn't be as such. And it hasn't been like that for me. He has not bothered me outside work hours like the others.

I do have to say that my work ethic is good. I deliver on time every time, I do what I say I will do, I keep him in the loop, I don't engage in office gossip, I come early and leave early and get EVERYTHING done, prioritise whatever he asks and I also make sure to ask about his family and children to be cordial.

Though I know I'm a good worker, I have to think that it cannot be that everyone complains that he's a workaholic and doesn't over work me (though I made it clear in the interview about my expectations) I never waste time at work or hang out with my coworkers so as to get things done. 

My co workers do like him as a person. He has a good nature, it's just the over working that comes up which I have yet to face.

I really like the way things are rn and I like my job but I am anxious for the future. In case, the mask slips how should I handle it?

1ewj761,Struggle finding/deciding a career - Would like input!,"I am a student at university (21F) graduating with my Bachelors degree in finance and a minor in Econ. I am very proud of myself of getting towards the end of my degree, believe me. But the past 3 years of going to school has got me busy. Between working 30 hrs a week during the school year and trying to stay social, my GPA isn‚Äôt great. It‚Äôs at a 2.5, so not something I‚Äôm bragging about.
Before I even started University, I had gotten my CNA license at 18 and I was initially going to school for neuroscience because that was a field that interested me and I wanted to go to med school but I didn‚Äôt have enough confidence to pursue something like medical school cause who do I think I am? Now the my GPA that will probably never be a possibility so I settled to start thinking about PA school but then I was unsure and thought ‚Äúif I want to go in the medical field shouldn‚Äôt I just go to med school?‚Äù ‚ÄúBut can I really balance med school for the most important half of my 20s?‚Äù I want a family, a house, kids, and I‚Äôm scared I would spread myself too thin with either of these options?!
I eventually settled on getting my degree in Finance because I felt that ‚Äúif I didn‚Äôt understand finance I can‚Äôt understand the world‚Äù. Which I understand is both a true and untrue statement. As for my major choice for med school/ PA applications I did a lot of research before choosing my major and I understand that I can have any degree I want I would just have to do the prerequisites for med school (which I feel like I would personally crush because I‚Äôm better at theoretical math and chemistry). 
I am currently working at a large bank as a teller and make decent money. In my free time I like to read macroeconomic articles, psychology articles, design articles, politics, and technology/biotech articles. 
I bring this all up because I‚Äôve had an internal debate with myself whether or not I should stay in a Financial career path or deviate into a healthcare related field, or completely deviate entirely from both and start clean. I just keep thinking, ‚Äúdo I have a talent here that could benefit the greater good? Am I using my creativity and smarts to my fullest extent? Am I limiting myself?‚Äù 

Here are some ideas that I‚Äôve felt very strongly (equally) about:

1. Continue my path in the Financial Sector
I could study and try and get my CFA and end up doing financial analyst work.

2. Take prerequisites for med school/PA school and do well on all of those classes. Then go on to study and prepare for the MCAT. Then eventually go on to work in aesthetics, dermatology, or surgery. (I understand specialties come with time but that would be the direction I would try to go in) 

3. Try and get into Nursing school (seems competitive) and become an aesthetics/dermatology/OR nurse.

4. Try to make my own custom home building company. I‚Äôm very interested in architecture and design. 

5. Pilates instructor ( am probably gonna do anyway cuz I like it ) 


Any other recommendations? Or advice? I just feel lost.

I have my first interview after months of unemployment. I was fired from my last position by upper management.

1ewj3xz,Manager is transferring before my potential promotion,"The past few weeks my manager and I have been talking about submitting me for a promotion this fall. The process starts in early September and she‚Äôs been great about helping me make my case (large 10k+ employee company, tons of bureaucratic bullshit).

Today we had an ‚Äúemergent meeting‚Äù where she announced she‚Äôs accepted another position within the company and will be leaving in 6ish weeks.

I‚Äôm worried my promotion chances are shot. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs able to still put me up for it. I‚Äôve been underpaid since I came back to this company 2 years ago (union screwed me). The salary position I took was technically a lateral move but I still got a 5k bump. However, I‚Äôm still 10k shy of what I should have been making, and probably 20k shy of what I SHOULD be making.

If I miss my chance at promotion, I won‚Äôt get another until September of next year.

1ewitxg,Advice on moving on from current company. ,"I am reaching a crossroad in my career and really think I would like a change but looking for some outside perspective. At the moment I have my CDL and Hazmat endorsements, driving for a local propane company. My current yearly income is around $52,000 before taxes. I have been feeling unsatisfied in my job and also would like to make a jump to higher pay and get out of a pretty toxic work environment. My goal is to ideally make $85,000 + and have a hybrid/remote role where I can spend a bit more time at home. 

I decided that I have run my course breaking my back for what really is next to nothing pay this day in age, and let my boss know 3 weeks back I would be looking for something else but wanted to give him plenty of heads up to prepare for the winter. (busy season in propane) He then breaks the news to me that he will be retiring soon and was curious if I would be interested in training to take over his spot as district manager which pays around $75,000 a year. I let him know that I would hear his boss out and the proposal they can come up with but never once told him yes because I really don‚Äôt enjoy the environment or coworkers I would be surrounded by. 

On one hand I think it would be great experience to have on my resume to further take to other companies in the future, but also I feel like the bump in pay isn‚Äôt quite what I expected considering all the extra work that I would have to do, including working weekends/on call and probably 55 hour work weeks. I really am pretty set on not taking the position because for $75,000 a year it does not seem worth sacrificing so much of my time to be at a place I don‚Äôt enjoy or feel like I am being paid fairly. There has been many things in the past year in a half I won‚Äôt get into that have really left a bad taste in my mouth with the company and feel that us drivers are not respected. 

My wife has also been CRUSHING it at her new job that she started after me and has gotten significant raises and I feel as if I would like to contribute more. She is now making around $200,000 a year. With this she has proposed I leave my current job and take some time off for the fall/winter to really focus on getting my resume built up and dial in what I would like to do with my life and find a better job. My fear is that having my last year and a half being a driver it will be really hard to get my foot in the door to get a job that checks at least some of the boxes. 

Not too sure what I am asking for, I am just afraid to make the wrong decision. Do I suck it up and take this job I really don‚Äôt want that doesn‚Äôt pay what I believe it is worth but get some experience as a DM or should I take my wife up on the offer and risk entering a job market and not finding something that gives me more fulfillment/better pay?

My skills: 
1. Some decent C#, 
2. Decent but more than C# SwiftUI basic swift. 
3. Very good at art but even though I have a daily contribution to my Art Station page, no ""professional"" pieces to catch a studio. Even for an internship. 
4. MySQL. The least of the technical skills. 
5. Very musical. Have considered a YT music page, and also have decent connections in that community. But no songs produced or uploaded yet. But started. 
6. At least a short story's collection worth of, short stories lol. I love writing. But nothing published. 

And I've had two businesses years ago that ended pre tty poorly. So I would love some thoughts on these. Tbh, I don't really. Cheers.

1ewioga,"Great recruiter screening last Thursday, but still haven't set up an interview. When should I follow up?","I got laid off through no fault of my own a few weeks ago and I have been hitting the ground running with applying to jobs and networking. I had a recruiter screening last Thursday for a position I am really interested in, and the recruiter made it sound like I was already on the short list of candidates they were considering and that they were ""really excited"" I had applied for the position. She also asked me about availability this week for an interview, and I told her I was flexible. She then said she was going to follow up with the hiring manager and get back to me.

It is now Monday evening and I still have not heard anything. I sent a quick ""thank you"" email on Thursday afternoon with no response. I know it has only been three business days since our conversation, but it is odd to get radio silence after they seemed so excited about me. Do I need to be more patient about this? When would it be appropriate for me to follow up about my status?

I know it is important to not get married to a jobs you apply for. I do have two interviews set up this week for other positions, but the above position is the one I am the most excited about and I think I would be a great fit.

With the recent struggles the creative industry is going through (AI, layoffs, etc‚Ä¶), I‚Äôm afraid of even touching my LinkedIn account.

I mostly just wanted to vent to strangers rather than to people I know, because I‚Äôm afraid of being judged by them. How do I get past this fear of even looking for places to apply to?

1ewgjiq,How soon is too soon to ask about remote or hybrid opportunities in the interview process?,"I have an upcoming interview that's just really an initial screening with HR. While I really need a job, their office is realistically about an hour away from home in heavy traffic, in an area that is reasonably bad with crime/homelessness/drugs. That's something I can't see myself doing daily, as I'd be committing an extra 3 hours a day of my just to getting ready and commuting... not to mention the weekly cost of a full tank of gas or more. 

It'd be a dealbreaker for me if it's a 9-hour-a-day, 5 days a week in office... and its an ad agency, where long hours are often a thing. I'm worried I'm asking for literally no life if they can't let me work from home more often than not. And I can't afford to move closer, nor would I want to, it's a dangerous and old area compared to where I own my house now.

Otherwise the company has a reputation for being a good place to work, so I'm interested. I don't want to waste their time in a series of interviews just to tell them ""listen, I already knew I was never going to drive this far, sorry.""

1ewepjq,Millennial Daughter's surprising expectations,"Throwaway account here.  
My 26 year old daughter moved to NYC 3 years ago after graduating college.  
She worked initially as a bartender, hostess, server in restaurants but wanted a more predictable schedule.

She applied to lots of jobs, without much success until a month ago when she got an Admin Asst. job at a start up in Brooklyn. (YAY!! So proud of her!!) She started on July 11.

She's planning a trip to California next month.

She's complaining about the management of the start up, venting to me about her perceptions of the owners and her responsibilities. 

I'm taken aback. I haven't been an Admin Asst in 30+ years, but at the time I was, I did not expect to take time off for at least a year. I came up in a time when jobs were hard to get and I was just grateful to not be unemployed.  I think it's normal for folks in their 20s to be a bit know-it-all but I don't know that I would have thought I knew better how to run a business than the owners when I was 26.

Do Millennials expect that they can take time off so soon after getting a job?

 Is this something you, as the boss of Millennials, find frequently? Is it something you accept because it's so hard to find staff?

My current role, which I‚Äôve had for over 5 years now, is in an incredibly toxic environment with an incredibly toxic boss. It‚Äôs had an outsized negative I mpact on my mental health and really all other areas of life.

However, I feel like I have to keep this job. It pays much better than anything I could get locally (I moved for this role) which lets me provide for my family and pay for my kid‚Äôs school. It‚Äôs remote which is great for flexibility and it gives me some credence/standing in the community which I feel is good as my kid gets involved in school and other activities. Plus the job market sucks right now. 

But over the last year - I‚Äôve realized this boss in particular is killing my soul. I‚Äôve lost all of my confidence, motivation and ambition. I feel like an empty shell/ghost of my former self.

My emotions are all over the place, it‚Äôs getting harder to concentrate at work, and I‚Äôm just sad, depressed and angry all the time. It‚Äôs really bad. I‚Äôm making poor decisions at work and feel like my reputation is going to tank at some point.

What do I do? Try to get on some antidepressant medication or something? Everything just feels hopeless.

1ewdnt3,Torn between two jobs ,"Basically, I (28F) am torn between two jobs, one that I currently have and the other I have a start date for. 

Job 1 is my current job. I work at a big box retailer making schedules, conducting new hire orientations, and planning associate engagement events. I have a rotation where I work 6 days in a row, followed by Sunday and Wednesday off on the off week. I work all holidays (minus Thanksgiving and Christmas). 

Job 2 is the one I'm thinking about leaving Job 1 for. I already have a start date and just haven't put in my notice for Job 1. Job 2 is a data entry / administrative assistant position. I would work Monday through Friday, no weekends, and have all major holidays off (including Good Friday and Black Friday, which I found cool). It is closer to my house. The only draw back is it pays 50 cents less per hour than Job 1. 

Job 1 is starting to make me constantly sick and nervous. I try to have conversations with my store manager about hiring and events to plan, but I often get shoved aside for managers and then have to do everything at the very last minute. I dread conducting new hire orientations. I've met (I feel like) every type of person, and it's just not the field I see myself in anymore. I've been in hiring/recruitment for almost 3 years now, and I don't think it's the field for me. I work retail admin, so it's kinda niche with no room for growth in the company, unless I want to switch from admin to department supervisor or manager, which I am not interested in. The inconsistency is driving me crazy. 

Job 2 is giving my family red flags. My fiance doesn't trust them because HR told me after my second interview on a Friday that I would hear something back by Monday. I didn't hear back until Thursday. Then HR wanted to verify employment and references for me after I received an offer letter. I sent everything to them and followed up 3 days later asking if they had received everything, both via email and phone. I didn't hear back from HR for 3 more days. HR says they have everything they need now, that we're good to start, and will let me know if they need anything else. I tried explaining to them that sometimes things get hectic in HR and that sometimes they don't get to respond as timely as they'd like to. 

I don't know what to do. Of course, starting a new job is always nerve-racking, but my family's distrust of the new job combined with them wishing I'd stay where I am makes me overthink leaving Job 1, which has been the goal the whole time. 

In your opinion, should I stay with Job 1 and tough it out or branch out with Job 2? 

Any opinions are appreciated. Thank you! ",glennjaminhow,1,1.0,0,1724102759,2024-08-19 21:25:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ewdnt3/torn_between_two_jobs/,8,2024
1ewdlol,Is it reasonable to request a hotel instead of waking up at 5am to travel to a meeting?,"My work has required me to attend a conference next week which lasts all day and starts at 9am. 

As I don‚Äôt drive, I‚Äôll have to get a bus at 5:30am to the train station, get the earliest train from my town to London, transfer in London and take another train, then get a bus from that train station to the work conference. 

I told my manager that I think I should just get a hotel the night before near the conference and he said that a lot of people wake up at 5am for work and that he couldn‚Äôt justify paying for a hotel out of the budget.

I work hybrid, two days a week in London which I manage fine, there was nothing in my job description about needing a car/having a driving licence and these work conferences happen a couple of times a year in different locations.

Am I being a baby by wanting to get a hotel? Should I just suck it up?

1ewd8um,Unsure of my options around gardening..?,"Hey, I've graduated from highschool a few years ago, got okay grades. Nothing crazy good or bad. Worked a handful of mediocre jobs back and fourth. Never pursued school as I didn't want to commit to studying for something I wasn't confident I'd love.

But I've gardened personally for a few years, and I've started doing it for a few people around my neighborhood. I take care of the plants: Watering, weeding, maintenance like seasonal trimming and deadheading, designing landscape areas like what plants go where during the planting season, figuring out what's wrong with certain ones ect.

In time I've learned that this hobby is something I can truly see myself doing in the long term, and I'd enjoy to as work. I've debated on going into college for horticulture.. but there are no schools or programs around where I live for that. And I'm not comfortable moving to be honest or living on campus. There is an agricultural science program near me but.. I don't know what jobs that would even really bring me.

An internship or apprenticeship is much more up my alley, but I don't even know what to search for. If I put in landscaping into a search, it's just a million landscape companies that mow yards. 

I really want to move forward and up career wise in some kind of outdoor path, physical labor and working in that environment brings me a lot of happiness and peace. I'd love to work with plants, or animals even. Gardening is just something I have more personal experience in.

You‚Äôd think the people at the top would have a clue about what‚Äôs happening on the ground, right? Nope.

It‚Äôs like they either have no idea what‚Äôs going on or, worse, they‚Äôre pretending everything‚Äôs fine.

No strategy, they don't believe in marketing, and they keep rolling out products that fall flat because they‚Äôre obsessed with margins over making something consumers actually want. 

It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre actively choosing to be out of touch.

I‚Äôm out here providing a solid, fact-based roadmap, and they‚Äôre just in denial. They react to any bad news like it‚Äôs a personal attack and get all defensive, treating me like I‚Äôm some misbehaving puppy.

1ewc4aw,Laid off from dream job and looking for career advice ,"I was laid off from writing music for video games just before Christmas of last year. It was an incredibly rare full -time WFH role, so I don't want to wait around for a similar one. Before that, I spent nearly decade writing music for random indie games and TV shows, and making ends meet with teaching music on the side. It's time to work a more solid job, and I'd love some advice. I'm currently considering:

- Technical Sound Design for games (My resume has some street cred here, but these roles are only slightly less rare than music roles. Also the games industry is going through some pretty massive layoffs.)

- IT (cloud engineering or something similar, which I heard you don't need a degree to get into)

- Data Analytics (also heard you don't need a degree to get into, and pays well)

- Union Electrician (don't have to pay for school, but physically demanding w/ no WFH option)

  
My basic question is this: Do I aim for Technical Sound, despite the downsides, since my resume has some work already geared toward that? Or, do I do something like a bootcamp and try to get into tech, where I have very little experience? Trades work is plan C.  (No shade to electricians, I'm just not very strong or handy.)",StrongAddition9087,1,1.0,1,1724099039,2024-08-19 20:23:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ewc4aw/laid_off_from_dream_job_and_looking_for_career/,8,2024

Hello I am at a juncture in my new engineering career and looking for some external oppinions on my situation.
 
Background: Graduated in 2023, Studied Materials Science Engineering and Math

Previous internship experience is in semicondcuctor manufacturing for a company that makes the most popular calculator used by engineering students.

Postgrad I started a new job as a Product Engineer at a small R&D Company in Boston working in Semiconductor Manufacturing taking an R&D
(science experiment) product and getting it ready to move into a full scale productoin line. I worked on standardizing our work instructions, Process improvments and automated data collection/SPC as well as documentation of processes.
 
Over the past year I have realized the Boston metro area is not for me and am looking to move back home to the NYC metro area.
 
Ideally I would want to end up in the cleantech sector in NYC and have had some prelim conversatoins with some startup companies, but would be open to any engineering job in New York.
 
I am open to any suggestions as the market for non software engineering jobs in NYC seems to be quite small. What do Engineers in NYC do/what did your careeer path look like? I see many people on linkedin that ended up doing product managment.
 
My long term plan is to work in engineering for a few more years (hopefully in startup cleantech) then go to MBA to work in Venture Capital/Finance. Is this feasable/have people done this before? any advice would be greatly appreciated.",humblebrag1217,1,1.0,0,1724096980,2024-08-19 19:49:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ewb8ml/engineering_career_advice/,8,2024

1ewanpr,I own a business but I am considering selling to pursue a more linear career.,"I'm a bit of an odd bird.

When I was a teenager, I left my abusive household and started a karate school at 18. I launched the school in a hotel meeting room, where I also lived. After a year, I moved into a storefront, which I owned for 5 to 6 years before selling it when I was diagnosed with Lyme disease.That illness pretty much halted my career, and I was out of the workforce for about a year or two.

 During that time, I made money through side hustles and from the sale of my business. I wanted to explore a different career field and tried working several odd jobs‚Äînothing too serious, just low-stress and fun.After living in a major city, I decided to move back to a beach town for a lower-stress lifestyle and started another school there. Starting the business with very little money was stressful, but I managed to get it off the ground and make a decent living.That said, running it has left me feeling burned out and filled with a sense of dread about the future.


 I'm making decent money, but it‚Äôs a pain. I know if I stay consistent, I should make a good living within another year, but I'm curious if I should switch careers while I'm still young enough to make the change.I've noticed my relationship is falling apart, and mentally, I'm not doing well. 

My girlfriend is feeling the stress from my work.Should I consider a different career path, or is this just burnout signaling that I need to make a change?I'm approaching 30, and the dread of getting older is definitely kicking in. My business has made me $120k to $150k a year in the past, and I'm set to do around $80k this year, my second year in business. 

By the third year, I imagine I'll be back to $120k to $150k.The idea of sales sounds appealing to me.I don‚Äôt have a degree‚Äîjust a high school education and a decade of business experience.

1ew9vu0,Workplace Tension Advice ,"Background: I have been with my current company for a little over a year. When I first started 2 months in our comms manager was hired by a different org and I was essentially told I would be running socials until a replacement was found. 

From about May-Dec 2023 I was running our social accounts, creating social copy/implementing vid content ideas. In addition to the normal tasks I do in my role.

2. Since this was discovered my manager and our comms manager have gotten very passive aggressive and honestly weird with me almost as if they resent me? When all of our interactions have been fine prior to ""this"" which I don't get why is bad???

She was shocked by this and asked the manager why not me instead. Well my manager said that I didn‚Äôt sound like I wanted a promotion.

1ew8u1o,Interviewing for a new role - the hiring manager is connected to my current boss on LinkedIn. Should I be worried?,"I‚Äôm currently at a role I‚Äôm pretty satisfied with but I have an interview coming up for another job I‚Äôm interested in with better pay, benefits, PTO etc. I have the HR screening coming up soon and if I pass, then the interview with the hiring manager.

This is for a senior manager role which will be reporting in to the CRO. The company itself is smaller - around 300ish people. My concern is that the CRO is connected on LinkedIn with the person I‚Äôm reporting to now, the CRO of my current company. I should note that this is an interim line of reporting as I used to report to a Director who is no longer with the organization. While a replacement is being hired, I‚Äôm temporarily reporting to the CRO directly.

I‚Äôm a little anxious that if the interview gets to the latter stages, the CRO of the company I‚Äôm interviewing for may reach out to my current boss. I don‚Äôt even know if they actually know each other; just that they‚Äôre connected on LinkedIn. 

Am I worrying needlessly? Would a CRO actually reach out to another CRO and ask about someone in a manager role? For all I know this could just be a case of one CRO adding a random connection cause that‚Äôs just how LinkedIn is sometimes. I just don‚Äôt want my current CRO getting the idea that I‚Äôm looking to jump ship and then go about replacing me.

1ew8p7b,Working after my last day because my boss didn‚Äôt listen to me,"First of all, the only reason I began looking for a new job is because my boss said she was laying me off. She let me list her as a reference for everything. But after I submitted applications, she decided she wanted to keep me and asked me to stay. I am paid well below market rate and she refused to give me a raise she had already promised, so I continued to apply. I had 5 interviews. In my field, it is very uncommon to get an interview but not an offer. We are unicorns. The only job I ended up getting was the only job that did not contact her for a reference. There was even one job that told me they were going to extend me an offer but just needed to check my references. I didn‚Äôt get that. So, I can‚Äôt prove anything but I‚Äôm already a little paranoid about my boss. 

I work 1-on-1 with clients and my boss is only paid for direct billable time I spend face to face with these clients. I typically have 8 to 9 hour-long appointments in a 10 hour day. It is more work than most people in my field have, and my boss always said, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre really busy but these clients truly need you‚Äù. 

However, that is not my only responsibility. I have to write long reports whenever I stop seeing a client, covering everything we‚Äôve worked on together.

I gave my boss 5 weeks notice because continuity of care is important to me. In that time, she continued to give me more clients. I told my boss that I had about 25 end-of-care reports to write and that I needed at least 2 days when I did not have clients so I could finish them. She actually tried to get me to stay longer because ‚Äúthey really need you‚Äù. In actuality, it does not matter whether my clients were getting a couple more sessions; significant progress cannot be made on that time anyway. 

She ended up only giving me 1 day without clients, and I was not able to finish the reports. When I told her I needed 2 days, that truly was a minimum.

It‚Äôs only been a week since my last day and she keeps contacting me asking if they‚Äôre done because it is costing so much money to keep my accounts open. 

She has also been very difficult when working with my new company to verify my employment, and it‚Äôs been delaying how quickly I get my new contract because she filled the form out incorrectly due to carelessness. She told me she filled out the form, but then the manager of my new work sent me what she sent me - a nearly blank form stating it was impossible to get the info they needed. But it‚Äôs not difficult. She has an electronic payroll system. I‚Äôve already started the job and don‚Äôt have my contract because of her delay. 

I feel like I can definitely just take as much time as I need and that 5 weeks notice was plenty of time to carve out time for me to write out these reports.

Can someone just validate me? I feel like I‚Äôve put in SO much work and been treated so crappy.",Maleficent-Tea7150,22,0.9200000166893005,33,1724090871,2024-08-19 18:07:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ew8p7b/working_after_my_last_day_because_my_boss_didnt/,8,2024

I have been working full time in a clinical laboratory since 2019, and I've considered leaving the field for a majority of reasons.

1ew7s7y,Are these red flags for a new job?,"I was given a start date of August 27 for an admin job. After HR gave me an offer letter, they wanted to verify my last three places of employment and speak to three references. I thought that was odd because I thought they'd check my references and employment before offering me a position. 

Also, HR told me after my second interview on a Friday that I'd hear back from her on Monday. I didn't hear from her until Thursday morning, almost a week after. I overlooked this because she simply may have been busy. 

Then, when I both called and emailed early last week confirming she'd received my references and employment verification, she didn't respond back to me for 3 days with an email. 

Is this delay normal or a red flag? My fiance and my mother said these are red flags and that I should stay with my current job as opposed to leaving it. 

The problem is that I am at my wits end with my current job. I conduct interviews and orientations at a big box retailer, as well as set up associate engagement events. The management team is beyond awful and leaves so much to me, despite the fact that I am technically not a manager. My schedule is erratic, and my hourly compensation is poor. 

This new job is 50 cents less per hour, but it's a data entry/admin job that's closer to home with weekends and holidays off. The benefits package is better than where I currently work too.

1ew72ut,Turning down a Job Offer for bad PTO policy,"I've been  a working professional out of college for about 20 years now. I recently received a job offer for a decent salary (less than what I'm currently making now, but it seemed fair for the job description). Their health benefits were less than desirable but my spouse has good insurance for myself and my two small children so it was a non-issue for me. The problem was their PTO policy. Commencing with the date of employment, every 3 months of work, you earned 5 PTO days for a maximum of 20 per calendar year. At the end of that calendar year, whatever time you did not utilize you forfeit (i.e. - if you're hired in September, then you earn 5 PTO days in December, but you only have 31 days to utilize them or you lose it. Beginning with January 1st every year, everyone's PTO goes back to zero. I knew with two small children I was never going to be able to comply with that PTO policy - so I politely explained my situation and asked if they would consider modifying it to provide some PTO upfront at the beginning of the calendar year, or at least allow me to carry over some of it so that I don't have absolutely none for the 1st few months of the year.  It was a swift & hard ""no"" and they rescinded the job offer. While I had already anticipated their response would be ""no"" - my bigger surprise was what sort of came with a ""offended"" tone in the e-mail? Offended that I would even consider asking them to negotiate something like PTO? Offended that I would have the audacity to ask them to budge on a PTO policy that seems almost draconian? Surely all job offers are expected to come with some negotiation and if you can reach an agreement great, if not, then it wasn't the right match for the job - but the defensive tone?

1ew6pwj,Which job offer would you accept?,"* **About me:** 15 years in CPG marketing. 10 with megacorp, then 5 with startups. 
* **End Career Goal:** CEO of food/bev brand you would see at Whole Foods. 

**THE OFFERS** *(All remote with some travel)*

**1. Sr. Director of Commercialization w/ Wildly Successful Food/Bev Startup**

* **Comp:** $200k + 20%, some equity. I've countered, might end up at $220k + 20%, $15k signing bonus. 
* **Pros:** Brand has the cool factor. Most closely aligned to my end career goal. 
* **Cons:** Broad scope including innovation (love) but also category mgmt, PMO. Wouldn't report to CEO, but SVP.  

**2. Senior Brand Manager w. Megacorp** *(potential for Director role)*

* **Comp:** $235k + 25%, $60k signing. I haven't countered yet. The challenge here is they love me and MAY have a Director role opening, but I'd have to turn down this SBM offer and wait to see if it materializes in \~3 weeks. 
* **Pros:** Very stable company. Very well-known brand. 
* **Cons:** Not the sexiest category (think consumer household staple). Doesn't directly align with my narrative of wanting to be a CEO of a whole foods brand startup. SBM title would be a lateral or step back, Director would be advancement. 

**3. VP Marketing w/ PE backed Food Manuf**

* **Comp**: TBD, likely $250k + 35%, plus equity and some signing. 
* **Pros**: PE backed which aligns with my end goal. 
* **Cons**: Brands aren't well known - basically a coman. High expectations - need a lot of help in marketing thought leadership (could also be seen as a pro I suppose).



**My plan:**

* Try to negotiate up and accept the offer for #1 (Cool Brand), but not announce on linkedin yet. It may be $50-$100k less than the other Y1 offers, but best step toward my end goal narrative. 
* Turn down SBM role at #2 (megacorp), but if they come back with Director role with significant comp ($275k + 30%, $75k signing?), seriously consider
* Wait on #3 (PE Manuf) offer, but likely turn down unless it's close to $300k

The problem is My country has an entrance exam based selection for medical school,and i didn't do well in this exam and hence wont get into it. My country has not even a single program for neuroscience.There are programs available for psychology,but obviously they are i say with confidence objectively not great.But since i am passionate about the subject,i didn't see that as an stop since.The problem is My marks have been high since childhood and hence considered a ""academically gifted student"" and every one an non-stem program in an coutnry like mine is a stupid decision both careerwise and economic wise. So the options left for me are either to apply foreign(USA) or to take a drop year for giving the entrance next year. Now,the dilemma is applying foreign is too competitive and i think i have silm chances,but i think i would enjoy the process and its very likely i will crack the entrance exam for med school next year but the reason i didn't crack it this time is beacuse i hated preparing the dry physics,chem,bio books,i dont hate med school neither those subjects,but i hate just rigourously praticing objective questions,i dont why but this process is already ruined for me,i just hate it. .So should i joing a very ""poor"" program just relying on my passion and not the economic anc career potention,or should i try to make this hateful process lit bit less hateful and someshow sacrifice this one year,for a good career ,or should i work to apply for USA,taking risk,which has the least chance of sucess,i will also have to study and work hard for it,but i think i will enjoy the process.Or is there any other alternative my thoughts haven't reached?",Aswasthama_2207,1,1.0,0,1724082663,2024-08-19 15:51:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ew5a25/what_is_my_best_option/,8,2024

1ew3kx0,Struggling to Get Back into Work After a Personal Tragedy ‚Äì Need Advice,"
Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm a 36F with a solid background in the marketing field. I used to be super motivated and excelled at my job, but a few years ago, I went through a really tough time. My father took his life, and I witnessed it. This led to severe depression, and my productivity took a hit. Instead of getting support, I was fired.

Since then, I‚Äôve had a hard time holding down a job due to my mental health and the impact of COVID and other factors that affected me over the last 5 years. Every time my confidence would take a massive hit and I think that was noticeable for a while. Finally, I ended up just getting a bartending job because I needed to make money and actually heal from my trauma without worrying about how to pay the bills and whatnot. Now, I‚Äôm finally feeling like myself again and am excited about everything we can do with ai - I even took a course on Ai and marketing. That said, it‚Äôs been about two years since I was in my last marketing related position‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm eager to get back to work, but I‚Äôm struggling to even get interviews despite putting a lot of effort into learning new skills, staying abreast of trends, tailoring my resume and engaging on LinkedIn. Etc.

My questions are:
‚ÄîHow can I address the employment gaps on my resume? Should I extend those roles I had over that time period so ATS programs don‚Äôt automatically disqualify me?
‚ÄîShould I be honest about my personal tragedy and mental health struggles over that time? Should I say I was fired?
‚ÄîAny tips or strategies for re-entering the workforce after a long break?
‚ÄîDoes my age (36F) matter, and how can I overcome any potential biases?

My manager informed me of a certain task that our team (me and her) had to complete. The task is to improve on a ‚Äúversion A‚Äù something that already exists, creating a ‚Äúversion B‚Äù that we will own. 

I haven‚Äôt been able to do it independently, so she went ahead and connected with her peers and found a solution. I was not part of those discussions. 

She then implemented the changes and gave me a very rough overview of what they were. I‚Äôm confident in my understanding of version A, but not all of version B. While I can execute version B, some assumptions were modified and I‚Äôm not on top of all the sources of information that were used. The overview I received was very chaotic.

She requested me to create a one pager that describes this new approach. Didn‚Äôt mention who the audience was specifically- only that it‚Äôs senior leadership.

I prepared a draft in a word doc and shared it with her. Again, I‚Äôm confident in my understanding of the broad methodology, but I expected that there would be tweaks, since not all details were communicated to me.

My manager got clearly frustrated with me, to the point of accusing me of lying about having understood the original methodology (version A). She was upset that I didn‚Äôt know this was supposed to be in a slide. She gave me very specific instructions on what words to use and where everything should be on the slide. I communicated that I stand by what I wrote but I‚Äôm happy to improve it. I also said that I was not comfortable presenting her work. 

The conversation ended at an impasse. She then did the slide herself and re-iterated that I should review version B. She said that she is doing this for me so that I get visibility within the org. 

I‚Äôm now requested to present her work using her slide. I think this is very weird and I feel  awkward but don‚Äôt want to start a battle for no good reason.

When we last spoke, I told her that I‚Äôm grateful but I‚Äôm not seeking visibility yet since I just started. Learning is more important to me. I reiterated that I‚Äôm happy to take on maintaining version B going forward, and will spend more time looking into it, but it doesn‚Äôt feel right to present her work.

All in all, this is causing me great discomfort. So much so that I‚Äôm typing this out on Reddit instead of working right now.

1ew11zf,Can I overlap 2 jobs? Please advise ,"It‚Äôs a long story. Basically I had given my notice to my job 3 weeks ago due to getting a new offer.

I got suspicious when I asked for paperwork certifying the $ amount for my matched salary with a date that this new salary would go into effect. I have it now in writing from a teams message. 

My new job would start next week. I know giving 2 weeks isn‚Äôt legally a requirement. If I give 2 weeks notice today at my current job, I‚Äôd have next week overlap with my new job.

1ew0umn,"I‚Äôm in an interesting situation, advice needed.","I‚Äôve been in recruiting for over 10 years. I started in agency and have since bounced between in-house and agency recruiting roles. Well, my previous role was as an internal recruiting manager with a large financial services organization. We were remote, flexible work hours, excellent culture, great salary, you name it. I had been there for close to 5 years and never thought I was going to leave. Unfortunately, last year was very difficult for this particular industry and my organization ends up laying off 20% of its corporate workforce‚Ä¶

It took about 5 months to land something new. I‚Äôm now back with the agency that I was with immediately before my last role whom i was with for 3 years. Every day reminds me why I got out. Every day I absolutely dread. I‚Äôm not in my mid 30s, wife, kids, mortgage, the whole deal. I‚Äôm putting in 60-70/hrs a week, I throw in a couple of work hours on Sunday just to get ahead. Additionally, I have to drive 100 miles per day, 3 days a week to get into the office. Some days I don‚Äôt even get to see my kids. Salary is mediocre, but I‚Äôm doing well enough that I can sit back and relax for Q4 and already well above the 100k mark. In any case, between the commute, the excessively long work hours, the and mind numbing work, my mental and physical health took an absolute nose dive. 

I interviewed with a company after my layoff that I was very interested in, it was going to be another remote role, salary aligned, all good. I accepted the verbal offer, but for whatever reason, they decided they were going to start moving folks in back in the office so we could no longer move forward. Interestingly, the Director of HR reached out and is very interested offered me a contract til the end of the year. 50/hr, flex schedule, remote, easy job fills. Unfortunately, no opportunity to go full time which is the only issue. I was planning on transitioning careers by end of year anyway outside of recruiting into a UX Design role but haven‚Äôt had any time to finish my portfolio and put any focus into my job search. 

So in all, if I accepted this short term contract, it would allow me to continue my job search in a more flexible work schedule, and all of the benefits of working from home. It would also get me out of a job I absolutely despise. However, in this job market, I am very concerned about any viable options moving forward so I‚Äôm asking for advice from you all. Thanks.

TLDR; in a role that sucks the soul out of you, expected to transition away from this job by EOY, but no time for job search because of current job. Offered a remote short term contract role with great company. Need advise on whether I should move forward with contract or suck it up in full time role.

1ew06oy,180¬∞ degree turn in my career: Does it make sense?,"Hi everybody, hope you are all fulfilled and happy :)

I would like to hear some strangers' opinions about my current situation, since everybody in my real life seems to be giving advice only based on how they will be impacted by my decision.

I (26F) got my engineering MSc one year ago (prestigious university, not US, not UK) and have been working in a small firm since then. I was never really convinced about the degree itself, but since I wasn't struggling too much I just decided to finish it (which I absolutely do not regret).

Already in the first months of my new job I knew something was missing. I decided to stick to it a bit longer but it just got worse. The colleagues are nice, the pay is ok, the projects are objectively interesting but I could not care less for them. I have absolutely 0 passion for this field and every day I just feel drained and annoyed about everything because nothing stimulates me or make me feel proud of what I do.

I thought about quitting and look for something else but the idea of sitting in an office all day working at a computer makes me want to cry. I hate the regular 9-5 M-F, I hate knowing exactly how my day is going to look like, I hate staring at the screen for 8h and not interacting with people, which I love to do.

Obviously I started to question my career direction and how fit I am for it. I started thinking that if I have to change jobs I should probably do something entirely different, or I will just end up somewhere similar and having the same complaints.

I always had a strong interest for medicine and the human body. Paired with my active and kind of chaotic lifestyle (where I thrive), I started looking into paramedic or nursing school. Both would last 3 years, with a big pay cut but still enough to live on and after that we are not talking about a much lower pay than my actual job. I shadowed a paramedic for one day and it was the most engaging day I had the last 1 year. It felt exactly like what I needed! I was so pumped after that.

(Almost) everybody in my life says not to do it. But I sincerely see no other way. What I studied is also a bit niche and it would be very hard to apply for consulting, banking, finance related stuff. And also the idea of getting another office job makes me want to throw up.

But I also see how demanding these other jobs can be. The hours would probably be longer and more physically demanding, I would be pushing big decisions (marriage, kids,...) 3 years into the future (but this right now does not feel like a loss) and I would lose 3 years of good investing/saving for retirement. Right now I could not care less about those things but I know I can be sometimes short-sighted and only think about present Me.

So, kind strangers, what do you think about this? Did someone of you have to make a similar decision? Do you regret what you chose? I would love to hear some wisdom!

1evyfka,Relied on AI,"I‚Äôm one week away from starting my senior year of college, majoring in computer science. And I feel like I‚Äôve made a huge mistake. I went into college unsure of what I wanted to do but I knew I liked math and enjoyed a computer lit class in high school that included a section on Scratch. At the start of my sophomore year I full sent into computer science with no prior coding knowledge. It was overwhelming and stressful. I was in classes with younger kids than me who had years of experience. it would take me days to complete projects that they could finish in under an hour.

Eventually I started to kinda get the hang of it and did okay. I still felt extremely stressed and inadequate compared to others but did ok. Later that semester I also faced severe health problems which caused me to be hospitalized for a while. Despite this I managed to pass my CS classes with an A and continued to the next semester. 

The next semester was one of my lowest in my life. I was constantly on the verge of tears and was the most stressed I had ever been. I didn‚Äôt feel like myself anymore due to the high stress from school and my health issues. I hit a breaking point. This coincidentally happened to be when I was introduced to ChatGPT. It was a relief to use it for a few assignments to get me through the tough times. But by the next semester I started relying on AI for everything. My grades suffered and I became lazy. I convinced myself that it was okay because my friends were doing the same exact thing. This continued until January of this year when I realized I was screwing myself 

Now, I find myself dependent on AI, and I regret using. Despite trying to handle my classes on my own this year my beginner level coding skills in 3rd year college courses weren‚Äôt cutting it. I‚Äôm in my final year I have a good GPA and will graduate. But I‚Äôm concerned about my ability to get a software job with my current skills.

I‚Äôve started using Codecademy but it seems like it only covers the basics. I need to solidify my skills at home alongside my senior year coursework to become a competent programmer. Can anyone recommend online programs or share their experiences if did something similar?

Also I am not considering changing majors or dropping out because I genuinely want to code. So don‚Äôt suggest that. I just need guidance

1evxv8q,Regretting the switch heavy,"Hey yall,

For some context, I changed jobs from Technical Engineer (DevOps) at a corporation that was paying me really well for my country's standards, around 2400$ per month. Worked for about a year.

I didnt really like my job at the corporation. It was extremely soulless and uninteresting, and I wanted to switch.

I was approached and got an opportunity to be a Product Manager for a startup. I knew the risks but I always wanted to be a product manager. It was a paycut, down to 1800$ after tax, but I thought I wouldn't mind it and did it thinking its good to become a PM at a young age to gain experience in it.

Its been 2 months since.

The startup's a complete mess. The CTO's stupid and makes horrible decisions. The CEO is constantly fighting with employees. And frankly the app is complete shit. I can try my best to fix it but there is no shot it competes with the monopoly in the local market. This company has absolutely 0 future.

I want to change jobs, but there's so many choices to make I have no idea what to do. I'd love to stay a PM, but companies rarely hire entry level PMs. Im a great software developer, so I wouldn't mind that, but wouldnt the multitude of roles on my CV turn people off? I know 2 months isnt alot so I dont know if i should omit my current job from my cv? Can i lie and say i was a software dev instead of a PM to help me find a job quicker? (Though they can see on LinkedIn im not a dev lol)

Im extremely stressed. I had a cushy job that despite being boring, was atleast paying me more and the company was very well known and respected. I have no idea what got into me. I regret it so much I can't express it to anyone but the internet. I just need advice on how to fix my situation. My old job already got a replacement so I can't ask them for my job back. I think i'm gonna keep applying to software dev and PM jobs, but I hope the variety of positions and my short tenures dont deter companies.",Practical_Race_3282,1,1.0,0,1724061379,2024-08-19 09:56:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1evxv8q/regretting_the_switch_heavy/,8,2024
1evxa64, Going back to uni at 35 in third world country worth it ? ,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 35-year-old family man living in a third-world country, and I'm at a pivotal point in my career. After finishing high school in the 2000s, I decided to study architecture. While there were parts of architecture school that I enjoyed, I always felt that something was missing‚Äîspecifically, subjects like math, physics, and computers. Despite graduating second in my class, this sense of incompleteness lingered.

After graduation, I worked mainly on drawing construction plans, which led me to the oil and gas sector, where I transitioned to a technical office engineer ( construction work) and then to a piping CAD designer. Although I preferred this engineering-oriented work over the artistic aspects of architecture, I soon found myself feeling unfulfilled and bored. I even turned down a project management role in medical equipment installation, preferring to stick with CAD design because I struggled to find interest in other aspects of the job. I've always been drawn to computers and software, I now feel a strong desire to shift my career in that direction.

This year, I decided to retake the Bac exam (high school diploma equivalent) to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering, thinking it would build on my experience in oil and gas piping. However, after passing the exam, I'm having second thoughts , and exploring alternatives that might better align with my interests.

I‚Äôm currently considering three options:

**Option A: Mechanical Engineering**

**Pros:**

* I already have a background in piping, which could lead to career advancement and better job opportunities. This path also complements my architecture degree.
* The program includes a good mix of math, physics, and computer science courses, potentially offering a fulfilling academic experience.

**Cons:**

* I might end up in the same type of work (construction/installation) that I‚Äôve grown tired of, especially since there's little real mechanical industry in my country‚Äîwe import most machinery and do minimal actual engineering.
* Continuing in this field might require working far from home, as job opportunities are often tied to specific locations.

**Option B: Computer Science**

**Pros:**

* I have a natural passion for computer science, and it suits my personality. I enjoy spending time with computers, troubleshooting, exploring Linux distros, and learning new software.
* Over the past year, I‚Äôve been self-learning web development through online resources like The Odin Project, completing basic projects and algorithms. I can genuinely see myself excelling in this field.
* There are numerous remote opportunities in computer science, and while harder to secure from my country, they are not impossible if I put in the necessary effort.

**Cons:**

* Computer science is something I could potentially learn without a traditional university degree, so I‚Äôm unsure if pursuing formal education at this stage is the best move.
* By the time I finish the program, I‚Äôll be around 38 to 40 years old, which might make it challenging to land junior-level positions.
* Starting a new career at this age, especially in a third-world country, feels risky and daunting.

**Option C: Electronics Engineering/Control**

**Pros:**

* This field has direct applications in the oil and gas industry, which aligns with my previous experience and could open doors to specialized roles.
* Electronics engineering/control is closely related to computer science, offering opportunities to work on automation, control systems, and other technology-driven areas that I‚Äôm passionate about.
* The skills learned could be versatile, allowing for potential crossover into various industries, including technology, making it a balanced choice between my interests and existing experience.

**Cons:**

* Like mechanical engineering, this path might also require working far from home, depending on the specific opportunities available.
* While it‚Äôs closer to computer science, it‚Äôs still a different discipline, so I‚Äôd need to carefully consider whether it fully satisfies my long-term interests.

Given that I‚Äôm capable of completing any of these programs, I‚Äôm seeking advice on which path might offer the best prospects for a fulfilling and sustainable career.

1evwvi6,Should I become a lawyer or do something else?,"This post is really long but I honestly don't have other places to turn to about this atm. As written on the title, should I go to law school and become a lawyer or no? 

I'm a 24 year old about to finish undergrad with a major in History in fall. Throughout my college career, I've gone back and forth over whether or not I should be a lawyer. Even as I finish college rn, I'm still not sure. Sometimes, lawyer seems like a good job. I like being able to work with people and help address their problems and I like work that isn't completely monotonous. From everything I've been told, being a lawyer is not always ""meaningful"" but it can be. If I were to become a lawyer, I thought my field would be in workers' rights, immigration, or international human rights. At the same time, I realize that going to law school and becoming a lawyer is a huge committment in time and money. This may not sound like a big deal to some people but the costs make this something I can't choose to do without thinking, I need to decide if the costs would be worth it. Loan and debt companies can be predatory and so I'm unsure if I should accept debt that may take decades of my life to pay off. However and more importantly, I don't know if I can afford to take so much time. I'm a child of immigrants and my father has gone through so much stress and worked as hard as he could to provide for our family. He's tired and although he's thankfully gained some stability in recent years, idk how much longer he can keep working to pay rent and bills. At some point, I want him and my mom to finally start taking it easy and de-stress. This outcome is still out of reach as me and my two older siblings are still not close to independence. One sibling is still figuring out what she will do and the other might apply for grad school again (she works and pays for all her things). We need to pick up the slack and I worry one or two gap years plus three years of law school would be too long. Would it? At the same time, becoming a lawyer could be a good way of gaining the ability to help them. I know that it's common advice that if you question if you should be a lawyer then it means you shouldn't become one but still, I refuse to let mere hesitance be the deciding factor for why I don't do it. 

My concern for my parents is one of the reasons I think about being a lawyer but the most important reason is that I don't know what else I should do. I know what I want: I want to earn enough money to provide for myself and my parents and to do things I want to do. What I do not know is how I want to achieve that outcome. I don't have many passions, my ADHD, which I've only recently begun to address, has constantly made it very difficult for me to develop productive hobbies. Aside from that, I don't feel inclined to specific careers and my choice of major doesn't help in this regard. Part of the reason I chose to be a history major was because humanties fields were seemingly recommended for students wanting to become lawyers and I already really liked history so those interests aligned. But now, I'm left with few career choices that are directly related to my major such as teacher, professor, or historian. Aside from these, I'd have to seek more general jobs that has skills applicable to History. Of course, I could go to grad school and enter another field through that. But then, what would I study in grad school? Do I go further in history or do something else entirely? Because of all this, lawyer feels like one of the few viable options that are related to my undergrad major. 

There's also the issue of whether I'd actually like being a lawyer or not. It seems like a lot of lawyers are unhappy and/or regret their choice. However, because I don't know what I'm passionate for in terms of career, idk if I should even care about liking the job (the adhd may mean I have to care though). Sometimes it feels as if I don't like doing anything but I can't just do nothing. Even if there is something that I like, it has to make money too. If I'm not going to like my job and be miserable anyway, I may as well be stable and miserable rather than struggling and miserable. However, wb my loved ones? I try to deeply cherish the people in my life but, from my understanding, lawyers often work long hours and even outside work hours for their cases. Life is short, I want to take time to be with my friends and family while we're all still here. But maybe this wouldn't be too bad, finding time off or better hours seems less likely but still possible depending on what kind of firm you work at. 

I should also briefly mention my status going into this. Due to my aforementioned adhd, I struggled incredibly to maintain my grades in my school's quarter system. Therfore I'll be graduating with a fairly low gpa, the maximum I can hope for at this point is likely a 2.5 which is very problematic if I want to apply for law school. Furthermore, I don't have any work experience that could make up for those grades and I have yet to start preparing for the LSAT. This is why I've been considering taking two gap years instead of one, that way I would have more time to gain work experience, study to get a good LSAT score, and distance myself from my gpa. Would this be the right decision or should I try to restrict it to just one gap year? If I can't get a job in this current market then should I restrict it to one

As much as I wish I could slow down and figure out what job or career I would like, pursue interests, and gain skills; I cannot. I don't have the luxury of time, I need to make and decide my next move soon. The longer I take to decide what I want to do in life means less time for applying for grad school or law school or doing whatever else. Again, I want to help my parents and I don't want to make them toil for any longer than they have to. It's painful to watch and frustrating that I still can't do anything. Don't get the wrong I idea, I care about my own wellbeing too. Becoming a lawyer is no joke but life is no joke either. To be honest, I feel unprepared for either. What do I do in all these circumstances? If you've read for this long, thank you so much.

But I don‚Äôt want to settle for this. I am very interested towards craft and I want to make a business out of it. For the last couple months I have tried to work on both(job and my business idea) but I couldn‚Äôt progress much with my business.

At this point, I want to quit my job and believe in myself that I could build something on own. But I‚Äôll be lying if I said I‚Äôm not scared.

Staying without income: Money is not too big of an issue in my case. I have little savings. I need not support my parents and god bless, I can take little support from them too. But my parents are against this decision.

So what do you guys think. Am I making a mistake quitting my job??",Peacewastaken20,0,0.4000000059604645,11,1724055491,2024-08-19 08:18:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1evwhh7/is_quitting_my_job_a_wrong_decision/,8,2024
1evwepg,Visited the r/Henry sub and? Must I be doing something wrong?,"Went down the rabbit hole while researching which city to move to while working remotely. The people had the same problem as me but making about 7x as me had the same issue.

I seem to know a lot about a bunch of things, education, and ambitious. I‚Äôm an engineer at level like 2 or 3 (next is a senior engineer). Non tech (mechanical, chemical, and biomedical engs)

The dilemma: even my manager (10 yrs of experience) makes like 130 tops. So while i‚Äôm, now, planning to get a LSS black belt and MBA starting next spring, I‚Äôm going to be making what? 150k? That‚Äôs not even middle class in a nice city like San Diego or even Austin TX. So why waste time & money?

What do I do to get out of the poorness loop? I don‚Äôt want my kids to be facing what I‚Äôve been facing. I want my offspring to have elite education and join the 1%. What certificate or major or industry do I go for?

Things I currently do well: engineering and management (team leader, PM, etc). Sales (i can ace sales and did before I graduated engineering school Bachelors). Web (i deployed a few websites as a hobby and for professional marketing, limited coding practice). Gen AI ( I‚Äôve been using gpt and other platforms and i can utilize it to get anything done for me). I‚Äôm also good at statistical analysis but been feeling bored of it and haven‚Äôt done much in the past 2 years but it‚Äôs like riding a bicycle. I did some coding when i was young but didn‚Äôt stay consistent. I can go for it if it means money -although i want to be more like management and executive rather than a specialist or a scientist.

1evw36x,Fight or leave: when the workplace brings you back to savana mode ,"You wake up at 7am, you are committed to the day, you go to they gym at 7:30am, no coffee as suggested by the self-improvement scientists and gurus, so you trust them. Weight-lifting, you feel awesome. Skip breakfast because you are trying intermittent fasting and are good with just a cup of black coffee after gym, right before office. 

You arrive in the office at 8:30, you are early, everybody else does not show up earlier than 9:30-10:00,  but you have a different role, you follow the boss, so you need time to prep for the day and then start the hectic day with him. You love the job, but he is a moron, you are from two different countries, you speak his language but of cours it's not going to be frictionless. He tends to do monologues, he gets upset, he always complain he has no time and vomits information (relevant and irrelevant) creating confusion all the time, you suffer a lot these:  
**1, Monologic Communication**: Frequent long monologues without interaction.  
**2. Lack of Active Listening**: Limited opportunities for team input and feedback.  
**3. Cognitive Overload**: Overwhelming amount of information in a short time.

He knew you were new to the industry but he lacks emotional intelligence to actually be able to guide you in and teach you shit.   
Every time you do something it's wrong or should have done something differently. 

The day goes one, it's 8pm, you have meetings because now in US people are waking up, you have set-up a call at 11:30pm on a Friday night, because that's where the boss said he could. 

You hate almost every moment of the job, you have anxiety every time the phone rings because it might be him ready to go at you for 50min straight. You start having dreams about the job and the boss, not the fun ones.

You have no control over your life. You are staying because maybe you cant find another job, you really need the money. Or maybe not? You are away from family, they say money it's not an issue, but you really don't want to leave without having a better option. 

The job itself is a great opportunity, but is it worth it? Maybe not. 

You think: ""Motivational videos tell me that I should not quit in the pit, or that these hard times are what really make me stronger"" so you might want to resist. Other times you think ""Leaving a toxic work place is not a defeat. IT's an act of courage"". 

Life will not decide for you.

Whereas the owner of the company loves me and does not want me to quit and We have a great relationship. Problem is the company manager who is in charge of the payroll and almost everything.

I'm currently in grade 10 and will be entering grade 11 next year. In India, when we enter grade 11, we are allowed to chose a combination of 4 or 5 subjects with English.

1. I intend to pursue BTech first, and then decide whether to enter engineering or research. Should I do BTech in Bioinformatics, or in Biotechnology, or in Genetic engineering? Which will allow me more options in the future, as well as a good salary? Could someone please give me something like a flow chart, as to which careers to pursue, which courses to do undergrad, postgrad and phd in, in order to be able to do what I want, as mentioned above, in paragraph#2. 

2. If there are any Indians here, could you, with your honest criticism, recommend me some universities for BTech for each of the courses above mentioned.

3. I am willing to do MTech, and if reqd, PhD in the future, What universities would you recommend, outside India, for the same?

4. If anyone here is pursuing the careers above, could you please tell me about your day to day work, and the country you work in so that I can get a better idea about which country offers better opportunities regarding the above mentioned careers.

I have a high school degree and I qualified for a free year at my local community college back when COVID was at its peak, but I chose accounting as my major, which wasn't a good fit, and I didn't have any idea what I was interested in at that time, so instead of going into debt and choosing a random major again, I'd just come back to college at a later date if that's the path I choose.

1evr90s,How should I deal with changing career disciplines? ,"I (24M) recently took a new job in a new discipline and I‚Äôm fairly certain it‚Äôs not the discipline for me. I have worked in construction for many years now. I‚Äôve had experience with several disciplines but my main specialty is commercial general contracting and residential construction.

I recently changed to crane and rigging working with wind turbines. It‚Äôs an industry I‚Äôm fairly familiar with but first time working in it full time. The work is straightforward and I have no doubts in my ability to succeed at my position. My issues are with the work/life balance and how unrewarding the work is. This job also requires extensive travel in remote places which adds another layer. 

I took this job for several reasons, the excitement of the work, the reputation of the company, and the monetary benefits. Of those three, the excitement of the work has been the one that has fallen flat. The work is interesting but the novelty wears off quickly. There is a large amount of down time in between tasks, waiting on cranes, components, or crews. This in turn creates long days and a large amount of time not actually working. It‚Äôs important to note we work 6, 10 hr days which I knowingly accepted but only had minimal experience working. My tasks specifically are not daily and only truly needed periodically as we disassemble and reassemble towers. Most of my time is aiding the other crews. With that, my work is simple but critical, however I do not see much intrigue in my tasks. 

Overall, I don‚Äôt see this discipline working for me. I found much more excitement, interest, and drive in my other construction roles. I enjoy the crews, aspects of the work, and the company as a whole but don‚Äôt see enough value here to justify the ‚Äúcosts‚Äù of this job. I‚Äôm 3 months in and would really like to make it 6 months before I make a pointed decision on the job. I wrestle with leaving a job so soon and not doing right by my own standards. I want to do good work and provide good service to the companies I work for but I don‚Äôt want that to come at the cost of my sanity/time. How long would y‚Äôall give it? How should I handle things and evaluate going forward?

Right now I am struggling a lot to complete my work and is causing me internal problems with the leaders as I bearly do anything, I tried a lot of things but at the end I always avoid to do my job (homeoffice).

I don't know what to do, probably I should quit but I am scared that I will not find anything as good as this. I have saved some money to be atleast a year without a job (that's not the plan).

1evorhh,Best way to convince my boss i need a new title ,"I'm a 33 year old delivery driver working at a craft brewery and ive plateau'd in my career. I work for a small operation and I've learned a lot while hear and I've taken on many responsibilities that a regular delivery driver wouldn't usually do. I work directly under the general manager and we collaborate a lot and have good communication with each other. But I'm getting to the point where i need to advance in my career or else I'll be a lowly delivery driver forever. So I'd like to convince my boss to change my ""title"" from delivery driver to assistant general manager so i can pursue future career opportunities with a better label on my resume. 

I had a conversation with him about this idea and he wanted me to put it into a written request to figure out what an ""assistant general manager"" position would look like and what other tasks i could perform to further assist him with. I've gone over it for a month now and almost everything i do is in a way ""assisting the general manager"", and there really isn't much more i could add to my job to further assist him. So is there a way to get this assistant general manager label? Or should i just accept that I'm a delivery driver who has several other tasks outside that realm? 

I primarily do all the deliveries. But ss for my other tasks; i do all the invoicing, shipping, warehousing, inventory, stocking and i respond to the majority of the customer emails. I also offer incite into dealing with customers and product problems.

1evo84e,I love composing and writing emails. What can I do?,"I'm 27M from Canada. I'm on the autism spectrum and I only have a high school diploma.

I've exclusively gone to post-secondary for STEM programs I didn't want to do but that I thought I was supposed to, including electrical engineering, cybersecurity, and software development, but I dropped out of each one. I've always hated the idea of working for 8 to 9 hours a day as a software developer, but I attempted going into that kind of work because my actual interests are useless. I knew that so many people were dying to be software developers, so I thought that meant I would get used to it and that it would make me happy, since work is work and it's not meant to be enjoyed. I did two internships as a software developer and hated them, and being so afraid of the next work day sent me into a bit of a mental health crisis.

I've now dropped out of one university program and two college programs, and I'm in too much debt to go back to school. My interests (and I'm embarrassed to talk about this at all) are in the social sciences and humanities, and I love communicating information. Geography, history, and languages are where all my main interests are. I look at maps for fun every day and have since I was a teen. I've reached an intermediate level of Spanish and a basic level of French, Italian, and Brazilian Portuguese, and I would love to continue studying the Romance languages for the rest of my life.

While this post isn't a good example of it, I've been told by countless people that I am very articulate in my writing and communicating of information. I love writing, and I'll be honest that in my software development internships, getting the occasional chance to compose an email was by far the most enjoyable part of the job.

I'm really ashamed to say it, but work with a lot of in-person social interaction is exhausting to me. I once had a job in a warehouse where the unpaid half-hour in the lunch room was the most laborious part of the day because that's when I had to put the most effort into appearing neurotypical in front of my co-workers. While I know it's incredibly difficult for me to maintain full-time work hours, it feels impossible to maintain that while also pretending to be someone I'm not. This was especially hard in my internships where I had to pretend to be interested in coding and software like all my co-workers.

Is there any possibility that I could find work in a non-STEM job? Are there any areas of demand for freelance work that could be up my alley? Is it possible to find any kind of work like this without a degree?

1evnr48,Work life changes: what should I do?,"F26, italian. I am working as a social media manager in an apprenticeship at a marketing agency. However, I haven‚Äôt been feeling very good about it for some time now. My boss has high demands, and although it's a web agency, I‚Äôve never been allowed to work remotely because, according to him, ""we‚Äôre not a company that was born for remote work."" At first, I didn't mind much, but now it's becoming difficult to deal with: going to the office every day is exhausting, and whenever I get distracted, go to the bathroom, or leave a few minutes early to catch public transport, I feel watched and judged (and in fact, I am, because I've been explicitly told that if I do these things‚Äîleave five minutes early, arrive just on time rather than a bit earlier‚Äîit's because ""I don‚Äôt care about the company"").

A year ago, I started a small personal project that‚Äôs doing quite well. However, since my boss found out about it, his attitude toward me has changed. He constantly compares my work at the agency to my personal project, insinuating that I put more effort into the latter than I do at the office. Working in a creative field, I feel like I need more flexibility, and definitely a boss who doesn‚Äôt mix my personal life with my work. I often hear comments like, ""if you stay a few minutes longer in the office, it‚Äôs no big deal, what else do you have to do?"" which makes me feel even more pressured.

My contract is about to expire, and I‚Äôm seriously considering (instead of accepting the full-time permanent job) taking back control of my life and figuring out what I really want to do. My personal project on social media is gaining traction, and it makes me think that I might enjoy working on my own. At the same time, I‚Äôd like to continue studying, perhaps by doing a master‚Äôs in digital marketing.

A friend of mine works in the Netherlands in a different field and earns nearly 3,000 euros a month, with many benefits that here in Italy, or at least in my company, are unimaginable. This makes me wonder if it would be worth considering opportunities abroad, where I would surely be paid more than my current 1,300 euros a month.

I‚Äôm really confused about the direction my life could take. I live in a city I moved to a few years ago for work, but lately, it feels very limiting: it‚Äôs hard to make new friends, people are quite reserved, and social activities seem to revolve around the usual home-work-drinking routine. I feel like I need a more dynamic and flexible environment to be able to give my best.

1evnlu0,Does the reputation of bachelor‚Äôs university have a big impact after a master‚Äôs in a prestigious university?,"So, I did 2 bachelors. 

My first one was in architecture from a top university in my country. 

After realising I wanted to switch fields but. couldn‚Äôt restart the bachelor since I was almost graduating and needed to work, I pursued a distance learning degree in Computer Science. 

The thing is, the university I did my bachelor in CS in is basically known for being s scam university, it‚Äôs accredited just like the top one I attended, but it‚Äôs been part of many ‚Äúscandals‚Äù of overcharging, charging people who didn‚Äôt even confirm enrolment, head of the university saying absurd stupid things, etc. 

I didn‚Äôt have another choice since even though it‚Äôs distance learning, in my country the exams need to be in person and in my city that was the only option. I couldn‚Äôt pursue another one in person since I had to work. 

But anyway, I am getting my master‚Äôs at a good German public university (I‚Äôm not from Europe, though) and was able to secure good internships in CS now. 

But I can‚Äôt shake the thought in the back of my head that if i were to apply to more important roles in big companies, such as tech innovation management in the LVMH conglomerate (I plan on migrating to the luxury sector, but LVMH was just an example), the recruiters would google my undergrad university, and simply dismiss my application due to the horrible reputation it has. 

At the same time I think it‚Äôs a stupid thing to consider, since they probably wouldn‚Äôt waste time googling universities, and if they did, they would probably focus more on where I did my master‚Äôs since it‚Äôs my most recent degree.

I got invited back for a ‚Äúsecond interview‚Äù but they described more as a meet and greet with the rest of the team and a tour of their offices/department.

No offer yet but I feel good about the chances.

Here‚Äôs the thing though. My wife is due with our first child in 2.5 months. By the time I would potentially start working that due date would only be about a month and a half away.

With my current employer I was planning to take off two weeks when the baby was born and then more time off around the holidays.

1evn6b3,Should I leave my FTE for a 3 month contract (double monthly income)?,"Hey guys. Facing a dilemma. I‚Äôve been searching for a new job for a while now so that I can leave my current FTE job. The pay is low and I‚Äôm getting lots of extra responsibilities tacked on without a promotion.

I‚Äôve been offered a contract role. 
The role is only 3-4 months, but it‚Äôs also fully remote and would double what I make in a month ($20 more an hour). 

I did the math, and If I save the extra income, I‚Äôd have an extra $9k-$12k in savings if I can‚Äôt land a new contract by the time this one ends. Benefits are not a concern. I don‚Äôt use the benefits at my current job since I‚Äôm still on my family‚Äôs insurance plan for a few more years.

1evmyqv,How do I choose a career? I have a lot on my mind to consider. What advice do you have for me?,"Hello everyone, so as the title says, I am debating about a path to pursue in the coming years. I have (somewhat) narrowed it down, but still have far too many options on the table.

I am currently going into my sophomore year, and have pretty much only done general education classes and Intro to CS. I have my majors declared as Computer Science and Business Management, but I will be changing them because Management seems to generalized for my interests, and CS is becoming very useless as it becomes massively over saturated at the entry level. Additionally, I am a baseball pitcher at my school, so after scholarships, I am paying about 5k a year for school.

Can I change majors as a sophomore or is it too late? I don't think my school would care, but I have already gone from CIS -> CS & Management, now I want to do CIS & Finance, and I am not 100% sure on that either, but at least they are much more similar to the fields I want to pursue.

My biggest concerns as of now if mostly time spent in school, later career salary caps, WLB (sort of), & entry salary (least important).

1 - Bachelors in Computer Information Systems & Finance with plans to get an MBA degree and CPA & PMP license.

2 - Finish my bachelors, then to work as a pilot. Attend a Flight School and get my hours & pass the tests, then go work up to being a pilot.

3 - Bachelors in Computer Information Systems and / or Finance with plans to attend Law School, and possibly become a licensed CPA or a CFA designation in addition after passing the BAR.

4 - Bachelors in something to secure the prerequisite courses and attend dental school. I have no interest in dentistry, but the pay is promising and I can pass the classes.

5 - After finishing College, begin an electricians apprenticeship and work towards becoming a Journeyman electrician.

6 - Start working as a package handler at UPS and work my way up to becoming a driver (fortunately, I have family within the company).

7 - Something else? Really wouldn't want anything too heavy in commissions like sales, but not opposed.

Additional things I consider would be the CISA certificate, working on the Six Sigma levels, possibly the Actuary Exams (all or some), and definitely the Series 7, 65, & 66 licenses.

Initially, my plan was the dual major, but it would take be 5 years to get my undergraduate requirements, & my 150 credits for the CPA licensure in Missouri (33 hours in accounting, 27 in general business). I feel like my entire life would pass me by if I was spending 5 years in school for an undergraduate, 6-7 for an MBA, 8 for a JD, or 8-9 for a DDS or DMD. I really would like to be completely done, or at least be fully capable of getting my education remotely while I work by the time I am 24 or 25.

How do I determine what to do? I generally don't have that much of a passion for anything that pays above 60k a year, but obviously you can't spend your life not being able to afford rent, so I had to find the closest things I would be able to get done well with a decent paycheck. What suggestions would you have for me with where I am at, I will list my qualifications and additional information below.

20 years old, & living in Missouri. I did some kind of technical school class in high school where I got a Testout PC Pro certification, and some certified networking hours. I am good enough at math, not a physics major level, but good enough to get through Algebra and Calculus (pre, business, and calc 1 so far). I come from a family of teachers, customer service reps, and 2 UPS employees, so I don't have many references in most of the fields I am interested in. Also, as for WLB, I am fine putting in the 50-60 hour weeks, obviously 40 would be great, but as long as I have one day off per week and get a bit of sleep at night, I would be fine. Finally, and I don't know if this matters, I took an IQ test (in person while in high school for a club I was in) and got a 137, my parents both scored a 135 & 141 respectively, so I believe it. I also speak English Natively, Spanish Fluently, and am working on German and Italian.

My work experience as of now is only working at Walmart for a year while in High School, and working as an Umpire for 2 years.

The only careers I really do not want to do would be anything related to Veterinary work (I only like cats and generally find dogs and other animals to be annoying), and education (my parents have worked in education for years, and told me to never go unless it was my passion).

I am also quite concerned about the rise of artificial intelligence, outsourcing jobs, and the failing economic situation. I would prefer to stay away from jobs that could easily be wiped out, like bookkeeping for example. 

I haven't done the full calculations, but my outright dream life is a 650k home (4.4k a month or so), 2.3k in monthly payments for 2 cars, a boat (I'm from the Midwest, it's what we do), and a Rolex Submariner (in silver, so 13-15k). I obviously am not expecting to achieve this at 25, but would like to make it after 1 to 2 decades of experience.

I also would love to open my own company someday, if I do the Finance or Tech route, consulting. If I do Law, a legal practice would be great but certainly hard, I know, and it's not something I love. Also, my outright ""dream"" company to start would be real estate development, it's something I have always loved and do have a passion (my school doesn't offer a real estate degree, and architecture is not something I probably want to pursue, but again not completely ruled out).

My ideal world pay range would be 40-60k with 0 - 3 YoE, 75-100k with 3 - 8 YoE, 100 - 150k with 8 - 12 YoE, and up to hopefully making the 200-300k range late in my career, and ideally with my own business. Note: salaries listed are ideal, I can certainly go for less.

Quickly, I am not at all opposed to moving out of state or out of the country. I know Los Angeles and New York have great opportunities, and I have family living in Germany and Russia so both of those would be on the table as well. Also, kind of joking, kind of not, I would consider Iceland because of my ""chronic"" issues with being single, New Zealand because of Lord of the Rings, or Italy because I do love it there (despite never visiting unfortunately lol).

Lastly, and this is a strange one, I have been single my entire life and want a job that has a title and salary good enough to attract a girlfriend someday.

So to summarize, I have a few career choices to select from, then I want to make sure I can get a good paying job in these fields (again, not looking for executive roles with 0 YoE, I understand ot takes time, don't take me out of context), and eventually start a real estate development company or possibly a consulting business as a backup idea. 

Sorry, I know this is a lot of information, but I wanted a few additional opinions on what I should do as a career, any information or opinions are so much appreciated, and if you've read this far, thank you.",DateMeMonicaBelucci,1,0.9900000095367432,2,1724023020,2024-08-18 23:17:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1evmyqv/how_do_i_choose_a_career_i_have_a_lot_on_my_mind/,8,2024
1evmvez,Career coach/counselor/mentor? Help! ,"
I am looking for some advice. I have an MS and I work at a nonprofit completely unrelated to my interests and the job is so unfulfilling and slowly eating away at my soul. I started looking for jobs 1/23 and this was the only one I landed. I‚Äôve been applying ever since and have never been offered another position. 

On top of it, I feel like I need some direction on what path to even choose at this point in my career. Do I need more schooling? How to i pick between interests and making money? I need some real guidance. 

Due to being deeply depressed by endless application rejection and wasted time in multiple round interviews, I have paused my search. I‚Äôve had to go to therapy and she suggested seeking professional career guidance. I would like to potentially put some time and energy into finding someone to guide me through my next moves and overall picture. 

Do I needed a career coach, a career counselor, or a mentor? How do I get one and know they‚Äôre legit? How much do they cost?  I don‚Äôt have much money to spend, so I can‚Äôt try out a million people.  If I had a job with enough money, I wouldn‚Äôt need help. But, I‚Äôm taking this very seriously ! I‚Äôve tried networking on LinkedIn and asking people to connect, but I‚Äôm always ignored. Networking always fails for me. Even messaging alums about job opportunities fails, I still always get passed up, and often becuase they choose someone they know.  

So, how do I do this? Where do I look? Thank you! ",mollyq2022,1,1.0,0,1724022748,2024-08-18 23:12:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1evmvez/career_coachcounselormentor_help/,8,2024
1evmobj,Could I get some advice on an upcoming interview? ,"Hello Everyone,

I need advice on an upcoming interviews. I'm trying this on mobile so I apologize for any grammar or formatting mistakes. There's a lot of ""back story"" that's important so I'll try and summarize everything the best I can. 



I work in sales at a custom/tire shop, specifically a custom shop that does aftermarket rims, tires and suspension kits on all vehicles but we specialize in trucks. I have only been at this job 7 months, but I have had a ton of success. Despite officially selling in March I'm #2 in the company for sales for the company (There's about 50 sales people across 11 locations) I have 1.1 million in sale (for reference the top 3 guys are all around 1 million in sales, the guy in 4th has $700,000) I get fantastic customer reviews, I have a great team, who (I hope) really respects me. 



The previous general manager, was great. I have worked with him in the past, and he ""recruited"" me to this role. He was great at the beginning, but unfortunately to make an extremely long story short, he had a lot of personally issues that spilled into work leading to his termination. Which leaves his position open. 



In the lead up him (the previous GM) leaving he missed a ton of work. So, for the past 8 weeks (give or take) I've been overseeing day to day operations at the store. I've been overseeing sales, labor hours, customer complaints and very basic admin duties requested by the accounting team; very surface level day to day management.  I don't do any banking, inventory management, scheduling or vendor negotiation or new vendor onboarding. One of the owners (let's call him Owner moving forward) who works out of our location has been overseeing that side in the previous managers absence. 



Which bring us to the position. When the previous manager was terminated I had a conversation with owner, we briefly talked about the upcoming position. The initial conversation (this is heavily paraphrased) I made it clear I was interested in the role, he basically said he is not going to promise any promotion at this time, he values me as a member of the team sees the work I put in. He's going to consider me for the role, but if it's not this one, there will definitely be openings in the future. I said I'm ok with not getting the position, but I want to be considered. He made it clear I was 100% in consideration for the role.


A couple days later I did see that he posted an ad for the role. Which did make it clear I am missing some key qualifications for the role.


5 years of management experience - I have 3.5 years of general manager experience. But I managed a chain restaurant ( Think Olive Garden but it wasn't Olive Garden) 

Peak sales performer, with experience training sales people - I thrive on this one, I have 8 years of direct sales experience and have trained and coach countless sales people. 

Basic understanding of accounting, and strong administrative skills - I'm somewhere in the middle. I have a basic understanding on how to build and use spread sheets, I can easily navigate most Crams and ERP software but that's basically it. 


Strong mechinal Appitude (Mechinal experience preferred) - this is where I really lose, I know my way around tires and rims. I know enough about suspension kits to get by. But my mechinal knowledge sucks, I spent almost 8 years selling cars and I can barley check my own oil. I didn't even know  what a ball joint was until my 3rd month on the job. 

So, yesterday I had a conversation with owner, and I requested a full sit down interview. I told him I think I could do well in this role and would love to discuss it with him. And he agreed, but his tone and some of what he was saying was almost like he was playacting me. He was essentially like I'm happy to sit with you man, I really can't promise or guarantee anything, then we talked about the future of the company and when he opens locations in new cities would I be willing to relocate. Personally, I feel based off of both conversations it's a no (right now). But he agreed to do a proper interview. 


Which finally brings me to Reddit for advice. I know I'm lacking some fundamental hard skills for the role, but all the foundations are here! How should I approach this interview to help him look at me as a serious candidate for the role?



Final peices of important info. I talked about my positives but there are a couple more detractors that should be mention. 

I started this job in February, I have had great success on a sales side I am barely 7 months in.


I had some ""bad luck"" in my last two positions. As a result this is my 3rd job since mid 2021. 


If I'm being honest I make frequent very minor admin errors. Small things like recording a debit payment as a visa payment. Or worse forgetting to record a payment into our ERP system. I am working on correcting this but it is worth noting. 


My interview is next week, I really really want this job. What should I do to impress the owner? ",SubjectJob2125,1,1.0,2,1724022199,2024-08-18 23:03:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1evmobj/could_i_get_some_advice_on_an_upcoming_interview/,8,2024
1evmdcd,Career advice - counselling vs mental health nursing,"For context - I have a Bachelors of Science in Psychology with a good grade (2:1) in the UK. Last September I began a Msc Counselling course and have enjoyed placement. However I am finding myself frustrated  feeling I am not making as much of an impact on individuals as I wish to. 
Since graduating in Psychology I have worked as a healthcare assistant in a forensic psychiatric hospital for 2 years and enjoy this and could potentially see myself working as a mental health nurse, however can also see myself getting burnt out quickly in such a role. I also notice how mental health nurses often have more of a ‚Äòadministrative‚Äô role in the wards rather than spending more time and communicating with patients as you do with counselling. 

However, I am aware of the security nurses have within the job market and not having to worry about available roles out there. This is something I do worry about with Counselling. I suppose I am looking for advice which is the best path to go down? The mental health nursing course would be 2 years for me (Msc) üòï Another worry of this is feeling I have ‚Äòwasted‚Äô my Psychology degree which I worked really hard for.

1evkkux,Supply Chain Career Advice - Demand Planner (WFH) to Material Coordinator (in warehouse)?,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm looking for some advice a potential career change I‚Äôm considering. I (26m) currently work as a supply planner for clinical trials at a large biotech corporation. I‚Äôve been in this position for about two years no, and have received positive feedback from coworkers and management. My position is WFH/hybrid; I‚Äôd like to emphasize that I find my job interesting and rewarding, and I get along well with my team. It is definitely fast paced and challenging, which comes with its share of stress and fire, which I manage with a level head.

However, as much as I appreciate my role, I‚Äôve been having this nagging feeling about whether I want to spend the rest of my career sat in front of a computer screen from 8am to 5 (of course with meetings and calls interspersed in between) even in the event that I were to be in the office from Monday to Friday, the bulk of the day is at a desk in front of the computer. I daydream about positions that are more hands on, where I‚Äôm immersed in my environment, and can leave my work at the door when I come home/log off(with the understanding that all jobs are stressful, just in different ways).


For that reason, I‚Äôm strongly considering taking my supply chain experience and applying to positions in the warehouse/in the distribution center at my company. My questions are: Considering that I‚Äôm early on in my career, should I use that as an opportunity to gain diverse experiences on other teams, or continue to develop in my current role?) Have any of you switched from office work to hands on and we‚Äôre happy? Anyone regret it? Thank you!

1evhzk3,"People who left their creative careers to pursue stability, how‚Äôs it going? ","Hi everyone!

So I went to art school. I was pretty successful as a student- securing $8000-$20,000 commissions from organizations in my last year of uni. I went to a pretty prestigious university, I had an award winning mentor & worked for her after our apprenticeship ended. 

I never got any discouragement from my family, friends, or colleagues about my path, everyone seemed to think I knew what I was doing. It was completely the opposite though- I was wrecked by anxiety every day, and the unstable income made me feel like I was going to be reliant on my ex for the rest of my life. 

I don‚Äôt come from wealth, and I realized how much that would work against me right after I graduated. The actual fine arts industry does not pay well, you can put months of work into an exhibition and sell nothing, even if people show up. 

You‚Äôre basically a small business, and your clients are going to be friends and family (whom, in my circle, are not wealthy). If you want to go into a management role (which I did), artists are not typically reliable or know what they‚Äôre doing. You need to be extremely accommodating. Everyone wants to do art gigs, but once practical elements need to be addressed, things tend to fall apart and people can lose motivation really quickly.

I also think that I‚Äôve never actually loved art that much. I don‚Äôt really dream of work, I dream of stability and having a good life, taking care of my parents. I‚Äôm not particularly sad about leaving the arts, I‚Äôm sort of feeling nervous for my peers. 

There‚Äôs also a lot of ageism and lookism in this industry. Being attractive, young, and charismatic goes a long way, and social media has become a huge part of the industry. I felt some insecurity about this, I‚Äôm pretty and charismatic, and I think that did land jobs that I felt unqualified for sometimes. I felt a huge pressure to get as many opportunities with my looks as possible before I aged out of that privilege. I don‚Äôt think this is unique to creative jobs, but it was icky not knowing if someone was interested in my work or ‚Äúme‚Äù.

You sacrifice so much to do art as a career, you basically condemn yourself to a life of begging for money from the government and your community. With every application, you‚Äôre supposed to justify your existence.

I feel a lot of respect for artists, my mentor, and other creatives that manage to do the work without the financial backing of wealthy families. I feel a huge relief from landing my first 8-5 job with benefits. 

Has anyone else had similar experiences? I know it‚Äôs a common story, and I feel like abandoning your art career is a ‚Äúsad‚Äù or ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù thing, but I‚Äôm actually really excited!!

1evgy0p,Concerned Over Lack of Marketable Skills in Current Position Permanently Limiting Career Growth?,"I graduated in 2022 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from a well respected university in the western United States. Not a great but not a bad GPA, passed my EIT, and some decent experience on my resume and LinkedIn prior to graduating.

I was fortunate enough to land a very respectable job about 8 months after graduation doing component design, integration, and assembly. Ultimately I decided to leave after just over a year of experience and move back to where I was born and raised.

I recently accepted a manufacturing engineer role after 5 months of unemployment. The pay was significantly lower than my previous role. My QOL is going to decrease significantly and my long term financial goals, loans, etc are going to be delayed unless my salary changes.

At the end of the day my plan was to work for a while, build my resume and perhaps look at moving back into more complex engineering after attaining some experience but the last few weeks have me concerned about my ability to build my skills and my resume. My current line of work is not going to be impressive enough on my resume to push my career further. This is as low as you can go in terms of day to day responsibilities, product line, etc while having the word engineer in the title. I am in my late twenties, and with a limited resume I am worried about having missed my opportunity to chase a respectable career as opposed to settling for an industry I might be overqualified for.

I would rather not work for this company for a short period, I think this might paint me as an unreliable job hopper and most of the people I work with are kind people: I do not want to ""lead them on"" or screw them over.

When I left my last position I accepted I might be taking a step backward to move forwards, but ultimately it looks like I may have placed myself in a hole.

Has anyone ever faced similar challenges in their career? Should I cut my losses early and not waste my current employer's time?

1evgpe7,Should I Quit Immediately or Work the Two Weeks? Seeking Advice on a Toxic Work Environment,"I‚Äôm in a tough spot and could use some advice. I got a part-time job in January this year, referred by a friend. The job was in the marketing department of a company that, to be honest, showed some red flags from the start. The HR person who hired me quit the week after I started, I received no training, and I had to dig through the emails of the person I was replacing just to figure out what to do. The company seemed disorganized, and everyone I asked for help would tell me they didn‚Äôt know and that the company was a disaster.

Despite this, I quickly got up to speed and started solving issues that had been lingering. My colleague (the friend of my friend) was really happy with my work, and I felt I was making a positive impact. But then I met Jazmine, the ex-wife of one of the owners, who no longer works there but still has influence. From the moment we met, she treated me rudely and even questioned my skills. It turns out she wasn‚Äôt happy that she didn‚Äôt get to hire me herself.

Over time, the situation only got worse. The owners, Mike and John, were barely available to approve solutions or budgets. They rarely checked their emails, skipped important meetings, and didn‚Äôt want to spend money when necessary to fix problems. My two-month probation period ended without any offer for more hours or a pay increase, but I stayed because I needed the money.

Recently, things took a turn for the worse. Jazmine started spreading rumors that I wasn‚Äôt doing my job, even though those I work with directly have praised my contribution. Last week, during a marketing meeting, Jazmine crashed the meeting and with the support of the owners, blamed the marketing department for a half-million-dollar drop in sales, without doing a any kind of proper analysis. Her outburst was inappropriate and just added to the chaos.

The next day, my colleague, who has been incredibly dedicated to the company, handed in her two-week notice. When Jazmine heard this, she was heard telling HR that if my colleague had dignity she should just leave immediately and that I should leave as well. Now, I‚Äôm seriously considering it. I‚Äôm torn between quitting immediately and letting them deal with the mess they‚Äôve created, or swallowing my pride and working the two weeks, although I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to be very uncomfortable and I‚Äôll hate it. 

What would you do in my situation? Should I leave immediately, or should I stick it out for two more weeks?

1evg5rq,"Accidentally sent gossip text to all-division chat, how do I handle the fallout?
","I feel like I need to add some context, so bear with me. I work for a government agency (EU), and my whole team is situated in a different city, so I basically work remotely from my hometown office. I've been working in this department for almost two years. I was really happy to join because I transferred from an extremely toxic boss, who was eventually laid off. I tried my best to fit in, work on certifications, and prove I am a valuable asset to the team. Based on my reviews, that‚Äôs honestly what it felt like‚Äîuntil my recent fuckup.

The situation involves a colleague (let's call her Amy), who is the head of one of the departments in our division. She is very proud of her achievements, speaks highly of herself, and makes sure everyone knows how well-connected she is with management, how she has the best holidays, etc. She's really self-centered and constantly seeks external validation.

Given that I work remotely and don‚Äôt really mingle with people, I have a healthy professional relationship with all of my colleagues. At the beginning of this year, one colleague from the division permanently moved to my city, so we now work together in the office. Over time, I discovered from her that some colleagues have issues with Amy, including my new colleague, but I didn‚Äôt really care, given my remote status‚ÄîI just wasn‚Äôt involved.

About a month ago, I started working with Amy and other colleagues on a workshop our agency is offering. I used this opportunity to visit the team for collaboration. After a few days, we had a whole division meeting, including the principal, where we shared what everyone was working on. That‚Äôs when I messed up.

It was Amy‚Äôs turn, and she started saying she worked on materials for the workshop. For some reason, I found it kind of funny because she didn‚Äôt have anything to her name in the logs of the material. So, I wanted to text my colleague and point out how Amy was bragging about something she didn‚Äôt actually work on. But instead of sending it to my colleague, I accidentally sent it to the general chat. Amy immediately reacted by saying she worked with another colleague on it, and he was the one making the entries and comments.

I felt absolutely horrible‚Äîhorrible for pointing out something so silly. It wasn‚Äôt really a problem that she hadn‚Äôt done anything yet; the project was basically finished. But it was the way she said she had, in her own condescending manner. My behavior was childish, and I apologized right after the meeting. She was stunned but waved it off, only for me to find out later that she immediately complained to my direct boss and the principal of our division, whom she is very close to. I still offered to discuss it privately one more time, but she insisted on doing it another time.

My boss reacted by taking me for a one-on-one and yelling at me, swearing and asking what my problem was. He said I was demotivating my colleagues, causing tensions, and gossiping all the time. I was stunned by his reaction and once again apologized. The next day, my boss called me in again, yelling at me for allegedly telling everyone how underpaid our division is compared to others, claiming that colleagues from another division are paid several thousand more. I‚Äôm pretty sure this was a direct consequence of my fuckup with Amy and the fact that a colleague who left due to being underpaid possibly mentioned my name while explaining his situation. I‚Äôm pretty sure his intention was just to solidify his argument, so he named me as well. We were close and worked together on several projects. I never mentioned any outrageous numbers, but I did speak with my colleague about other divisions being paid better because it‚Äôs general knowledge in our agency, and our salaries are determined by government-public ""tables."" You pretty much know how much everyone earns. The only differences are in bonuses, all of us know that there are divisions that pay more. I honestly couldn't even care less about this, but anyways I had to deal with and explain.

Generally speaking, I still feel terrible because I really like my work, try to build solid relationships, and just don‚Äôt want to be problematic. I‚Äôm afraid this fuckup might impact how my colleagues view me, especially since Amy has influence and, from what I‚Äôve heard from previous colleagues, can be rather vengeful. I want to continue working as well as I possibly can to prove I‚Äôm worth it, but I‚Äôm not sure if I should approach this matter differently. Should I be more aggressive and just act like nothing happened or rather just leave it be, possibly talk to Amy again (I am planning on doing this anyway). I never had this situation occur in my work-life and just don't know how to approach it effectively. What would you do in my situation?

**TLDR:** I accidentally sent a message meant for my self-centered, validation-seeking colleague (head of department) into the all-department (35 people) chat, which caused a cascade of other problems. How do you deal with this situation after apologizing and offering space for discussion?",hunduk,5,0.6000000238418579,34,1724005590,2024-08-18 18:26:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1evg5rq/accidentally_sent_gossip_text_to_alldivision_chat/,8,2024

1evfuxd,Asking for a referral for a job that I'm a bit under-qualified for,"This week I applied for a job in an industry that I used to work in briefly and would like to get back into.

I didn't keep him in the loop on my job after I moved on (I worked with him on a contract), but we still ended on good terms. 

The job I applied to ties in directly with a company that he does work for. I even believe that I met this new position's prospective boss while I was under contract at my last position. 

My question: I want to reach out for a referral from my previous mentor, but I feel that it's a bit lofty to reach out for his help after we fell out of touch, especially for a job that I am probably a bit under-qualified for.

1eveo63,Tesla‚Äôs Flawed Hiring Practices,"I am 32yo and applied at Tesla‚Äôs career portal for the job called ‚ÄúManufacturing Development Program‚Äù. I get rejected every time as though no one reviews my application while I received an automated response. I collected evidence that showed Tesla has preference over younger demographics despite their job postings being available to the public. This is a discrimination on a face value, because it leaves no room for anyone older and out of school who is qualified and willing to take the job. The job posting shouldn‚Äôt be made available to job sites and on their career portal if it is meant for High School Students. It should be explicitly labeled so as not to confuse older qualified individuals looking for a career change. So what if I am not fresh out of High School or affiliated to local schools? 

This has been putting a lot of strain on me as it has been hard looking for jobs just because I am multi-skilled and no solid career path.

1evdvku,How to get taken seriously for more senior positions ,"For 2 years now, I haven‚Äôt been able to land a next job despite of my qualifications. I lose these positions to people (men) more senior in age but not radically different/ better CV. I need advice on how to change this!

I‚Äôm a 36-year-old female. I‚Äôm bright, bubbly and witty and considered pretty/ sexy. I do appear younger than my age.
I work for a huge global retail company. In the past 10 years I‚Äôve held several leadership positions in 4 different countries in EU and SEA. Last 5 years I‚Äôve been an area manager for 4 units and 600+ employees. 
My performance has always been at least ‚Äòmeeting expectations‚Äô in all areas, and my leadership scores have been outstanding (close to 100%, typically 80% is considered good). The only ‚Äòserious‚Äô performance issue my manager ever brought to me was about my habitually delayed travel cost claims (plus of course normal performance feedback). 

I‚Äôve applied to 14 jobs on generally the same or lower level than my current role in the company (different locations). I only got to the final round twice, on positions that are deputy to my current one, but both times I was rejected because the hiring manager felt I was overqualified and would get bored and leave before long (ok fair enough, even if I had other reasons to commit, which I shared in the process). 

A few first rejections I just wrote off as normal thing, they had someone more suitable in some good reason etc. After that I started asking for more feedback. What startled me is that almost always the feedback is the same: interviews were great and they really loved talking with me, that I‚Äôm a great communicator and I have an impressive CV. However, they decided to go ahead with someone else, who, as it appeared EVERY SINGLE TIME, happens to be a male in their late fifties. (I have nothing against them individually and I‚Äôm sure they all are great at what they do and deserved the job!)

My ‚Äòtheory‚Äô is that I appear too junior in the interactions and that there probably are some other unconscious bias involved. I have not been treated unfairly in the recruitment situations, but there are other signs that make me think of that. For example, I met one recruiting manager in a company gathering and stopped for a chat. He asked about my job situation and proceeded to answer himself that of course I‚Äôm not in a hurry because I‚Äôve only had my role for a year. Dude, four years at that time! He interviewed me twice and had all my documents. Another example is from a team building game, where a group of management members including my boss and peers, played a game where we pointed out a cartoon character each of us resembled. My boss gave other females characters such as Moana or Dutchess the aristocat, and I got Jessica Rabbit. 

How do I change this? I hate the idea that I would need to start acting differently and hide my personality to better fit some dusty corporate image of how a ‚Äòserious‚Äô manager should be.

I knew I would struggle a bit because I do have a difficult time concentrating and this job requires 100% accuracy. My first week was last week and I did well at the beginning of it but the last few days, I was almost exclusively called out in front of everyone for making multiple mistakes. I'm also not used to how quiet offices are so it makes it extra humiliating having your entire team hear you screw up.

This has been my best opportunity in a while and I really don't want to mess it up. I just feel like a complete failure and need some advice.

Another thing to add, I seem to be the only one making mistakes out of the other couple new hires.

1evak6l,"Contacted by an internal recruiter, do I jump?","As the title says, I‚Äôve very recently been contacted by an internal recruiter for a role. I am currently employed but always open to new opportunities, so just not actively seeking anything or putting a great deal of effort in. However I‚Äôm torn on whether to pursue this opportunity.

My current role is for large government contractor within their supply chain arm and is salaried (70k in HCOL), two days per week telework, a 12 minute commute, a great deal of autonomy, and a very low workload. This is also the second promotion within a year for me. I‚Äôve been with the company for 1 years and in this role for 5 months. I am well liked by my supervisor who works in another building, and well liked by my team that I work with. It‚Äôs not very fulfilling, and I am often bored, but it‚Äôs stable and safe. The company last year cut half the team to run lean and this role was one that survived, and this last month they renew d the contract for another guaranteed 5 years. I can likely grow in this field over the next several years.

The company that contacted me is also a contractor, but for a much smaller boutique where everyone is exceptionally qualified. Like two masters or a phd, and nearly all engineers. I only have an associates and am not an engineer. However in my previous life I accumulated ten years of very specific military experience. They‚Äôve had an opening due to one of the members of the team about to leave for reserve duty, and seem to be in a rush to fill the role - they contacted me Wednesday and I‚Äôve had the phone screen and team interview already. They want me to redo my resume and interview with the project lead this coming week. It feels like they‚Äôre rushing it.

This new roles pay band would be 75-100k (stated by recruiter when I asked initially), 3 days work from home, on a small team, double my commute, and likely a large increase in workload. Id likely be able to get my PMP certification. However, they were supposed to renew the contract this month, and instead received a 6 month extension. They assure me they‚Äôve never lost a contract and they‚Äôll be getting another 5 years for this current one. During the team interview the person didn‚Äôt seem to be able to give great detail about the work. 

Not only do I feel deeply inadequate for the role, but I don‚Äôt get that warm and fuzzy about it. I feel like I‚Äôll be let go as soon as the other person comes back, or once the 6 months are up. The job is interesting, and I do want to obtain my PMP. Am I silly for worrying about this? Should I stay or try and leave and risk it?",grabberByThePussy,3,0.8100000023841858,3,1723991299,2024-08-18 14:28:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1evak6l/contacted_by_an_internal_recruiter_do_i_jump/,8,2024

She‚Äôs extremely unprofessional and gossipy, hired a relative and gave her all of the shifts leaving everyone else with nothing, and i for some reason have become her scapegoat in recent months. i‚Äôve always been an extremely reliable employee, literally the only person to pick up shifts, but there was one week where i couldn‚Äôt pick up dropped shifts due to just taking a break from excess work for my mental health because i was so stressed out - and she‚Äôs hated me since. everytime something goes wrong, she blames me, if my co worker does something wrong it‚Äôs somehow my fault, and she‚Äôs now stooped to a new low of making up lies about me to tell my co workers. the other day the told one of my co workers that i was DEMANDING more shifts, when i literally haven‚Äôt mentioned a thing about shifts in months!! she then went on to complain about how it‚Äôs so unfair some people get more shifts than others (only referring to me)‚Ä¶ YOU LITERALLY MAKE THE ROSTER!!!

i guess my question is, is going to HR even worth it? and what could I even expect from it given the circumstances, would she get a slap on the wrist? would i get fired? is there any point at all? i‚Äôve never dealt with HR before, i don‚Äôt know what would happen but this just sucks ",destroyaa2,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1723987672,2024-08-18 13:27:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ev98kt/should_i_contact_hr_about_my_manager/,8,2024

1ev7olr,Fired for Excessive Tardiness After My Older Brother Passed Away,"I had been at my job over a year without receiving any disciplinary actions. Then unfortunately my brother passed away and after one week grievance period I returned to work. 

Which I immediately informed my boss. That due to everything that's happened, I am going to have to pick up my nephew every day before work and because this may possibly cause me to be late for my 3 P.M. start time ( no more than 15 minutes max) I asked if I could get my start time pushed back. So I'm not running the risk of constantly being late and it would not hinder my coworkers since I was currently the only employee in our department on that specific shift. 

To which my boss not only agreed to help but actually stated that since my shift (2nd shift) was so new to the company. He was actually already considering making my start time later because it was originally assumed that the other 2nd shift departments would be done sooner, so I would be in turn be done sooner. 

I thanked him and told him how much I appreciate the help because I had very limited options as far as other ways to get my nephew picked up. Not to mention, he had just lost his dad. So I wanted him to know he still has someone who absolutely cared about him above all else. 

Fast forward not even a week later. My manager still has not made the changes and I'm grinding it out doing everything I can to get him picked up and still get to work as soon as I can but in all honestly I'm arriving no more than 10 minutes late but I'm also staying way later then that and always making sure I never leave before everything is done.

Eventually I get called into the office by my boss where he has a write up waiting for me due to excessive tardiness , stating I have an expected start time and no other job is going to allow me to come and go as I please. I am honestly shocked and I ask I thought we agreed you were going to move my start time back. Which he said I've already moved your time back once when I put you on second shift why should I do it again. Which aside from that not being what we discussed a week prior but also me moving to night shift was to accommodate me at all. It was silly a new shift starting that he offered me and I accepted. 

Needless to say after this exchange my motivation was hanging by a thread. So obviously I'm still choosing my still grieving nephew over not being 10 minutes late to a job that clearly doesn't appreciate much. After 3 more days once again called in for a write up. This time HR is present. My manager gives me the same speech about priorities. I tell him I'm not going to choose any job overy family. Especially when me being late in no way affects the job getting done. Then I ask him again what happened to you agreeing to move my time back. To which he has a different answer with HR present. This time he states he is still currently working on that change but either way this is my final warning about not taking my job seriously.

Fast forward 3 days later. In spite of the blatant lies and utter disrespect I'm still completing every single job task I have but yes I am still coming in about 10 minutes late. Which I end up getting pulled in the office one more time, to be just be told they are terminating my employment affective today because my attitude about my punctuality has not changed but how difficult of a decision this was. I don't complain or argue at this point. I just get my stuff and leave. 

So I'm just curious on everyone's opinion. Was I in the wrong on this? Or am I correct in feeling like not only is my manager a heartless POS but is showing up on time then most important part of a job? Or should there be instances that allow some slack? Especially when the job is always being completed no matter what.

1ev6vum,How do one find his niche when he‚Äôs good at everything but not great at something specific?,"
I‚Äôm good at everything, but not particularly great at something

Hello guys!

I‚Äôll begin with the question in case and then with my background to understand the context - how do you choose your path and start being great in that specific niche?

And now‚Ä¶the context.

I‚Äôm 27 years old and I work as a Social Media Manager for one of the biggest creative agencies from my country (Saatchi&Saatchi). I have a good salary and I‚Äôm basically the go to man when it comes to Social Media in our agency. I work with a few really high profile clients and everything is great, just that I‚Äôm not really satisfied with it and I‚Äôm trying to find my ‚Äúthing‚Äù.

I have a bachelor in Communications and Public Relations and a master‚Äôs degree in Image Campaigns. It‚Äôs not that important since realistically I learned almost nothing from uni, but‚Ä¶üòÇ. I have worked before as Communications Specialist, Marketing Manager and even freelance programmer (for basic things like building a Wordpress website, help with some frontend code, nothing too fancy).

Here I stay with good copywriting skills, good marketing knowledge, social media, digital knowledge and deep understanding of some things that most people who work in agencies have no idea about, buuuut I‚Äôm not particularly great at something specific. People come at me when they have a random question because I might know the answer and if I don‚Äôt, they know I can find it pretty fast.

I have a huge advantage in the agency because they allow me choose different projects and even go outside of my area (I‚Äôve even tried Client Service, just for fun), but when the director asked me ‚ÄúWhat do you want to do next? What‚Äôs your plan? Going as copywriter maybe? It‚Äôs better for your career to be the guy who is incredibly good at something‚Äù I simply didn‚Äôt know how to answer. I know a lot of things, but can‚Äôt put my finger on one that I want to go in more depth.

How did you guys handled such things in your career? How do one knows how to choose his niche?

Thank you and sorry for the huge a** post.

1ev6pmw,Starting from scratch at 24?,"I don‚Äôt have a bullet point list of my qualifications here. I‚Äôm more looking for general advice or if anyone has experienced similar. I‚Äôm a driven person - when I go for something I give it 100%, but I just need to direct it somewhere. 
When I really think about my life, it‚Äôs been a huge fuck up basically and I don‚Äôt feel I have anything going for me, it feels like a hopeless life. People say 24 is young but when you‚Äôre starting from scratch at this age it‚Äôs not. 
Context - I had a difficult childhood and was never really able to apply myself in school, even though I wanted to do better, I just felt angry all the time and it became a vicious cycle. I then found something I was good at - I started training to be a classical musician when I was 13/14 and even though at 17 I started to have doubts, my parents pushed me at 18 to do my 4 year honours degree at a prestigious conservatory, which ended up being 5 years as I took a year out before my final year due to physical/mental issues. I got a 2:1 but basically collapsed after the end of my degree, and due to the state I was in I didn‚Äôt really integrate enough into the community to work in the industry. I then injured myself (temporarily)a few months after which was probably the nail in the coffin in terms of losing my connections. 
That was last year and now I‚Äôm working a couple of basic jobs, one in hospitality and one a receptionist at an estate agents, so both dead end unless I want to become an estate agent, although I think it would be a bad idea. 

I have another career idea which is to become an SLT (speech and language therapist/pathologist) as it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm really passionate about for multiple reasons. You can do a masters/postgrad if you have a degree, but it needs to be academic, if not at least science/language so I think all the effort I could put into being a good applicant (volunteering/an a language A Level I‚Äôm privately studying for my hobby) would be in vain. And to be honest the reality of the career path may not be worth it considering the competition and low pay (basically capped at 35k in UK).


I still need to learn to drive,  I have a huge student loan from my degree already that I basically just have to mentally pretend doesn‚Äôt exist. I have parents potentially able to help me one day on a down payment for an apartment one day which is an unbelievable blessing but to do that I‚Äôll need a good-paying job. I‚Äôm gay so I‚Äôll never need to pay for a wife/family or anything like that but like anyone else I want a sustainable and comfortable life but I feel like my life is over before it‚Äôs begun and I feel hopeless.",Shot_Race_3157,0,0.5,4,1723979338,2024-08-18 11:08:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ev6pmw/starting_from_scratch_at_24/,8,2024

1ev44jb,"How I practically hacked the job market. ( It's not quality, its quantity )
","Disclaimer: This might annoy some recruiters, but please hear me out‚Äîthis is coming from a job seeker's perspective in the 2024 market. I‚Äôm not selling anything, just sharing my story.

So, I‚Äôm a self-taught full-stack dev with 4 years of experience and, if I do say so myself, a pretty solid portfolio. My struggles with the job market began about 2.5 years ago, right after I graduated. Since then, I've had a few periods of unemployment, mostly because I work as a freelance contractor.

My first job lasted 4 months before I got laid off. Then I spent 2 months hunting for another gig before landing a long-term contract that I stuck with for 1.5 years. During that time, I learned two things:

1. I was getting paid way less than I should have been.
2. Other people at my level had way better work hours while I was grinding through 10-12 hour days of mind numbing work.

I was thinking of switching, but my boss found out about it (thanks, LinkedIn) and fired me before I could find another role. That totally wrecked my mental.

Around then, I came across a study that said people who switch jobs more often end up in a better spot, especially at mid to senior levels. My friends backed this up, so I figured, why not?

My plan was:

1. Keep applying to new jobs.
2. Land a new job.
3. Repeat step 1.

I've realized the only way to know your worth is to keep tabs on what other companies are offering. And trust me, companies do the same with you‚Äîthey post fake jobs to see what people will work for. It's why getting ghosted after the 2nd or 3rd interview is so common‚Äîthey win no matter what.

I found another job within a month but kept applying anyway. In 6 months, I‚Äôd switched contracts three times and ended up with two remote gigs that each paid 25% more than my original job but this took a toll on my time and my energy, so being the developer that i am, I was like. Why not automate this. XD

I built a script in Python to auto-apply to hundreds of jobs every week, focusing on remote roles.

This is where i made another major discovery.  
ATS systems are sooo compexx these days.  
ATS systems started ranking my resume lower because it was being flagged for spamming.

One recruiter even called me out, saying they knew I was applying everywhere and wouldn‚Äôt consider me.  
To bypass this issue. I personalized my resume for each job using a custom GPT model I trained on highly ranked resume templates using the McKinzie format and ended up making them a custom chatbot primarily for myself.

Within 2 months, I was unable to use my LinkedIn as a troll account to getting tons of messages by recruiters. I had now officially turned The ATS game on it's head XD

I had successfully made this an AI vs AI bout LOL (You started it recruiters, if you had just read the resumes yourself, we all could be in a much better job market rn)

I'm curious if any of you have tried this before or not and what were the results for you guys.

For those who are interested, train your own GPT model. Just remember, in 2024, you're writing your resume for the ATS first, and the recruiter second.

The dental recertification process here takes about 2-3 years after acceptance to a school and passing the board exam. It could cost between $300-500k in loans, depending on the state or school, which is daunting. I enjoy dentistry, but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs worth the financial risk, especially with mixed feedback on how quickly loans can be paid off and current income levels for fresh grads and insurance reimbursement issues. 

Another option I‚Äôm thinking of is pursuing a master‚Äôs degree in Public Health (global health, which would allow me to continue working full-time or part-time while studying. My plan is to possibly join USAID, Implementing Partners of USAID or World Bank (Health Sector). I have ~1.5yrs of work experience with USAID from my home country. I was also thinking of working on skills like data analytics or earning a PMP certification to strengthen my resume. (Not sure how easy it would be to find a well paying job in these areas.)

If you were in my shoes, what would you do? I‚Äôm open to any advice, insights, or even alternative career paths.

1ev23cn,100% Remote PM vs 3 Days WFO Data Analyst with Higher Pay,"Hi peeps, throwaway account. I highly appreciate if anyone can share me some good career advice between two career choices I am facing now.

As context, I am a project manager for a localization field, fully remote and my teams working on a different time zone, which I only overlap their working time for 3-4 hours per day. Only one 1 hour meeting per week, the workload is fairly low which sometimes I feel like I am having a leave but when it's peak season, the workload and stress is easily managed. I can work anywhere anytime and manager has full trust on me to deliver my work. The only complaint is working remotely took a toll on my social life, I hardly meet anyone new and talk, and constantly forced myself working outside on a cafe and did some light travel to soothe out the boredom.

I got an offer from IBM working as a data analyst with a possibly 30% pay raise (it's yet confirmed). 15-30mins car distance with 3 days working on office settings. It's a data analyst job which I personally think it can set out a specialised career path in today's industry on next few years. I am unsure about the work culture and management in new company, but it's certain enough to say I'll lose the privilege to be full autonomy like I was, working with a team together on time with them.

I‚Äôm stuck between two decisions because:
1) Life wise, I feel like I‚Äôm not fully utilised the 'now' to work completely remote, and probably to travel big and explore around. I just started this career 1 year and half ago, and did some decent travelling. Still, it costs me the social aspect of human connection. Changing to new company sounds interesting, but I bet I'll cry missing out to the life I can work completely remote.
2) Career wise, I feel like PM in localisation field can be easily replaced not like data analysts (specifically japanese speaking data analyst which is hardly replaceable in my country) and I couldn't forsee any career path on this position. I feel I would miss out the data analyst career path if I choose on enjoying the 'now' of my current position. The pay is significantly higher too.

For more context:
- I live in Malaysia.
- I can live comfortably with my current salary or new offered salary.
- PM job is considering to counter offer me but if so I might be the end spectrum of their salary bandwidth (this is just assumption, 'what if they replace me with a cheaper headcount' thoughts pop out)

1ev1nme,"I don't want to quit building my product, but getting a demanding job would force me to quit and regret later. What to do?","Hey everyone,  
  
I‚Äôm at a crossroads and could use your thoughts.  
  
Option 1: Google interview. I‚Äôm unprepared and would need to grind hours on leetcode with no guarantee of success. It feels like a time sink. But, while many are waiting to get a google interview, I was reached out for a L6/L7 role through a recruiter from google directly.  
  
Option 2: A service based company wants me to be a tech arch between 2 distinct business units. Pay is decent (not the market price, but still decent), but growth is uncertain, because it's a service based company. But they are really profitable overall.  
  
Option 3: Consulting / Freelancing. A long term client, though this project I would get money to keep paying my bills with no investments. The hours of work would be pretty low, so it's not too much of work.  
  
And then I started building a product after 20+ failures in the past, I sat and figured out the mistakes and wins that I gained through that, and I am planning to replicate the strategies that worked, and I feel that it will work this time, will be working as a indiehacker and will be a good MRR for the next 2 years. I don't need to be full-time and can literally grow slow.  
  
I am leaning more towards consulting + indiehacking, but it means dealing withs some instability.  
  
I do have a safety net for a year. By doing consulting could extend that.  
  
Am I being too dumb for taking google's interview too lightly?

For the whole decade I have built so many products in the past, time to time, as a side hustle, so whatever job I take, I would definitely go back building a product, no doubt about it. So, I thought right now is that, why not do it now, than taking any kind of demanding role and loose focus on the product.

1ev0xdt,Career over mental health?,"Hi everyone. I just dont know where to ask for help at this point and I just kept thinking about it. I would like some of your opinions.

I used to work in retail and had the best time of my life. Although there were occasional bad days, it wasnt too much to the point that I could not sleep or I would bring the work home with me. There was less responsbility and if something bad happens, the managers did not make you feel like it was life and death. Everything was fixable to an extent. The coworkers was also fun to be with since they were mostly my age. The pay paid the bills but saving up was hard. You clock in for your shift then you clock out and thats it. Thats what I enjoyed abt it. 

I have recently started a new job at a law firm as a legal assistant around 4 months ago. This is very exciting for me as I am a law student and this kind of oppurtunities does not show up often. There was nothing wrong with my old job, I just started applying to further pursue this career. However, I have found myself in a tight spot and have found mysef extremely stressed at this job. It feels like I am being set up to fail. I don't take the physical work at home but I think about it almost every night. There are times that I could not sleep and sunday scaries have been basically part of my life. I think about quitting all the time and have had time where I just cried driving home. I understand that this is basically the ""real world'' but I have seriously considered going back to my retail job. I have been in contact with them and they have told me that they are willing to take me back if needed. 

  
I know that this current job would be a good for my career. I know that even if I dont go through as being a lawyer having an experience as a legal assistant as opose to retail customer service would probably get me to better jobs, but it is just so very harsh on my mental health.

I am very worried that quitting and going back to my retail job might be career suicide and I wont be able to have this oppurtunity again. ",tetel_,2,1.0,8,1723955816,2024-08-18 04:36:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ev0xdt/career_over_mental_health/,8,2024

1ev0krv,Should I leave my job for a temp 1-year contract? ,"Hi all, I‚Äôm currently working as a counsellor where I‚Äôve managed to find much purpose in and i‚Äôm in a permanent role. My colleagues are great, with a super healthy caring and supportive environment. 

Recently, I‚Äôve verbally accepted a 1-year temp contract over at a place I‚Äôm doing my internship at. It‚Äôs allows me to gain some experience in forensic psychology where I‚Äôm trying to complete the requirements necessary for my postgrad degree. 

There is a slight increase of a few hundred in my base salary but without any benefits (e.g., bonuses etc). There‚Äôs no job stability and I‚Äôm worried about having to chase contracts for a while until I manage to find a more permanent job in the field (if at all as connections matter a lot and Its not my way of doing things)
Nonetheless, this allows me to gain the experience I‚Äôll need if I want to pursue a future in that field. I‚Äôm not sure if I want to, and it‚Äôs not absolutely necessary for me at this point. 

However, this new job allows me to save cost (~15k usd) in completing my postgrad because of certain requirements. 

On the flip side, I‚Äôve given a verbal acceptance (not signed a contract) and I‚Äôm worried about its repercussions too! 

P.s., I‚Äôm intending to have a family in the next few years! 

Tl;dr 
New job- 

Pros- saving cost, complete postgrad quicker, higher base pay, experience in the niche field. Possible opportunities in the field in the future 

Cons- short term contract, instability in career, small team, no benefits. Poorer work life balance, less meaningful. 

Current job- 

Pros- meaningful, best colleagues, team and management, stability, family-friendly(important), very good work life balance, good benefits (leave/bonus/medical etc) 

Cons- might be stuck at current possible for a while, might be slightly harder to transition over to the niche field of psychology im in, might offend the management and get blacklisted if I rescind my acceptance. 

What should I do? Are there areas I‚Äôm not considering well? ",puppertato,1,1.0,1,1723954561,2024-08-18 04:16:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ev0krv/should_i_leave_my_job_for_a_temp_1year_contract/,8,2024

For office workers:

‚Ä¢ Tell me about your job? 

‚Ä¢ What is a typical day like in your job? 

‚Ä¢ What do you enjoy most about your job? 

‚Ä¢ What do you enjoy least? 

‚Ä¢ How did you get into this field?

‚Ä¢ What is the range of pay for someone in this field? (Starting/Experienced) 

‚Ä¢ Do you recognize training from Academy Canada? 

‚Ä¢ Do you have any advice for a person entering this field?

I am the manager of my department and am involved in every single event from the time I meet the client to the moment the tipsy attendees file onto their shuttle. Of course, event planning is highly organized, involves a certain level of sales and meeting planning, strong communication, and close attention to detail. I'm good at what I do - with awards and reviews to back that!

Recently, my employer did a market comparison study of our salaries. While we all received a bump in pay, I am still underpaid for my field.

I have started looking elsewhere. However, I am finding my exact role isn't really in demand. I'd love to find something remote and with travel, but the only thing I can seem to find in events through online job boards are scams or paid subscriptions for leads.

1euz0td,My employer is withholding pay ($400) from earned sick hours & I don‚Äôt know what to do.,"My employer is withholding pay ($400) from earned sick hours & I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I work at a job that considers itself a ‚Äúsmall business‚Äù but employs more than 11 people so I am supposed to earn sick hours for every 30 hours I work. I have been working for them for about 9 months and have earned almost all the sick time I can in a year (almost 40 hours). The earned sick time shows on my check.

Last week I tested positive for covid and was sick for a few days. I was taken off the schedule for my 3 shifts within that period & was expecting sick time. My co-worker/friend who is an assistant manager (still part time) tested positive the same day, and did the same thing (missed the same shifts, called in at the same time) got her sick time. 

I was not paid for the shifts I missed. I asked an assistant manager why, and after he asked my boss who does the paychecks why, I guess he gave some excuse about how because we are a small business, only the ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù get sick time, and not the other part timers. 

I‚Äôm missing almost $400 that I very much need & I believe I am entitled to it. My state‚Äôs laws (MA) on earned sick time say that all part timers working for a business that employs over 11 people get paid sick time they can earn starting day one, and use after 90 days, working 30 hours to earn each sick hour. 

The problem is, my assistant manager told me he recommend I drop it and don‚Äôt reach out to my boss. This is because my boss loves to gossip, is extremely sensitive and dramatic, and would not take well to confrontation on the subject. I need this job, I just received a promotion that allows me to take shifts at another business that we own  that I like better, but I‚Äôm going to be living paycheck to paycheck for the next two weeks and it can‚Äôt help but feel unnecessary when I‚Äôm pretty sure I am LEGALLY entitled to this compensation. 

This is my second job, it is SO MUCH better than my first job in terms of adhering to laws and treating me fairly but I am unsure what to do. I really appreciate any time anyone spends to respond to me.

1euwsx4,Future professors...please know what you're getting into,"My husband has dedicated 15+ years to his field of study. He's worked really hard. He has a list of peer reviewed publications. Glowing references. Experience in the public and private sector. 

The goal of becoming a history professor kept him motivated. His interest in the field came through in conversations. He had a talent for finding ways to break down current events and how the world has come to this point. 

The last 15 years have been hard. We've made a lot of sacrifices (no kids, rent the basement apartment at  his parents house, live very boring uneventful lives).

The eye was always on the end result. His supervisors and colleagues were very encouraging and supportive. Maybe phrases went to his head and my head..like..  ""the best PhD proposal I have seen in 10 years""; ""I'm postponing my sabbatical, I have to work with you""; ""count yourself as one of 5 experts in the world for this field""; ""you will be able to write your own ticket""; ""history is important, there will always be a place for history""; ""an education from a Russell group university means your foot is already in the door"". 

Well, a lot has changed in the world. Academia changed. 

He recieved his PhD just over 1.5 years ago. He's applied to over 600+ positions. 

Each week the search criteria would be expanded. 
In province, out of province, history, history-adjacent. Fulltime. Part time. Contract. Course. Talent Pool. Exam invigilator. University. College. U.S.; U.K.; N.Z.; AUS. Europe. Anywhere english speaking. Asia. Middle East. South America. Postdoc. Intern. Paid. Unpaid. 

He's had 3 interviews and one visiting professorship.  His application package is excellent. He's met with career counsellors at the university and elsewhere.
He's been told history is dead. We're not replacing outgoing/retiring professors. The department is closing. He's studied the wrong kind of history. He cannot check off any categories that would make him a preferred candidate/hire. Sorry your application wasn't even reviewed. Thank you for your interest, we recieved over 3000 applications for this position. Sorry we cannot give you feedback. Dear ""insert candidate name here"". 

He was so defeated. He refocused his approach..he tried public service.  Policy officer programs, border security, defense analysts... Rejected. 

Tried the military. Rejected- not fit for service due to an undiagnosed hearing impairment (news to him, he hears fine). 

My husband went from someone who was so passionate and eager to teach and learn history, to someone who has no purpose. His spirit is broken. He hates himself. He regrets everything. This is not okay. 

This has been 15 years. 15 years is a lot of time to be working toward something and not see any benefit to your efforts. We're in our late 30s/early 40s. We both thought we'd set roots down somewhere by now. 

It's beyond heartbreaking to watch.

So anyone interested in academia, please do your research. Surround yourself with supportive people. 

And if you know anyone else in this same boat, please be kind and check in on them. This is a very lonely and depressing journey. 

And if you work in academia already, particularly in HR, please.. remember the human beyond the application. The most helpful rejection emails my husband receives include information like how many applicants there were. This really helps put things in perspective, and helps him understand the market better.

1euvb6d,After giving two and a half months notice Boss asked for me to take on additional jobs. ,"Greetings all, I am in need of some guidance. I have worked for a small business for 16+ years, was partner for a period of time and we sold our company to someone who we know well, but is not in our industry. 
     After some time I have decided to step down. The job was already burning me out and we had family loss and other things that have happened this year. I gave my boss two and a half months notice to show respect and support for the company. 
     My boss has now asked me to complete additional tasks before my departure to ‚Äúset the company up for success‚Äù before I go. He has offered a bonus, but I am leery of saying yes. 
     My body has been showing signs of extreme stress from breaking out into hives since our last project and I have had uncontrollable bouts of crying. Some of this is my fault for being a ‚Äúyes‚Äù person, something I will start to address when I begin counseling next week. 
     I have already communicated that some of his goals are unachievable in the time frame that he wants and said no to him, and since he is not in our industry I do not feel that he understands what his employees do everyday. 
     The tasks he wants us to complete I have already said would be too much to take on in a short period, so he asked for half of it to be done, with a bonus. I am protective of my manager and ultimately this will fall on her if I do not help before I go. He has also offered her a bonus (and yes it is sizable) and I do not want to take that away from her. I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
   He has also said he is entertaining not replacing me and putting my responsibilities on my manager, which is far too much for anyone to shoulder. 
Any suggestions are appreciated greatly. ",emopuncher,9,0.9100000262260437,10,1723937753,2024-08-17 23:35:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1euvb6d/after_giving_two_and_a_half_months_notice_boss/,8,2024
1eutvse,My Experience with Primerica/ starting out with insurance advice...,"‚ÄºÔ∏èThis information below is about my experience with this so called company. Please note that this information is to spread awareness on the topic, so you can have your own opinions or beliefs about it. Just know this is from my experience‚ÄºÔ∏è

As I was looking for a new change in a career pathway, I wanted to get back into insurance. In my mind, I wanted to start out with a company so that I can get my training paid for on the job. I went on indeed and started applying to jobs. One of them was Primerica. 

They reached out to me on indeed to set an interview through Zoom. As I attended the zoom meeting, they talk about how newcomers are ""trained and supported"" to obtain Life Insurance License, and Security License. They open the conversation with, ""tell me about yourself, what state you live in, etc.."" and said my first name every sentence they would state, it felt scripted. 
They spoke little bit about the company and how it helps middle income and lower income families provide help for financial advise. Then they talk about their struggles and how this company helped them succeed financially to where they can help others. 

Once I signed that IBA form from them, I somehow didn't feel right about doing it. I did read through the contract before signing. At the time, I was motivated to get my license quick. When they told be about the incentives they give out (for example, by me signing that form just earned me $50 great...) it was nice to see but my main motivation was to just get my licenses. 

I thought maybe I can just go through the process easily, but they tell you to download these different apps, and all you get is SPAM. What was most difficult for me was that they ask for you to join these ""business meeting"", or ""training meetings"" while I was trying to go through the insurance courses. On top of the spam, they direct message you insisting you attend more meetings, and more zoom calls to try and gain incentives, and get through the steps. This hurt my brain...

I had to meet with a third person that tried to butter me up with ""all that cash flow"" from people who have dedicated their time with the company, and moved their way up. I was showed slide after slide of trips, incentives, concerts, but the one that stuck to me the most was one of a Mercedes Pyramid. They shove it in your face without even saying it. ITS A PYRAMID SCHEME! Then they stated the process of moving up in the company, and outlines the steps for you by shouting: 
RECRUIT! MEETING! RECRUIT! They sent me a link via messages about adding these meetings to my Google calendar from previous months up until December. I viewed it and it was literally 5-6 day weeks of zoom meetings on ""business ethics"" which is just hyper motivated speaches on how others were making good money and on operating a business through ethics.
This person then spoke with me about the insurance courses I was taking, and how to pass the test. Stating AND admitting to using chatgpt to cheat through the pretest courses, and then studying the questions through chatgpt to study for the test. They stated that I will not be using the information ON THE JOB that the courses provided. Then what is the point of me obtaining my life and securities licenses if they didn't apply to what I would be doing? 

That's when I started questioning myself ""what did I get myself into?""...

I have heard ""amazing stories"" from these people on how this company has changed their lives, but more importantly how they impacted others, especially those like me who are the bottom level of income. Yet they flash slides of going on trips, going to concerts... Yeah you get the idea. That's when I started feeling like shit. 

Throughout the process I did question them. The biggest red flag for me was when I asked about the recruitment and making a FB post. 
They said it was apart of the process of ""creating my own brand."" Then they asked if I have already created a list of family members/friends for recruitment. I said no, and asked how I can properly recruit someone.They told me not to say anything to them and just send them their way. 
Like what? I told them I did not feel comfortable sending people's information without the person's permission. 
Then, they sent me a script that sounded like total Chatgpt or some form of AI, and asked me to create a three way group chat. The ending of that AI script stated, 
""I‚Äôve added my trainer in this chat to discuss further."" 
Again, They DO NOT care for the permission from the person you reach out to. 

In the end, I had to think to myself, maybe I can stay and just do the courses without having to deal with meetings, zoom calls, bogus incentives. I decided that to me, it was not worth it. As of now, I cancelled my IBA contract (getting refunded for, along with the insurance courses), opted out of every app, deleted spam meetings on my Google calendar, and removed every recruiter from my contacts.

I highly advise that you do research on a company before applying. Just check and see if its a good fit for you. If you like multilevel-marketing schemes, maybe this is the job for you, but for most it is not. 
In my opinion, I don't think this job is the appropriate way for someone to start as an entry level insurance agent. It does seem easy to do, but most of the money I will be making comes from the people I recruit, not from clients (commission would be 30% from applicants if I have stayed) 

Right now I am reversing my steps and getting my license first and then applying to jobs that are in need of an insurance agent. From what I was told by many people, it is better to start with Property and Casualty before moving up to different ones like life and health because they are harder, but that all depends on a person to person basis because some requirements are based on the job you are looking for. 

I saw this video after I opted out of everything, and it truly explains a lot more than what I have been through with Primerica:

1euqgpk,Should I quit my job and focus on MBA admission process OR should I just move to another company?,"As a context, i have been working ~4 years in my current company. I really love my job, my direct manager, the company culture and etc. 

However, my direct manager is leaving in 3 months and I am given two options:
1. To stay at my current role but will be reporting to another manager called C. I like C as a person but C has the same level as I am. So C will get promoted (to be 1 level above me) and my next promotion will have to wait until his next promotion comes. This is a career suicide for me. 

Anyone else in the company would think my department would be under me when my direct manager resigns (this does not even come from me). So I am very hurt bcs C has not even handled this department ever yet being given the role easily. 

2. To shift department. I will have to report to L. The problem is that L has 10 people reporting to him and  considering I am the ‚Äúnew‚Äù recruit, the promotion for me will come much later than his current team members. This will also set back my career.


I do not like both options and seriously consider to resign from my position. The thing is, I love my current role and I felt like it‚Äôs forcefully being taken away from me. I know you must‚Äôve thought I am an entitled person in delusion. But let me tell you that my bonus and scores always reflect the highest in my department. Moving to another team may mean that I have some loses and huge disadvantage.

If I have to start over, I‚Äôm thinking should I just aim for MBA or just move to another company?

1euq86g,Should I study marketing for masters in US? Or should I study bachelors in engineering? What should I study to get H1B visa? ,"I am 20 yo from Central Asia, I am 4th year student studying journalism. I am thinking of studying masters in marketing in US. I am worried about my future career after masters. US job market is in horrible condition, mass layoffs, corporate greed. I am worried about visa sponsorship, since I will have only 1 year of OTP and less time to get H1B. I am really worried that I won‚Äôt be able to get a job with visa after graduating because of the oversaturated market for marketing. They will always prefer a local no matter how good I am. My masters degree will be wasted then. 
Masters will cost me around 150K$ if we combine tuition fees and living expenses. My parents can afford to fund me but they aren‚Äôt millionaires or mega rich. So it‚Äôs a very important financial decision. 

I have been thinking about going to a STEM field and studying engineering. I am interested in computer science but it is also an extremely oversaturated. Everyone is trying to get into tech and now it has become: ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt know what to do just learn coding‚Äù. Perhaps I should do engineering in something else than tech? Not sure. If I study something tech or engineering related I will have to study 4 years and start from scratch. It might end up costing more expensive around 250$K but the salaries after graduation are so much higher? I have read entry level marketing jobs only pay around 35K-45K$. And I will have 3 years of OTP and more time to get visa. However I will be dependent on my parents for a longer time. I will be around 25 at the time graduations. Also it will be a bachelors degree not masters. What I am worried about the most is not being able to study well or ending up miserable studying engineering. I am afraid that I will fail and be expelled. I have ADHD and autism(I am officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist) and I really struggle to focus and have high performance. Engineering degrees and jobs are very demanding and stressful so they are paid accordingly. It‚Äôs not that I am not smart, it‚Äôs just that I really struggle to be productive because of ADHD. Marketing seems like less stressful field to me, I have been a marketing intern in a local company for 2 months.

Whatever it is I don‚Äôt plan on working as journalist. I definitely need career field change. I want to apply this fall for the next academic year and leave for 2025 fall semester. I do not have option of working more years or taking more time. My parents are narcissists and I am done with their abuse and cannot stay with them for longer. I want to study only in US. 

I feel so lost, stuck and hopeless. Please share your thoughts. ",anxiousADHDdkid,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1723923969,2024-08-17 19:46:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1euq86g/should_i_study_marketing_for_masters_in_us_or/,8,2024
1eupeo7,Should I quit my private university job I started a month ago?,"I have worked in higher education for what seems like forever. First at a community college for 6 yrs, then a public university for 1yr and now a private university - of which I was super excited for - having turned down another position elsewhere just to be there. 

So as I mentioned, I started my position at this private university about a month ago. For context, the gig is a normal hourly position from 8-5pm at not exactly the greatest pay. However I took the job because it got my foot in the door to the department I‚Äôve wanted to work in. I also live about 35 minutes away without traffic and with 50 minutes. It‚Äôs quite the drive but seemed worth it. 

Continuing on, I work with a majority of women and they all seemed really nice, personable and welcoming. And of course, me tying to get to know them the first week I asked them about themselves and shared abit about myself. I thought i was having great conversations about what we used to do, our majors in college, what we plan to do, nothing to personal and all good things. 1st week came to a close very well. Or so I thought.

The 2nd week, there was a day I was running late and I had sent a text to my bosses boss letting her know that I am running late, in my hurriedness I forgot to text her when I arrived, and that was my fault. This led to my first awkward conversation about timeliness, apparently one of the other ladies IMed her and said I‚Äôve been coming in late‚Ä¶. even though I was only late that day).. the conversation moved from timeliness to about how some people are private and to not ask them questions maliciously or not maliciously. I was to much in shock at how the conversation went I forgot to advocate for myself and verbalize I had no ill intent in trying to make conversation. The remainder of that week I kind of just put my head down.

The 3rd week I started eating lunches off campus, just saying the cordial good morning, have a good evening, and not trying to insert myself in a conversation where I‚Äôm not wanted. Still keeping a cordial‚Äôs distance.

Now, This past week‚Ä¶ there was three days I left at 4:57, 4:58 and 4:56pm. Times I thought were reasonable.. but yet again another awkward conversation to be had‚Ä¶ I got a Teams video call from my boss. She told me she heard I was leaving early and would need to stay there until 5:00pm. My response affirmed I did leave with in a 2-3 minute window but nothing like 15-10 or even 5 minutes. I tried not to show it but my heart kinda sank because I don‚Äôt feel like I was doing anything wrong yet I‚Äôm still being targeted by some in my first month of just trying to work there.

I have found myself reverting back, toning down my enthusiasm and kind of shelling myself in because of the office culture‚Ä¶ The few complaints about me that led to two awkward conversations with my boss and my bosses boss. Any advice? Am I being unreasonable/dramatic? Is 4:56pm too early? Should I start looking else where?

I'm only 19, so I have little to no experience in a skilled profession. I'd say most of my experience is more marketing, if that helps.

I don't fancy uni, as it's just something that never appealed to me. Even A-levels didn't interest me. I ended up getting DDC. I also got average GCSE's too (5/6's). 

I feel the best way to get out of Walsall would be to do an apprenticeship in a different city while living in a house share in that city. Problem would be finding an apprenticeship that will pay me enough to even live independently - but I'm sure they're out there.

I am not really picky on which avenue of finance I want to go down, more so just what certification/masters I would need to break in (CFA or MBA) that has a high earning potential and okay wlb.

1eums22, Feeling Stuck After My BA in Criminal Justice‚Äî Really Really Need Advice.,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm reaching out because I‚Äôm feeling pretty lost and could really use some guidance. I recently completed my Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice, but I‚Äôm struggling to find promising job opportunities in this field. I‚Äôm not interested in traditional law enforcement roles unless they‚Äôre more administrative or desk-based.

The reality is that my home life isn‚Äôt healthy, and I‚Äôm in urgent need of finding a stable career path to help me get my life in order and eventually move out. I‚Äôm interested in risk management, cybersecurity, and tech-related fields, but I‚Äôm also open to exploring any other academic paths that could lead to a good remote job.

**Here‚Äôs where I need your help:**

1. **What academic programs, degrees, or certifications** would be valuable for someone transitioning into fields like tech, risk management, or cybersecurity?
2. **Are there any remote job opportunities** in these areas or even unrelated fields that I should consider?
3. **What steps should I take** to make a successful career shift given my current circumstances?

I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed and a bit hopeless, but I‚Äôm eager to find a path that offers stability and the chance for a fresh start. Any advice, recommendations, or personal experiences would be incredibly appreciated.

Thank you so much for your support and guidance.",Maleficent_Wish3280,2,1.0,4,1723914764,2024-08-17 17:12:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eums22/feeling_stuck_after_my_ba_in_criminal_justice/,8,2024

1eulbsu,Retail pharmacist 15 years ago vs now,"15 years ago my family and everyone they knew advocated for their children to become retail pharmacists. They said it was the easiest/fastest way to obtain a doctorate degree and get a high paying job but be ‚Äúcozy‚Äù. 

I had a different life path and thus I never got to experience this myself to make up my own opinions.

15 years later, my younger cousins are all about to enter college and my siblings are now advocating for them to pursue pharmacy and become retail pharmacists. I come from a 1st generation immigrant background where many of the older family members have a distorted view of what it means to ‚Äúgo to college and get a great job‚Äù (don‚Äôt blame them, they have never gone through the experience themselves). Their definition of ‚Äúcozy‚Äù may be completely way off to what many 2nd+ gen Americans think.

That said, I wanna be able to provide some insight to my cousins. I‚Äôve done some research and I find conflicting information.

Regarding salary, I‚Äôve heard that the pay actually isn‚Äôt that good in 2024, you‚Äôd start around 98k to 110k and have little room for salary growth. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm also reading the national average is like 130k. I‚Äôm sure cost of living geography impacts this. While the salary is more than adequate, I think the concern is the lack of salary growth or salary cap.

I also heard that it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúcozy‚Äù job. You‚Äôre always on your feet, and you have customers who are may be impatient, and you are always understaffed/overworked. I guess for those who come from a harsher background such as my family, that is considered cozy. It is all relative.

I also heard that as a retail pharmacist, career growth and expansion is limited. But unsure of details -  could anyone provide clarity?

Thank you for anyone that has experience that can add some clarity, there‚Äôs a lot of info in this field and I‚Äôm sure times have changed.

1eul96z,My company wants to send me abroad for 6 months. What do I need to know to negotiate fair terms?,"This is a LARGE chunk of time. I will be away from family and friends and will have to put my life on hold in the US while I'm in Germany. Without setting anything in stone, I did discuss the possibility of bringing my cat. A few things thay make this trip a bit concerning: 

I have a bit of depression and anxiety and take medication for this, so having my cat does help for emotional support (he's not an official support animal). If I cannot bring him, this would be much harder to commit to for a full 6 momths

I do take medications that neeed to be refilled on a regular basis so I'm not sure my health insurance would allow 6 months of a supply. 

Being in a hotel vs a place where I can cook. Eating take out becomes hard on my body after a week. I can't fathom going 6 months on a take-out diet.

I currently rent an apartment and my lease ends in December. I could stay at my parents and commute until it's time for me to leave but if I have to sign a new lease, what then for my apartment and money going down the drain?

So those are my concerns. But I also see this as a great opportunity to build my skills, I've been in this country for 3 months for school, so I know a bit of what the culture is like however I am not fluent in the language. I'll be studying but it's not a requirement to be fluent for this work. 

So I'd like to know how can ensure I am compensated well for this trip? The company provides a card that will pay for my housing and food while overseas, there is no stipend or daily limits. Can I request additional compensation for paying rent on an apartment I can't live in, an increase in pay while I'm overseas, additional PTO if I want to fly home? Any tips would be helpful.

1euknbl,More $$ or time and freedom.,"More $$ OR more time and freedom? Need help deciding!

I (34 M) have been offered a new job at a company similar to my current job.

My current job has ALOT of perks that are overlooked by management due to less pay. I currently make 26$ per hour. 

I routinely work 4-6 hour days and am paid for 8 hrs everyday. Kind of like salary, but still hourly. I am ALWAYS paid for my 40 hrs a week despite working ~25 hrs a week. I work alone most days and have a company vehicle to use where they send me out to job sites to complete various tasks. I have little to no interaction with my boss. I get a text or possibly have to call him ~3 times a month. I‚Äôm able to use my vehicle outside of work for small trips to the grocery or other miscellaneous things as long as they are not a ‚Äúroad trip‚Äù.

 I get along fine with all my colleagues. I have good insurance and benefits. 

The new job I was offered is in the same work field. BUT this job is offering me 35$ per hour. That‚Äôs roughly an extra 200$ per week. 800$ per month and a whopping extra 20,000$ per year. 

BUT the catch is I will be routinely checked in on by my boss. I will always have to work 8 hours a day ( the vehicle is GPS tracked and cannot use it outside of work). It will be a little more workload as they have to fill my 8 hrs of work. Same benefits and insurance. 

My current mental health is great. I LOVE having the free time. I love being able to sleep in untill 9AM and lazily go work until 2-3 PM. I have gotten very accustomed to my current schedule. 

Is the extra cash worth it? 

I am currently able to pay all my bills and expenses with my income. I‚Äôm NOT able to afford fancy things like a new vehicle or a mortgage on a house. 

I have no crazy expenses like children or debt currently. 

I‚Äôm scared by taking this new position, my current employer would not hire me back if things do not work out. I feel as if I‚Äôm risking a very kosher job for more money and may never have a work schedule like my current one. 

My current job annual income is around 52,00$ ( an average income in my area)

My new annual income would be 72,000$ ( an above average income for my area) 

I have gotten very little sleep recently and am incredibly plagued by this hard decision. Please help me Reddit gods. ",RxBandit29_,7,0.9900000095367432,2,1723909265,2024-08-17 15:41:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1euknbl/more_or_time_and_freedom/,8,2024

I got a BA degree in International Relations (International Econ major) with about 8 years of various admin, customer/stakeholder success type positions. I would like to switch my career path into Finance. Long story short its only in my late 20s I realized that I want to pursue Finance career.

I have currently two options, either pursuing a BA in Accounting and Finance at one of top 3 universities in the world under a sped up program, since some of my credits will overlap (will take me 2 years to complete it)

Or go straight into Msc in Financial Management which will also take 1.5-2 years. But this university is lets say top 10-15. I am also thinking of simultaneously pursuing CFA.

Another detail to add is that I am from Geneva Switzerland, and there is an abundance of finance jobs here, so it's not like I will need to relocate or do some drastic lifestyle changes to pursue this path. I am just wondering how hard would it for me to put foot in the door without a Finance BA background if I go straight for Masters.

1euj62l,What's a life hack that made your life easier?,"I'll start with mine: During undergrad, I became a Resident Advisor. I only worked 2-4 hours a week, and it covered my rent for four years! I‚Äôm still doing the same now in grad school.

Another life hack I believe in is investing early for retirement.

Growing up in the Middle East, one life hack I always admired was earning in dollars or euros while spending in the local currency. International workers could live above average without needing to be born into wealth or marry into it.

Why I‚Äôm asking:

I‚Äôm currently pursuing a PhD in life sciences with 2-3 years left. I recently finished an internship in a pharma company, and honestly, life feels a bit sad. The daily routine of a 40-minute commute and 9-5 doesn‚Äôt seem worth it.

I grew up in a place where you were paid just enough to live, but you had time‚Äîtime for family, friends, and life outside work. Here in the U.S., it feels like life is all work, with little time left for anything else. I get that people here focus on enjoying their free time, family, and hobbies, but when is there time for that?

I appreciate the opportunities here, but I‚Äôm searching for a life hack to make this situation better. Maybe work somewhere like Spain or Lithuania, getting paid in dollars, and living my best life. But with my career path in research requires significant funding, my options seem limited to places like Boston or San Francisco.

1eui34r,Where do I go from here? ,"
Hi there!! I (32F) feel like I‚Äôm approaching a fork in the road career-wise and I‚Äôm a little lost. 

I went to college for graphic design and website management and design. I already knew how to code before I started college so I worked part time for and e-commerce company through college and after. I ended up being their lead designer, but due to financial reasons I was laid off in 2014. 

I decided to take a job at a local craft coffee shop as a barista. I immediately fell in love with the art and science that‚Äôs a part of every aspect of the job. I‚Äôm honestly not bragging, but I easily excel at most things that I decide I want to do (unless it‚Äôs sports‚Ä¶) so learned the job very quickly, soaked in all the knowledge I could and loved it. I know part of me loves it because you can goof off, don‚Äôt have to be super serious, joke around a lot. That appeals to me bc starting at 14 I developed chronic illness and pain that made me grow up really fast and was home, very ill during my teens and early 20s. I stayed at that shop for 5 or 6 years, then was offered a bar manager position at a high volume shop in a large city. The team was the best team I ever have worked with, they were fun, great baristas, supportive, and everyone genuinely loved everyone that worked there. I thought I would stay there until I was ready to move on to my next step in coffee. Sadly the owner did a few illegal things with our pay, fired our beloved manager, and was treating us all with extreme disrespect, we all found other jobs and walked on the same day. 

I have worked at 3 other shops since then and it just isn‚Äôt the same, also the pay at these lower tier shops isn‚Äôt great. I‚Äôve had to take some time off working at all to deal with some health problems and I want to spend this time also planning what I would like to do when I do go back to working. 

Ideally I would like to remain in the coffee field. I could take classes to get my technical training to be a technician who services shop equipment, I could consult, and there are other things you can do in the coffee field. I was hoping someone had some ideas or advice that I haven‚Äôt thought of. I really want to take everything into consideration because I‚Äôm done bouncing from shop to shop, I want a job home lol. 

Any advice or guidance is welcome and would help. ",RevolutionaryBelt975,2,1.0,2,1723902298,2024-08-17 13:44:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eui34r/where_do_i_go_from_here/,8,2024

I signed up for job centre a month ago. This week I was offered the opportunity to take either a railway engineering or a data engineering course. Right after I was given the options I received a phone call saying I got accepted for a job which happened to be a door to door sales jobs.

Door to door sales job - I have been confirmed the job but it's largely going to be commission based. 

Railway engineer - sounds like something I'll enjoy but it's a course so it's not a guaranteed job at the end.

1eufib0,From the trades to I don‚Äôt know what,"Hello everyone!

Recently I‚Äôve been struggling with knowing what I want my career to be. My life has changed drastically in the last year or so where I am questioning everything. Are there any good test that help you figure out what career might be best for you?

As a little back story, I‚Äôm about to turn 25 and all of my working life has been in the trades, mostly going into CNC and workshop type gigs. I had a job I loved that I left when I got married and moved to Scandinavia the beginning of this year. Now it seems like my spouse and I are going to be returning to the US by the end of this year. I‚Äôm hoping to get my old job back but since I‚Äôm married now and will be working towards buying a home and matching work schedule with my husband now that he will not be a student for much longer, I‚Äôm struggling with wanting to keep being a tradesmen. 

I‚Äôve thought about moving up the ladder to do some drafting and programming (I‚Äôm a few classes away from a getting a associates degree in Mechanical Design and a CNC certificate) or maybe eventually become some type of manufacturing engineer. But I‚Äôm not sure if I would like to pursue careers that are more stay at home since there might be a good chance my husband has a SAH job as well. I love working in manufacturing, it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done longest and what I know but I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs any job that could keep me in this field but also working from home. I don‚Äôt even know how to get started if there is that option. I would hate to start over from zero to go into a new industry but I will if I like it and has good potential for at least 50k a year and stay at home options. 

I would love to hear from all people but especially people who have worked in the trades and have had career changes. Thank you!",OneWithTheMachine,2,1.0,2,1723894221,2024-08-17 11:30:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eufib0/from_the_trades_to_i_dont_know_what/,8,2024
1eufbl9,From 3D Artist to Digital Marketer? Worth it?,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm a 3D artist who's been struggling to find work for over 6 months now. I'm starting to feel like I need to diversify my skills to stay afloat in this industry. I've been considering taking a digital marketing course, but I'm not sure if it's worth my time.

Has anyone else out there made a similar transition? Can I really use my creative skills in a new field like digital marketing? Or should I just stick to what I know and keep applying for 3D art jobs?

I'd love to hear from anyone who's gone through a similar experience or has advice on how to break into digital marketing. Can I build my own brand using the skills I learn? Or is it better to look for a job in the field?

Let me know your thoughts!

1euf6vh,Did I do something wrong. ,"

I got sent to my boss's office because there was a claim of me leaving work early. I didn't leave early, but it basically ended we me telling my boss that employees under her management have manipulated their work to get ""a full day's of work"" in less time and then physically leaving the office campus early. So they do an hour of work in ""15"" minutes. Essentially, by 1:00 they are done. And then they find a way to slip out of the office earlier. I told she needs to reconsider what's going on in the office because I told I find it frustrating that I'm getting called out on something I didn't do while other people do this on a daily basis. 


My question now is do I send an email to my boss reviewing what we discussed and how she's going to change the policy. Or do I stay low and don't do anything and make sure I'm coming to work on time?  I feel like I accidently put a target on my back now and I don't know what to do now.

1eud1hk,Future Career Advice!!,"I'm an eighteen-year-old male about to join the U.S. Navy as an Aviation Structural Mechanic (AM), and I'm seeking some advice. My goal is to set myself up for guaranteed success, both during and after my military service, but I'm finding it challenging to decide on the best path forward.

To give some background: I've lived my entire life in northeastern Arkansas, where I've been blessed with a supportive family. I've also been fortunate to find love early in life, and I plan to get married after completing boot camp. Throughout high school, I was passionate about music and was actively involved in my school's band program. Music has always been something I excel at, and before enlisting in the Navy, my plan was to attend college for music education, with the goal of taking over my high school's band program.

I didn't seriously consider the military until my junior year of high school. After a Navy recruiter visited my school and explained the opportunities available, I did some research and realized that enlisting would be a smart financial move and beneficial for my relationship. After much thought, I decided to sign up.

Lately, I've been thinking a lot about my future and how to build a solid foundation that will support me after my military service. While I'm not particularly interested in pursuing an aviation-related career in the civilian world, I plan to take full advantage of the training and certifications the Navy offers. This way, I have aviation as a fallback option if needed. However, my true passion lies in music, and I'd love to pursue a career in that field. I'm also considering other options like working in counterintelligence for the FBI or possibly entering law enforcement.

I know there are many career paths I haven't yet explored, and I'm struggling to figure out the best direction, especially since I want to have a family and children after my active service. I just want to make the best choices for myself and my future family.

If anyone has advice on what steps I should be taking or what careers I should be looking into, I'd greatly appreciate it. Any input would be helpful.",wbstull06,1,1.0,1,1723883996,2024-08-17 08:39:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eud1hk/future_career_advice/,8,2024
1eucvml,"Thinking about switching to 3 new industries. I'll work in all 3, if I have to.","I'm currently 28, have lived on my own for 8 months, unemployed for the last 2 years and have decent work experience in sales, insurance, manual labor and a few other things.

I'm basically below the poverty line, and thinking of careers mirroring my hobbies, that would be great to work in: and 3 industries hit me:

1. Real estate investing; 
2. Being an extra (possibly with a goal of becoming a director or executive producer) in the film/television industry;
3. Becoming a biographer, historian and author.

I'm also thinking about becoming a biographer and author, with a focus on historical figures and influential people who haven't had much written about them, and I'd be writing the first ever biography about any of them. I'm very forward-thinking in that way.

There's only one problem: I don't drive. So, I'm trying to work remotely in other 9-to-5 jobs first, to sustain myself but I keep getting rejected.

I live in New Jersey (in a small town, 30 minutes west of the Shore), but my goal is to move to Nevada to live with my boyfriend. He's gone for at least 14 hours of every 24 hour day (7 days a week), so whichever path I choose - real estate, being an author or being a film extra will be a much-needed distraction from my boyfriend ignoring me & the stress it's caused me.

I'm also looking to form a partnership with someone (I believe in the power of collaboration - strength in numbers), and in our partnership, this second person will agree to mentor me to help me achieve my career goals and financial goals, and map out a process to get me there.

1eubdgc,Would love advice from some career veterans on which job to choose ,"Hi all! Would love to get some thoughts on this. I'll keep this as short as I can: 

I was laid off from a corporate marketing job a few months ago. I've started volunteering and have discovered an industry I'm passionate about through that. I'd like to transition to that industry and have been applying for jobs and networking. 

In the mean time, I've been offered two positions. One is doing corporate marketing in an industry I don't care about, and it would be a 65-mile (round trip) commute each day. It pays the same moderate amount as my old gig. 

The other is for a position in the industry I want to be in, and it's about five minutes from my home. However, it would be a HUGE pay cut from my last position--about 40%. It's for a non-profit; they're not massively lowballing me, or anything like that. They offered me the top of their pay range. 

I'm trying to decide which to choose. 

I know on the surface a 40 percent cut sounds insane to even consider. But my thoughts are this: 

1. It's in the industry I want to be in, in a large organization. So there would be networking and advancement opportunities. 

2. I have an emergency savings that would cover the shortfall from my expenses and this position for about 6-9 months. 

3. I don't intend for this to be a permanent position, and avoiding an hour+ commute each way with traffic would allow me more time to apply for jobs after the work day.

4. And -- it's sad that this is the last thing I consider -- but it would give me a far greater sense of purpose and contentment than any role I've previously held. My career up until this point has been a slog, because I chose it for its stability, not because I had any affinity for it. That said, after more than one layoff, it's clearly not that stable. 

A little context: I'm 30. I don't have any debt. I rent my apartment. I don't have kids, I don't plan to have kids. But I also don't have a lot of savings.

I'm historically a very careful person, but after surviving a severe bout of depression--mostly due to my life situation--I'm feeling strongly about taking some calculated risks.

1eu9xou,Employment Application for job I was offered. I really need advice please!,"I was recently offered a job and asked to fill out a background check and provide references. In addition to this I was provided an employment application and requested I fill it out. The application is unlike anything I have seen before in that it includes this language.

""I further understand that the Company may contact my previous employers and all educational facilities I have attended. I authorize those employers and educational facilities to disclose to the Company all records and information pertinent to my employment with them. In addition to authorizing the release of any information regarding my employment, I hereby waive any rights or claims I have or may have against my former employers, their agents, employees, and representatives, as well as other individuals who release information to the Company, and release them from any and all liability, claims, or damages that may directly or indirectly result from the use, disclosure, or release of any such named herein as personal references to provide the Company with any pertinent information they may have regarding myself.""

In the application I have to share if I have ever been terminated or asked to resign from a job. I was terminated from my last job, however, it was more a mutual parting of ways and more nuanced. My employer stated that it had nothing to do with my quality of work and ultimately I was dissatisfied with company policies and the company wasn't willing to invest anymore energy. I even collected unemployment. I had no write ups or corrective actions while at the job. I'm nervous about saying no (about term or resig) on the application because that means I will have to explain and potentially lose the job if they look into it. However, if I say yes, then they will know it was a termination (as listed by HR) for sure even though it was an amiable mutual parting of ways. I even stayed on for an additional 30 days to help the company be set up for success before my departure instead of being fired on the spot.

1eu92tf,I really need advice!,"I never thought I would post a question to the Reddit community and i apologize in advance for the length and/or rambling but here goes. 

I am a 52 y/o (almost) mother of 3, grandmother of 2. I've been working in a specialized industry for almost 30 years. The current, and start up company where i work is paying  me  more money than I've ever made.  A lot more. I'm in a lot of debt due to losing my job in a mass layoff in August 2022, out of work until March 2023, and now working with the original owners of the first company who left and started  this company. 

I've been trying to get a job with the feds for a while to no avail. Until recently, when  I finally received the email saying I had the job (once I passed all the tests  - fingerprints, background, etc). This job is low paying but is secure, COL increases every year as well as an increase for years of service/grade advancement. When I retire I will have a small pension. In 20 years :(. 

I'm torn on what to do. 

Should I stay at the high paying, yet high risk (terrible management) company that could fold in 2 years leaving me looking for a job? Again. At 54. I know the older I get the less marketable I become, so would like to have a secure job tied down to take me into my twilight years. Uggh. 72. The thought of working another 20 years makes me want to weep.  The job with the feds is a 'now or never situation and I need to decide within the next week or 2 for a late September start date. This will give me 2 good earning months at the current job to pay my debt down below 10k.

If I stay where I am, a place i don't really like, where we have a highly unqualified staff (family and  friends of owners) and were short staffed, making a lot of work for me and a lot of nonsense by people in and outside of the company. BUT, I work from home so am able to help with school pick up/drop off, after-school care, etc and it allows  me to travel and work in other locations, which is great since I have family and friends scattered from sea to shining  sea. I have the trust of management that I can sort of come and go as I please without a lot of flack. Lots of freedom when I'm not chained to my desk working a solid 8 (which is pretty much always) . Flexible, (if we're not super busy but, we always are)OR do i start the job in the completely different industry that is steadier, secure, low paying, but with a pension after 15 - 20.

Oh yeah, my youngest just graduated from university and I have 180k in parent plus loans from the feds. She went to an out- of-state school with no scholarship $, and parents who didn't save for the future of our driven baby girl. So, we took loans to cover the out-of-state costs. 55k ish per year. Ouch. Civil servants get student loan forgiveness after 10 years of repayment. In 10 years I'll probably owe more than I originally  borrowed so, this will be a huge burden off of our shoulders.

The 2 jobs have comparable benefit packages.

What would you do in the situation?",Krissyola,5,0.8600000143051147,9,1723868327,2024-08-17 04:18:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eu92tf/i_really_need_advice/,8,2024

Some questions do make me think things went well. I was asked if I was applying anywhere else, to which I said no. At the end they asked me how I would navigate a situation where a senior 60s year old worker becomes very stubborn and wont budge, and he iterated that its a delicate situation.

1eu5f1f,I feel like I just took a huge step back in my career.,"Hey everyone, something happened today and I feel like I just ruined my opportunity and took a huge step back in my career. I have worked in IT for the past 5 years. During 3 of those years, I was a level 1 promoted to level 2 Device Support Engineer at a Fortune 500 company. I used to get new hires set up on laptops and help with password resets, physical moves, setting up new locations, any sort of end user support, etc. It was a fundamental and entry-level IT job. I left that job and have been at a small family-owned MPS (managed service provider) for 2 going on 3 years in late October. I started at the service desk, working my way up to project coordinator. I had an opportunity to be an Account Manager, which I was pushing for as I am always trying to climb the ladder to bigger opportunities. I was told by my Vice President (VP) that I would get the chance to be an account manager; however, he also wanted me to be a SharePoint migration specialist and continue my role in project coordination. I started training under another account manager who also did SharePoint migrations and quickly learned that there was no chance I wanted to be a SharePoint migration specialist. I understand SharePoint pretty well, but this was much more project-based and technical than what I was led to believe. I only have 2 accounts as an Account Manager, which are great, and I like building those relationships and making a positive impact for people. The 2 accounts are not very big; the total number of people between the 2 companies is only 20, and there's not a lot of technology other than laptops and printers. My Project Coordinator role is pretty simple. If my company believes something is a large project (This could be something simple like buying 30 laptops and getting them installed at the same time or something more complex like getting a new building set up for a client) I would meet with the client and the Account Manager to get a rough scope of work so I know who I need to include on my end, then typically go out on-site with one of my project engineers or the hardware manager to get the full scope, equipment, timeframe, budget, etc. I would get quotes and a proposal together, deliver it to the client, get a sign-off, and oversee the project until completion. I wouldn't do the technical work; I would mostly be there for communications and scheduling. Today was week number 8 trying to find my rhythm and flow in the new position and balancing everything. Over the past week or 2, I haven't been myself. I've been not as engaged in meetings and somewhat in a zone in the office just trying to figure everything out. Today, I had a meeting with my VP and my Manager, and we all decided that being an account manager wasn't going to be in my wheelhouse due to my ""zoning"" issues, which was a red flag for my VP. He is going to take the weekend to think about everything. However, the direction he decided would be best for me to go is with our Hardware team. I feel like I worked for the past 5 years to keep going and improving just to not be able to handle the stress or the change, and now I'm back to square one. (No disrespect to the hardware team; they are honestly great people). I just feel like I worked towards a goal to achieve it, just for it to be taken away. I like the people at this company, and if the direction is to go to the hardware team, the Manager is great, but I just feel personally like I failed. I'm not sure if I should take this lesson and just be the best teammate I can be and grow with the hardware team, or if I should just leave since I feel I broke the trust with my VP and old manager and should start looking for something else. We haven't discussed pay or anything yet however I feel like I will get a pay cut since the hardware teams salary is typically on the lower end in the company.

Should I just quit?,"I‚Äôm a 32-year-old finance professional who made a bold move to a new country within my company, seeking a better quality of life. While I love my new city, I'm struggling with a toxic team environment that's causing career regression and burnout.

In my previous role, I was a decision-maker and leader, but now I'm micromanaged to the point of suffocation. My new manager is aggressive, forgetful, and creates delays, making it impossible for me to perform meaningful work. I'm overwhelmed with tedious tasks, producing multiple decks without any analysis or decision-making responsibilities.

To make matters worse, a new analyst was hired and assigned a high-profile project, while I'm stuck with mundane tasks. He‚Äôs only focusing on that in weeks, and not doing any of the basic tasks as agreed before he joined. When I spoke to my manager about my concerns, he suggested I ""manage my time better.""

I used to love going to work and I went above and beyond for the company. Now I dread zgoing to work, and my health is suffering. I feel trapped due to financial dependence on this job. Has anyone experienced a similar situation? Should I cut my losses and leave, or is there a way to address these issues and reclaim my career satisfaction?

 I had a meeting with our National Sales Manager and HR manager and they said that they cannot offer me the role at this time, due to my lack of sales experience. However, they have said they would love to develop me into a Biz Dev role by offering to pay for my studies and to have me shadowing an existing BDM after completing my study.

They said that I can look into courses that would suit me, so I could present them through to the management team and they will either approve, or get me to find an additional course to study.

1eu372p,First bad review. What to say in next touch-base?,"I‚Äôve been at my company for 5 years and have had an extremely positive track record. Everyone I have ever worked with has had very wonderful things to say and very senior people at my company vouch for me. Two years ago, I got a new director and manager. They were relatively hands off and supportive at first. Company and team expectations are shifting and they have started to micromanage and nitpick. My director has even said extremely hurtful things regarding my integrity due to a misunderstanding but I sensed a shift in my confidence, faith in leadership, and overall passion after that comment. My job has changed a lot this year and I have been a little slow to adapt which has resulted in my first negative review. She said I have many gaps and she will work with me to fix it. I told her I was on board with that. 

All other petty feedback was annoying to me but hearing that she believes I‚Äôm an underperformer definitely was the wake up call that I needed. I have a few touch bases with her next week and I have a few notes that I will mention, mostly demonstrating that I hear her and I am very excited to finish the year ahead with a positive attitude and embracing change.

1eu2bg0,Should I assume this recruiter really wasn‚Äôt feeling me?,"
There‚Äôs been this school that I‚Äôve been trying to get a job at for almost as long as I was at the last school I worked for (almost 2 yrs?). This is a recruiter I dealt with before, it‚Äôs always the same guy & I‚Äôll start with saying I finally got the gig. The application process was always tedious: indeed apply, questionnaire that can probably add up to about a paragraph, interview with recruiter (this guy) and finally panel interview w/ hiring team. The furthest I made it over a yr ago was to that panel interview & got that rejection email, every other time after they‚Äôd send the questionnaire & I got a rejection email shortly after. Well this time around, I made it to the panel interview, was told this was the last step & then am told they want to meet me one last time to ask questions to gauge my experience & my expectations were very low but tried my best and guess it worked out this time around. 

This time around when I first met with the recruiter, he just went on and on almost an hr talking about company culture and kind of tested me too. At one point he said he wanted to hear from me because ‚Äúhe felt like he was doing most of the talking‚Äù. Every time he‚Äôd give info or give an order he‚Äôd always end with that *reassuring* ‚Äúokay‚Äù & it kinda threw me off at times. He did warn me when we first met that he thinks the hiring team would want to meet with me and they did. Yesterday, he calls me to tell me that they extended an offer & I told him I wanted to move fwd but needed to let them know I had a NYE event scheduled after I met with them & wanted to make sure it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. And he said I threw him a curveball, I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong but he wanted me to speak with the hiring mgr before moving fwd bc he didn‚Äôt want to speak for them. He said it should be fine but that curveball comment threw me off. You know when you just feel like someone may be reading you wrong? I come across maybe as too reserved to him but I answer ‚Äúokay‚Äù and asked questions to show interest almost every time. 

I know it wasn‚Äôt his decision, it‚Äôs more what the hiring team thinks but at the same time I can kind of gauge my potential experience with the company based off the early stages.

1eu1ql9,I don't know what job to pick,"Im 20(F), and I need help on what job to pick. Ive worked for about 3 to 4 (insufferable) callcenters before i got this new job as a graphic designer. 
I've never worked as a graphic designer before this. I have a few certificates but i learned the most stuff via youtube, on the job. 

When i started this job i had something called an ""associates contract"" which had a few loop holes like, not getting paid for sick leave, not getting health care (it's mandatory for an employer to pay atleast half the health care insurance monthly where I'm from), and not getting pension, or vacation money. They pay is also not that great. 
Apon hearing all of this i thought ""I can use this job to learn and then maybe job hop again when i have enough skills"". 
There were also some false promises made, like they said they were gonna get me a new laptop so i could work more easily (they didn't, and i ended up slightly upgrading my laptop myself). And stuff along those lines. 

The job itself is really chill (especially compared to a callcenter) and i actually quite like my colleagues. Especially one woman i work with everyday, we make a great team. 

Ive been designing and ive been improving by alot while working here (2 months). But when my boyfriend heard abt me not getting health care etc, he said hed find me a new job, and he did. This new reputable company liked my portfolio so much that they immediately scheduled an opointment and said theyd hire me and i can start in a month. They also offered me more money, insurance etc so i agreed. 

But get this. At almost the exact same time, the company i work at now changed their entire contract. I got a raise (still a bit lower than company B) and they have insurance etc now. 

So now I'm a bit unsure if i should stay at the company i already work at, or job hop again. 

Honestly im leaning towards company b a teeny bit more now, because theyre very reputable, have reputable clients, and have offered to teach me new skills like front end web design. When i mentioned i liked doing new things they also mentioned alot of interesting projects theyre working on, and said theres enough tasks to pick from if i don't wanna design anymore/ wanna help with something else.

Company A did give me a pretty decent raise, but i overheard the supervisor woman saying ""she should actually be open to working a little on the weekends if theres too many tasks now that she got a raise"", which definitely made me feel uneasy. 

The only problem really is, the work at company A is not that bad, fun at times, pretty chill, and i like my colleagues. 

So can you guys help me pick? 
(Feel free to ask more questions if you want me to clarify something)

I (25F) recently decided to leave my job as an elementary school teacher for reasons I won't unpack here. I currently work at a crisis nursery, and while I enjoy it, I don't want to continue doing it long term. I've taken a lot of online quizzes and such to determine what jobs might be right for me, but I really want to hear from others what they think I should do!

Things I look for in a job include a consistent schedule, full time work, at least $19 an hour + benefits, and a work environment that wouldn't require me to take work home once the day is over, at least not consistently. 

I have a bachelors in elementary education and a lot of experience with children, but I would rather not spend my day working with groups of children anymore. Childcare and education are at the bottom of my list of options.

I don't mind some manual labor but would rather that not be the entire job, I enjoy moving throughout the day with periods of rest, and I really like to work independently while seeking help when needed. I enjoy helping others but I really don't want to work in client-based or customer service jobs if I can avoid it.

I don't want a monotonous, same-thing-every-day kind of deal if I can avoid it. 

Also, I'm located near St. Louis, MO!

With these parameters in mind, what kind of jobs would you recommend? Feel free to be as specific or vague as you'd like. I know that few to zero jobs will meet all of my wishes, so don't consider everything I said to be a requirement, just a guideline to help spark ideas.

I graduate this December, 2024 and I will be earning a bachelor's degree in Economics and Chinese Studies. I plan to move abroad for an opportunity next August, 2025, but in the meantime I need to find a short-term opportunity to earn money to pay for my bills until then. However, I have noticed that most of the postings for internships are limited to those who will be graduating in the future, and because of that, I am ineligible. I would really like to gain some professional experience before moving abroad, and not just work retail.

Are there any opportunities that you can think of that might suit me? Are there any internships or short-term positions for recent graduates that I could look into?

Should I just quit?,"I‚Äôm a 32-year-old finance professional who made a bold move to a new country within my company, seeking a better quality of life. While I love my new city, I'm struggling with a toxic team environment that's causing career regression and burnout.

In my previous role, I was a decision-maker and leader, but now I'm micromanaged to the point of suffocation. My new manager is aggressive, forgetful, and creates delays, making it impossible for me to perform meaningful work. I'm overwhelmed with tedious tasks, producing multiple decks without any analysis or decision-making responsibilities.

To make matters worse, a new analyst was hired and assigned a high-profile project, while I'm stuck with mundane tasks. He‚Äôs only focusing on that in weeks, and not doing any of the basic tasks as agreed before he joined. When I spoke to my manager about my concerns, he suggested I ""manage my time better.""

I used to love going to work and I went above and beyond for the company. Now I dread zgoing to work, and my health is suffering. I feel trapped due to financial dependence on this job. Has anyone experienced a similar situation? Should I cut my losses and leave, or is there a way to address these issues and reclaim my career satisfaction?

1etxmcn,How can I show progression on my resume when my job titles sound so similar?,"I've been working for about 6 years, at 3 different Fortune 100 companies. I'm applying for jobs now and I really feel like Covid messed up my title progression. Ever since Covid, I haven't been able to break out of this ""Analyst"" job title. 

Here is my current resume:

1. Technical Project Analyst (1 year)
2. Assoc. Software Project Mgr. (Promoted, 1 year)

*---------Covid Layoff affected Media industry, so I went into Tech-------------*

1. Cloud Analyst (1 year)
2. Sr. Cloud Analyst (Promoted, 1 year)

*---------- Received offer to return back to Media industry----------*

1. Business Analyst IV (1.5 years) - Contract

At my current job, I have significantly more responsibility than any of my previous jobs and the salary is over double from my last job, but I'm still classified as a ""Business Analyst"". The issue is that because it's a contract role, there is no way of progression or promotions, so it's difficult to show growth on a resume. Of course, the descriptions are all accurate to what I do, but I feel like recruiters typically look at titles during initial screenings.

I feel like my resume is getting looked over because of this seemingly lack of progression, when in reality my roles have gotten a lot more complex and contain much more responsibility. I'd say I'm more aligned with a Technical Program Manager.

1etxfjo,Need advice on a career shift + commute,"Hey everyone, like the title suggests I‚Äôm looking to make a career change and I‚Äôd like some advice on whether or not a 50 minute commute sounds worth it to most of you with more professional experience. If I were to take this job, it pays $2 more an hour + the opportunity for what looks to be really good comission after 6-12 weeks from the looks of it. According to the interviewer, average employees meeting their goals will earn around $26 an hour between hourly and comission checks. However the first 6-12 weeks I‚Äôll basically be making the same amount of money after the hourly + tips at my current job since I get about $18 an hour now if you include those tips. My current job offers no benefits whereas the new one seems to have very solid benefits. 

Just wondering if others had gone through anything similar and frankly, if this offer sounds worth it if you were in my shoes.

I would like advice on my situation. I am from East Europe, Mechanical Engineer. I would like to emigrate to USA because I like it's values of liberty and I can say for me that I am a hustler, hard working, and I feel like it is the country where hard work is valued and paid.

However my bio is nothing special, maybe unfortunately even below average. My family had a lot of issues, which troubled my studies so it took me almost 10 years to complete it. In the meantime, I managed to live with temporary jobs, part time jobs and freelance. It was my choice to live like that, I found it the best way to support my family and study. However, 10 years of study do not look good in bio. I would like to highlight that I have Master degree. I have 3 years of experience, 2 in one company and 1 in other, in which I am still working. While I am satisfied with the company, I am not satisfied with the conditions of my home country and home society, and that is the reason why I want to move.

With all I wrote I am very concerned that my hopes for landing a job is slim in USA, especially since I would like to go to either New York or Boston. I am concerned that my lack of experience might be a huge minus, and that I might be seen as a ""job hopper"" . On my strong points, I have certificates of knowledge of some 3D softvares, and a small engineering portfolio.

I would really appreciate advices how can I increase the chances to emigrate to USA. I would really like to show that I am motivated and hard working and I will not dissapoint future employer and run away to other company. Also, how can I improve my bio in the meantime, can I work on some traits, skills, etc, so that I can put it on CV? What US companies like to see very much?

1etvjlq,Help with approaching manager to discuss a salary raise,"Hello! I am planning on reaching out to my manager requesting a raise and wanted some advice on how to approach the subject.

**Some background info**:

I have been working for the company for roughly 4 years (since 2020). However, I have been working on the same contract and supporting the same customer since 2017 (transferred over to my current company when they acquired the contract). I have maintained a positive relationship with our customer and they have expressed satisfaction with the products I produce. Within the past year, my responsibilities have increased tremendously due to internal reorganization - resulting in an internal title change within our team's technical chart but not receiving an official promotion.

It is hard to get a hold of my manager because he is in the process of retirement, and I want to be able to advocate myself to him and his successor to ensure that my salary matches my new responsibilities since onboarding. I was planning on leading with three key points as to why I should be considered for a raise:

1. Stating that my responsibilities and role have increased significantly since I've been hired and providing examples of how my scope of work has expanded - i.e. list of projects I now lead, systems and equipment I ""own"" as POC, etc.
2. Identifying my current salary - and then comparing it to the median salary of what a similar position is listed on the Company's website as well as the median salary listed on Glassdoor for my position.
3. Noting that the rates of inflation since I have been hired are cumulatively higher than the rates of my previous annual raises resulting in a net loss - while including the percentages of inflation and raise percentages each year since being employed.

**Question:**

Is my approach appropriate for this situation? What should I include or omit from my email when contacting my manager? What specifics should I emphasize on?

I appreciate any and all feedback!",Heckhound,1,1.0,0,1723831220,2024-08-16 18:00:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1etvjlq/help_with_approaching_manager_to_discuss_a_salary/,8,2024
1ettymq,How work better under this manager?,"I started a new job 2 months ago and I‚Äôm finding it difficult to work under my manager. She‚Äôs great outside of work but I‚Äôm getting nothing done, and she‚Äôs getting increasingly frustrated with me. 

What throws me off is the way she sets expectations and manages due dates. 

She gives me minimal information as to what needs to be done, there‚Äôs no timeline, and she doesn‚Äôt answer questions. I understand that she wants to see what I‚Äôll come up with unbiased.

I use my best judgment and make progress, then check with her to get her feedback. At that point, she becomes very specific about how my work should look like, to the tiniest of details. Unfortunately I‚Äôm rarely able to use that feedback because it boils down to how she would have done the thing.

It seems to me that she expects a finished product that I stand by. I can‚Äôt show her a finished product because the scope of what we‚Äôre working on is infinite- it‚Äôs not clearly defined and it keeps changing. It would take me months to get there, and she expects days.

My approach has been to ask for feedback often, let her micromanage in those sessions, and hope that I‚Äôll understand the requirements better with time. It hasn‚Äôt been working, and I‚Äôm beginning to feel very uneasy about us working together.

I think from her perspective she wants to be hands off and set high standards, but her approach hasn‚Äôt been working for us so far.

1. Virtual interview goes really well
2. Recruiter says they want me to fly out to interview (they aren't going to pay me back unless I get hired)
3. She tells me the salary $65-70k for an entry level staff accounting position in LA, I'd like more but agree because I'm more interested in finding a good fit than the money.
4. I fly out, they love me, I practically get an offer on the spot
5. I recieve an offer the next day from the recruiter ($65k) I ask to negotiate, she says the hiring manager wouldn't like that, I say I'll do it anyways
6. I email the hiring manager asking to negotiate, we have a call and it goes well, I'm expecting a new higher offer soon
7. The recruiters call me asking what I said to him. I'm honest and say I'm expecting an offer shortly. I honestly lose my temper and mention times they have overtly lied to me, and say I feel they don't have my interests at heart, but I really like the job.

Here are the things they've mentioned:
- hiring manager can't do more than $65k
- isn't normal for them to pay for travel expenses
- it's not normal to negotiate after receiving an offer

How does Equifax obtain this sensitive information? With the willing aid of thousands of U.S. businesses, including much of the Fortune 500. Government agencies (as much as 80-85% of the federal civilian workforce) use the service, including schools and healthcare workers. In order to access the data, these organizations also allow a quid pro quo - they allow Equifax to tap directly into their HR systems so the credit bureau can sell the information to others. In other words, these organizations actually pay Equifax for the privilege of giving away their employees' personal information.

Equifax also sells this data to third parties, including debt collectors and other financial services companies.

I have a lot of issues with feeling and being relatvely old for starting college. I have also always had a dream on becoming an entreprenour. I am smart and an extremely hard worker. My interests are exercise and economy(mostly finance). I now have to make a decision fast, on whether I shall go all in with college, or try to start a business. But im lost with where to start and what business to start. My ambitions are also really big, and I am afraid of the big risk with entreprenourship. In 2-3 years time i will even more feel to old for college. So for me, its really now or never. Its not for the competition with others my age, but more of what i want to do with my life. I dont care about what everyone else thinks, but myself and those who are close to me.

Any thoughts, experience or perspectives on what I should do? College or go for it. I am also ofcourse attracted to be in charge of my own day.

When I graduated from high school, I initially wanted to go to college for aviation and become an airline pilot, but my parents dream for me was always to play college baseball so I went to a smaller school that didn't offer aviation. All of the degrees programs my school offers are pretty useless, all we have is CS, Business, Education, and things general degree like that. The only other degrees that we offer that aren't as worthless are Nursing or Biology (premed or whatever you call it), but I have no idea what Reddit is on about, nursing jobs on Linkedin and Indeed pay significantly less than what is said on here. So I have ended up as a dual major in CIS and Finance, but all I have been told is these degrees are useless and you will struggle to make 30k with 5 YoE. I have no idea what to do, I was considering saying screw it and going into the trades, but my parents would throw me out for doing that because they will only support me if I go on exactly what career paths they want, and I don't have the funds to afford the 3k+ rent that we have to deal with nowadays. Additionally, trades where I live also don't pay what Reddit claims they do, my friend has been in welding for about 4 years now, and just broke 40k or so. What can I even do at this point?

1etrrqh,Should I quit my job when I don‚Äôt want to?,"I might have to quit my job, but I don‚Äôt want to

In October 2023 my fiancee took a job in Colorado which made us long distance since I have to stay in our home state because of my job. It was a decision we made together, it‚Äôs both of our dreams to move there. A ton of thought went into this decision and we felt good about it. He has an amazing well paying job that he loves. Great people, and great work environment (which is uncommon) 

Our thought process was, that I would apply for jobs and then move out there when I landed a job. Well, we get married in 2 months and after about 200 job applications over the  10 months and 10 interviews I have had absolutely no luck finding a job. 

The thing is, I LOVE my job. Like I legit enjoy doing my job and my boss/co workers are the best. I am terrified if I quit my job after the wedding to move with him I might regret losing my amazing job, not many people can say they love their job (especially in this job market) and I might be unemployed for wayyyy too long. 

My fiancee has offered to move home, but I still want to move in Colorado. I guess I am at the point where do I say having a job that I love is worth him moving back and giving up on our dreams? Or do I quit my job and take the chance and move out there? 

We have both tried to think of the best case scenario but either way it seems like a lose lose situation. 

What would you do in this situation? ",Euphoric_House4400,4,0.8299999833106995,9,1723822121,2024-08-16 15:28:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1etrrqh/should_i_quit_my_job_when_i_dont_want_to/,8,2024

Orginal plan was high finance but I understand thats unlikely given the new circumstances.

So, I want to give you guys some info on the school system here, because I think it might be helpful if anyone wants to know. I don‚Äôt really know how to put it, because I don‚Äôt know what these lines are called in other countries but I‚Äôll try.

1: Study specialising. This is basically normal school for another 3 years. I made the mistake of having this as one of my wishes, and I don‚Äôt want to study this line, but this is what I‚Äôm currently signed up for.

2: Sports. This is the line I‚Äôm hoping to get accepted to within some weeks, so there is still a chance for this. It does fall under the same category as Study specialising, but sports is my biggest passion, so it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm more interested in.

3: Tech and industry. This is a different kind of college, which is more practical, and would enable me to become an apprentice in my 3rd year, with the added bonus of my best friend going there. Unfortunately it‚Äôs extremely unlikely for me to get into this college, seeing as I didn‚Äôt apply for it in the first place, and there being 5 full classes with 60 more people waiting in line.

A TWN report is quite comprehensive, and includes information on a job seeker‚Äôs employment dates, salary history, paystub information, health care provider, whether someone has dental insurance, and if they‚Äôve ever filed an unemployment claim. It also now shows business income, thanks to Quickbooks. Previously, procuring this data was illegal, but Equifax found a work-around to the system.¬†

My passion has brought me some great experiences and I'm currently interning in a lab at Brown University, which has taught me a lot and made me confident that this is what i want to do; however, my parents are really strict and want me to be a doctor.

If I had to be a doctor, id want to go into neuroscience, but that would keep me in school till im almost 40, and I would hate my life learning all that general biology(I HATE biology). Plus i would incur so much more debt

One of the biggest things for my parents is the pay, and obviously neuroscientists/surgeons get paid way more than physicists.

Ive tried talking to them on multiple occasions calmly, but theyre very stubborn and there doesnt seem like much convincing will happen. So what should I do?

Is there a way I can be both(not just study both, but be a full-time worker/expert in both fields)? If I can that would ideal cuz, while i hate biology, i do rly like learning certain aspects abt neuroscience, and im certain I could skip/speed through a lot of the required courses to be a physicist given all the self-studying and experiences ive had already.",Individual-King7906,2,1.0,17,1723819988,2024-08-16 14:53:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1etqv1i/i_really_want_to_become_a_theoretical_physicist/,8,2024

Do you have advice what to write on the Curriculum Vitae pdf file I will be sending to agencies? 

I have diabetes2 recently diagnosed and although I work towards limiting its effects on my physical endurance I cannot work in very heavy body work jobs or standing 8 hours per day. I was offered a job with minimum wage but the boss warned me I will be standing almost 8 hours/day every day Mon to Fri and I had to turn it down and thank the boss she was so brutally honest with me at the application process (its a fruit factory for greece import fruits in Brandenburg Germany with salary 900 euro per month plus full health insurance). 

Now I am looking for secretarial jobs as I am fast typist, fluent in English and my native language and a bit of German and a mix of various languages at beginner level. Not sure if its worthy to spend some time to educate myself first, like taking language certifications first before I go send my cv. Last time I proved my knowledge of English as foreign language it was like 10 years ago. Possibly I need to retake the TOEFL exam just to prove my skills and language is up to date or no?

When I have means of transportation (I live without transportation or nearby bus staation in very rural and remote location) I may go to McDonalds as there is rumor they ''hire everyone''. Would that maybe be a good start and proceed into better jobs from there? Having said that, it will be great dissapointment if they dont hire me as they are famous for hiring 'everyone', I had 2 schoolfriends who worked there, one for 2 months and she quit due to the stress she said, the other stayed 2 years.

1etpx42,I'm being pushed out at work not sure what I should do,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm a Full Stack Developer in Canada with a few years under my belt, all at the same consulting company. For about a year now, I‚Äôve been feeling like my manager is trying to push me out, and I could use some advice on how to stay stable in my role for now and make sure I get my severance if they do let me go.

So, here‚Äôs the deal: For the last two performance reviews, my manager has given me really negative feedback, full of vague claims and half-truths. When I ask for specifics, he usually backtracks. For example, he hinted that my ""slow"" work was losing the company money, but when I asked for details, he admitted it wasn‚Äôt actually happening‚Äîjust that it might. He‚Äôs not involved in my day-to-day work since he leads the whole software team, so his feedback feels pretty disconnected from reality.

In a recent 1:1, he said he didn‚Äôt have issues with my performance or execution but claimed I wasn‚Äôt ""taking enough initiative"". But then, in the written performance review, he criticized my work as inconsistent and error-filled. After the first bad review, I got put on a PIP, which I passed pretty quickly thanks to my coworkers consistently giving me good feedback. But in our most recent 1:1, he brought up off-boarding me again (though no PIP this time). Honestly, I don't understand his issues with me, it seems his main issue is this ""initiative"" and ""lack of ownership of the project"" which he has yet to define.

He recently told me that there‚Äôs not much more he can teach me here at this company and that I should leave if I want to grow as a software developer. Which I'm taking as full admission that hs trying to push me out.

I actually like this company‚Äîit‚Äôs fully remote, has unlimited vacation, and the pay‚Äôs decent (though I‚Äôm not getting raises anymore because of these reviews). I got along well with my old manager and the product managers I work with, but ever since this guy became my manager (as the software dev team grew), I‚Äôve felt more and more restricted and isolated.

Besides job hunting, do you guys have any other advice? I‚Äôm thinking about talking to his manager (who used to be my manager) as a last-ditch effort to make sure someone else hears my side. I‚Äôm also documenting all the positive feedback I get, just in case they try to deny me severance if they fire me.

I'm ok with that as I'm still be reach out to.

I'm currently interviewing with a company that appears to be excited about me. The reality is that the job is a coordinator position that will pay $22-26 per hour and is onsite. I'm certain there is no room to move up due to the nature of the employer and department. In this case, it is the kind of job that I would continue applying and interviewing to leave as soon as possible. They're looking for someone with 1-2 years of experience, and I'm coming in with more than a decade.

From the first interview, I'm getting a lot of warnings that I think it's going to be a headache of a position. With being onsite, I don't know how I'm going to be steadfast in finding a new position. 

The final round is this week. They invited me onsite. It's a total of 5 hours for which I'll have 4 separate interviews. I also have to prepare a performance task to talk about during the last round. I really don't want to work on the task. At all. This is all for a coordinator position...

I am working full time at a MNC and have been with this project for 8 months or so. It has been on my mind if I should stay in this project. For context, this project is really bad. Here are some factors: 
1. Bad project governance 
2. Management has very ‚Äútraditional mindset‚Äù. 
you need to ‚Äúgain visibility‚Äù so management will know you. I don‚Äôt know if this is common for other companies? Please let me know in the comments. 

There are alot more factors, but my main concern is that staying in this project does not 
value add me in anyway. I do not feel any advancement to my skillsets at all, maybe only learning your usual soft skills at work (how to deal with people etc). But here is the catch, in order to get promoted, it will be good if i can stay in this project before jumping to my next. pay jump is about 20% increase if i get promoted. 

promotion happens 2 times a year (1 in mid year and 1 end of year). let‚Äôs say if i do not get promoted EOY, I‚Äôm thinking if staying in this project until the mid of next year is worth it?

My role is much more tactical, requires additional hours, manages more people, bigger projects, and makes a larger impact when looking at the two roles (the creative manager agrees). I‚Äôve been in this role for 1 year, and the creative manager that just left was previously in my role for 3 months before she found an opening in that creative space and made a lateral move - did not get a raise at that time because it was lateral.

I‚Äôve been working in the digital marketing space for around 7 years and have worn a few different hats during that time. I‚Äôm at a bit of a crossroads in my career and would love some feedback from this community.

# My Experience So Far:

1. **Marketing Campaign Coordination (2 years):**¬†Worked as a coordinator and managed multiple demand-generation campaigns for tech companies within a digital marketing team. Almost all campaigns were connected to the email marketing.
2. **Team Management & Operations (5 years):**¬†Managed a team of campaign coordinators, focusing more on operations. I handled team KPIs, workload distribution, and general team management.
3. **Project Management:**¬†Transitioned into a project management role, focusing on:
   * Developing and implementing KPIs for the campaign management department.
   * Managing user tech requests.
4. **Side Project with an EU Energy Startup:**
   * Built and organized their CRM database (Google Sheets, Monday.com).
   * Ran email marketing campaigns (content creation, design, performance tracking).
   * Developed PowerBI dashboards to visualize sales and customer data.
   * Built email infrastructure (MailChimp, Brevo) for scalable marketing efforts.

# Where I‚Äôm Stuck:

I‚Äôm considering transitioning into more hands-on work with Google, and Facebook ads, and maybe even exploring affiliate marketing. With my background in campaign management, operations, and tech projects, I feel like I have a lot of transferable skills, but I‚Äôm unsure if this shift makes sense or if I‚Äôm overlooking other potential paths.

Would really appreciate any advice on:

* How others in similar situations navigated their career path.
* If anyone with experience in affiliate marketing or ad management thinks this would be a logical next step for me.
* Any other areas I should be considering that might align with my experience.
* I do not want to work on a big digital companies and at the same time I do not want to work on 1 client (1 company).

1etnyqq,Should I study marketing for masters in US? Or should I study bachelors in engineering? What are my chances of getting H1B sponsored with marketing and engineering degree? ,"I am 20 yo from Kazakhstan, I am 4th year student studying journalism. I am thinking of studying masters in marketing in US. I am worried about my future career after masters. US job market is in horrible condition, mass layoffs, corporate greed. I am worried about visa sponsorship, since I will have only 1 year of OTP and less time to get H1B. I am really worried that I won‚Äôt be able to get a job with visa after graduating because of the oversaturated market for marketing. They will always prefer a local no matter how good I am. My masters degree will be wasted then. 
Masters will cost me around 150K$ if we combine tuition fees and living expenses. My parents can afford to fund me but they aren‚Äôt millionaires or mega rich. So it‚Äôs a very important financial decision. 

I have been thinking about going to a STEM field and studying engineering. I am interested in computer science but it is also an extremely oversaturated. Everyone is trying to get into tech and now it has become: ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt know what to do just learn coding‚Äù. Perhaps I should do engineering in something else than tech? Not sure. If I study something tech or engineering related I will have to study 4 years and start from scratch. It might end up costing more expensive around 250$K but the salaries after graduation are so much higher? I have read entry level marketing jobs only pay around 35K-45K$. And I will have 3 years of OTP and more time to get visa. However I will be dependent on my parents for a longer time. I will be around 25 at the time graduations. Also it will be a bachelors degree not masters. What I am worried about the most is not being able to study well or ending up miserable studying engineering. I am afraid that I will fail and be expelled. I have ADHD and autism(I am officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist) and I really struggle to focus and have high performance. Engineering degrees and jobs are very demanding and stressful so they are paid accordingly. It‚Äôs not that I am not smart, it‚Äôs just that I really struggle to be productive because of ADHD. Marketing seems like less stressful field to me, I have been a marketing intern in a local company for 2 months.

Whatever it is I don‚Äôt plan on working as journalist. I definitely need career field change. I want to apply this fall for the next academic year and leave for 2025 fall semester. I do not have option of working more years or taking more time. My parents are narcissists and I am done with their abuse. I want to study only in US because that‚Äôs where my BF is going to study masters too.

1etlb2h,University of Leicester vs Nottingham Trent university ," 

I have two offers to study computer science one from Nottingham Trent university and one from the university of Leicester 

To give you some context the university of Leicester is ranked 35th for computer science and 36th overall in the university league tables. However Nottingham Trent university is ranked 49th for computer science and 45th overall.

The university of Leicester is making me do a foundation year if I go there which would mean I am there for 5 years assuming I take a year out for industrial experience whereas Nottingham Trent university have offered me a place to join from the first year.

However I do not know anybody going to Nottingham Trent whereas I know quiet a lot of people going to the university of Leicester so I came here to ask for some advice 

Also how do you guys think I would cope going straight into the degree seeing as I have little to no coding experience apart from some basics in python as opposed to doing the foundation year ",Careless_Issue_2099,1,1.0,0,1723804226,2024-08-16 10:30:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1etlb2h/university_of_leicester_vs_nottingham_trent/,8,2024

I'm new to the corporate world and I've got great feedback from my supervisors at my internship and I'm hopeful they will keep me on after I graduate in December -- of course, I won't know until closer to that time.

Although not an ideal GPA, it would be much better than the 2.9 I had two semesters ago.

I've had some professional experience this summer, but nothing is ideal. I have spent the meantime building my skills and network. Over the course of the last three months, I've networked with almost 100 people, securing many referral offers. I have been looking at firms that offer internships and full-time roles that seem appealing, reaching out to alumni and recruiters at those places. I am also preparing to start the WallStreetPrep Financial and Valuation Management course.

I am considering taking a gap semester because I would be able to recruit with better grades, better experience, as well as better technical skills. However, I don't know if it would ultimately be a good decision. I am very much interested in many roles. I am a first-generation student of a low-income background, not saying this for sympathy points just giving a background.

As for what I'm interested in, I am looking into IB, PE, Real Estate, Asset Management, Wealth Management, Investment Analysis, Corp Fin, Equity Research, M&A general even, and roles at places like AMEX or Capital One. I would love some advice and insights! tnx",Dull-Direction6804,1,1.0,0,1723760732,2024-08-15 22:25:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1et8exp/taking_a_gap_semester_to_qualify_for_rerecruiting/,8,2024
1et8adq,Need advice for career change to business administration (U.K.)?,"I want to switch from customer service to admin related roles. I am currently out of work and interested in business administration as a career. However, a lot of the entry level admin/receptionist roles are asking for experience which I do not have. I have experience in customer service, retail, and patient care. 

I‚Äôve looked at some courses that I could potentially start off with but there are so many. I read the NVQ and diplomas are well respected by employers, but people that succeed in these should ideally be in an entry level role first. 

As I‚Äôm currently out of work, I‚Äôve been applying for customer service as well although that‚Äôs not my end goal. Also contacted recruitment agencies.

Is anyone able to suggest any good courses or a way for me to make the switch? I don‚Äôt have a lot of money to spend as I‚Äôm unemployed right now.

1et79jo,Job Offer Rescinded During Negotiations After Quitting Current Job - What To Do Next?,"Hi folks! 

As the title reads, I was negotiating a job offer, and the offer was rescinded during negotiations.

I was offered 49k annually, when the job ad stated the salary range was 49-54k. I currently make 94k in my current role, but was willing to take a pay cut as this new job is closer to family. I was a bit bummed to receive this offer, as I feel like I was lowballed. After receiving the job offer, I quit my current job to allow for enough time to move home and to provide sufficient notice to my current company, but the job offer was rescinded after I attempted to negotiate the salary. All that I did in negotiations was state my current salary and ask if there was anyway we could mitigate the difference between what was offered and what I currently make. 

In Canada, am I able to collect EI due to this? I did not sign the job offer, nor have I tried yet to get my original job back. Returning to my current position would be difficult, as my motivation for moving home to look after a sick family member. If unable to collect EI, do you have any other advice?

Thank you so much. I am feeling very lost.

- Finish Nursing and then do Med School (Start residency at age 31)

- Get back into a top tier business school and pursue investment banking (start working age 27-29 depending on which school I get into)

- Do something else or pursue something creative (movie producing, stand up comedy)

1et6478,What Route Do I Take?,"Hello, I‚Äôm a 19 year old college student about to transfer to a university in Florida in the spring and I plan on majoring in economics but I still need guidance on careers for me and what path to lay my hands on. I still want to pursue my bachelors but just not sure of my career path and I need help because I really don‚Äôt want to go into university not knowing the career I want. I plan on staying in Florida after I graduate as well. Here‚Äôs some stuff I‚Äôm looking/not looking for in a career path* so I can get advice more specific to my situation:

what do i not want in a career:

- no blue collar
- lots of hours or a job where im always on call
- no job that has me giving off an image/impression all of the time (jobs like sales and jobs that involve presenting all of the time etc.)
- something that requires more than 5 years of school (I am willing/thinking about getting my masters though)
- prefer to not be a programmer specifically

what do I want in a career:

- good pay progression upwards to high 100k (target income by 28-30: 150k-170k+)
- entry level jobs with a salary of 65-70k minimum 
- good work life balance (ability to take multiple vacations if i wanted to and or a career with jobs that aren‚Äôt needing of 60-80 hour work weeks but needs someone that can come in 3 days out of a week)
- remote opportunities 
- benefits (401k pension insurance etc)
- something with a field that i‚Äôll actually get internships in that will lead into said career
- job security hopefully 

what are my interests/Preferences/what am I willing to do/put up with:

- I like the process of analyzing and building a thorough understanding of a subject that i can give to help others learn or analyzing for the benefit of others 
- Math
- guidance (as in guiding lost people down a favorable path)
- desk/office jobs
- learn systems like excel or sql or other different systems 
- i prefer, don‚Äôt need, a job that offers some variety/building 
- similar to guidance but offering opportunities/options to people that are struggling
- Want to learn about finance and Economics
- i have a recent developing interest in wanting to help kids (worked at a summer camp recently)
- I am willing to deal with exams in career process but i just hope it‚Äôs not a constant thing.
- i take an interest in studying trends so careers that involve some sort of research could be up my alley (preferably based on the interests/stuff I said before)

I just don‚Äôt want to step onto campus not even having a framework of what I want to accomplish so please let me know of a career path I can take.

1et51xt,Previous Employer Provide Inaccurate Title/Job History to Reference and Background Check,"I'm in a bit of shock right now so sorry if my wording isn't the best.

Two weeks ago I finished eight interviews with a company that took two months to complete. They wanted to do reference checks before giving me an offer. This role paid 150k plus commission which was twice as much as I ever received. Not to mention that they were all impressed with me and this was a company that was exactly what I'm looking for; they even offered to give me a managerial title during the last two interviews.

I provided two references at my current company - both VPs who knew I was looking to leave and who I'm close with - and two references from my previous employer. With my previous employer, I had a good relationship with management for a few months after I left. We would text, talk on the phone, etc. Then things took a bad turn. There was a mass exodus and they blamed my departure as I was one of the first hires in the department I worked. When things were still good and I asked for references they told me to tell me whatever they wanted me to say to my future employer. Thankfully I still have screenshots of the emails and texts.

Four days after I provided the company I was interviewing at my references they sent a standard rejection email. I knew it had to be because of my references at my previous employer. (When I told my current employer about this they were beyond surprised and thankfully we record all calls and they let me listen to the calls they had as my references and it was a glowing reference.) So I decided to run a background check on myself through Mintz. I just got the report back and the title they provided was not correct. I had started off in support and then promoted to an Account Executive. They listed me as a Sales Development Rep the entire time. This company didn't even have a single Sales Development Rep until about eight months before I left the company.

I'm unsure of how to approach this situation. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.

Just one point of clarification, the person at the job I was interviewing with specifically said they would prefer at least one reference from each company I worked for which is why I gave them the managers I worked for at my previous company.",x058394446,2,0.75,2,1723752397,2024-08-15 20:06:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1et51xt/previous_employer_provide_inaccurate_titlejob/,8,2024

1et3mys,"Looking for a second opinion.
","

Hi everyone.

I've been working in a toxic (sometimes abusive) work environment for three years now and I'm burned out! So, I started out considering other options.

Long story short, Company A (Big Finance company in Europe) contacted me via LinkedIn, went thru the interview process and signed a pre-contract three weeks ago (The process began in April and ended in July), we're currently working on getting the corresponding Visa so I can fly over to Spain and recolate to Madrid but the process has been quite slow. Two months later (in June), I began another process with a well-known tech company (Company B) since I never thought I'd actually get the first job. So, it appears like Company B wants to hire me as well, and I don't know what to do because I was referred by a friend of mine.

To give you more context, I'm in Colombia (Bogota), so Company A offered me 50K (14 payments), I have to relocate to Madrid (Company A will not assist with my relocation) and Company B will likely offer me around 2350 usd a month (We negotitated between 2100-2500 USD).

Both are great opportunities, not gonna lie, but I think that me going to Spain is my best bet (especially in the long term), so I want to be honest but backing out could burn bridges.

What would do you? How do I go about this?

1et2upd,22 year old unsure about pursuing finance career ,"I'm one year into my job working in corporate finance at a mid to large sized company in a rotational program. Had a very underwhelming first year. 

Went into this program since I had excelled at Finance during my undergrad. However, after learning about the company and seeing what it takes to continue a career as a finance professional, I'm starting to rethink the path I'm going down. I look at the leaders at my company and they are not people I want to be when I'm older (not saying they're bad people or anything).

I have been told that I have great interpersonal skills. I do enjoy socializing and connecting with other people. I am a capable worker. I'm passionate about commerce, and want to be able to develop a full understanding of a company and have an impact. I find trying to learn about the business I'm working for is difficult since you get so compartmentalized in your department. And senior leaders don't want to waste time teaching you.

My fear is staying at this business, pushing spreadsheets, never having ample opportunity to use my interpersonal skills and working 15 years to be a manager/director of a corporation I don't care for.

1et11o9,Struggling to Land an Internship ‚Äì Seeking Advice on Improving My Chances and Managing Anxiety,"**Hi everyone,**

I'm a final-year Computer Science student, currently navigating the internship application process. Despite having a solid understanding of various technologies, I'm finding it difficult to get my resume noticed by recruiters. This has been weighing on me heavily, leading to increasing feelings of anxiety and overwhelm.

I‚Äôve gained experience with a range of technologies, including Python, Java, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Linux, cloud technologies, and the MERN stack (though I'm still a beginner with MERN). Although I‚Äôm confident in my technical abilities, the lack of positive feedback from my applications has been disheartening. Seeing many of my peers land internships, it's hard not to compare myself, which has been affecting my ability to stay focused and productive.

I‚Äôm reaching out to this community for guidance on several fronts:

- Resume and Application Advice: How can I make my resume more attractive to recruiters? Are there common mistakes that I should avoid?

- Where to Apply: Are there specific platforms, companies, or roles that might be a good fit for someone with my skill set?

- Dealing with Anxiety and Stress: How do you manage the stress and anxiety that comes with this process? If you‚Äôve been in a similar situation, I‚Äôd love to hear how you handled it.

I know that everyone‚Äôs journey is different, and I‚Äôm trying to maintain a positive outlook. However, I‚Äôm also eager to learn and improve, so any insights or advice from those who‚Äôve been through this would be greatly appreciated.

1et0wtk,Chase the money or stick with growth and opportunity?,"I (35m) work as a project manager at a local construction company and make $85k (company A). I‚Äôve jumped around the past 5 years from one job to another. Starting in 2019, I‚Äôve worked for 4 different companies; leaving each role due to a multitude of reasons. I left on my own accord for 3 of those changes, and was laid off from one. Now I am faced with a crossroads where I have the opportunity to go back to the job (company B) that I was laid off from at the beginning of 2023 due to market issues and forecasted new home builds. Company B is a billion dollar company and laid off 25% of the workforce at that time and are now in a growth period in my city. Company A (current employer) is a smaller company and has a lot of growth upside, but I‚Äôve worked there for 8 months and don‚Äôt see myself making $110k for at least another few years.

My current salary is $85k and I am in a role with a company that primarily deals with renovation projects (not necessarily what I want to do). Company B only works with new builds (more up my alley) and has tried to get me to come back since late last year and I‚Äôve told them I wouldn‚Äôt come back unless I can make $110k off the rip.

The downside to the much smaller company A is I wear a ton of different hats and the workload is put on very heavy. Company A doesn‚Äôt provide any type of retirement match until 2 years of employment. Company B has retirement matches and is more likely to be at the mercy of the market, while company A didn‚Äôt let anyone go during the economic downturn and is likely more secure.

1et0a47,Should I Take a Low-Paying Tax Associate Internship or Wait for Better Opportunities?,"I‚Äôve been job hunting since April and today I got an interview call for a Tax Associate internship at a firm in Al Ain. The internship is for 4-6 months, with a salary of AED 1500 per month, and they‚Äôve mentioned that the duration could be extended.

The salary for this internship seems quite low, and I‚Äôm not sure if I should take it just for the experience or wait for potentially better opportunities. I‚Äôve heard that September to March is typically when more job openings become available here in the UAE.

A bit about me: I‚Äôm an ACCA Affiliate with a B.Com degree, currently pursuing M.Com, and I‚Äôm also taking a course in UAE VAT and Corporate Tax. I‚Äôm planning to pursue a career in tax, but I have no prior experience other than a two-month internship at EY GDS as an Audit Consultant. 

For context, I‚Äôm a resident here in UAE, living with my parents in Abu Dhabi, so I don‚Äôt have significant financial pressures, but I‚Äôm eager to start my career.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice on whether to take this internship or hold out for something better.

1esztbd,"Applying to new jobs in higher education, are these red flags?","Hello! I've worked in higher education for over 7 years now (5 full-time), and have only ever stayed with one University for most of my work history, so I feel like I don't have an accurate gauge for what's normal. Almost all of my jobs have been through this single university.

  
The hiring process for my current job was long, tiring, and involved. I had to take a half-day civil service test, did a phone interview, and 2 in-person interviews, then waited 3 weeks for a response, and another 3-ish weeks for the process to be finalized and to actually start.

  
I recently decided I cannot stand my current workplace anymore, and have been applying to other colleges/universities and companies in the same expertise field as the college I work in currently. Some of the problems in my workplace are problems with higher education in general post-pandemic, but mostly that it's a toxic and inefficient environment. I'm scared of leaving this job and going to something worse.

  
Out of 15 applications so far, I've gotten 4 interviews, two with different universities that I'm most interested in.

University A contacted me last friday, I didn't immediately respond, they followed up on Monday, and I scheduled a virtual interview for the next day, Tuesday. I feel like I fit their needs pretty well, and they told me after the interview that they were expecting to follow up with interviewees beginning of next week (8/19). They contacted me today, sooner than expected, and set up a final interview with the dean for tomorrow (8/16).

  
University B had originally rejected an application I had put in a few weeks ago, and I hadn't heard anything further besides the clearly automated rejection. Today, I got a call from their Provost office saying they had an additional, similar position to the one I applied to pop up, and asked if I was interested in the slightly different terms. I said yes, and scheduled an interview for next week. I was surprised they had kept me in mind though, since I'd gotten the automated rejection earlier. 

  
I haven't applied to or interviewed for many jobs in my life, I've been fortunate in that way, but seeing how easily these interviews seem to be coming is a bit of a red flag when I consider how long redditors and my friends have been trying to get jobs. Is it just the nature of higher education right now, are they that interested in me, or is it an actual red flag?",CausticMoose,1,1.0,2,1723739864,2024-08-15 16:37:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1esztbd/applying_to_new_jobs_in_higher_education_are/,8,2024

1esx3ym,Finish Grad school or Drop out?,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm writing to ask for help picking a direction for my career. I‚Äôm 31 and have been working in the heavy civil construction industry since 2016 (Project engineer> project manager /estimator). My work life balance is not great 10-11 hour days 5 days a week. Two years ago, I started a part time online master‚Äôs in data science because a friend was absolutely killing it as a data scientist with only 3 years of experience working from home 8 hr/day and I was jealous as hell. I think my primary goal was to reduce my hours while still making good money. I had considered getting my engineering license and switching to a design role, but civil engineering seemed like a large pay cut compared to construction. ¬†About 8 months into the MSDS program I stopped because I had an ACL surgery and a new job (still in heavy civil construction). After a few months of recovery from surgery the tech job market seemed to have crashed. So, I figured I should finally get my engineering license (My undergrad was in environmental engineering), there should be some roles where data science and engineering intersect, and it will definitely help a career in construction. I passed the civil PE exam 2 months ago and I am now licensed in another Colorado, I expect to be licensed in California, where I currently live, in about 4-6 months.

After passing the PE I applied to a Marketing Manager role with a local outdoor recreation brand. My background is not in marketing, but they mentioned they were struggling to manage their Facebook data because it had grown so large. I was intimately familiar with their product because of a past life as a professional athlete using the product they sold. After a couple of interviews, they offered me a part time contractor role as a marketing data analyst. Basically, I set up a database, using Google Big Query and have been running SQL code to break the data into more manageable sections, and then have been looking at basic trends for different demographics to determine which ads are most effective, and to determine if there is an optimal monthly ad spend value.

I was likely going to give up on the master‚Äôs degree before this opportunity, but now that I am here, I feel like I need to follow through with the master‚Äôs degree. I feel spread pretty thin. I‚Äôm still working 50-55hr/week at my day job, trying to squeeze in grad school, and do another 10hr/week at this company. The last thing I want to do is perform poorly at all my tasks, but that is what is happening as I am burning out. Moreover, I probably need to schedule another surgery to remove scar tissue in my knee.

My wife and I want to start a family, but the cost of living is so high in southern California it seems impossible. My wife wants to take 1-2 years off work when we have kids. I don‚Äôt know how we can afford that. We both make good money; my wife is a director at a small ABA therapy company. ¬†

Someone tell me if I am wasting my time with this master‚Äôs degree or assure me it is worthwhile in a AI centric future. If I really work hard at it, I can likely graduate in 2 years (I average about 1 credit/month and have 9/30 credits completed so far). Tell me if I should stay in construction, try to move into civil engineering, or pursue tech. Maybe I should just say fuck it and start my own general contracting company.",shastaslacker,1,1.0,1,1723733300,2024-08-15 14:48:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1esx3ym/finish_grad_school_or_drop_out/,8,2024

I graduated at the top of my class in law school, so I'm a quick learner. I am an excellent writer, researcher, editor, proofreader, and transcriptionist. I can type \~85 WPM with 99% accuracy.

I also confirmed articles were legally and factually correct. I also edited grammar, style, and punctuation.

¬†

I have some experience teaching and general customer service experience (cashier, restaurants, manual labor). I will not be a paralegal, but I could be a virtual assistant to attorney or other individual.

I am wondering what I should pursue, but I am definitely open to ideas.

1esvx3e,Career and Life Restart (31),"Hi All, 

I'm feeling at a stand still in my career and as a result my life. I'm 31 years old and have my degree in finance. My experience has been working in banks and investment companies. I lost my job at a hedge fund early this year and it was been an absolute struggle to find a new job. I'm getting many interviews and getting to the final rounds, but have yet to receive an offer. I've done mock interviews, worked with various recruiters, and pay close attention to how I am presenting myself. It's been very demoralizing getting to 3rd rounds just for it not to work out, but add on top of that the debt is piling up and rent is due. I found a temp job in HR, but it is not sustainable and pays a little bit over minimum wage.  I've been trying to find a way to restart my career because it seems it has stalled. I'm not hellbent on staying in finance but it's my area of expertise. I've applied to roles at non-financial institutions where I think my skills are transferrable but have not had much luck (besides the HR role). I feel like I made the wrong the career choice and am stuck in an industry where I cant find a new job, but don't have the skills to change industries. I feel like I need to re-invent myself in order to change my circumstances. I've gone through major changes before, but at 31 it feels like I will never be able to recover from this.

1esvv1v,Job Interviews: Secrets I Learned From Years of Coding (That Work for Any Job!),"Okay, let's be real: job interviews are scary.  But they're also a game, like any game, you can learn how to play it better.  I've spent years in the tech world, writing code and leading teams. And while my experience is in programming, the things I've learned can help anyone get their dream job.

**1. Shine Online:** Your online presence is like your first impression.  Clean up your social media and make sure your LinkedIn profile looks great. Think of it as your online resume.

**2. Tell Your Story:** Don't just list your jobs on your resume.  Tell a story about what you did and how you made a difference.  Instead of ""Managed a team,"" try ""Led a team to success, exceeding goals by 15%.""

**3. Be the Person They Want to Work With:**  Practice telling stories about your work experiences.  Make them interesting and show how you solved problems or helped your team.  People remember stories more than facts.

**4. Practice Talking About Your Work:**  Even if your job isn't technical, practice explaining what you do and how you do it.  This helps you think clearly and shows you're confident.

**5. Show You're Valuable:** Research the company and the interviewer.  Ask smart questions.  Make them think you have other options, even if you don't.  It shows you're in demand.

**6.  Meet People in Your Field:** Go to events and connect with people online.  Networking is key.  You never know who might help you find your next opportunity.

**7.  Don't Be Afraid to Apply Everywhere:**  The more jobs you apply for, the better your chances.  Even if you don't think you're perfect for a role, give it a shot.

Remember, getting a job is tough, but it's not impossible.  Use these tips, be yourself, and don't give up.

1esusf9,Am I crazy for wanting to leave my job after 5 months?,"Hi everybody. I am looking for a bit of career advice, or maybe just some affirmation that I‚Äôm not as crazy as I feel.

Background: my wife and I, both 26 years old, recently moved two hours from home so I could take a job. I‚Äôve always worked in Economic Development/non/profit, and a job opened up for a well-known organization in our state. I interviewed and was offered the job. As with any job, I tried to negotiate my pay at the time of my hire and they acted like I was crazy for asking, stating ‚ÄúI thought we told you that wasn‚Äôt in the budget.‚Äù I know, red flag number one.

Anyways, it was still a good opportunity so we packed up our life, along with our new baby, and moved. I started on April 1, 2024.

Fast forward to today, almost 5 months into the job. All of the senior team and leadership that I work with are hyper-workaholics. I‚Äôll randomly check teams at 11pm and they will all be active. This is every night.

One of them in particular waits until about 7pm daily to send me messages on Teams and Outlook, and it causes my anxiety to spiral because of her demeanor. She is essentially a micromanager, which I haven‚Äôt had to deal with since I was maybe 16 years old.

In short, I‚Äôm looking for advice. Am I crazy for thinking it‚Äôs completely inappropriate to message me every night with ‚Äúthis is wrong, that is wrong‚Äù, etc.? The workplace feels very toxic and senior team definitely picks favorites. I am not one. Turnover at this job is probably 75% over 2 years.

I was brought on to train the team on our CRM, which nobody but me knows how to use. Also, since I see the checks that come through, I can‚Äôt help but laugh at the ‚Äúnot in the budget‚Äù comment from when I was trying to negotiate my pay. I am nearing 6 months of work and no talk of a performance review has occurred.

I have a bachelors degree in PR and marketing and am studying for my CAPM certification right now because I feel that the writing is on the wall here. Has anybody experienced a similar situation?

1estbn9,Fresh graduate - Full time to Temporary Advice,"Hi everyone, 

I worked in Banking as a Financial Advisor for 2 years now.(I am in Canada). I've been in banking after graduating college. The branch I worked in was highly toxic, so I started applying to different positions internally. All within scope of my qualifications.

Recently, I accepted a temporary work offer from a department but without any guaranteed position. It is a six months. The wording was that because of the merger, things are uncertain.  My company is bigger than the merging company. 

The department I applied in basically said they will advocate to keep me in the position, as they are growing. And they wouldn't want to go all the trouble in re-hiring someone and training them. 

I was provided confidential knowledge that I now have a note on my file, since I've been applying to different positions. 

Now a friend is basically talking to me as if I've screwed myseld up. I took the risk as my branch has been eating away my sanity. I brought up the issues with my manager, but nothing changed.

1esqzom,"[IT] Finding My Niche: Seeking Part-Time, Remote IT Work with a Visual Focus
","Hi,

I'm looking for advice on which technologies in IT I should master to get a job that meets the following criteria:

* **Part-time engagement**¬†with approximately 20 hours of work per week.
* **Fully remote work.**
* A¬†**gross income of a few hundred euros per month**¬†(I live in Eastern Europe).
* **One-man-team work**, meaning I can mostly work alone and am not dependent on others‚Äîin other words, being ""the guy in the corner with headphones on who barely talks.""
* **low hanging fruit**

By education, I'm an electrical engineer with a few years of professional experience in front-end mobile and web development. I've also tried back-end development, but it just doesn't work for me. It's too complex and abstract. You have to cover a dozen non-functional requirements (e.g., security, performance, scalability) before even developing features that the client actually cares about. You really have to know what you're doing, especially when developing business applications that require industry-grade code‚Äînot just throwing something together that barely works. And not to forget, back-end development is boring to me.

So, I'm more of a visual guy and not a great programmer. I'm not very good at problem-solving‚Äîmost of the problems I solve by brute-force, which means trying and playing with something until it works. Or it doesn't. I'm okay with simple programming and scripting, but when it comes to architectures, design patterns, and algorithms, I just freeze.",Special-Connection78,1,1.0,0,1723714695,2024-08-15 09:38:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1esqzom/it_finding_my_niche_seeking_parttime_remote_it/,8,2024

Company A - executive director 

- national healthcare company opening sites in my state. Large cash infusion from private equity 

- very thorough and long top grading interview process. 

- Offer - 130k 25% yearly bonus with 20% guaranteed. Additional 5% monthly commission type bonus based on census which is continuous as long as census goals are met. 

- 20 direct reports, including dept directors 

- On site 5 days a week with a touch of flexibility, -30-40 min commute (don‚Äôt mind it)

- unlimited pto / 3% 401k match

Company B - director of ops 

- report to CEO/owner

- small 100 employee company,  brand new beautiful 6000 sqft office

- wants to ‚Äúrestructure whole company for growth‚Äù

- much less prestigious, ABA community involvement non profit

- every dept head reports in to me 

- company is pivoting to a growth strategy and CEO is at a wall so high expectations 

- Offer - 160k 20k yearly bonus 

- 100 reports (whole company) with 5 dept heads 

- On site but office is 15 min walk or 3 min drive

- ‚Äúno set pto plan‚Äù

Benefits are not a concern as the wife has health benefits covered for the fam

1eslpsh,Construction Project Engineer or Academia ,"Basically, I turned down a lot of brand name UC schools for earth science to go study construction management at Cal Poly. The construction program is definitely the best in the nation and has $90k starting salaries, 100+ recruiting companies, and lots of internships. A lot of California construction CEO‚Äôs are alumni‚Äôs, so a lot of money is put into the program. It definitely pays a lot more than any kind of geology from talking to alumni‚Äôs of both types of programs.

However, I‚Äôve had a lot of self reflection I realize it would fulfill my inner child to be a scientist.

1esl8ru,Wanting to drop out of university before it even starts ,"I want to drop out of university. I haven‚Äôt even started yet. 



Dear reddit, advice wanted. 

I want to drop out of my 4 year college. I haven‚Äôt even started. I‚Äôm going to be a freshman. 
I‚Äôve paid my tuition, i‚Äôm registered for classes, and I have a pretty cool roommate. What could the issue be?

Well, i realized a few things. 

I won‚Äôt be happy with a four year degree. Look, i‚Äôm currently going into neuroscience. It‚Äôs truly my passion and something I enjoy but to be honest I don‚Äôt like any of the career outcomes. The careers i‚Äôm more interested in require graduate degrees and I don‚Äôt have the patience nor motivation to complete a masters (honestly PhD preferred). 
While i was finishing high school I actually told myself i‚Äôll go get my bachelor then a 2 year associates because i realized half way through my senior year i wanted to be an x/ray technician. By then i had already finished all my college applications and gotten accepted into every school i applied for. during high school i did dual enrollment which allowed me to take classes at a community college and i absolutely LOVED IT. i‚Äôve taken almost all the required courses for the xray program. I only have 3 more classes to take to be able to apply for the program. 

Second, i‚Äôm scared of leaving home. It‚Äôs always been me and one of my parents (raised by said single parent) and grandparents. My grandparents have gotten to the age where they can‚Äôt live independently so my parent takes care of them. they are what we can call the ‚Äúsandwich generation‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want to leave my parent alone to care for them. I want to be there to help like i was during high school. I‚Äôll also miss my cats HEAVILY. i‚Äôve had one of my cats since kindergarten and the other day i realized how old she was getting. I can‚Äôt leave her. I feel like i‚Äôm abandoning her. tearing up writing this. 


I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have a very good college credit GPA and i don‚Äôt want to go away, become depressed because all the classes i‚Äôm taking won‚Äôt count towards the x-ray program. what if i perform terribly in the classes then lose my good GPA. I‚Äôm so lost. I feel like i‚Äôm disappointing everyone around me if i drop out. I feel like i‚Äôll be judged for going to community college. 


As stated, i already paid for the fall semester. Should i attempt one semester and see how it works out? It‚Äôs too late for me to also register for the fall 2024 semester at my community college.

I‚Äôve been with my current company for a year now and started with the salary they offered without negotiating since it‚Äôs a pretty small company (18 employees). After two months they offered me a 6% raise because I was doing pretty well and then another 4% last month during performance review so a total of 10% in my first year. During the review they offered me a new position from senior engineer to project manager because my manager is leaving and a 10% raise. I asked the HR if there‚Äôs a chance to get 15%..she said that the company brackets won‚Äôt allow it and that I will new to management but she will speak to the big boss and get back to me. Now after that conversation, I‚Äôm having regrets for telling her that and I should‚Äôve just accepted what they offered because I don‚Äôt want to come off as ungrateful.. 

Any thoughts? Was that a bad move? Will it backfire because HR will speak directly to the president about it?

I requested a meeting and we scheduled it for today. They offered me the exact amount that the coworker makes and then asked if I had another number in mind. 

I said that while this is a good start, it didn't feel like a rise and more of a 'leveling' of the department. I let them then know that I know that J made that amount. They clearly started messaging each other (this was done over Zoom) and they looked a bit flustered. 

I told them, Hey, that how it works nowadays. People should and will discuss salaries. I then asked for the amount I had in mind. For reference, I am a female and J is male. 

They first said how they didn't even know that J made that amount, which is obviously all bullshit as my boss manages payroll and is actively hiring. There was more bullshit said but they eventually agreed on my number. 

The meeting ended with one of the bosses saying that 'While they don't mind us discussing pay with other, it can lead to toxicity and we should avoid going down that path'. 

Anyway, I don't think they were expecting me to have a spine but it worked for once!",redditwontlogin,1630,0.9800000190734863,96,1723682816,2024-08-15 00:46:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eshtit/update_new_coworker_earns_more_than_i_do_my/,8,2024
1eshjop,Should i switch positions to get hired faster ,"
Job A  ~ i work for a staffing company within a huge corporation with excellent benefits that you only receive once hired on, my current position it is super easy, i don‚Äôt really do much of anything at all most days, i can break early, break late. but in the current position, it can take from 4-8 years to get hired on to the company, i work around a lot of older guys 35-50 and they didn‚Äôt mind waiting to get hired on and say i should wait it out

Job B Assembly ~ from what i hear this job is super labor intensive, but you get hired within 1-2 years, you can‚Äôt break early or late, everyone I‚Äôve talked to in this position, hates the job and wants out, it can be very difficult to get out of this position once you‚Äôre in it, you can move up in the company faster starting at this position

I want to switch so that I can get hired faster but all of my fellow coworkers say i won‚Äôt make it a month,

1esev4o,Sabotaged By My Boss. What do I do?,"I‚Äôm from Toronto Ontario and have been with the company for 9years, working in retail sales. I'm a team lead and need some advice from more experienced managers. Detailed story:

I was recently given my first (&final) warning by my manager (Let‚Äôs call him Bob)for breaking company policy which I was given permission to do from my manager‚Äôs boss (let‚Äôs call him Billy)

The company policy states that we cannot ring in our own sales at retail locations. We need a managers consent. I wanted to buy an item from our store but Bob was on vacation. Due to Bob being on vacation, I had to go to Billy to get permission to ring out the sale. Billy granted me permission and said it wasn't an issue and to go ahead with it. 

Keep in mind all of our bonuses are based on sales and meeting quotas. This sale went to me with Billy‚Äôs approval. 

When Bob gets back from vacation, all is fine. He knows that Billy had given me approval for the sale of my own purchase. It wasn‚Äôt until a few days later when Bob found out the amount of the sale that things changed. Suddenly he was on the attack accusing me of breaking company policy and told me I would be written up. I was immediately on the defensive due to confusion and didn't know what to say or do. I told him that Billy had given me permission but Bob denied it. He then proceeds to go to the back and call Billy. He comes back out after 15minutes and has Billy on the phone. I asked Billy why I was being written up when he had given me permission to ring up my own sale. Billy was silent and didn't come to my defense. I was shocked someone would do this. (note: I was given permission via phone call so I had nothing in writing)

That's when I went into work the following day and got called into Bob‚Äôs office. I was given my first ever warning and it was noted that it was also my final warning.  

I was told I have until Monday to sign the papers. And that I was losing my monthly bonus because of this. 

Background on the workplace: company culture at this retail location has always been lax. Company policy states no one can ring out their own items but Bob has given everyone his code to ring out their items. Everyone does this and this is the norm. I have NEVER participated in this and have only ever done so with Bob‚Äôs (or Billy‚Äôs) approval. 

Bob constantly breaks the rules so I assumed it was the norm. Bob pockets company money from cash sales and makes personal purchases with the money. (food etc)

Bob is also known to participate in time theft for his friends that work under him. They often leave work hours early but are still on the clock as per Bob. 

Bob is given an allowance for staff entertainment as well as supplies for the retail location. Bob has been using the pocketed cash to pay for these things as well so the books look like his expenses are low. Which in turn ends up giving Bob a larger bonus. 

I have worked for the company for 9 years with no issues. This is the first time anything has ever come up and it's due to what I think is Bob's greed. He was upset that he did not collect a bonus on the sale that I rang out. 

I have feeling Billy knows Bob does these things but says nothing. For example, during a staff dinner during a good month, Billy saw that Bob used the cash from cash sales to buy drinks for them and said ‚ÄúI see nothing, I hear nothing‚Äù. 



What do I do? Do I sign the papers? Do I write an email and explain everything to Bob, Billy & maybe even cc Billy‚Äôs boss?

This isn't right. But I don't know what to do.

1ese04y,Dumb question: what is this job called,"I have kind of lucked into a job that I really love. Not so much because of the work or the people, but because of the excellence life balance and the lack of imposter syndrome I feel, which nearly broke me in my last job. I work for an event management company and help them find and implement software to help run their events. This includes everything from managing the development of their home grown registration system, to finding solutions to book onsite meeting rooms, and everything in between. The company is not in the tech sector, but I came from the tech sector, so I guess I'm more savvy on what to use and everyone seems happy. I have pretty much full autonomy, am an IC but still work with multiple departments, and am never overwhelmed with work. While I'm happy, the company cut some of our events this year so I'm worried the writing is on the wall and want to start looking, if for nothing else than to have some interview practice for when and if they start to do layoffs. 

The problem is I don't know what this job is called. Yes I know that's dumb. What would the title be for someone that finds external software solutions for operational problems, and then implements those solutions? What kind of experience is required for that role? Operations Manager? I've looked at those jobs most involve managing other people, which I do not want to do.

1esct88,Torn on whether to accept an offer,"Hi everyone,

I am super torn on a job offer I've received and would love some outside input.

I am a technical recruiter with 7 years of experience currently working for a mid size tech consulting firm. The technology industry has seen a downturn over the past couple of years, and my current firm has slowed down a lot and gone through a couple of rounds of layoffs. This is what led me to start looking for a new job, however I do feel I have reason to believe my job will be safe for at least the near term. They just reduced our recruiting function in the spring, and things just picked up so we are all feeling busier. I've gotten nothing but positive reviews during my time there and have been told I'm in line for promotion when things pick back up.

I've received an offer to join a civil engineering firm as their first dedicated recruiter. They are a smaller company (400 people to my current firms 10,000) and the role would be onsite 5 days per week vs my current 100% remote job.

The offer is 6k less than I make now, with a salary review in 6 months (their reasoning being that I don't have industry experience). 

I'm struggling to get excited about taking a step back in both pay and flexibility. However, if I decide not to take it and my current company does more layoffs, I'll be kicking myself. This new offer represents the chance to build a process and team, but presents some challenges of working for a smaller company (helping other departments as needed, things like planning the company holiday party, HR/admin work). 

If I take this offer and don't like it, I'm worried it'll be harder for me to interview and land a new job while working in office. My current company has offered good severance and I'm financially stable.

I (23f) recently graduated with a BA in Public Health. I‚Äôve been having trouble landing even minimum wage jobs, and the work opportunities I had in college aren‚Äôt easily available to me since changing locations and moving in with my parents. My parents have been supporting me since graduating a few months ago, but my father recently lost his job so now there‚Äôs 7 people (not including family overseas) relying on one income source in a HCOL area. 

I am in the process of preparing to apply to dental schools in the next two years, and I truly believe this to be my calling. I understand that going the dental route will be high risk (from the time and money commitment) and high reward (well paying, stable career). Dental school will be a huge investment, and with my current financial situation, I can barely afford one semester of the few prerequisite courses I have yet to complete. In an ideal world I would pursue a dental career, but it currently doesn‚Äôt seem practical to dedicate so much time to taking classes, shadowing, volunteering, and studying for the DAT when I need to prioritize having an income source. Also, I wouldn‚Äôt start dental school until 2026 or (most likely) 2027. 

My work experience includes tutoring, advising students on college applications, working in laboratories, assisting clinicians with tasks involving paperwork and phone calls, caring for the elderly, babysitting an infant, working reception at events, doing nails, cutting/coloring/styling hair, caring for dogs, meal prepping, among other side hustles that I can‚Äôt recall at the moment. Most of these jobs were informal, and aside from academic research, I‚Äôve never been officially hired or trained at a company. I‚Äôm a quick learner, highly adaptable, and great with people. I‚Äôm good with manual tasks that require dexterity. I‚Äôm a semi native Spanish speaker, so I understand the language perfectly but sometimes struggle with grammar when speaking, so I‚Äôve been making an effort to improve. I‚Äôm not sure how relevant this is, but I‚Äôm generally considered to be attractive and personable, and I take care of my appearance (I was in a sorority, you get the picture). 

For some context, I graduated from a top public university with good grades when considering grade deflation. The curriculum for my degree included subjects like general chemistry, physics, cell/molecular biology, evolution + ecology, anatomy & physiology, nutrition, microbiology, infectious diseases, epidemiology community and environmental health, calculus, statistics, data science (R and python), and humanities courses like sociology, anthropology, psychology, and history. I have a wide range of interests and am open to almost anything. 

Are there any certifications I can pursue while working part time or full time that will help me find work? I‚Äôm open to doing an extensions program or something similar. I‚Äôd prefer a field that‚Äôs in high demand and pays around/above $50k a year. I don‚Äôt want to be in a situation where I dedicated time and money on a certification only to wind up making minimum wage, or unable to find work due to low demand. Ideally, I would also have potential for job growth and can start the path to a career, but that‚Äôs not necessary. 

My resume is scattered and I fear that it doesn‚Äôt represent my capabilities. I understand that I have to tailor it to meet job specifications, but I don‚Äôt have meaningful experience to show. I only had one internship doing research in a prestigious lab, and it barely related to my academic or career interests. I don‚Äôt know how to convince employers that I can do the job. Is there any information I should know that could help me find entry level or minimum wage work? Are there any resources that could be useful to me?

In an ideal world I would pursue a dental career, but it currently doesn‚Äôt seem practical to dedicate so much time to taking classes, shadowing, volunteering, and studying for the DAT when I need to prioritize having an income source. Also, I wouldn‚Äôt start dental school until 2026 or (most likely) 2027. 

My work experience includes tutoring, advising students on college applications, working in laboratories, assisting clinicians with tasks involving paperwork and phone calls, caring for the elderly, babysitting an infant, working reception at events, doing nails, cutting/coloring/styling hair, caring for dogs, meal prepping, among other side hustles that I can‚Äôt recall at the moment. Most of these jobs were informal, and aside from academic research, I‚Äôve never been officially hired or trained at a company. I‚Äôm a quick learner, highly adaptable, and great with people. I‚Äôm good with manual tasks that require dexterity. I‚Äôm a semi native Spanish speaker, so I understand the language perfectly but sometimes struggle with grammar when speaking, so I‚Äôve been making an effort to improve. I‚Äôm not sure how relevant this is, but I‚Äôm generally considered to be attractive and personable, and I take care of my appearance (I was in a sorority, you get the picture). 

For some context, I graduated from a top public university with good grades when considering grade deflation. The curriculum for my degree included subjects like general chemistry, physics, cell/molecular biology, evolution + ecology, anatomy & physiology, nutrition, microbiology, infectious diseases, epidemiology community and environmental health, calculus, statistics, data science (R and python), and humanities courses like sociology, anthropology, psychology, and history. I have a wide range of interests and am open to almost anything. 

Are there any certifications I can pursue while working part time or full time that will help me find work? I‚Äôm open to doing an extensions program or something similar. I‚Äôd prefer a field that‚Äôs in high demand and pays around/above $50k a year. I don‚Äôt want to be in a situation where I dedicated time and money on a certification only to wind up making minimum wage, or unable to find work due to low demand. Ideally, I would also have potential for job growth and can start the path to a career, but that‚Äôs not necessary. 

My resume is scattered and I fear that it doesn‚Äôt represent my capabilities. I understand that I have to tailor it to meet job specifications, but I don‚Äôt have meaningful experience to show. I only had one internship doing research in a prestigious lab, and it barely related to my academic or career interests. I don‚Äôt know how to convince employers that I can do the job. Is there any information I should know that could help me find entry level or minimum wage work? Are there any resources that could be useful to me? My priority is to start having a steady income, and increase my prospects by getting certifications.

1esbabg,My probation period is coming to an end but my boss is delaying telling me if I passed or not,"My probation period ends on 31.08. Weirdly I work in a company and team that it's impossible to know where you stand. There isn't any feedback given (good or bad), so honestly I have no idea if I will pass or not. 

My boss kept telling me we will have the ""end of probation"" talk soon (next week, the latest before next Thursday, for sure after the weekend, etc). I would think this isn't positive, but at the same time, he mentioned new tasks I need to carry on, possibly move to another team (where I have been supporting and fit my skills better), etc. 

I finally asked him directly, can we schedule a call for tomorrow. He said he wanted to not rush (he is very busy atm) and have a proper talk but ""we will have the talk next week"". All is good and dandy but honestly, I NEED TO KNOW. I have some plans coming up that I need clarity on. Also would like to know if in 1.5 weeks I won't have a job anymore, or if I will have one. 

There is a big team event (company team event) coming up in Sept, that I need to book tickets for  and have those days locked in from my personal life and I really wanna know if I'm going or not. 

I don't know how to get some clarity and I think it's kinda weird that by now there isn't a proper answer.

I've worked on various different sites foing various different roles from generic static guard house, to security receptionist, to security concierge, to Doorman, to Event Security Operative, Event Security Supervisor, Event Security Manager and more. 

Over the 13 years my hours have fluctuated depending on the contract, site and requirements of the site but its always been a number somewhere between ¬£23,000 - ¬£27,500. With the higher salary being towards the beginning of my career where I was doing roughly the same hours as I do now.

With the exception of when I've done overtime I've never earned about ¬£32,150 in a single year even though my knowledge base has increased and have also gained multiple additional qualifications of varying levels including but not limited to: 

First Aid in the Workspace
Emergency First Aid At Work
Adult Mental Health Awareness
ADHD Awareness
Spectator Safety Level 1 - 3
CCTV Operation in the Public Space
Handcuff Training

I also have the following security licences:

Door Supervision (Frontline)
CCTV (Frontline) 
Keyholding (Frontline & Backline)

I plan to add Dog Handling & Close Protection to my repetoir.

I ask this question because I feel like I'm worth more than what I'm currently on with the extensive level of knowledge and training but not sure how to approach the subject with management or how to calculate my worth to the company in general.

1esabki,I desperately want to rejoin education,"Sorry if this is not the right group to post this in. I am in need of guidance so feel free to recommend any subs that are best suited for this. 

When I left school I entered an animal management course, which is my passion. I was going through a lot in my personal life and was really struggling in education. I passed but didn't receive a grade high enough to enroll in the next course.

I decided instead to enroll in something else that I thought could be good for me which was Cyber Security. I spent 2 years doing this course and my passion was lacking. This resulted in once again passing, but I didn't enjoy the course at all.

During these 2 years I began working at a builders merchant and have now been working there for 5 years. I worked my way up to a management role which I have fulfilled for a year, but I am beginning to fall out of love for this job as the company and industry change. I dread going to work every day and come back miserable and exhausted.

I really want to go back into education for animal management but I'm struggling to decide what to do as not only will I now need to pay for the course but l also won't be able to work during it. 

The main reason i want to go back into education is because I don't believe a simple 'pass' will be enough to get a real job in animal management and it's been 5 years since I had any involvement at all.

There are no apprenticeships near me, nor are there any animal care work jobs that I could work in to gain any extra experience.
Am I doomed? It is terrifying thinking about the path I created for myself as a young adult, trying to navigate life without any guidance.

1esaa4e,"19M : Burnout, 2yr College ""Dropout"", Starting Fresh in debt","Somewhat of a backstory:
I have done 2 years in university now, during my last year, burnout, coupled with bad coping skills, a lack of motivation and poor mental health directed me towards failing all my courses and letting go of it all. 

It started off by me missing an appointment for my adhd medication, which snowballed into me messing up my schedule, messing up some grades, ‚Äúcoping‚Äù then missing my next appointment etc. with the snowball getting larger/worse every cycle. But i doubt that that would be the only cause because no person in their right mind would let everything go.

What did i do during all this time? A combination of sex, drugs (weed, shrooms, nicotine), meditation?, introspection, writing, and just wasting my life away on the internet. (I quit all substances for 3 months now, except weed occasionally)

I have no income and was depending on my parents and student assistance (grants and loans) to fund everything. 

Im currently spending the summer with my family right now, and they do not know about this situation. All they know is that i finished another year of university and now im moving onto the next, technically i could have enrolled into another year, but as i said i let go of it all. I did not enroll in anything this academic year.

Experience:
I have no ‚Äúreal‚Äù work experience as i have never worked before, unless selling miscellaneous items on various marketplaces is considered experience. Just high school education and ~ a year and a half of university credits. I am a very quick learner, but i typically start losing interest as quick as i learn. 

Housing:
Im in Ontario, Canada right now, and the housing and job market is not in the best place for me. 

Staying with my family as an option would probably be the best decision, but the mental stress and shame that comes with it feels like it could crush me. I have a complicated relationship with my parents, and i value freedom above all which i don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll have much if i stay there. I also don‚Äôt want to set a bad example to my younger brothers, as i don‚Äôt want them to think that it is okay to just throw your blessings away. All that or im overthinking it all. If anything, beggars can‚Äôt be choosers.

I have friends that would help, but I don‚Äôt want to possibly bring them down or add to their ‚Äústress‚Äù due to my problems. Now that I mentioned it, i also have the same ‚Äúissue‚Äù with my parents, I don‚Äôt want to stress them out, but i need to survive.

‚ÄúLife goal‚Äù: 
I see myself creating a multidisciplinary brand centered on avant-garde fashion, music/sound, and design. I know it will be a difficult path to take, but i am willing to take that path as that is the only purpose i see for my existence.

Possible income path:
I enjoy and im passionate about cooking, i have been cooking for years now and i enjoy providing people with good culinary service, would looking into starting a culinary career be a good start? Im willing to start off as a dishwasher and work my way up if it pays the bills.

Finances:
Account(s) balance: $9,850
Debt: -$14,916

:::::: I am aware of and I take responsibility for my past actions. They were bad decisions but whatever happened happened and there‚Äôs no changing that, what i could control is the present, and hope for a better future.

:::::: My life goal does sound crazy, which it is, but as long as i have a roof on top of my head, and food on my plate, if i could work on my projects, i will be content. 
    I have a couple plans to start generating some income from it all, but i think it would be a better plan to hold it off until i have some financial stability and an emergency fund, so that i would be able to seek some more aid mentally and hopefully be in a better mental state, as you cant put sugar on shit (build on a bad foundation).

My agency‚Äôs close rate was becoming alarmingly low so they asked the strategists (there are two of us) to look at the biz dev team‚Äôs pitch decks and recommend a new structure. We did. They took my idea and ran with it. They even had the strategists start presenting the pitches. Since then, our close rate has improved ten fold.

1es9fet,What to say to HR for expected salary when the range being offered is very large?,"I have the HR screening portion of a job I applied to recently coming up. I know they‚Äôll definitely ask me what my salary expectations are. In my previous roles, the ranges have been pretty small and I pretty much knew what I could get based on my experience. 

This one is a little tougher. For example, my current salary is around $120k, and the job is offering a salary in the range of $100k-$150k. The minimum I‚Äôm willing to take to move is ~$130k. This new role actually has better vacation and WFH benefits so I don‚Äôt mind taking a small increase. 

I‚Äôm wondering however, should I aim even higher so as not to leave any money on the table? 

The thing is, $150k is kind of a lot for my role, and I don‚Äôt even know if the majority of companies that have this position would ever offer that. I‚Äôm almost at the top end of the salary band for this position in the industry as is. I don‚Äôt want to waste my opportunity by asking too much. Should I stick to the $130k number (still obtainable in the market) or push a little bit more?

1es8qay,Should I quit? ,"TLDR: I am in my late 30s and wondering if I should quit my job.

I was able to move laterally into a role that I‚Äôd been aiming for by working hard in several ‚Äústepping stone‚Äù roles to get to here. It was exhausting but good, hard work that took me 2 years.

I‚Äôm five months into this new role and have maintained a good reputation. In fact, I was recently told my performance and results are ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù and my boss joked that I need a raise.  The issue is that I am just so extremely burned out. While grinding for the past couple of years, I really let my health ‚Äúgo‚Äù. I‚Äôve gained weight and my chronic disease worsened. Worst part is I can‚Äôt scale back at work right now. I have tried repeatedly to get a better work-life balance, but keep failing myself. When I take vacation (even just a couple of days so far), I find that my work piles up so much that it is overwhelming and worsens my anxiety.  I recently talked about my concern that I‚Äôll burnout with my manager, but frankly not sure he actually cares. If I got paid more or promoted to grind like this, it‚Äôd be different, but when I brought up the topic of moving up at my company in at least a couple of years, my manager told me he was 10+ years in my role before he moved up.

So I feel like I just need a break. I know that the problem is me. Knowing my personality, I think that I need to just quit and focus on my health, even if I don‚Äôt have a backup plan in place. I‚Äôm fortunate that my spouse could support me with no problem.

But then I‚Äôll see my work friend, who quit a year ago to take care of 2 kids, unable to find a job. There are so many people vying to get into my company and I start to feel like an ungrateful person for not seizing the opportunities awarded to me.

1es73rq,Asking for accommodations ,"My doctor has advised me to request wfh flexibility as an accommodation but I‚Äôm hesitant to do so. I have been experiencing flare ups of my Crohn‚Äôs disease which had previously been well managed. I‚Äôve been trying to push myself to honor the current hybrid schedule at my office - but as a result of increased fatigue, pain, and other symptoms I‚Äôve been finding myself experiencing fevers and exceptional levels of exhaustion after in office days. My doctor advised me that stress reduction and rest are essential and has offered to provide documentation. I know that a more flexible hybrid schedule will provide a serious decrease in stress levels and will better allow me to control my pain management and rest (just being in a laying down position instead of in an office chair when not on video calls makes a huge difference). I‚Äôve also done a full remote schedule in this role before and being home will not effect my essential job duties at all.

Basically, is this okay to ask for? I‚Äôm second guessing and very concerned about retaliation or what happens if this gets denied. My boss is very all-in on return to work and we‚Äôve had friction previously. I think if I go through with this I‚Äôll schedule time with HR to understand options and what documentation they‚Äôll need first, then give my boss a heads up that I‚Äôve made the request formally with HR. I‚Äôm also in a unique position where the only other person with my skills is about to go on maternity leave, so while I have more leverage I also know they‚Äôll be even more eager to have me in office.

1es6smz,I don‚Äôt know what my ‚Äúpersonal brand‚Äù is. How do I market myself to recruiters? ,"
Hi. I got laid off in May 2024 and have been looking for a job since. I‚Äôve taken the job search slow to relax and enjoy the summer but now I am refocused and struggling to land an interview. I have 3 years of experience in social media management / strategy and 1 year of experience as an Account Manager working with a big brand, I‚Äôm 26F. I know I‚Äôm capable to do the jobs I‚Äôm applying for but I‚Äôm not getting interviews.

I want to make my applications stand out by including either a presentation or website with my work/projects but I have no idea how to show my personality or sell ‚Äúmy story.‚Äù Which is advice I‚Äôve been given- that as a marketer I need to sell MY brand/story. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm passionate about or how to stand out. I feel like I‚Äôm just the average basic bitch tbh. I don‚Äôt post on LinkedIn my thoughts, I have an average social media following on IG and TT - sharing my opinions online or trying to be ‚Äúan influencer‚Äù online myself is just not me, but it seems like companies want that from a social media person. I don‚Äôt want to do that - I know that I‚Äôm extremely motivated to work hard and have received positive feedback throughout my career.  

How do I get out of this funk and feel motivated to tell my story? How do I figure out what my passions are? Is this even the right thing to do to get a job? I‚Äôm feeling so lost and discouraged.

1es6n5u,What would you do?,"I‚Äôve been working at my current company for about 2.5 years. I make $105,000 a year and have received a $10,000 raise per year since joining the team. 

I genuinely enjoy my role and there‚Äôs significant flex in responsibilities. My team is great, I‚Äôm autonomous, fully remote, and am trusted since have a longer tenure than most of the other employees in the company. However, I‚Äôm being paid significantly under market for my role, have not received a promotion (just a title change with no pay increase) and basically needed to beg for an additional 5k increase this last performance cycle because they tried to give me the standard 3% and then realized I had gone without a pay increase in 18 months. 

The company is still very ‚Äústart up‚Äù and has grown SIGNIFICANTLY since I‚Äôve joined. I work in TA and have been responsible for over a 150% headcount growth, and what we have been paying has also significantly changed. My equals in the company are ~10-15 years my senior, the average pay band for my level is now $115,000-$130,000, and as much as I love my job there‚Äôs a part of me that feels like sticking around may be at my detriment in the long term. I‚Äôve moved to NY (our headquarters location) since joining the team and my pay is pretty significantly under market. 

I haven‚Äôt necessarily been looking for another role and am quite comfortable with where I‚Äôm at. However, a recruiter reached out to me about a private search happening for a role with the same job title at a company she used to work for. It‚Äôs a company I‚Äôm familiar with, has great benefits, and I‚Äôve genuinely really enjoyed meeting with their team. It‚Äôs a hybrid (~3 days a week in office) role, with a pay of $135,000-$145,000, $135 a month wellness budget, and 2 months a year where you can work remote anywhere in the world that can be used in tandem with your 25 days off PTO package. It also almost feels like a slight reduction in responsibilities from my current role because we live in a very sprint and high chaos state all of the time. 

It kind of came out of nowhere, and I‚Äôm now in the final stages of the interview process and genuinely being considered for this role. There‚Äôs a part of me that is really excited about the opportunity and the thought of going into a new market at a ‚Äúnew level‚Äù and feeling empowered in that. There‚Äôs another part of me that feels slightly guilty for even considering the role and can‚Äôt really justify leaving a fully remote and easy going role and jumping back to the bottom of the totem pole. 

My current employer is supposed to be coming to me next week with a ‚Äúmarket rate‚Äù adjustment for mid cycle (which I can only assume will put me at $115,000-$120,00 max). I‚Äôve felt the need to put together a presentation to almost justify my worth and contributions to this company and why I deserve to be at $125,00-$130,000, but there‚Äôs a part of me that feel like that demeaning too. 

My questions here are: 
How much would you genuinely consider the new opportunity? Is it worth switching to a hybrid role from remote?

1es6kkt,Am I crazy for wanting to become a full-time student again? Or am I overthinking this?,"**TLDR:**
I‚Äôm a 2022 marketing grad currently working as a recruiter, unhappy with my day to day and my income. I am desperate to make a career change that would likely require a different bachelors degree (comp sci or engineering). My experience in recruiting has exposed me to just how critical management can be in regard to things like an employment gap or short tenure in a position, so I am worried that leaving my job to pursue said degree will only make my background look worse and that it will be a decision I am made to regret- my job experience is limited to an 8 month recruiting job, followed by a year gap, and then my current recruiting job of 5 months. 

Would I be crazy to leave my job and pursue this degree, even if it means abandoning my half way complete MBA and having no work experience for another few years? Or is it not too late to effectively start over?

**Full context:**
I graduated in 2022 with a BS in Marketing and could not find a marketing job in any capacity. After 2 months of applications, I took a job in recruiting planning to keep searching. I  did well there and received promotions, but never enjoyed recruiting or my compensation in the slightest. I stayed in that role for 8 months. 

I left that recruiting job after getting accepted to a 2 year MBA program and spent just under a year pursuing that before accepting my current job, which is a hybrid marketing/recruiting role for a an engineering company. I settled on this position due to once again failing to land interviews, and while it is less recruiting than my previous role, I am still unhappy as recruiting takes up the bulk of my time. I have also learned marketing isn‚Äôt as enjoyable as I once thought it was. 

I have now been in this role for 5 months and have since paused my MBA. I did this because I not only found it difficult to balance my work, personal, and school life but also because I realized a career in management, particularly in the context of marketing or recruiting, does not align with my career or personal goals in any capacity. 

After continually failing to get interviews and transition away from recruiting, I have now reached a point of desperation where I feel the need to make a career change. I have spoken with friends and peers, taken many of the career guidance tests, and have determined I am most interested in an engineering or computer science role- roles that require me to complete another bachelor degree. 

I would like to dedicate my time to one of these degrees, leaving my current job to become a full-time student, but my limited time in recruiting has exposed me to perspectives from different management levels across an abundance of different companies. I fear that my butchered and inconsistent experience will make it difficult for me to land a decent well paying role all over again. Am I right to think this way?",asharksalt,2,1.0,2,1723654044,2024-08-14 16:47:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1es6kkt/am_i_crazy_for_wanting_to_become_a_fulltime/,8,2024

1es4w53,Pregnant and at a loss - what to do? ,"Throwaway to protect identity. 

I was poached from a competitor in 2021 because I was made an offer I couldn't refuse, after 5 consecutive years of turning her down. WFH position, 3 weeks vacation and a 17k salary increase. I knew the hiring manager from our industry groups, she was a mentor to me for years so I had no reason not to trust her. 

Accepted her offer but made the mistake of not reviewing the offer letter. Got on board and found out I was given a standard contract. Addressed it with her, and she got defensive and told me I signed the offer letter. Lesson learned. 

I got pregnant and had my child January 2023. FMLA went smoothly, and on my last day of leave I received an email from my boss with HR copied stating I would need to commute upon my return if I want to keep my position. The commute is 1 hour each way, which was a big part of why I refused her previous offers; the commute is unmanageable for me. 

I got on a teams call with her and the region president and I explained that I was not mentally ready to begin commuting as I was struggling with PPD and I was hired to WFH in the first place. She shrugged her shoulders and said ""oh well, we have a business to run."" 

After that call, she started micromanaging me, nitpicking and sending me berating emails making problems out of nothing. This has been ongoing since. 

They had hired my husband in the meantime to help fix their department and once the dept lead found out he was Ukrainian, they moved him to a team that has little to no workload. (Our last name is a town in Ukraine. Dept lead screenshotted google maps and asked him if he was Ukrainian through text, to which he replied yes. Next thing he knew was he was being moved to another team for no apparent reason). He reported discrimination to the region president and asked for a meeting, the president agreed to meet 3 business days later, and hwne my husband showed up, he was fired because ""they didn't need him anymore."" 

Now I was stuck, dependent on health care benefits until my husband found a job. 6 months later, he landed one, and 3 months later (this past June, he acquired benefits). I started looking for a new job and found out that I'm pregnant again, due in December 2024. 

I submitted my FMLA application in June, as soon as I found out, and just yesterday the VP HR called me to tell me that the company policy is only (1) 12-week leave per 24 month period. I would need leave at exactly 23 months into this period, but per policy, I was ineligible. 

Now I'm struggling with what to do as I only have 1 PTO day left (2 weeks given with standard contract and my 18m old has neurology appts, so I had to use some days for traveling to Boston Children's)

As far as I can tell, my options are: 

1. Return to work immediately after being discharged from the hospital after giving birth

2. File leave through the state, which is only 65% of my pay, and this will leave us unable to make our mortgage

3. Find a new job, which is unlikely I'd get hired being 5 months pregnant 

Either way, I won't receive full pay if I take any time off and my husband had taken a 20k pay cut to leave the industry, so we're short already as it is. 

He did consult a lawyer last year who told us that we would waste more money pursuing them for discrimination and wrongful termination so it wouldn't be worth it. 

I'm struggling with my mental health, pretty severely. My brain is foggy and I'm not sure if I'm missing any potential avenues I could take to be able to spend time with my newborn while being able to support our bills. We applied for assistance but we gross $400 too much to qualify. Have no assets to sell, already refinanced our mortgage when my husband was fired to cover us until he found a job. Unemployment helped but it wasn't enough. 

Does anyone have any insight or suggestions about what I might be able to do or am I completely screwed? ",Upstairs_Mango_2504,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1723650067,2024-08-14 15:41:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1es4w53/pregnant_and_at_a_loss_what_to_do/,8,2024
1es4p2j,I can‚Äôt decide which job path to follow,"So, I‚Äôm in kind of a weird situation. I managed to land 3 part time jobs in fields that I‚Äôm interested in. But then recently I got offered 1 full time job that seems a little less interesting, but it would offer me a good income and a predictable schedule and stability. So, I‚Äôm torn on what path to choose. I‚Äôll explain my paths here: 

So I started as a part time art teacher at this small art studio. I am an artist and I love teaching art, it‚Äôs like a dream job for me. But this job didn‚Äôt pay me enough to survive, so I was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll find another part time job to supplement this and I can just work 2 jobs.‚Äù ($20 an hour, usually work like 15-20 hours a week). The owners are rude to me and penny pinchers, but the work itself, I love and am very attached to it and I‚Äôm good at it.

I then got a 2nd job recently as a school photographer. We go around schools across the state and take students ID and yearbook photos. But this job is seasonal only, so in Winter time and Summer, there‚Äôs no work. Only work in the Fall and Spring. But my art job has winter and summer camps that give me work in those times. (It‚Äôs $22 an hour, will probably work 20- maybe 30 hours, they‚Äôre flexible with you making your own schedules). 

The photography job starts super early (like 4 or 5 AM) and shifts are like 10-12 hours, so it‚Äôs long days. But I like photography (although, not entirely a dream job of mine, but it seems like an interesting job) and it seems like I could maybe make friends with the other cool young artsy people that work there too, and we get to travel around, not be tied to a desk, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs kinda keeping me hanging on to it. 

Then around the same time I was applying for jobs, I also got an offer to be a music teacher, which seems like it‚Äôd pay well. It was listed for $50-$75 an hour, but I‚Äôd only be teaching probably 5 hours a week (1 day a week, in the evening only) so it‚Äôd just be a 3rd part time job. I‚Äôm a musician as well, so this follows my interests. 

Each of these jobs is in a different location. One is 20 min away, another is 30 min. away, and the other is 45 min. away.

HOWEVER,
I applied to a lot of jobs recently and I just also got offered a job to work as an office admin at a Montessori private school for elementary kids. The job also said I‚Äôd get to help teach a little too (maybe they‚Äôd let me teach art sometimes??)

It‚Äôs $23 an hour, full time 40 hours a week. It doesn‚Äôt seem as interesting as the other jobs, but it might be a more stable career path, and I‚Äôd have the security of knowing I have work all year long, no gaps. I‚Äôve done admin stuff before, it‚Äôs not as exciting, but that‚Äôs ok, I could still do it. I was very scared when I had first lost my job (before I got the art teacher job) and had financial insecurity, it‚Äôs terrifying. So part of me is like, maybe I shouldn‚Äôt hop around to all these different jobs so much, maybe I should go the easier route.

Is it normal that I'm expected to be fully independent after a week of work? I started this job couple days ago. I had two full days of training (including from the grounds up, since I was very clear in my job interview that I have no clue about accountancy, but now my entire job is essentially invoice data entry), but since then I'm alone in my office. Everyone assures me that it's okay to ask, but I can tell they are annoyed with me making stupid mistakes or sometimes not even my mistakes, as I get blamed for previous worker's errors. The finance departament gets really petty with me, making sure to point out that I made the same mistake yet again. I'm struggling with all new responsibilities.

I'm having a terrible time in my new (well, first ever actually) job but I can't tell whether something is going on with them or with me, since I'm naturally sensitive and emotional anyway.

1es4bk9,How to deal with jealousy of close friends benefitting from nepotism.,"I'm a university student, at a fairly decent UK uni (all A/A\* to get in) and in the horrible process of applying to every single internship possible. I have a very close friend, doing basically the same course, in the same year, who got an internship position. He got this position because He asked someone who works there what's available and go the position. No interview, assessment, didn't even need to hand in their cv.

How did they get the last position? Family member. Same stuff. No interview, cv, anything. They claim they have just worked hard for their positions, and they may have worked really hard in their previous role, I don't doubt it, but the person who has taken them in at the new position, wasn't the manager at their old job. They wouldn't of overseen there work etc., so it's not even a case of a manager changing jobs and bringing over old reliable staff. 

I'm trying desperately to get my way into the field, and it's soul sucking and so draining. I try to talk about it and they say something along the lines of ""Oh you are so smart, they'll be able to see that and you'll be alright, if I can do it so can you"". They are completely oblivious that they got there position from complete nepotism, and I struggle so much with the jealousy. 

To clear up, they took a gap year for work, hence why we are in the same year but they have work experience.

Any tips to maybe gently bring this up in conversation or deal with the envy, which I'm not proud of at all but just don't know how to get rid of it.",T0pCronos,1,1.0,0,1723648715,2024-08-14 15:18:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1es4bk9/how_to_deal_with_jealousy_of_close_friends/,8,2024

He has been using sick time for his appointments, and they are scheduled well in advance. He has a few conditions that he is managing, but nothing that would rise to the level of FMLA. He just has to see the doctor ever few months about them. There is nothing in the handbook limiting appointments, so I think that this is just something being made up out of thin air. 

I have told my husband to email the supervisor a recap of the conversation and request that he confirm that my husband understood correctly.

Always was a hardworking student. Always among top three in class. Great school. Good govt college for grad in Economics hons. Masters again from govt University.Both grad and masters from top 3 ranking university in India. Kicker: They taught absolutely no fucking shit in grad and my marks plummeted to hell. With a bit of brain that I have, got into masters, qualified NET but didn't wanna become a professor. Since I'm no good in my subject after grad, have no other skills ,as nobody in my parents is educated. They didn't let me start earning or internship during school and college as they thought I should focus on my Studies, pursuing hobbies is looked down upon. (I must mention that I'm a first born girl in a family where monthly earnings are barely 20000 rupees). Ultimately it's the things that get me a job which I was barred from doing. Finished my master around my 22nd birthday. Didn't get a job, taught tuitions,still do, but it doesn't pay much and isn't regular.I'm great, and I mean it, really great with English literature and speaking skills but have no degree in literature. I feel stuck. Because I am. I'm hyper aware of everything and it makes the pain of not turning out how I believe I would,even more bitter. I always thought I'll be and officer. I'm not. I didn't even prepare for it. Why? My father is a narcissist. Makes everything about himself,has god syndrome and would sabotage anything I do. I'm sorry if I sound bitter, because I am. I don't wanna tell him I want to prepare for something big and trying to earn little money to be able to finance myself. I want to give my mother the a life better than the best and don't want her to wash a damn utensil in her life. She's sacrificed and faced a lot of struggles and insult due to and from my asshole father.I'm sorry for this rant. Suggest me anything and everything.

I've applied to a few positions in companies and one of them responded by sending me a psychometric test. It was incredibly easy - just mental arithmetic. I passed it and had an interview that ended early because I told them I wasn't willing relocate to London (something that should have been clear from my application). They told me that they would ""look into my residency requirements and get back to me - probably we will reschedule the interview.""

I'm actually extremely insulted by the test. I have a doctorate in maths - papers in top journals etc. Why do they expect me to spend 30min proving I can add numbers and calculate compound interest? Does it say anything useful about me whatsoever? My suspicion is that this is all based on BS science nobody has taken seriously since the 70s.

1es2qnx,I believe I was unjustly fired. Is there anything I can do?,"Hello.

I‚Äôm female, 27 (black/native/fat if it matters).

Just giving out full details.

I live in a town called Ardmore, located in Oklahoma, US.

I believe my employment lasted from July 12th - July 18th.

The employer in question was Dairy Queen. Role was team member.

Up until the 18th (my final day of employment), things were going well. I was beginning to be crossed trained in the cooking area.

The 18th rolls around, and my general manager was stressing about the store getting shut down because someone from corporate (district/area manager I believe), was coming in this specific day.

Things are fine, albeit hectic. At the time noticeably overstaffed.

I did a bit of everything that day, custodial, dishes, drive-thru, and finally ‚Äúblizzard alley‚Äù or whatever similar silly name they decided to slap on.

It was hectic! There were two of us to begin with, but as the night went on, and we got busier, we ended up with 5 people in the same area.

A couple of other girls were looking over my shoulder, or idly standing by (since they didn‚Äôt get the hang of mixing yet). One even confessed she didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I was attempting to help her learn.

I was in the middle of a sundae when the visiting corporate person walks up. Says ‚ÄúHey you,‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt immediately look up (it was busy and I was trying to get orders out)

I look up, he says ‚ÄúHey, you gotta go, you‚Äôre fired, and leaves.‚Äù

I say nothing, take my gloves off, clock out, and go outside.

I come back inside briefly to ask the GM. ‚ÄúI was wondering why I was fired?‚Äù

She actually looked bothered. Whether she actually was I don‚Äôt know. She was the one training and looking over me since the beginning of my employment. Never heard a complaint once. She actually liked that I wanted to learn the cooking area.

She replies with a sort of hesitation. A grimace. ‚ÄúBecause you were standing around doing nothing‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù I turn around, heading back to the main entrance. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she says. She seemed genuine about it.

‚ÄúNot your fault,‚Äù I say, not even looking behind me.
And that was the end of that.

For context, when I first started working at this place there were a total of 3 of us (myself, a cook, and the GM herself). Over the next few days she hired about 6-7 more people.

For further context, I hear the place can‚Äôt keep employees. About a month or so before I worked there (I had just moved states), my family tells me that there was a mass walkout. All the employees quit the same day.

I was putting in effort. I was working. I was doing my job. Yet despite there being a few (2-3) people who were *literally* doing nothing, I was the only one fired.

Now I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs anything I can do besides nothing.

Any direction or word of advice is much appreciated. Thank you for your time.",blakmagicke,1,0.5099999904632568,39,1723644988,2024-08-14 14:16:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1es2qnx/i_believe_i_was_unjustly_fired_is_there_anything/,8,2024
1es2j0w,"Left a toxic boss, took a break in retail. How do I answer the dreaded ""Why did you leave?""","Hey r/careeradvice, throwaway account. 

Last year, I quit a toxic manager who had been squeezing me with frustratingly vague required improvements, angry escalations out of the blue, and displeasure with the changes that he asked for. His behavior was unexpected, as I'd worked well with him for years without a problem - whenever he had issue with my work previously (which was rare), he'd give specific feedback and I'd make the changes, done, move on to the next project. Our relationship was professional and friendly. Now, it was vague ""I just need better quality/reports/etc"" with no response to follow-up work I provided to him, or worse, he'd say it was worse with no specifics. I spoke with HR, concerned with my perceived poor performance and looking for guidance, and was told to just meet with him more often and document recaps in an email to him. (Spoiler alert: I did both, it didn't help, but it did make me feel way worse about myself.)

After some time I was doubting my ability to do the job, because why else would he be so hard on me? (I could indeed do the job, and was quite good at it, but I assumed he was well-intentioned and that I just had to improve.) I was in a terrible place mentally because of it and was looking for new jobs. Unfortunately, my career was terribly niche and my partner and I would have had to move at least a state away, and partner had just started a great new job. 

One day I was criticized harshly by Toxic Boss in front of one of my team members for his policy interpretation, not HR's, that he had me enforce. I broke down later in front of my coworkers - I am NOT an emotionally demonstrative person. That was the final straw; I quit that same day. I hate the term ""gaslighting"", but in retrospect a lot of his behavior seemed that way. 

I immediately got a job with a small retail store, and have been working there for \~6 months recovering my self-worth and mental health. If you've ever worked retail, you know how bad it was when I say retail has been extremely pleasant. 

I still speak with my old coworkers, which had helped me reaffirm that I was, in fact, not terrible at my job. I also now think I know why my old boss was acting strangely. A few months after I left, Toxic Boss and his immediate boss (the org's CFO) were let go effective immediately. They were recorded by security being physically intimate while onsite at work, apparently more than once. They are thought to have started an affair (CFO is married with kids) a few months before my first poor quarterly review. They are also currently being investigated for embezzlement. I have a certain level of validation, knowing Toxic Boss is definitely crazy.

All of that background for this question. I've decided on a new career and have some interviews lined up, but how do I answer the ""Why did you leave/Why did you work retail for 6 months"" question? I can't just say ""My boss was snogging his boss and went nuts and was probably stealing tons of money and I couldn't f'ing take it anymore"", it sounds like something from a movie. 

TLDR: Toxic Boss was fucking his boss and making me miserable with gaslight-y behavior, I left and worked a (comparatively) pleasant retail job for 6 months. How do I answer the ""Why did you leave?"" interview question honestly?",Ornery_Mammoth8421,25,0.8999999761581421,39,1723644461,2024-08-14 14:07:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1es2j0w/left_a_toxic_boss_took_a_break_in_retail_how_do_i/,8,2024

1es1j60,What should my next career step be?,"
I am looking for some genuine advice here. I just recently graduated with a B.S. in psychology from one of the top schools in the U.S. with a really high GPA. During my undergrad, I worked as a research assistant for 2 years in 2 different labs that built my skills in manuscript writing, poster creation, research presentation, data collection, survey design, participant management and scheduling, data coding, and data analysis. I also worked as a teaching assistant for a year for 2 different psychology courses.

During undergrad, I also worked during the summer semesters to build my bank. Because I also had a full ride scholarship, I was able to save 50k by the time I graduated. I was also able to land a research coordinator position that started right after I graduated and make 40k at this position. 

In the last year of my undergrad, I submitted applications to Ph.D. programs in Clinical Psychology and got rejected‚Ä¶ by all of them. Now that‚Äôs it‚Äôs time to reapply, I‚Äôm doubting whether or not I want to apply to Ph.D. programs again or try getting a masters in psych or in something else instead. 

I want to make good money and build a comfortable life. I love subjects like math and science along with psychology but I don‚Äôt know what path to take right now. I‚Äôm confused on what I should do next. Should I get a masters? Should I try to get a masters while working full time?

I've been in the heart of the action and being offered a people management role in the new team where I'll be managing a small group of analysts who jerk off all day doing BS work whom I am pretty sure work multiple remote jobs owing to the nature of work. Simple data cleansing and reporting work.

The other option is to wait it out and find another role within the company. This appears to be a horrible position to be in with the current state of the economy. 

Utterly disappointed how things have fanned out. Would love to know your stories and how you dealt with such a situation. ",Accomplished_Risk476,1,1.0,0,1723641787,2024-08-14 13:23:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1es1hk8/top_performer_screwed_over_during/,8,2024
1es15m4,I need a new job but I don‚Äôt know what to do.,"
Title. I wake up miserable every day because I am so bloody bored of my job. 

I am a software tester at a small company being paid peanuts (a couple hundred above minimum wage) and I took the job as I needed something immediately after uni and it was the first one to give me an offer. I have a first class degree in compsci and a master‚Äôs in compsci as well.

I‚Äôm not interested in computing at all anymore really. I enjoyed the theoretical aspects of it at university, but the corporate life has killed any passion I have for it. 

So what to do now? I have applied for countless jobs in the computing industry but I cannot even get an interview (despite my degrees). I am going to look outside of the sector but not sure what?

Is there any other industry that I could join with my compsci degrees or are they completely useless outside of tech? I feel like I want something a bit more physical where I am on my feet. I actually enjoy manual labour quite a lot. 

However in the UK I‚Äôd have to be on an apprentice wage if I were to learn a trade and I can‚Äôt afford to do that with rent/bills. 

Feel like I‚Äôm stuck, any advice is appreciated.",sherimpeee,1,1.0,1,1723640892,2024-08-14 13:08:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1es15m4/i_need_a_new_job_but_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,8,2024
1es0b3c,Potential Career Pivots Given My Background,"I have an MBA in finance and accounting from a very solid school. Somehow ended up in asset management compliance. I have a pretty good spot now - money is good and I have a great boss. But I want to earn more. I‚Äôve tried getting into private equity compliance. Have had several close calls over the years, with the most recent one being back in June.

I‚Äôm not sure if my background really lends itself to any kind of meaningful pivot where I wouldn‚Äôt need to start at the bottom again at my age (40).

I‚Äôm wondering if there are any certifications or degrees that aren‚Äôt as huge a time commitment that may help? Should I just stay the course and keep trying to get into private equity compliance? 

I‚Äôve even wondered about CPA. I think I‚Äôd need to go back and take classes before I‚Äôm even eligible to sit for that exam. Not sure if my MBA classes would help a bit there.

1es0aj7,I've been dinged in performance reviews for things that aren't even in my job description!,"I've been in the same role for the past 4 years. I am 60 (F) so I am at the end of a long career. It's not uncommon at this point in people's careers to be in positions for longer periods and to take on responsibilities and tasks based on work experience. Most of us in a leadership role have something like ""other duties"" in our jobs that anticipates we're going to take on different stuff. 

But for me it seems like I've been taking on tasks and roles and responsibilities that were never part of my job description and it was like that story of the boiling frog: you don't notice you're job is changing until it has changed beyond recognition. 

My boss asked me to review my job description because she thought that there were things in my JD that I wasn't doing and that I should be. Well...it couldn't be farther than the truth. When I actually reviewed my responsibilities at least 20% of what I now do isn't reflected. Not only that but for the past two years in my performance reviews I've been critiqued for not doing certain things and everything I was criticized for was the extra stuff I took on!

And this wasn't small stuff; it was dealing with external vendors, negotiating contracts, oversight of the budget ... huge things that I know how to do and have done but were on top of all the other things I was actually hired to do. And when you are spread too thin: something is going to drop. 

So now I will be meeting with my boss and it should be an interesting discussion...because after I add all these tasks into the job I'm going to request that my compensation be reviewed. I may be owed more money.

I apparently insulted or offended X: I introduced X to the organizers of a conference, thinking that X would do a remote presentation (as X lives hundreds of miles away), but when X called to tell me that X was coming for the whole conference, at X's own expense, I didn't want to overpromise the benefits of the conference, and I probably came across as though I didn't want X to come; I did, but I didn't want X to be let down, as the conference isn't worth that kind of trip.

I reached out to X a few times on X's personal email to propose some other business development opportunities and to let X know that I was excited that X would be coming to the conference, but X didn't respond.

I have an online meeting with X and another person today, which was scheduled before I insulted X.  X already wrote to confirm it: ""Looking forward to speaking at 3pm today, warmly, X"".

I'd like to apologize to X by saying how highly I think of X, that X is always welcome, and that X has an open door here, and that I may have insulted X through how I came across when we spoke about the conference, and I'd like to say that directly to X.  **OK to say to X, ""do you have a minute before or after today's meeting for a quick 1-on-1, as I would like to make amends for something I think I did""?**

1erzs4h,Knowing when to move on,"Hi all. I have been involved with an Employee Resource Group for the past 7 years now and I feel like it is time to move on. The problem I have is that I don't want to feel like I am;
a) letting the group down
b) throwing away opportunities 
c) failing. 

All involved in the ERG are volunteers. The group has gone through several Chairmen and committee leads but the group doesn't seem as engaging with me as I have been in the past. Call me paranoid but I sometimes think that my face doesn't fit anymore. In the past, I have build up connections and gained so much experience which has been invaluable to my main career, hence why I feel dejected and disenfranchised. I feel like I should move on but at the same time am conflicted with potentially throwing away opportunities. 

Should I stay or go? Has anyone had similar experiences? How could I approach this and remain positive?

I‚Äôve got some money saved so I can afford to retrain/ get some qualifications. Problem is I have no idea what I want to do. All I know is I can‚Äôt use my back and I want to be home as much as possible because I love my family and they bring me true joy. Not looking to be a millionaire.

1eryx7k,Scared and guilty of quitting,"in 2017 my old job was  in a canteen for office workers as  a member of front of house team. In 2019 because of brexit we were told by canteen owners that we are laid off and replaced by vending machines and boxed sandwiches delivered by some company. My manager told me about his partner being a manager in this hospitality venue, they're not affected by brexit that much and that I should try my luck there. I did.  It's the best job I ever had. In 5 years working there I never heard management scream/yell at the team. I could always feel like my opinion matters even though I am just a regular worker there. I had managers asking for my opinion/suggestions and going forward with them numerous times. We are a small team of about 10 people. We are a motley crew that looks after one another. It's the first job where I wouldn't have a little cry before my shift and would always leave to work with a spring in my step. We're such a well oiled machine I can't believe it.  
There is one problem however, the pay is below min wage ( we range from 0 hour contracts to 25h/week like me or full time contracts like managers, overtime helps to make it to min wage or slightly above, but not always) and we need more staff. The team and my managers are amazing to work with. However, the owners and directors are a bunch of cheapskates (they own more restaurants and hospitality venues and have the funds to hire more people/give raises/give proper contracts, but choose not to). One very good part time lady finished her degree while working there, she wanted more hours for a year or so to save up money so she could have some savings while looking for a job in her field, was denied so she left. Another one didn't get his contract upgraded from 20h to at least 30h, he left. A chef wanted a raise, was denied - he left.   
Now that chef is offering me a job in a fancier place that is opening soon. He will be a head chef there, he is offering me a back of house role while I am doing a mix of both front and back of house in my current job. This would be a more challenging role, I would be basically a junior chef with no experience, but I get along with chef well and he wants to coach me. He is offering me full time with 10% extra pay as a start with another 5-10% after 6 months + tips depending on how business goes. So I may be getting extra ¬£2.50-4.00 an hour on average.  
The deadline for accepting the offer is short. I basically have to give notice to my current employer next week and start my job in the middle of September in a new place to make it work. However, September-December are the BUSIEST moths of the year where I work. I'm talking about venue being open 7 days a week with only 10 of us working there. If I quit, my current coworkers are screwed majorly. All of them will have to pull extra 10-20 hours a week until the end of December. There might be weeks where even extra 20h/week overtime won't be enough.  My team has no idea about me potentially leaving and that would be a bit of stab in the back. The company has a very prolonged hiring process (can take 2-3 weeks just to get to interview stage). Also, new hires tend to be unreliable, we had a spell where 8 in a row didn't even show up for an interview. And even if they are accepted they are pretty much useless for at least 2-3 moths until they learn how we do things here (if they even stay: 1 in 3 hires quit within first month). I don't care about the owners and directors being inconvenienced. I worry about  my team and lower managers. We looked after one another so much. We've seen each other in our best and our worst, we enjoyed good shifts and shouldered bad ones hundreds upon hundreds of times.   
I am itching for a change however. I'm 32 and feel like I've been stuck in a groundhog day since 2019. One friend moved to Germany with his gf. A relative opened her dog grooming salon. My coworker finished her degree and left. Another friend left big city and is living in a cozy homestead with his gf. Another one moved to USA to make art. I see everyone going through changes in their lives while I lived in the same routine for 5 years: wake up at the same time, take the same public transport to the same part of the city to work in the same building with the same people while eating the same food for lunch day after day, week after week, month after month, year  after year. There was no growth at all. I've been doing some IT learning in my free time and I was planning to leave in a year or so once I'm done with it and have my certificates finished. I mostly want to change jobs to give myself a kick in the butt and forcefully drop the routine and to save more money once my certificates are ready. If I leave it would be for a year or two. But I am worried. What if I don't fit in there? What if I fail at new job? What if the team is toxic? Should I stay in my current job until I finish my IT certificates? What if my work/home balance is ruined? What if it's not worth losing a job I like for those extra few ¬£? If I leave during the busy period now I can't come back. I'd be seen as unreliable and bridge burner. Who wants to take back a member of team that left during the worst period of the year?  
How did any of you deal with the guilt of feeling like you're stabbing coworkers that you like very much in the back and potentially leaving them with 40-80+h overtime a month? How have you dealt with the fear of change and failure in the new job? How do you decide if it's worth to quit the job? Is it better to have a lower paid job that you're guaranteed to keep or shoot for better one, but potentially regret at the end? I only have  enough savings  to pay rent/bills for a couple of months and am so conflicted. Haven't slept properly in days.

1erywot,Prioritize location/support or time/career advancement?,"I need advice on a career move

I'm interviewing for a job in robotics with a company that has been contracted by a major company, like top teir company that is a dream job for many. I currently have some robotics experience in an adjacent field and feel I have a decent shot at landing the job. It will be a fairly significant pay increase and the time home will be one of the biggest benefits. I'll be working 4-10's and have Fri, Sat, and Sun off and home every night. Versus what I do now which is a 3 week on and 3 week off rotation which takes me away from home for those three weeks. 

The biggest downside is the requirement to relocate to a city where we don't know anyone and leave our support system of friends and family. We have 3 small children ages 4 and under and can use all the help we can get. Especially when I have to leave my wife for long periods of time. Also the city we would be moving to would be a downgrade as far as schools and quality of life. We are currently in a nice suburb of a major city that has everything you could want for entertainment. The city we would be moving to isn't small but would not be the same. 

The potential job has a much better outlook as far as future employment too as I see robotics growing exponentially in the coming years. My current job is quite stagnant in comparison but still growing. 

Pros: more money and time home

Cons: worse schools and town without friends and family, also selling my house with a 3% interest rate

1erwb5k,32M feeling lost in life and career,"I am a 32 years old unmarried, childless man and I am currently feeling lost in life and career. Therefore, and facing some embarrassment at first, I picked up the courage to seek professional support from a therapist for the first time in my life. Nonetheless, I've decided to post here in order to get additional advice from men who are part of this community.

I think that my current feeling of being lost (or left behind) in life mainly stems from two circumstances: mild bullying which resulted in the inability to fully experience my teenage years if and when I compare them with the ones experienced by my peers and the loss of my father due to cancer when Covid-19 was ravaging in 2020. The first circumstance, in fact, turned me from a quite extroverted and carefree boy into an introverted, overthinking and resentful man while the second one wreaked havoc in my everyday life as I abruptly lost one of the most important people I was attached to in a phase in which everyone is supposed to settle down both personally and professionally. Cancer is basically like having to deal with a time bomb where you cannot see the timer and this puts you face to face with the precariousness of life.

Those events profoundly affected me, as I practically spent my teenage years most of the time alone focusing on my studies and these last years trying to settle down professionally facing great difficulties in both dealing with people (as I work in Sales & Distribution) and life itself. Career-wise, there are days in which I feel completely absorbed by what I am doing and therefore I manage to get things done as expected without having to deal with what my therapist calls ""intrusive thoughts"" and others in which I feel overwhelmed by a hurricane of negative thoughts and sensations about myself and the future ahead of me that make me cry silently on my pillow as soon as I get home at the end of the day. The sales-related job I am currently holding, paired with the psychological status I'm confronting lately, can be really challenging as it's basically all about constant interaction with existing / prospective clients and bringing in results for the company. You and your team are at the forefront of the company and partly responsible for its annual turnover, therefore you are subject to both internal and external pressure as far as targets, margins and the like are taken into account by superiors and management.

I deeply regret the fact of not having been able to experience love in its blossoming, intense and raw nature during my teenage years, unlike my peers, the fact that those times and hangouts will never come back again thus leaving a deep scar inside my heart and lastly, the fact that I am very often going to be at unease in social settings when acquaintances/colleagues/clients/prospects etc. discuss about their family, children and career prospects. At the same time I also drastically reduced the amount of time I spend on social media as people just seem to share the good things in their lives, but I always try to take any opportunity to hang around my friends and family members, even if some of them are starting a family and this makes me feel at unease as I previously explained. Going out for dinner/ a movie/ a play at the theatre all by myself is too much for me to handle and, quite frankly, humiliating at the moment. Casually going out for some drinks or travelling instead, are more manageable activities but come with some strain as well.

Sometimes I take into account the option of a career change into less people-oriented positions like the ones in IT for example, but I don't feel skilled or driven enough to restart everything from scratch... I'd like to become more optimistic and resilient in order not to find myself alone and hopeless as I reach maturity and retirement. Are there career coaches or people holding sales, HR or management positions who could give me some advice? Thank you for your help and please forgive me if I made some mistakes but I am not a native English speaker.",Musingcountryman091,2,0.75,2,1723624008,2024-08-14 08:26:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1erwb5k/32m_feeling_lost_in_life_and_career/,8,2024

I am currently working as a production manager handling 6 different brands at my company. Im bascially in charge of ensuring 1.4 million units are being shipped on time. I have some support but she is only helping me for 4 of the brands which equates to 600,000 of those units.

I have a lot of stress, and late-night calls 3 times a week with the factories. My salary is 87K, which is the average range for a production manager in apparel.

I've been in production for 5 years now, but have noticed a pattern of late work hours with insignificant pay. Very high turnover as well. And the grunt of the work always pushed to me.

I am already so tired and stressed from this field of work. I broke last week because of it was so hectic. I found out my only help will be going on maternity leave in a few months and I have not been provided a temp. They told me there are data entry associates I can use to support me in the meantime. (this is mostly for PO updates etc.).

Anyway, I broke and talked to my manager and told her i want to apply to an open role as a supply chain planning analyst. I had talked to the planning team about the new role and they mentioned they dont work crazy hours.

It's true, i have seen it for myself. They even tell me that they had previous coworkers who were studying while working full-time because of the free time they had.

Anyway what im trying to get at is this.¬†**Is it worth taking a 17,000 dollar salary cut to regain my sanity and mental health?**

I can move up the ladder and become a senior planner. BTW the salary for this role is higher at other companies, it's just a little lower at my current company. So essentially I can stay here and get promoted to senior role and transfer somewhere else to get a 110,000+ salary.

It feels beneficial to my future in the long run. Although, when I told my family and friends, they told me it was not a good idea.

I am 26! I am so young, I think now is the right time to do it.

Also, i am okay financially to take the pay cut.

I'm on a new contract in the same company but a different department. I love this new department as I came from a call center in the previous department. This new one is more laid back, no excessive time watching/keeping, no micromanaging, not a lot of meetings, and most of all no dealing with customers on the phone‚Ä¶just all projects and I'm learning a great deal. It is such a nice change and has lessened my stress and anxiety, which I desperately needed.

The problem is the previous department now has a full time permanent position available and before my contract ended, the management assured me they would let me know when an opening is available. Well they did and I got several of teams messages with everyone wanting me to come back. However, I really don't think I want to, but at the same time, l would be a fool not to take a permanent job with benefits, I guess, right?

My last mind was to not apply, as my current contract I have many months left on it and in the interim, my plan was to get certification in another field I have experience in and then look for permanent work in that field Yet, we know how life is and things don‚Äôt always go planned.

I submitted an application at the last minute for the permanent role out of guilt, feeling pressured and anxiousness and thinking I'd be ungrateful after that team pushed for me to get hired on. However, now I want to back out. I dread having to go back. It's not necessarily horrible and toxic but not anything I want to go back to. I really really want to stay on the team I'm with, it‚Äôs a better fit for me but it's not permanent. I've quite anxious going back and forth deciding what to do.

Any advice?",ready4paradise,2,1.0,0,1723600392,2024-08-14 01:53:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1erpi8r/proceed_with_temp_job_or_take_permanent/,8,2024
1erpcae,Seeking Advice: HR Professional Considering a Move Back to Spain (or Other Spanish-Speaking Countries),"Hi everyone,

I'm currently working in HR and have accumulated about 5.5 years of experience in the field, mostly in onboarding, hiring, and HR coordinator roles. A couple of years ago, I found myself at a crossroads‚Äîconsidering a career change to teaching but also itching to travel. I decided to take a leap and became a Language Assistant in Spain for a year. It was an incredible experience, but due to personal reasons, I had to return to the U.S. and found another HR role here.

Now that I've been back for almost two years, I'm feeling that familiar urge to shake things up again. While I do enjoy working in HR (for the most part), I'm considering making a move back to Spain, but this time I'd like to work as an HR Coordinator for a Spanish company. I'm also open to other Spanish-speaking countries, such as Costa Rica.

I'm planning to get my SHRM-CP certification early next year to strengthen my qualifications. However, I admit that my Spanish skills have decreased since leaving Madrid. I'm set to start meeting with a language partner next month, and I currently consider myself at a low B1 level.

This is a sincere question, and I‚Äôd appreciate any advice:

1. Would it be feasible for me to secure an HR role in Spain or another Spanish-speaking country given my background and upcoming SHRM-CP certification?
2. Are there any work exchange type opportunities in Spain or other Spanish-speaking countries that I might not be aware of?

Any insights from those who have made a similar transition, or who are familiar with the job market in these regions, would be greatly appreciated!",jstax10,1,1.0,0,1723599908,2024-08-14 01:45:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1erpcae/seeking_advice_hr_professional_considering_a_move/,8,2024

I performed team lead duties, as well as managed a pretty significant project for our team (essentially 2 full time jobs with little help - learning everything on the fly).

4 months ago there was some restructuring and I moved to another team, with the plan that I would take over as lead. I've had several conversations with my new manager about this but nothing is happening (just being told to hang in there). The hiring/promotional freezes have been lifted, and I'm not getting promoted. I'm getting a little frustrated as I'm seeing people from other teams get promotions, title changes, etc.

I know things in the corporate world can take a long time, but I'm having a hard time ""hanging in there"" when they should be paying me an extra 20k per year.

I really don't want to leave my job, but at this point it's not off the table. I got comfortable and let my technical certifications expire. I could be ready to start a full on job search in about 4 months after I get re-certified.

**Your Work Personality Strengths**

Your career test reveals your¬†**high energy and enthusiasm**¬†and your¬†**ability to motivate**¬†others, which makes you¬†**naturally inclined to be a leader**. Yet, you are unique in that your leadership style is not consumed with controlling others. Likewise, you do not like being controlled.



You lead by utilizing your¬†**strong understanding of others,**¬†and this gives you the ability to effectively match other people's talents and abilities with appropriate tasks or projects that fit them.  
  
You tend to have numerous interests at the same time and are highly capable of juggling many interests (or passions) at once.

You do, however, require a little more appreciation and approval from others. But, you also enjoy giving this approval and appreciation as well.

You have a genuine interest and insight into others and find you are most¬†**energized when interacting with people**.

- Allows you to be more efficient by giving you a clear understanding of the goal before starting the project.

- Helps you avoid routine and allows you to delegate the details of an assignment you find tedious.

1erohb9,Received a poor performance review ,"I have a double major in accounting and business information system. I graduated in 2018 and have since been doing accounting roles such as AP or AR mostly transaction. Nothing big like forecasting or budgeting. 

I have always been working in contract positions and struggled to get full time jobs. Most of them only need filler roles for short periods and I used them to stay active and get whatever experience I could instead of having a large career gap.  

I had a lot of toxic environment work place experiences. However, This year I joined a large FMG company and was enjoying the role as its flexible and friendly I got the role through a childhood friend. Who is really close to my current manager. The current role is more than a transactional role and includes month end reporting and budgeting/forecasting things i have no background on. 

Recently due to a lot of familial stress, and in general lack of understand around certain areas, I have been making mistakes and felt that they were frequent. I also slowly noticed I was being allocated less work. We are a team of three with me and another girl who are Assistant Accounts and one girl in the accounts clerk role and then my manager. 

Although I was making mistakes there was rushed or minimal training on certain documents. I tired my best to complete them but naturally had areas that were lacking. Some mistakes were simply dumb on my part messing up coding for journals etc. 

  
I am on a 12 month contract and recently asked my manager if my contract would be extended. She then asked me how I am finding the role. So I responded I was enjoying it and learning a lot. 

But then she outright said the following: 

""you are highest paid in the group but I feel you do not understand even Dr and Cr in accounting. You make a lot of mistakes and I find it easier to give it to the other girls who are lower pay then you they are faster as well. I feel you rush to finish and make mistakes. I think you should consider if accounting is the area for you."" 

regarding the pay - when applying I simply filled in my desired pay for the role. And HR accepted without questions or negotiating with me. During the interview I said I am from transactional background and am interesting in learning more and developing. 

  
I was a little bit surprised and hurt with the way she worded it. In general my manager is super nice and friendly almost motherly. And I appreciate her honestly because even I was feeling down that i was making silly mistakes. I wanted to keep the job so I was trying my best to work with my collogues and fix whatever knowledge gap I had. I felt sometimes if they asked questions she received it better then when I asked. Almost as if my salary created a higher expectation. My manager was also part of the interview process. 

  
Although I am aware I had areas to improve, I expected some sort of development plan or advice like further training or get someone who is in the role longer to review my work for a before sending to my manager. But an out right decision on whether the role is right was quite shocking for me. She said she will only extended my contract after seeing how I go for the remaining 5 months. But I barely have tasks compared to the others. 

Initially I was trained on tasks with everyone did everything once and then never given a chance to do it again. The expectations from me weren't really clear I was told by my friend who was in my role previously that I was originally hired for the system transition. Which I was doing well in and got a nomination in our quarterly finance for my work well done. But the person in charge of the project took a mental health leave and since been away. After which my role has been super unclear and I have been going of adhoc assignments or asking outright when I had nothing to do. 

Do you think this situation is fair? 

Although her comments did hurt they are helpful, as I know I need to hone my attention to detail more. But I am considering as she said if I should stay in this career path. My experience with accounting in frank words has been shit.

I'm a 31 years old man and for the past 9 years I've been working in a warehouse in a small boring town in England, lately as a team leader. Quite a comfortable job, making ¬£33k a year. I am a Romanian immigrant, I don't have any studies, qualifications or skills, I didn't even graduate high school.

  
While it might be obvious why I feel like I've wasted my life so far, this year I want to start my GCSEs for Maths and English, after which I intend to follow a open university.

  
My ideal goal is to get to work remotely and travel the world a bit while working from wherever I want, since I am quite fed up with the English weather. My girlfriend is currently studying business and marketing in university for the same purpose. 

  
I don't really have any passion that I would like to follow for a career. There are so many courses and career paths that I could start with a open university, that I don't know what to choose. I don't really care what it is I would do as long as it pays decent and allows me to work remotely and travel.

  
So here comes my question, as the title says...Which would be the best career path for remote work and ability to travel while working? Those of you who got to do this...what studies did you follow? What do you do? What is your advice for someone like me?

1erna3i,Are there viable alternate careers for a 41M food services director? ,"My partner 41M has been feeling trapped in his career path, and is struggling to find positions he can apply for with the experience he currently has. He has been working as a Regional Director for a food services provider. The company he works for assigns him to specific clientele to work with. Previously he his client was a financial/banking institution. He was recently ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù to work with a financial technology company. His company tends to smell the blood in the water every time he attempts to leave, and provides him with a ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù which includes a pay bump, potential change in the client he‚Äôs working with, but no change in title. He says that he feels like this job pigeonholes people into very niche areas, preventing them from leaving or moving up. His complaints include complete lack of professional boundaries from colleagues, as well as clients; virtually no work-life balance, (he‚Äôs expected to drop everything for any call/email regardless of the urgency or if he‚Äôs on vacation); and no accountability from any department including his higher-ups and middle managers. He finds they people are willing to take credit for work they haven‚Äôt done, and throw innocent parties under the bus when they feel the goings getting tough. He takes home ~$200k, but he‚Äôs willing to take a pay cut. We live in the Bay Area in California. 

His resume includes these points (details have been redacted for privacy):

* Facilitated the reduction of overall product costs by 12% in the first 90 days of oversight in a $35 million subsidized portfolio. ¬†
* Grew portfolio revenue from $11.3 million to $18.6 million by acquiring two new locations, expanding the catering program, and securing a 5-year contract extension.
* Facilitated the acquisition of two new locations, generating an additional $2 million in revenue. 
* Enhanced the catering program through rebranding, restructuring services, and reconceptualizing the brand. 
* Successfully negotiated a 5-year extension on the client contract, ensuring continued partnership and stability. 
* Established strategic partnerships within the local Bay Area market to enhance brand visibility and collaboration. ¬†
* Improved food safety ratings from third-party safety officers from consistently low levels to 4-5, demonstrating a commitment to quality and compliance. ¬† 
* Successfully reduced turnover from 14% to 7% by implementing effective retention strategies and fostering a positive work environment.

Although he‚Äôs been applying for operational management type of jobs, he feels like his experience doesn‚Äôt translate into viable, stable job options. 

His highest level of education is a BS in Biology, which he received in 2008.

He‚Äôs considering getting an MBA, but I‚Äôm not sure if that will help boost him out of this rut or give him more opportunities. 

* What kinds of jobs could he be eligible for with the credentials/experience he currently has?
* Would any kind of further education or certification be necessary/worth it? 
* Does his resume require more/less? 
* What kinds of programs would be worth looking into, if any? 
* Any and all advice is appreciated.

1ern9g1,Can I work two positions at the same company?,"Hello Reddit,

I recently began a new role as a Mechanical Engineer two months ago, a long-standing career goal of mine. I am currently enjoying the work and have been actively involved in training to temporarily assume the role of Production Analyst. I am already performing most of the responsibilities associated with this role and could quickly learn the remaining tasks. This opportunity has been a valuable learning experience and keeps me actively engaged.

Today, the Plant Manager and the current Production Analyst proposed that I officially take over the Production Analyst position. I find both roles fulfilling and am hesitant to choose between them. Ideally, I would like to pursue both roles, although I am unsure if this is a feasible option.

My concern is that managing both positions might be excessively demanding, despite my preference for remaining busy and avoiding downtime. My role as a Mechanical Engineer is a training position lasting a year and a half, so I would continue to gain engineering experience while also acquiring skills as a Production Analyst. Given my relative youth and the possibility that I may not stay with this company long-term, despite their positive treatment, I wonder if having the title of ""Engineer"" would be more advantageous for my future career compared to the Production Analyst role.

1ern8qc,I do the work of 3 full time jobs and got a $1/hour raise,"
I‚Äôm 24 years old (lives in Ontario, Canada) and i started a job in an optometry clinic as a Vision Therapist. Having a very athletic background and previous knowledge of Physiotherapy (did not complete schooling due to COVID and had to start working to help my family make ends meet) as well as deep connections with local sports organizations . My current boss hired me to grow in an up and coming field that is Vision Therapy. This field is pretty evolved around the world however only a few locations practice in my province. 

I started at $18/hour with the promise to be full time and become certified. Fast forward 8 months, my boss currently has me taking on responsibilities which are way more than my original job duties Such as; cleaning of the clinic (mopping and the garbages), Patient Care Coordinator, and I now have been tasked with cleaning up and managing all things to do with contact lenses (within a week of doing it, i found errors in our pricing which explains why our contacts would lose money. This change would make the company approx 60-80k extra per year), i am in charge of contact lens teaches as well. all things that would be done by a certified optician. and of course i continue my Vision Therapy duties. 

I brought all this up to my boss, i wrote all my achievements and valid reasons i deserve a raise in the $24/hour range. (A certified optician alone would make somewhere in the $28/hour range). I just had a meeting today where she said she acknowledges everything i do, but she will only give me $19/hour because of where the company is currently. (She owns it and does very well) but we will have a meeting in September to set up a plan for the future.

Previously she mentioned i would be running the Vision Therapy spanning other locations down the road. I‚Äôm really stuck and don‚Äôt know what to do as even my coworkers said i deserve way more.

1ern44e,Should I quit my perfectly fine part time retail job to work in a brand new fast casual food place for the possibility of making more money?,"Ok here‚Äôs the long wall of context. I (17M) currently work at Target, I‚Äôll say the names of the companies because my post history references them, but I‚Äôll try not to doxx myself while I‚Äôm at.

The job is good, stable, pays well and the management is nice. Minimum wage is 15.69 in my state and this Target is paying me 16.75 hourly. Unlike the posts you‚Äôd see at¬†[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/), my store is great at meeting my desired hours and working with my ever changing availability. My availability for the upcoming school year has already been approved and my job will work well with my busy schedule full of senior year responsibilities. I‚Äôve honestly never had a job this easy and great, and my only complaint might be the boredom (work in tech department, when there is no truck shipment there is literally nothing to do all day).

Yesterday I applied to a Brazilian fast casual food stall that‚Äôs opening at my local mall, purely out of boredom/curiosity, and to my surprise they called me back and said they‚Äôre willing to interview this week as they‚Äôre opening next week. I asked the manager about the pay and she told me it‚Äôs 15 an hour + tips. (In my state it is totally legal to pay food workers less than minimum if tips will make up for it). She told me that in other locations with the brand, tips are around an additional 13-14 dollars per hour per attendant, I applied to a customer facing attendant role. I told her I needed a day to think about it, but she told me that I needed to respond tomorrow. I speak English, Portuguese, and Spanish so languages will not be a problem at this new job.

Here are problems that might arise with working at the new Brazilian food place.

1. The pay might not reflect what I was told in the phone call.
2. The new job might not work well with my availability, I will have a lot of homework and other responsibilities my senior year. I might have to lose sleep many nights.
3. The location is going to be LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT to my old job. I used to work at chick fil a and the job was shit, the managers there know my opinion about the job, and so maybe seeing them everyday now might be a little awkward. I also told myself that I would never go back to food service when I got hired at Target, cause CFA was such a hellhole. It is by far the busiest location at my mall and the lines frequently extend past the food court, no exaggeration.

My current job is really chill and I really enjoy it, I much prefer retail over fast food.

Reasons are that I work nights 4 days a week and always overworked because things keep changing at Amazon. Also, I never have time for friends because my schedule is wonky for my free time. I'm starting work soon at a different department to do order picking, but how will my experience especially with Amazon appeal to companies like Costco?

1erm601,Finished my Google Project Management certification ‚Ä¶now what,"I‚Äôm really desperate to get out of my current position in the restaurant industry - I‚Äôm tired of the people and the hours. So I decided I‚Äôd try and get the quickest education I could and settled on Google‚Äôs Project management certification. 

The two problems:
1. I have basically no network. I basically interact with 5 people outside of work per week - my chiropractor and his receptionist, my former employee boyfriend and probably two grocery store cashiers. Nobody who can really help me get a job. 

2. I don‚Äôt have entry level skills. I‚Äôve been in leadership for over 3 years and I‚Äôve cracked $60k the past two years. I‚Äôm ok with the Office suite, I type above average, regularly hit 97% on data entry tests and am also a proficient French speaker. All skills required of $30k entry level positions, with anything making comparable money requiring a degree and 3-5 years of experience (and apparently the restaurant leadership doesn‚Äôt count).

I having a trouble landing my first job as a full stack developer or backend developer (specially .NET or Java) 

I've been searching for a job for 3 months now , i got some interviews but it didn't work for different reasons , I am really in a bad need for money, i need to leave my parents house because i am 25-years old and i still can't go out with my friends without my parents permission i need to ask if i want to buy a bar of chocolate because obviously i don't have any money :)!
And my dad won't let me work for anything except something he saw promising (customer service , waiter, etc. Is not allowed) that's why i decided to shift my career and work in tech so i can work anywhere and get paid even if he didn't allow me to ( like remotely or something) so i can have my own money and just leave. 

I am 25 years now and still have no life! no friends! no privacy! no money! nothing. 
I am writing this when i just lost all of my hope seeing people and all of my college's friends happy and moving on with their lives and i am still stuck where i am. (ps: i graduated 2 years ago)


I would really appreciate any kind of help or advice or recommending companies or ways will help me relocate anywhere ( i am living in the middle east) or help me get my first job so i can secure a stable source of money and move.

1erkuuk,Do I let the anxiety win? ,"Hey all,

  
So I've worked jobs with some what ""none traditional"" work settings. I work with my family from High School through College. We own a restaurant so I was offered luxuries such has hours/days off. After graduating College I started working as a Case Worker for the local mental health authority. It was hybrid so I started and ended my days from home and all my appointments were in the community. I was never in the office. After 4 years I began working as a College advisor. This was going to be my 1st traditional be at the office 8-5 job but the pandemic happened so I worked remote/hybrid for 3 years. In 2023 we started going to the office full time. My anxiety has been crazy and now I'm considering leaving. I don't like the job all that much. I do really want to leave but I'm afraid I won't find something in the same salary rage. I have a savings and have already identified areas I can cut back so I know I'll be ok financially. I have also started applying for remote jobs. I've been out on FMLA for 12 weeks and it's time to go back but I'm strongly considering not going back. I don't want to let the anxiety win but I also don't feel fulfilled and I don't see anymore opportunities to grow with the company right now. Resigning makes me feel like I'm failing even if its for good reasons. Any advise? Thanks for reading.



PS: I'm 33/M. I have a BA in Psychology and a BS in Health and Human Performance. Single, no kids. Just me and my pup so this decision doesn't impact anyone but me.

1erjrwy,Owner cares more about kids softball than his company,"I am second in command at a small design/build firm. I do not have any ownership, but helped build this company from the ground up. We are in year 7 now, with about $1.5MM in sales and 7 employees. My boss‚Äô daughter is now doing travel softball, and it has consumed his life. He coaches her team and just joined on to assist at a private high school. They travel a week at a time and did 5 tournaments this summer. Summer is our busy season, and I am tasked with running everything while he is away with no increase in pay in 2 years, and talks that there isn‚Äôt room right now for an increase. I do all designs, sales, and project management for $65k a year. I feel like if he spent more time working on the company, he would see where we can improve and profits could grow. 

Am I being unreasonable? Should he not care more about this company than he does softball? He will drop everything to help out on the fields and leave us high and dry. I don‚Äôt want to leave because I‚Äôve put so much into this company, but honestly don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep going. I have two kids as well, and understand being there for them, but the amount of time and energy spent on a sport is above anything I‚Äôve seen before.

1eriuof,Is it worth it to consider this job?,"So I've been trying to break into Data Analysis. I've learned a lot from the google certificate.

I've been applying to entry level roles just to get a feel for it. I was surprised when one gave me a phone interview. I have some transferrable skills. I've worked with Data in a contact center environment. I work in the financial industry with a lot of spreadsheets and sometimes data.

Anyways, this role is basically what I make currently, 60k.

Looked up the company, it looks like they have a rather outdated business model and are struggling to adapt. They have mixed reviews on Glassdoor and Indeed.Most everyone seems to say the company has great people and work life balance. A lot of griping about turnover and layoffs, low pay.

I don't know how stable my current role is. It's definitely not rock solid. Plenty of work that we do is being automated and offshored, and there's an uncertain future for our group.

It sounds like they want to just toss you out there with minimal training and see if you sink or swim. The recruiter gave me a lot of detail. She said it would start with owning a specific system of customer contact information and working with one of their vendors on that data.

But then they want to expand it into Adhoc projects.

It seems to have generous PTO, and 7 hour days for a salary job, which I've never heard of anyone doing.

It sounded promising, she claimed she only had one other person to phone screen and they didn't answer the call. I wonder if it's because they look like a bit of a sinking ship from the outside.

If I managed to get through a year how big could the payoff be? Does a year hands on even mean anything in terms of getting a better paid role?

Where to go from here?,"Here's some background about my current situation: I graduated in December 2021 with Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a concentration in marketing. Worked at dominos for a few months while looking for a job. Hadn't had any luck for a few months so ended up taking the first job that offered me a position. It was position at a local non profit that consisted of assisting with basic digital marketing (social media content creation, email, etc.) and creating and managing fundraising events. Started at $16 hr in a high cost of living area, now up to $19 with 2 and a half years under my belt. I am more than ready to move on from this job as I have learned as much as I can and there's no room for growth. I am also kind of sick of working in the non profit world. Have been actively searching for a job since January and tbh there hasn't been much relevant job postings in my area relating to my events and marketing experience. I applied to two jobs somewhat early on in my search that I thought my experience applied extremely well to and the interviewers seemed to agree because I made it through three rounds of interviews to the final stage and both times they picked someone else. Other than that, there were a few other relevant jobs I applied to but didn't make it past the initial phone call or in person interview. I know I could do those jobs but they just didn't pick me. It feels like people who are way over qualified are gobbling up entry level jobs that pay average at best for my high cost of living area. I'm just frustrated and at a loss of what I should do next. I've been thinking about taking a Google ads certification course to boost my resume and skill set in that area but I don't know. I feel like I'm overqualified for the job I have now and that I'm not gaining any valuable transferable skills. I'm almost 26 and I feel like I'm getting left behind career wise.

His words prove that commitment is a thousand times more important than whether you love what you do or not! May we understand this!

1ere4cd,Do I choose prestige or salary/location,"Hello fellow redditors. Boy do I have a dilemma for you:

On the one hand, I‚Äôm currently working in finance at a okay-sized but growing firm in the US (think 1000-2000 employees). The salary is not the best (I am also a recent grad) but the culture and my team are cool. The work itself is relatively boring but there is a good wlb.

On the other hand, I shall be interviewing for another role in a developing country (aka my home country). It is a big and very prestigious global company (like top of the top in the field). But since it is not in the US the salary is even lower than my current gig and other benefits (401k, Amazon delivery, McDonalds etc.) are not available. But I‚Äôd be closer to my family and old friends, which is important to me (and saves on rent). It‚Äôs worth noting that I will have the ability to come back to the US if wanted.

My question is what should I do? Or perhaps better asked, what would you do?

1ercojf,Need objective advise about a possible career switch.,"Hello everyone, this is the first time Im posting in this sub. Im currently having a hard time making a decision. Some context first;  
I work as a **Technical Architect** for a large software company (everyones favorite CRM), and recently been contacted by one of my ex-bosses at some other company to join him, in a much smaller company (regional bank with about 2 billion net income). I've known the guy for many years, 10 plus years, and he reached because he wants me help with some tech transformation efforts.  

At my **current job** the pros: 

* High base salary + RSU + bonus
* unlimited PTO
* Fully remote.
* Very good Health Insurance ($100 a month PPO with very low deductible)

The cons:

* Close to zero opportunity for promotion in the next year or two
* very fast pace changing environment, had 9 managers in 2 years.
* The role I have is the one of a consultant, I do technical advising to our customers, Im part of the profesional services org, and my performance is measured on the amount of hours billed to customers on a yearly basis.

The opportunity Im being offered does not look good financially, pretty much they are offering

* Same Base pay, same bonus, and some RSU (they cant match what I get today)
* 21 days of accrued PTO per year
* 3 days in the office
* Somewhat good health insurance (\~$500 a month PPO, low deductible)

The only pro, I would be getting, is that I would be a Senior Manager at the company, reporting 1 level down the CIO, and would be given the technology transformation efforts that pertain to Artificial Intelligence ( I have a **M.Sc.** in AI), and thats it. So in short, a appealing title, and nice projects that align more closely with my degree.

I would like to hear some objective thoughts about this, because he is a friend and might getting in the way of making a decision cause I know him, and Im partial to liking work with him.

1ercem0,How to not let something my manager said affect my confidence and work?,"Hi all, not sure if this is the correct place but wanted to get some advice on how to handle something my manager said. Long story short, I (28F) have been having an extremely hard time mentally and have been working through things in therapy that have made me more sensitive. Over the course of a few (6+) months, there were 2 times when I couldn't handle my emotions and started crying on calls - obviously was and still am mortified about it. A few weeks later my manager mentioned that he heard I have been ""emotional"" and proceeded to give me unsolicited advice on why I ""have to reel it back in"" and how he ""sometimes wants to choke people out, but can't do that"" .... On top of this, since I have been here there have been quite a few times that my manager has talked negatively about my colleagues to me - I never participate and from the beginning I realized how wildly inappropriate it is, but that it is very normal in the industry... And now I'm starting to wonder what else has been said about me that I don't even know about. Given all the unsolicited information that has been shared with me about my colleagues, there's no doubt in my mind that a million other things have been said. 



Prior to this, my job was the one thing keeping me afloat and was a distraction from everything in my personal life, but now I feel so deeply insecure and ridiculed and can't get it out of my head (whether it's real or imagined). Any advice on how to recover from this? I want to talk to my manager about how much it affected me but I won't be able to without breaking down, not to mention I could definitely see it making things worse.

1eraz0u,Advice needed on whether to take job offer,"Hi! New here but I'm in need of advice. I just started a new job in March. Last week, another local company reached out to me and told me they were interested in me. I told them due to my short tenure at my current job, the only thing that could really tempt me to move would be a significant salary jump. They came back with a $25k/yr bump. I am now super conflicted. I do plan on asking my current job to match that but there is a good chance they won't. 

My resume currently shows the following:
Company A 2013-2015 
Took a break from 2015-2020 to stay home with my kids, moved cross country, also got my masters
Company B 2021- 2024
Company C March 2024- present

The professional community in my field is really small so I absolutely do not want to burn any bridges. I'm also wary of having such a short stint on my resume. Plus, guilt, because I'm the only one who knows how to use a specialized, vital software in my office and one of three in the entire friggin company so I would be leaving my current company in the lurch. 

But, money. An extra $2k a month would help so much. I do realize if I took this new job, I wouldn't be able to leave for at least 3 years minimum.

1er7j6g,"I've been a barber for 10+ years, I've had enough; but training in something else seems so daunting. ","I trained in hairdressing/barbering when I left school, in college (in the UK that is at 16yrs). I completed the 3 year course and transitioned to a salon that had a barbering section when I finished. 
This salon was in a relatively small village and wasn't the best employer, so when I had an opportunity to work at a busier barbershop in the local city I jumped at the chance.
After being there 5 years, the owners ideas changing resulting in all of the then current staff leaving over a small period of time. 
I was one of the first to jump as I'd built up a very good loyal customer base so I decided I'd take the leap to mobile. After a year of mobile I decided that the juice wasn't worth the squeeze in terms of driving all over the city for a little extra than shop price and it not working for many clients.
Now I'm in a shop the city again, and its getting busier but I'm feeling so burnt out with this job as the potential for earning is so low as haircuts aren't expensive but you get high street shops that are awful charging half the price that we do. A mix of feeling undervalued and some clients remarking the price (""I can get it done for ¬£X down the road"" fyi around ¬£20 is deemed a higher price in my area) has got me feeling like there is a very limited upward trajectory. (I have debts that need paying and my current earnings aren't touching them, which in turns feels like my whole life is stagnant but the years keep moving.)

I'd like to retrain in something that has good earning potential but I'm in my 30s and that doesn't really seem feasible. 

Has anyone had experience switching from a labour intensive job into a more desk based, online form of work. Or even physical work that is worth more than people deem haircuts to be worth. For example I have done research into physiotherapy/personal training suited to specific niches, i.e mobility, biomechanics as these would be something I'm already slightly versed in. Another example would be the software route, whether that be engineering, design or something data related. 

Apologies for the rant, this is the first time I've articulated how I feel on this matter properly. 

TLDR; sick of not earning enough money to live as a barber, looking for advice to switching to something with better earning potential.

1er740g,22F either going through grass is greener syndrome or quarter life crisis?,"Not sure if this is the right place on reddit to ask but here goes...

**How does one go about evaluating their values and initiating action to align a life with these values?**

I am Aus based for reference.

Pretty early on in life I decided that I wanted to have to travel, work internationally and be financially independent. I steered toward a career in medicine due to my fascination with human bio at school, good grades, the ability to be your own boss and earn a pretty good income, where effort = income, as opposed to corporate gigs where I correlated higher level of responsibility/management = more pay = more hours + less WLB.

Before starting med, I divulged in a bit of travel and introspection and thought that I decided that I would be honored/grateful to be in a career that helps people + communities through their most vulnerable times, thus went into med with the idea that I would become a holistic/lifestyle primary care doctor.

I am just a bit over halfway into my med degree. While I generally enjoy my medical classes - I don't really enjoy the placements, which introspectively is probably because I lack any kind of autonomy or real contribution in my capacity as a student.

Becoming wary of my school classmates in different careers now graduating + the long study slog that lay ahead, in addition to my 20s slowly trickling by + my passion for medicine dying down, my priorities for my career felt like they changed...

A WFH gig sounds lovely, this probably is not going to be attainable in my career until I hit my late 20s/early 30s and if I manage to mitigate all of the indemnity/medicolegal red tape that comes with running a virtual clinic, OR completely pivot and gun for a non-clinical career in pharma or adjacent.

Working overseas for a decent salary is not really an option given the licensing restrictions of most countries internationally, unless I decide to do volunteering.

In short, I value intellectually stimulating work, decent renumeration and autonomy both professionally and geographically in my career, at this point in time, and would like to enjoy this in my 20s before wanting to have a family and be more permanent somewhere. I would really like the opportunity to live in a global city and feel like I'm missing out on that experience staying in my home regional town to study.

I am realizing how much this career will ask of me and I wonder if I would have been better off putting my effort and energy into something that will allow a bit more flexibility and freedom in my 20s? 18 yo me would have either done healthcare or biz/finance or international relations but chose the former due to the reasons I outlined earlier. I really enjoyed math at school and was toying with the idea of studying ML or quant trading recently but I know nothing about the reality of this field.

I've approached my careers counsellor at university who has been unhelpful and only suggested pursuing a masters.

How does one align a career to their professional and personal values? I feel like there is a bit of disconnect between mine currently. Am I too disillusioned of the reality of life and a career?

1er6mnc,Negotiate an ‚Äúunusual‚Äù PTO request as a fairly young professional of 4-5 weeks,"I love travel, i grew up traveling with my parents, I love visiting family. I've been post grad for three years and my job had a pretty decent pto policy in comparison to most at 15 days pto which included sick leave and 7 holidays. The office was closed after Christmas so if you didn't have enough left you could take that week unpaid although I never did as I tried desperately to save as much as I could so that taking a longer international 2 week trip would be possible one day. Only 40 hours could rollover.

Unfortunately, now that I'm in a relationship my vacation time is split between two families which ends up leaving practically none for any sort of travel. I rarely get sick but I don't take any sick leave and go to work not feeling my best simply to not waste days that I need for the future. 

Long weekends and holidays add up and were often missed at this role bc Easter and Christmas Eve weren't holidays MLK day too. 

When my company was acquired they moved to 10 days vacation 5 days of sick leave. Office is open after Christmas. A notably worse policy imo. Unpaid leave was not allowed until all pto was exhausted and then required advance notice and permission. 

Now that I'm looking for new jobs I'm really wanting to get something that's less conventional and obviously would be willing to have my salary reflect that. I'd like 5 weeks. Even if that means some of it is unpaid But I know most places are not flexible on pto and base it on tenure.

What would be the best way to negotiate this? I'd obviously love to have my pto request and a decent salary but would also be apt to have the option of unpaid leave or a lower salary for more time. Running the numbers of course to not make less than I currently do. (Although I have a masters degree, my industry is very much low pay)

 I'm probably never going to own a home, I don't really want kids with my spouse and we just really want to travel and live our life while we can and it's frustrating that a job in the industry prevents that solely so I can work more. 

Before you tell me I'm lazy or asking too much or gen z and wanting a lot...my wife is from the uk and works remotely for a company there that offers her over 7 weeks of paid vacation. She graduated with her degree last year. That was her starting policy, her salary reflects the local market and she keeps the vacation.

1er6h9c,Quit from Internship,"So, i'm doing hotel management and had an internship offer from the uni. It was a 9hr job at the administration/front desk, thought it is not the dept i want to specialize in. but i was excited nd eager to experience new stuff. but within 3-4 days of working there, i had to quit due to my health. 

at first i asked the HR if there's any chance i cud work for 5-6hrs rather than 9hrs cuz my body isn't able to cope up with the long working hrs. the HR said it's the hotel policy nd since my health condition is serious, it's better for me to take care of myself rather than complicating it further. I discussed about this with others as well nd they too said if it's gonna cost ur health, its better to not go. So I quit. 

I feel like maybe i shudn't hv quit but at the same time, i didn't want my health to get more complicated than it is now. I am confused and don't know what to do now. Is the decision I made right? Is it ok to quit from an internship with only 3-4 days of working there? Is it ok to work in this industry with health issues like Chron's (IBD)?

1er6h8p,Did I mess up with recruiter?,"I was contacted by a recruiter for a role at a large company. The same day (weird timing), my friend connected me with someone else in another dept at that company. This was more for an informal chat/connect than an interview. 

The recruiter put me forward for the first role and I did the interview. Meanwhile I scheduled time to chat with the second person. I told the recruiter this situation and they said they thought they would have feedback soon from the first interview so just schedule
the call with the second person in a few days, because they would definitely have feedback for me before I talked to this person. I asked if the role was confidential or should I share that I had interviewed. They said, do the meeting and no need to bring it up because we should have feedback for you before you do the meeting anyway. 

Well, I didn‚Äôt get feedback before the second meeting. When I did the call with the second person, she said that she and the other interviewer connected the dots that I had spoken to them already and that‚Äôs the reason I hadn‚Äôt gotten feedback yet. They were waiting to see how this second convo went and then put their heads together about where I might fit. 

I was not trying to be deceptive at all - I just thought the second conversation was an informal one. And I even talked to the recruiter about it. 

I thought about writing to them a follow up note to share more specific thoughts on what dept I am interested in, but truthfully, the second convo was not for a specific position so I can‚Äôt even really assess. So I probably just need to see what they come back to me with. 

Any thoughts on how I could have handled this better or what would be best to do next?

1er419x,How to deal with boss's lies? ,"I'm having ongoing issues in my workplace that have been going on for a year now, I finally handed in my notice last week. 

My manager thinks I shouldn't burn bridges as it's a small field and she is right. However, call it stupidity or moral scrupulosity, I cannot let my boss continue to lie without saying anything. Integrity is a core value in our job as scientists and healthcare professionals. 

I have written down everything that has happened to me since starting for legal reasons, and I've been in touch with HR and unions. However, my boss continues to recount his version of events which contain some outright lies. He claims I came to him demanding an automatic promotion early on in our discussions, which is categorically untrue and makes me out to be entitled throughout this whole dispute and makes him out to be nothing but reasonable. I have corrected him every time he has made this point - including in an in-person meeting with HR and union reps. He continues to say it. 

He has said it again in an email to me and HR, and I'd love to tell him to stick it since I have a new job now. However, I want to stand my ground and reiterate the truth, especially as I do not want to give up this fight or lie down and take the abuse I have faced.

1er3p0a,Asked to name my price,"Hi folks,

I got approached by a company I collaborated with at an old job to discuss a new job. It's on a 3-month contract on a specific contract, with the possibility to extend the contract to up to one year.

The call went well and it turns out I was the only person they spoke to about the position, and the top of the list for both the people involved in the decision as I'd left a good impression. The issue is that this would be my first job in this field so I don't want to ask for the average salary and risk them saying ""Nah, we're going to pass.""

Is it worth me going for something that's fairly low (I've looked at the average salary for the position in the UK and it's more than twice what I've earned previously so I can go to around that level) and asking if it's possible to renegotiate after the original contract has expired? The field is a pretty exciting one and it's similar to what I'm doing right now but on a different side of things, but it's also a lot more stable and the pay is generally better, so if I can get some experience at this level it could potentially keep me more stable in the future.",video-kid,1,1.0,0,1723542193,2024-08-13 09:43:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1er3p0a/asked_to_name_my_price/,8,2024
1er3hs0,Is an online molecular biology degree worth it?,"(24m) commissioning into the Air Force for at least 4 years. I have a bachelor's of science in nursing and have realized my passion is for genetics specifically crispr technology in curing diseases. 

I plan to use my GI bill when I am done and go back to school then change careers. However there's another benefit called tuition assistance which is free money for classes while active duty. 

The problem is I think only online classes are realistic considering deployments, change of duty stations, being sent all over the world for training, and a job that does not care about your school schedule. 

Recently I found there are some mostly online possibly even completely online somewhere options for molecular biology or similar degrees. 

Lehigh University 
https://distance.lehigh.edu/online-programs/masters-degree-programs/online-molecular-biology-masters

(Also Arizona State University and John Hopkins have online with short in person session) 

I realize how important in person lab work is to these kind of degrees along with the networking and collaboration but I want to make use of my benefits and not waste my time. 

I also no it's more important to pick a college with the research you want not the degree but I would be limiting myself and unable to do that.

Would one of these programs be worth my time? Why or why not?

If not do you guys have any other recommendations? (I could do something nursing related like master of science in nursing for administration or nursing research... But I really want to switch over to real scientific research)

The hours aren't like usual workplaces. Your job could start at 3:30 am or 4:30 am and if you're lucky - 6:00 am . Last week I had a rough week after starting 4 weeks ago.

I've been trying to tough it out and juggle stress, anxiety and difficulties sleeping. 

I made some mistakes the week my manager wasn't here and we had a review 1 on 1 to discuss anything and my manager brought up some issues that the RN and doctor (who comes around rarely) that they reported against me for. I touched a machine without gloves but according to the RN , she had to tell me more than once. I don't recall her warning me more than once. Oh and cell phone usage . Where she said she had to tell me more than once about using my phone on the floor, don't remember that either (in my memory she told me once and I stayed off the phone). Another incident that I didn't immediately ask for help when I couldn't turn on the computer. 

I also noted that I could've been wrong about the manner of times but that I didn't know or believe it was more than once. 


Overall though, I'm usually more tight knit for criticisms and with all fairness, they were right to correct my behavior in all professional ideals. It wasn't that I didn't agree but the way I handled the situation that ultimately bothered me. I'm usually not that reactive and I allow people to say what they say and I take the criticisms by the chin. 

However I believe my behavior is due to the exhaustion. I had an outburst of tears during the review and had a slight emotional breakdown (I didn't attack anyone but let's just say that I wasn't coming off as a functional human being ). Following that week, I had to leave last Friday an hour into my shift because I got ill ....

I leaked too much saline on the floor while trying to hook up a machine. I tried to clean up my area using a mop. Attempted to do all of this at regular speed. I tried to extend the mop out but somehow the mop and stick part came apart but was fixable. It fucked me up. My heart felt like it wasn't getting enough pumps. I got sweaty really fast and I got scarily weak quickly. I got dizzy and could barely move without my heart feeling as if it would stop beating. I ended up stumbling to the bathroom to get control of myself and ended up realizing I needed to go home. I came home. Laid down and went to sleep. I felt a bit better by the coming Sunday but nonetheless, still tired. I was able to calm down and get better hold of myself emotionally. 


Due to this stint, I believe drama has happened in my workplace and people are talking about me. It's seemingly coming from the only male PCT. He's saying sly stuff under the guise of humor when he was much more different and nicer prior to the meeting I had with my boss. The RN is also very weird and said some  condescending stuff when I needed to discuss my schedule with my boss. 

I can tell that my boss has a slightly unprofessional relationship with the other employees and may have discussed what happened during the meeting. Now the RN, male PCT and once nice Biomed tech are sort of making my job uncomfortable. 

The problem is that I'm a bit tired and I really don't want to come to work with this drama as I'm already still trying to regulate myself as an employee . I don't know if I can handle other people's ambiguous bullshit and balance out my own response to the situation. It seems stressful and I've had troubles sleeping since it occured, which does affect my ability to work. 

With such a schedule and other issues following it, I will admit that my personality and behavior is a bit different than how I'd normally carry myself. I'm not like mean, rude and completely disruptive. I just come off a bit more naive, distant, sensitive kinda child like. I'm trying to fix it because it's not how I usually am but I can tell it's affected my workplace.

1er19ar,Feeling Stuck in My Radio Career - Advice Needed,"Hi everyone

I'm a 24F who started working in radio at the age of 19. Initially, I took up work to avoid marriage, but I quickly found something I was genuinely passionate about. I began my career as a radio host in the small town I grew up in, where I hosted a morning show for 3.5 years. I loved the independence and the work‚ÄîI was always on time, exceeded expectations, and was thriving.

After a while, I wanted to move to a bigger city and a larger station. I got an offer from the company I currently work for (over two years now), but the role was for a producer and an OB jock. Initially, I rejected the offer because I had no experience in those areas. However, the head of state programming convinced me to join, promising opportunities to host shows and produce podcasts, so I took the leap and moved to a bigger city.

For 1.5 years, I worked hard, often on weekends, taking on more than I signed up for. I even received offers from two competing stations for roles that I would typically have to work six years to achieve, but I turned them down because I didn't want to stay in that city.

Eventually, I got the chance to move to Ahmedabad, which was my ultimate goal. But since moving here, things have taken a turn for the worse. I‚Äôve made some mistakes, and now I have far less work than I used to. Most days, I feel stuck, unsure of what's expected of me, and have little to do. I‚Äôve received feedback from my boss pointing out the errors I've made since moving, and I feel like my career is slipping through my fingers. 

I used to be good at my job‚Äîpeople said so. But now, I‚Äôm uninterested, frustrated, and not even sure what my role is supposed to be anymore. I still do voiceovers, want to host a podcast, and am trying to revive my social media presence, but I feel lost. I used to be busy all the time, and that's when I thrived. Now, I do whatever‚Äôs left after everyone else has done their jobs, and it‚Äôs shattering to see how far I've fallen.

I have experience in music management, hosting, and event management, but I‚Äôm at a crossroads. I don‚Äôt know if I should quit and find something else or try to find a way to make things work here. My mental health is suffering, and I wish I could just crash every time I drive to work. But deep down, I want to be busy again because that‚Äôs when I‚Äôm happiest.

I could really use some advice. Has anyone else been through something similar? What would you do in my situation?

Thanks in advance.

1er10gn,Useful skills?,"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm a 19 yr old college sophomore. While I currently major in psychology and am considering either going the full route to becoming a therapist which is what I‚Äôm more confident in. Or using my 4 yr degree to then apply to PA school or maybe even nursing school (altho nursing is unlikely).

However, maybe due to social media I‚Äôm feeling this dooming stress where a little voice in the back of my head keeps telling me I don‚Äôt have any acquired skills.
I‚Äôm not sure why but random hands on careers have always felt fun to me (even though I was and am one of those kids who would get stressed out at the idea of building a car or something bc I never wanted to fail in my elementary STEM classes). 
As of right now and kind of randomly the last couple months, I‚Äôve considered somehow learning about mechanical like how cars work, electrician stuff, or even coding. I don‚Äôt even think I necessarily want a career in these things, I just wish I knew the basics so that like if I went to the dealership to get my car fixed, I wouldn‚Äôt get scammed. And like so I could maybe change my oil on my own yk. Altho tbh a small part of me wants to learn skills also as a fallback plan to make extra money in times of struggle. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know if learning any of this stuff is relevant. I guess I just wished I knew more about the stuff around me just in everyday life maybe because of how clueless I feel like I am since I have been coddled my whole life.

So yea if I‚Äôm just looking for advice abt my dilemma, and if I‚Äôm just completely overthinking, or if what I‚Äôm thinking is valid. Thank you in advance for your help!!

I worked the last ten years in construction -- earning about 75-80K before overtime as a cinder block mason (taking on a foreman type role at a small company).

It seems as though I won't be able to return to work due to a persistent knee injury and have been referred to WCB vocational rehabilitation (career retraining provided through worker's insurance)...   does anyone have ideas for starting a new career at 30?

Something with 2yrs or less of schooling would be preferred (as worker's insurance might help pay for the schooling/training that is 2yrs or less apparently), but I'd be interested in forgoing worker's insurance coverage and spending longer in school if it would pay off career wise.

I have an undergrad in psychology from SFU and averaged a bit over 4.1 -- not sure if there are any careers or further schooling people might suggest that are in this field.

1eqyos2,"""Lined up"" for FT Position but I am ready to leave, its a bad time for the team, how do I do this nicely?","Bascially I have hated this job since before I started - just knew it wasn't a good fit from the beginning but needed income -  and, after a ridiculously physically mentally and emotionally taxing year in the PT position, my boss said she will soon be on touch for an interview for the FT Position (same position but FT hours and benefits and I still had to apply and will need to interview, stupid but standard procedure out of my boss's control). My boss went out of her way to make the pay and the terms of FT Position would be something that I would stay for and still within range of what she could offer - she even mentioned wanting to make it whatever it would need to be so I wouldn't want to leave in summer's busy time and in this time we were able to bring two onto join me. We have ""seasons"" and this is our heavy heavy season. 

Unfortunately, I am finally ready to leave and am really excited for the days I can focus on my life and not deal with the major emotional roller coaster I am almost always on with this job. Nothing lined up (other than a small consulting gig) just ready to live my life again and try pursuing some other things I've been wanting to do. I am constantly stressed and not motivated AT ALL by this job but have done a great job keeping the program afloat and shaping it into something better than it was (was just me the first 8ish months) and my boss and I get along really well and my team - two that I manage now - are happy to have me. I know it will put a lot of strain on all of them with me leaving now, so how do I do it without explaining myself too much and also showing my appreciation for everything my boss has done?

1eqyduf,22F either going through grass is greener syndrome or quarter life crisis,"Not sure if this is the right place on reddit to ask but here goes...

**How does one go about evaluating their values and initiating action to align a life with these values?**

I am Aus based for reference.

Pretty early on in life I decided that I wanted to have to travel, work internationally and be financially independent. I steered toward a career in medicine due to my fascination with human bio at school, good grades, the ability to be your own boss and earn a pretty good income, where effort = income, as opposed to corporate gigs where I correlated higher level of responsibility/management = more pay = more hours + less WLB.

Before starting med, I divulged in a bit of travel and introspection and thought that I decided that I would be honored/grateful to be in a career that helps people + communities through their most vulnerable times, thus went into med with the idea that I would become a holistic/lifestyle primary care doctor.

I am just a bit over halfway into my med degree. While I generally enjoy my medical classes - I don't really enjoy the placements, which introspectively is probably because I lack any kind of autonomy or real contribution in my capacity as a student. 

Becoming wary of my school classmates in different careers now graduating + the long study slog that lay ahead, in addition to my 20s slowly trickling by + my passion for medicine dying down, my priorities for my career felt like they changed... 

A WFH gig sounds lovely, this probably is not going to be attainable in my career until I hit my late 20s/early 30s and if I manage to mitigate all of the indemnity/medicolegal red tape that comes with running a virtual clinic, OR completely pivot and gun for a non-clinical career in pharma or adjacent. 

Working overseas for a decent salary is not really an option given the licensing restrictions of most countries internationally, unless I decide to do volunteering.

In short, I value intellectually stimulating work, decent renumeration and autonomy both professionally and geographically in my career, at this point in time, and would like to enjoy this in my 20s before wanting to have a family and be more permanent somewhere. I would really like the opportunity to live in a global city and feel like I'm missing out on that experience staying in my home regional town to study.

I am realizing how much this career will ask of me and I wonder if I would have been better off putting my effort and energy into something that will allow a bit more flexibility and freedom in my 20s? 18 yo me would have either done healthcare or biz/finance or international relations but chose the former due to the reasons I outlined earlier. I really enjoyed math at school and was toying with the idea of studying ML or quant trading recently but I know nothing about the reality of this field. 

I've approached my careers counsellor at university who has been unhelpful and only suggested pursuing a masters.

How does one align a career to their professional and personal values? I feel like there is a bit of disconnect between mine currently. Am I too disillusioned of the reality of life and a career? 

Thank you for reading this brain splatter if you got to the end x

  
**TLDR**: considering switching career direction from med to something else, would appreciate some guidance in how to recognize and act in alignment with professional and personal values.

1eqwith,I need to work on my mindset.,"I spent several years as a professional before having to take some substantial time off for health reasons. The career gig wasn't a good fit in the long-run so I didn't go back. Since then I've been working my way through entry level jobs in different fields trying to find a good fit. I haven't found the right job yet and I'm starting to wonder if I ever will.

Now I'm 40, looking for work again, and every interview I seem to get goes sideways. I lack confidence. I lack belief in my abilities and it shows. To top it off, these jobs I'm getting interviews for are ones I've had to compromise on pay, location, job duties for. 

I just want someone to want me so I can leave my current job. Really, I want to quit my job tomorrow but we need the income and health insurance. Looking for work on top of working full time at a job i dislike is exhausting. I feel I'm going to compromise and end up in the same place in 9 months again after taking whatever job I actually make it through the interview process for.

I've got a phone screen for a job that I'm actually excited about coming up later this week. It pays well, is a career position, and it would require skills from my career job that I left 8 years ago. It's pretty much the perfect job. I don't want to screw this up but based on recent experiences, I'm not too confident I won't screw it up.

1eqvqvm,Next steps in security / Finding specialty ,"Hi there! Long time reader never time poster! 

Here‚Äôs the layup I‚Äôve been in the IT / Security space for about 12 years and currently a security engineer for company, I was previously at an MSP where I held many hats from field engineer, to tier 3 support and finally a CSM. 

I thrived and learned a lot at the MSP both technically and business operationally. But I still couldn‚Äôt find my speciality and it drove my mental health in the dump almost burning me completely out of the industry all together. 

 Here‚Äôs my question - 
How do I find a speciality or something I can really grow into the next 5-10 years in security?

I‚Äôm not a technical unicorn but I can understand high level concepts, support things I‚Äôve never touched with relatively quick ease and I am great with people of all caliber. 

I love home labbing and testing new things but I feel like once I have my couple projects deployed or completed I lose interest and move onto the next unless it isn‚Äôt working in the first place. 

I fear that I need to stay in an individual contributor role before possibly becoming a manager and going down the director route of some IT / Security/ DevOps team. Or go spend the rest of my life learning splunk and becoming a contractor or something the appeal sounds low on that anyways. 

Endpoint security is cool I just don‚Äôt know enough about it deployed Wazuh this weekend to the house and thought I would like more insight into these things for general knowledge / troubleshooting.  My boss also mentioned to look into application security and I‚Äôve watched a few things but still don‚Äôt know where to begin. I‚Äôve been trying to use burpsuite and go through their courses to get more accustomed to this workflow / troubleshooting.

I have a bachelor degree in Law and Computer Science and have been working as a lawyer for 6 months. 

I didn‚Äôt really know what I wanted to do in college, hence two degrees, but now I feel inclined towards Heath, Safety, and Environment consulting. 

I planned on doing a master‚Äôs abroad in Marine Environmental Sciences (in Germany, I‚Äôm from Brazil), as they take CS grads and I don‚Äôt want to stay in my country, but I‚Äôm not sure if that would be a path that could potentially lead to HSE consulting. 

At first I didn‚Äôt plan on doing the master‚Äôs for this purpose, but now it‚Äôs becoming more what I would like to do. 

Should I restart a bachelor instead? In my country it would take 5 years, but in Germany that would be only 3. ",ProposalLeading4831,1,1.0,0,1723506865,2024-08-12 23:54:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eqtcz8/looking_to_switch_to_hse_with_non_related_degrees/,8,2024
1eqtbjc,Got removed from a project ,"So some senior specialty decorators (SD) wanted to do a social media video where they would each be adopting a ‚Äúnewbie‚Äù employee and seeing who the best mentor is.

SD came up to me last week and told me they were all so excited to tell me about this project because they knew I would love the idea, and they were right, I was really excited. I‚Äôve never been on the social media so I was nervous but not offput.

Another employee complained that since certain SD‚Äôs wanted dibs on me as their ‚Äúapprentice‚Äù for the video, it was unfair and I should not be allowed to participate. This all was discussed without me on my day off. 

I come back in after my day off and SD pulls me over and they all inform me I‚Äôm disqualified from participating because of what I just described in the previous paragraph. I was really bummed out, I feel like my interests get looked over a lot and I don‚Äôt get a lot of free time at work to work on other aspects of the job I‚Äôm interested in so this would have been a really fun opportunity for me. 

SD said they would come up with something to involve me next time but it really feels unfair to me now that I‚Äôm being excluded for being liked. My problem is is this is such a not big deal that the fact that I‚Äôm being treated so unfairly over it is upsetting me.

Over the last few years the love for this God forsaken industry and cooking as a whole has all but completely vanished and I've been pretty miserable for about a year and half now. I had dreams of moving to a new city or even new country and cooking cook food but I haven't even come close to trying and at this point I'm so jaded by everything that  the thought of just going to another restaurant makes me sick, and among many other reasons it has effected my life outside of work. I never cook for myself relying on delivery most nights and I barely have any will to get things done in my life. I basically try to extract as much joy I can out of my time away from the kitchen which basically amounts to just staying at home bingeing the media I like and eating like shit trying to distract myself. I've never been a great self-starter and it's only gotten worse. The biggest problem is I have no idea what to do. Id love to go to my boss right now and say I'm done and try and change careers but cooking is all I know, I have no other real skills and barely any hobbies I could turn into a real job.

1eqrxh7,Should I switch out of engineering and into psych?,"I (19m) am going into my sophomore year of engineering at a university. I chose engineering because I really like math and physics and I‚Äôm decent at the subjects. This plus the fact that I was undecided going into college made me choose engineering because it seemed like a safe bet. Throughout the year, however, I realized I am passionate about psychology and people more so than I am with engineering. I still enjoy the subjects, but I can feel a clear difference in excitement when I think about my future studying psych compared to being an engineer.
I like engineering but I am struggling to be content with a specific discipline; i‚Äôm debating between biomedical and industrial systems and I feel like I won‚Äôt be satisfied with my choice regardless. I understand that a psychology education isn‚Äôt always taken seriously, and my parents are not really on board with it. I understand that a technical degree in engineering is very reliable, more-so than psychology, and is pretty fulfilling down the line, but I think i‚Äôd feel regretful if I went through with it and disregarded psych. 
If I went through with psych I would definitely go to grad school and maybe more. But i‚Äôm not sure if that is the smartest decision.
I definitely want to follow what I am more passionate about  and feel like I could be good at, but a part of me thinks it‚Äôs more wise to stick with engineering and settle with reading books about psych. I was thinking about maybe adding a minoring or combining the two interests somehow.

1eqq7dv,Is it normal to have things taken off your desk all the time?,"For context, I'm in a shared office space with about half a dozen women. I am the only man. The rest of the guys work on other levels around the building. 

I was able to squash the women of the office ""pranking"" my desk 3 years ago. By that I mean they continued to do more and more destructive things to my desk that would just result in me spending my first hour of work cleaning up even with me asking them to stop. It ended when they serran wrapped my desk entirely. I told them they went too far and they needed to clean off my desk immediately. 

All the girls involved cried because I was being too mean to them. But they cleaned it up. I don't think they ever really forgave me, it definitely felt like there was some resentment there. 

What never stopped was how anything on my desk is somehow up for grabs. It use to be pens. I had to stop bringing in personal pens because they would disappear. Even now, purchasing pens through my own department's budget, it's still a free for all for every other department to come get pens all because they don't want to/know how to buy their own through their own budgets. Fine. Whatever it's company money anyways. 

Then it became my credit card machine. My department takes payments and the machine is the only way to type or swipe cards into the system. It magically appeared on of the other girl's desk. I never said anything, whatever. 

Then my invoice stamp disappeared and they didn't buy me a new one until over a year later. So I had to borrow other people's stamps. 

They also use my desk for their own storage. Since I'm up and moving around between each operation that I oversee, I'm not always at my desk like they are. So they decided that they can store things on my desk. I'll come in to stacks of papers and reports all over. 

It just seems like a joke to them. No one in the office seems to take my complaint seriously. 

Today I just noticed that one of the two little stuffed bears are gone. They sit on my computer and judge my lack of engagement in this job. Now one of them is gone. On one hand it's just a stuffed bear, who cares. But on the other hand it REALLY feels like some people here really do not respect myself or my personal work area.

Well now currently in 2024 I‚Äôm ready to hand in my letter of resignation and possibly never returning. I do plan on doing the proper two weeks notice. But my heart is absolutely broken and I am in utter disappointment. My company hired on new consultants that made a lot of pay cuts particularly in my department. Not only have they purposefully understaffed us to save on money. By doing this they have doubled our work load; mentally and physically. They changed our hours from 10:30-6:30 to now 11-7; and they verbally encourage us to clock out when the work is finished (between 6:30 and 6:45). Last week was the first week of these hour changes and I can‚Äôt afford the 2 hours missing from my paycheck so I stayed till 7. They didn‚Äôt like that but I‚Äôm not missing out on the hours. The last straw was a text that I got from a fellow coworker telling me that they had a new hire quit and walk out because of another employee. As I‚Äôm driving I am realizing what this job is doing to my mental health. I‚Äôm almost two years sober from SH and I can feel those scary thoughts coming back. I have started looking for different jobs because I‚Äôve realized that even though my managers do care about me and my life these hire ups could not give two penny pinching fucks if I slip back into my addiction. I want to write a letter of resignation but not really to my managers I want these hire ups to read it and maybe have an ounce of empathy; or maybe even the realization of ‚Äúoh yikes we kinda suck‚Äù. How would I write this? Also what would be a good thing to say to new jobs when I go into interviews of why I am wanting to leave my current company?

1eqor18,Career advice please,"So as the title suggests I'm looking for some advice.

I'm currently working as a Junior PM mainly carrying out PMO analyst activities. I have worked as a PMO analyst for over 4 years before that.

 I don't really enjoy the PM elements of my role( meetings, politics, approach to take debates,  stakeholder management  etc) and I feel out of my depth in terms of technical knowledge of the projects I'm involved in.(Currently across multiple IT projects)

I am much happier working on some of the reporting, budgeting, meeting pack preparations etc parts of my role. 

I am thinking of moving out of the PM world but would like some suggestions on what I might be a good fit for.

I had considered data analysis as I have basic SQL, Tableau and Power BI skills. I also worked in regulatory reporting for a period in the past.

Alternatively I had thought about cyber security but wondering is the learning curve very steep?

I have over a decade in financial services and multiple qualifications so would like to try move sideways in terms of salary.

Hi there,

Military vet here in his upper 30s looking for a career change via the GI bill. I‚Äôm at the point where I can select a bachelors program and it‚Äôs between these two. I wish to work with computers and get out of my current industry which is retail & restaurant management. I need to make my decision (or would strongly prefer due to enrollment) before Wednesday of this week. 

I grew up with computers in the dial up days and have always been a PC gamer. Not that any of that info translates to these careers, just mentioning it to state I‚Äôve always wanted a job with computers since as long as I can remember yet I never pursued it until now.

I want something with stability and longevity‚Ä¶ I want to be able to work from home and be a family man. So I‚Äôm turning to Reddit for advice. Do either of these bachelor programs afford me a better opportunity? Is one skewed more favorable than the other? Does one pay significantly more based on qualifications? Is one field significantly more challenging if im not capable of hacking into the matrix? 

I appreciate any replies and any time spent with assistance, guidance, or your experience. Thank you. ",DarkStocks3,1,1.0,0,1723492543,2024-08-12 19:55:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eqnkoz/which_bachelors_program_computer_systems/,8,2024
1eqnfa1,How do I manage this schedule if it actually comes true? ,"I know it is far fetched but I am just confused rn , so basically I want to do intership in a certain country and I was researching abt it today , I found a very intresting intership program provided by the govt of that country 

This intership program provided fully funded research for 5 weeks in that country's university. It was also related to my field which is computer science or in general technical field 

I saw when can we apply for them and I saw that this year's deadline is already over ( it was upto April)...the schedule was given and it was written that intership based on research is of 5 weeks and travel and food costs would be accomodated...it will end around mid July and wrapping up of it will be 1st week of aug 

Now this was very exciting and I can apply for it next year, but my main concern is on campus placements in my own university 

From 1st or 2nd week of July , companies start coming for on campus placement of final year students ( 4th year). The more a company comes before , the more package it offers and more good it is. Although placements go on until dec but package and company's position and name keeps on declining 

Now definitely I don't know if I would even be selected in this intership program which I mentioned earlier. But my question is...what should I do? Coz I am really so confused...what if I would actually come into a situation where I have to choose between my oncampus placements or this internship program? 

I had conflicting views abt both things 
*For intership program: 
1. I thought that it's just a research internship and all I would get is a certificate, some stipend and something to write in my CV/resume 

*For oncampus placements: 
1. I thought that idk if I would even be selected in the companies that are coming at start as these companies only select very very few students every year. Plus leaving a change of free foreign intership of this didn't seem right to me! But the main issue is that what I am going to do is intership and what my college is offering is placement 

So my question is...if I get into this situation actually...what should I do? I know I should focus on developing my skills and believe me I have been working on hard on it in uni ü•π. This is something which is eating up my mind soo an advice !?

1eqna43,What is the best option?,"
I recently finished college and have a graduate job lined up for September in finance/ fund accounting. The thing is, I know I do not want to do fund accounting in the future it was just the only job that I could get that had hybrid working and in a location were I can public transport to. 

I personally wanted to a graduate programme in a more accountant based job such as working at the big 4 in auditing, or doing an accounting and finance programme in a big company, however i did not have any luck and got rejected from all these jobs.

The position that I have lined up is a two year contract and offer to pay for qualifications I pursue during this period so long as I pass the exams and stay the duration of the two years e.g. CFA, CPA. 

I also have the option to a masters program for a diploma in accounting however this costs about ‚Ç¨12k and I would preferably like to start earning some money

What would be the best option? To do the accounting exams while working the job and try to find a more accounting related job after a year or 2, or do a masters Programm for a year? After one year I will have the opportunity to have the same amount of accounting exams passed with each of these options.

I'm trying to not compare myself to others, I'm trying to play to my strengths, but... Long story short, I've had a long depressive episode for the past 6-7 years (and I'm still in it) but I'd like to rejoin my career (journalism/comm) without any relevant experience.

In the past, my writing was great, but I haven't published in almost a decade. I know, just ""write"" but... depression has this funny way of taking all motivation, inspiration, and really any passion away from you. And it's really hard to do an in-depth piece while working full-time in another sphere AND dealing with depression (yes, I take meds). And I just don't know how to really reference this or explain it, everyone else has much more developed resumes than I do. I'm not sure how I can compete in an already competitive market, when I'm not competitive at all. I also know a lot of the modern-day workplace is about marketing yourself, and I really hate marketing myself, so it seems like I'm just in a lose-lose situation.  
In a way, I'm venting.

1eqm3e3,Need help don‚Äôt want to blow this ,"Hi, 

I need some advice. After about 2 months of barely any communication back from recruiters, one finally is open to speak with me tomorrow! This recruiter in particular is actually the recruiting manager, so I don‚Äôt want to blow this. Back in July about a month ago, I did speak with a recruiting manager as well from another hiring agency and it was going well until she asked me about why I left my job. I said professionally it wasn‚Äôt an ideal fit. She then judged me for it and even said ‚Äúwhy would you leave a job without another lined up?‚Äù So I said it was a hard decision but this wasn‚Äôt an ideal fit for me. I could tell she just didn‚Äôt like my answers for this part and then the phone call ended. She never spoke to me again and even disconnected with me from LinkedIn lol. This however didn‚Äôt crush me because well there‚Äôs thousands of recruiter and job agency‚Äôs this is just one of many. Fast forward now to a month later and this job posting in particular I really like and want to pursue! However, the only way I can is if I pretty much wow this person tomorrow. I‚Äôll do my best to be charismatic and professional as well as promote myself best I can. What I would like help in is what should I say when asked why did I leave my job? The truth is I left my job because I was beyond mentally drained and just couldn‚Äôt take it, I did my best to stay but after a year of trying to make it work and nothing I just couldn‚Äôt take on the mental burden anymore, hard decision but worth it. It seems people just don‚Äôt like this lol. So I‚Äôve asked others what say when asked this and how to say so that further questions aren‚Äôt asked. I don‚Äôt want the main focus to be in this or any conversation with a recruiter that I left my job so abruptly without another lined up. I‚Äôve been told to say, I left because I‚Äôm looking for a new challenge and an opportunity to grow. The company was downsizing and so I had to exit, as the project was ending. I‚Äôve also been told my family which is true that I had to leave to further take care of my mom, my mom did unfortunately get hurt, she was hit by a car and I had been helping but was struggling while working, once I stopped working I dedicated a lot of time to help her recover. She‚Äôs still recovering but I don‚Äôt normally mention or use this because I just thought it was a bit much but she literally told me to lol. As it really makes ppl not want to continue asking and the I said what if they say or think that this means I‚Äôm not flexible and it will get in the way. They said to mention she‚Äôs much better now and doesn‚Äôt rely on so much of my support that I am much more flexible and ready to work. What is everyone‚Äôs opinions here and what should I say? I want to say what will best serve me in moving forward to actually being choose by the client and recruiter to do the actual interview for this job. I don‚Äôt want the conversation to focus mainly on why I left and more so why I‚Äôm such a great fit. Please let me know what has worked for you in a similar situation. Thank you!!

Pros
- Potential law income is very high
- No maxing out of salary unlike marketing
- Get to do something way more interesting and law is more black and white than marketing
- Help people and businesses
- Less likely to be laid off at 50
- Can open own practice in future
- Immediate family are in the area I would study in (currently no family around us)
- Get to be out of marketing, which is turning so digital/social focussed which I dislike

Cons
- My marketing role pays around $130k
- 3 years of school/3 years of lost income
- Already in 60k student debt
- Have kids
- Would need to move province
- Potential high income is just that, potential

My manager straight up told me he told HR I was a high potential employee, and I know for a fact that they have those meetings with HR and senior management to discuss about successions plans, and it does sound like my name has been brought up on different occasions.

I have recently been offered a middle management position at the same company but on a different country, with great expat advantages and a 5 year contract, but I have been thinking a lot about my career lately. 

To be honest, I never thought I would stay in this company that long as I always thought I would end up in a tech companies doing state of the art stuff and not just regular big corporate trying to catch up but still late tech.

Also, I know for a fact that the team I would be managing is pretty lacking in terms of technical skills, which higher management is perfectly aware of since I was asked to evaluate them (and now asked to upskill them).

That being said, I did enjoy leading some projects without being deep in the technical, just enough, to be able to orchestrate how things go, deadline, communication between individual contributors and senior management etc ..

Do you think I should seize this opportunity ? Is it a once in a lifetime opportunity for an introvert like me who don't really have this vibrant personality (which seems to be the biggest criteria to go into senior management position) ? Or do you think I should try and finally get a new job in a tech company, ideally a FAANG ?

1eqj8ng,Is CS suitable for me,"I finished my 1st year as a cs student in my country then I got accepted to study abroad cs. As I already spent one year as a cs student, I have a good knowledge about the major, different fields related to it and all the other things ,which means I'm not a new to this major. The problem is that I was satisfied and felt like this is my major and it is what I want to continue studying and everything was fine. Now, I started thinking about my high school dream of being an aeronautical engineer or mechanical in general. And felt like cs will kill me with no passion just because suddenly I felt like spending my whole life with a computer is a nightmare. Changing the major is a big deal as I already got accepted as a cs and there is a fund and different things that make me incapable of doing it.
Now I need to know am I have a problem with the major? 
Also I'm really into astronomy so I was thinking (when I chose CS) that I can work in this field with this degree but now I think it won't happen because there isn't lots of jobs in this field (and my university is not ranked high or something). I was thinking about  data analysis and data engineering as I thought they would be good for someone who is interested in astronomy and science but then I found that software engineering is the famous one that can a person work in after graduation unlike data that needs years of experience.
I know I said different things unrelated to each other but it is what's going in ky brain and I can't stop thinking nor making a decision.
I also started feeling that studying abroad was a stupid decision abd I dont need it (although it is better as my country doesn't have data jobs it's just focusing on full stack and sw)

I hope everything is going well.

I need some advice. Maybe someone can share some helpful tips.

I've successfully completed three job interviews in IT. In the first meeting, they offered me a 10k salary increase (10.5% more than my current salary).

Today, two things happened:

1. My current boss told me I'll get a promotion with a 3% salary increase at the end of the year.
2. My husband lost his job (we knew this could happen but not so soon).

I have the final interview next week and I'm considering asking for a slightly higher salary. How should I approach this? 

How might the other party react?

We lost our big contract (way above my level, beyond anything I did or could do). So all of our work is sunsetting, including the project I manage. I am going to need to find a new job or else I will find myself unemployed.

To be honest, I am a bit behind the curve. I could have been doing this months ago, but I wanted to see my project to the end, look after some people.

Starting last week, I applied for project manager positions at a number of companies I am familiar with. I was hedging my bets. I was worried about ANY getting back in touch, based experiences now in the distant past that scarred me. 

But to my surprise, I've been getting call backs from just about every one I've been applying to. I do think I have a strong resume for a project manager position.

I've gotten a callback on one and think I am a strong candidate. Call this Company A. They are my #1 choice for a lot of reasons...the work, company culture, compensation. But I also think this will be the most competitive position I am competing for.

I've also gotten callbacks from two other companies, lets say Companies B & C. They are good companies and I could see myself working for them. Even though they are the second choices, they have good culture, good compensation. 

The thing is, they are driving hard for me. So I guess my concern is that given my fear of unemployment, I am worried about pushing them to the side and then not getting an offer for Company A, and being unemployed. But on the other, Company A is a company I really, really want to work for. Have for a few years. 

Does anyone have any advice for me on how to navigate this situation?",Rtstevie,2,1.0,0,1723469490,2024-08-12 13:31:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eqdtdi/job_searching_and_getting_more_interest_that_i/,8,2024
1eqdre0,Not sure if I should quit?,"A little background. At my current job I have been at for a few years, it is a very small organization, with less than 10 employees. I was originally hired to help the owners wife retire, however we became more and more busy and I have taken on tasks that were previously handled by two other employees in addition to my original role. I recently have moved, and am commuting 1.5 hours each way, which has led me to begin looking for another job. I have asked for a raise, in order to help me with the commute and would have kept me from looking for a new role, however was basically told to ""budget better"". Other than that I enjoy the people I work with and the job isn't terrible. 

  
Recently I have been offered a position elsewhere, more money, closer, and includes a work vehicle. I wouldn't be doubting taking this job, if it wasn't for the fact I really do enjoy the ownership at my current company for the most part. I also found out that in a month, the owners wife will be out of the state, so nobody will be in the office to handle the accounting/billing. Should I feel bad about leaving?

1eqdr5f,Insecure about slow workplace. Advice welcomed.,"I feel like I'm in an unstable situation and I'm looking for advice, or potentially someone who has been where I am.

I'm a mechanical engineer doing design at a manufacturing facility. The company is less than 50 people. Business is slow. I upskill at work for most of the day, which my boss supports. I recently got a raise to 93k and live in LCOL/MCOL area. I have been here 2 years and prior to this worked in another industry. I graduated from college 7 years ago.

I by no means am complaining, but the idea of staying here for 10 years and not getting solid experience, kinda just coasting, terrifies me. If they fire me, I feel like I'd have no skills and end up serving at the Waffle House. My eventual 10 years of experience will not be equal to another engineer's 10 years because our workload is so slow. 

I don't feel deserving of the pay, especially when my days are so easy. I do work hard when needed and I'm always working on learning something, but that doesn't feel like real engineering experience or responsibility. My next upskill is to get a FE, just to increase my employability in case I'm laid off.

Does anyone have advice? Should I quit for lower pay and more work for experience? Is this just imposter syndrome?",OptimalStatement,2,1.0,1,1723469331,2024-08-12 13:28:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eqdr5f/insecure_about_slow_workplace_advice_welcomed/,8,2024
1eqde1l,Considering dropping out of sustainability master's,"Hi!

I guess I'm posting because, like a lot of people, I'm unsure of how to proceed with my career and would greatly appreciate the wisdom of others' experience.

It's been my life dream to do meaningful sustainability research either as a researcher or professor. In pursuit of this dream, I applied and was accepted to a top master's sustainability program at a top 5 research university.

The thing is... maybe a little too late...¬†**I'm realizing/starting to have extreme doubts about the job prospects that will be available to me in sustainability.**¬†It's a small, overpopulated field, and I know professorships are already hard to get in less competitive fields. It seems like in sustainability, I'd have to sacrifice so much for the small¬†*chance*¬†of being able to become a researcher. What if that sacrifice is for nothing?

Also, the more I've been thinking about it, I'm not really sure research would be my thing, either. I'm not sure I would want to be in the academic pressure-cooker for the rest of my life.

**I'm kind of thanking my lucky stars that I finished undergrad with another major in Econ, because I'm seriously considering switching tracks now.**

I was thinking I could aim to pivot into business sustainability, and avoid sustainability academia that way, but even with this, it seems like the entry-level business sustainability jobs are in big cities that I wouldn't be willing to move to. (Not a big city person.)

Having (tentatively) ruled out academic sustainability and business sustainability,¬†**I was thinking I could just totally lean into economics/busines**s. Maybe once I get past the entry-level stage I could come back to business sustainability and not have to live in a big city (?).

So here I am, looking for government econ-related jobs and am strongly,¬†*strongly*¬†considering dropping out of my sustainability master's if I land a job.

**If I could get any concrete advice, it would be to ask- what do you think about dropping out of a sustainability master's program that I've been accepted to, given that I'm seriously considering switching tracks?**

I wish you all luck in this trying time <3",sustanomics,1,1.0,0,1723468392,2024-08-12 13:13:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eqde1l/considering_dropping_out_of_sustainability_masters/,8,2024
1eqd8y9,Looking for some guidance on something vacation-related,"So my boss, the Director of the department, was recently fired. I‚Äôm currently reporting to directly to *his* boss, the CFO. This is an interim situation until they find a replacement.

I have some vacation coming up later in the year. Half of that was already approved in writing by my ex-boss. For the second half, I had a discussion with the CFO and he confirmed verbally that he‚Äôs ok with me taking it.

I had sent an email to the CFO in our email thread on the vacation communication stating that as discussed, confirming that I‚Äôm ok to take the second half of that vacation. 

I never received a response to that email - I assume that since he okayed it verbally he didn‚Äôt feel a need to reply.

But now I‚Äôm wondering - should I follow up again with a gentle reminder to give me a written confirmation? Just in case for due diligence I guess? Or would it just be annoying for him when he‚Äôs already verbally confirmed it?

1eqcy9a,"Choosing a degree: MA or MSc, and job opportunities?","Hi! I (20) got my bachelor's degree in International Business last month, and have since registered for two masters at university: for the MA in International Relations & International Organization, and for a MSc in Business Administration: Strategic Innovation Management. I'm just not sure which one would suit me best, and wonder if anyone might have advice (or experience with one of these programs).¬†

I am pretty creative myself, and have a passion for entertainment. For example, I do photography, love movies and music, and have previously done an internship with a film distributor. On the other hand, I am curious, love a challenge, have an interest in consulting, business strategy, and have interned at a big 4 company. I chose International Business because it touches upon a wide variety of business domains, and working abroad also really appeals to me. As part of my degree, I have already spent a year abroad now, for example. In addition, I hope to buy my own house one day, so salary plays a bit of a role in my choice of further education.

The MA interests me because it looks at (from what I understand) the impact of international politics on businesses, and possibly allows for a future career at an embassy or government. Despite this, I think an MA earns slightly less than an MSc, and online I can't find much about future prospects after the degree since it is relatively small-scale. The degree might not be very creative, but the name of the degree might bring to mind PR or something along those lines for a potential international employer, which might make it slightly more appropriate for a job in entertainment.¬†

The MSc appeals to me because, despite being more business-oriented, it is still quite broad. Innovation is everywhere these days, and with more and more universities emphasizing sustainability, the job prospects after this degree seem relatively good to me. Nevertheless, it is perhaps a bit less creative and I think that an MSc in Business Administration might not help me so much with, say, a job in the entertainment industry - should I still be interested in this after college. On the other hand, it might fit better in a consulting firm where the salaries are also probably a bit higher again.¬†

I know it's important to follow your passion and not to make a choice based just on salary, but I hope you guys understand my dilemma. Also, I know that your studies don‚Äôt always say something about where you will work later on, and I might do another internship to make my resume more relevant to employers in one of the sectors regardless of which course I choose. Despite that, I genuinely don't know what to do and only have 2 weeks to make a choice lol. I would really appreciate any advice :')",sometiime,1,1.0,0,1723467248,2024-08-12 12:54:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eqcy9a/choosing_a_degree_ma_or_msc_and_job_opportunities/,8,2024
1eqcxsk,Is it possible to back out of a signed offer without ruining your reputation/relationship with the organization?,"I recently accepted (two days ago) a job offer from a reputable large organization after letting them know I had another offer on the table and they were my first choice. They rushed to get me an offer, and I signed it. There was only a 24 hour window for me to sign. However, when I let the other job I was considering know that I accepted another offer, they replied saying they might be able to improve their offer and that they can call me today.

The job I accepted is a longer contract with significantly more pay, but it comes with an indefinite probation period, minimal support, and a longer commute. I was encouraged to take it by my mentor due to the prestige of the organization as well as more room for growth and to build yourself within the organization. The other job is closer to home, offers a better work-life balance, and has strong support systems in place. It‚Äôs my first job in this specific field and the additional support offered would be really beneficial to me.

1eqc00g,The wrong person in the wrong position. Should I resign?,"I worked as a QA Engineer in a local IT company for three years. This company had some difficulties with organisation and staff turnover, so in addition to my main duties, I also wrote technical documentation, guides, did devops work, and trained others. But most of all, I liked my projects because the longer I worked, the more complex the testing became, and I especially liked various analytical work with the database, load testing, and testing of complex backend logic. I also liked teaching others and being a carrier of certain knowledge.

This year I received an offer from a well-known IT company. I thought it would be an improvement of my experience, because in the old company the technology was somewhat outdated, and I was a bit stagnant in my work and not developing. But after 5 months in the new company, I can't bring myself to work. I started to hate my job.

My entire team is working on 1/6 of the project, and because I'm new, I get the easiest job: testing text and button changes on the screens and writing test cases. The project itself is painfully boring. The strangest thing is that I receive constant criticism - sometimes my mentor doesn't like my approach to writing tests, and sometimes the way I test. Funny enough, because at the onboarding, the mentor also told me that I needed to figure out everything myself. There are also a lot of meetings in the company where they discuss functionality rather than the development process itself, and there I constantly wonder if I am really a necessary person here.

I know that the company has a team of analysts, but they hire people with experience and a high level of professionalism. And you can't change the team at will, only if the management wants you to. 

Now I'm confused, I feel a bit humiliated, I've lost faith in myself, I'm demotivated and most importantly  stuck. And I am losing my passion for the profession. I don't want to let the team down anymore because I can't bring myself to work, but it's hard to admit to myself that I couldn't work in a prestigious company. Should I resign? I can return to my old job, but how will it look on my CV, since this is my second job and my first time working at a prestigious company?

1eq9me4,How do I repair conflict in a professional work relationship?,"
I just started 3 weeks ago. The agreement was that I will be compensated according to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) rules. Before the two week mark, I was asked of it was possible to not be paid the employer‚Äôs share of CPF. I said okay as it was not a full month wage. Days later I was asked if it was possible for me to contribute 17% of the employer‚Äôs portion of CPF contribution of my salary. I said no and told her to round up my CPF contribution instead. My boss mentioned that it was not within budget to fork out another $300-$400 for my CPF. This was against the prior agreement I had when I came down to the store to confirm my start date. 

To top it off, all staff are only given 15-20 minutes of lunch despite working 8h. I‚Äôm aware that this is against fair practises in Singapore.

Few days back, I was serving 3 customers who kept purchasing more items the longer I spoke to them at an event. When it came to payment, it was handed to me and split into 2 bills as it was paid by separate individuals. I did not check the number of items purchased. As their cards kept getting declined, one of them took interest in another item on display. I asked if they wanted to purchase it but they declined so we did the payment and they left.

After the payment was done via credit card instead of NETS, my manager asked how many of our products were purchased. I specified a range as I was unsure. I was eventually reprimanded and accused of ‚Äútaking so long to close the sales‚Äù and of ‚Äútalking too much.‚Äù The final number I stuck to was correct but I was not believed. 

When I was dismissed from work at the end of the same day, I was again scolded. As it was an event, it is normal to tear down the booth shortly before the event ends. I had asked the part timer what time we will close the booth, and how will the packing of the store‚Äôs items be done. As a full timer, I assumed I would be the one packing everything. 

She explained that she usually does not do closing at the end of the day. Rather the boss and their spouse would do it. The same thing would happen in the morning. 

‚ÄúPerhaps we‚Äôll start packing at ‚Äî‚ÄîPM‚Äù. I said I didn‚Äôt know what the plan was so we should wait. 

The part timer raised it up with the Manager and said ‚Äúyou should have told me earlier about the packing.‚Äù The Boss was furious and vented about how it was inappropriate for me to instruct the part timer as he/ she did not want the part timer to feel it was unfair for me to go off early.

I know my place as a new, full time staff that it is not my place to boss people around. The Manager had left for a few hours after I reached my workplace for something personal so when the part timer and I had the conversation, we couldn‚Äôt ask him/ her. I didn‚Äôt even know whether the part timer would keep the items until the end of the event if I were to be dismissed early. 

I just recalled that in the past week, another part time staff was NOT informed to work an extra hour. She was confused and kept asking me every 2 minutes if she was to go home at the newly specified timing. 

My question is, aren‚Äôt these signs of bad communication on the Manager‚Äôs end? With regards to the event, should I clarify my end when I return to work in a few days or do I wait for him / her to reach out to me?

1eq83x0,I almost ruined my career by refusing to delegate. Here's how I fixed it. ,"I was drowning in work, living on coffee and takeout, even though I could hire more people and ask my team to do a bunch of things.

So I listed out everything I did in a week. I looked at each task and asked, ""Do I really need to do this myself?"" Turns out, the answer was often no. That's when I started learning how to delegate and here's a framework that helped me, without losing the quality of work:

1. Use a skill x passion matrix to identify tasks perfect for delegation. Low-skill and low-passion tasks are a must for delegation. Focus your energy on high-impact work that aligns with your strengths.
2. Choose team members for each task, thinking about their skills and what they might want to learn.
3. Communicate expectations with the 5W1H framework (who, what, when, where, why, how). Helped me make sure I didn't miss any details.
4. Provide consistent feedback. *I would schedule a recurring check-in using the Sunsama app* so we could catch any issues early and make adjustments before things got off track.

What task do you often tend to do yourself but can delegate?

1eq2x8q,Stuck in a City Job and am beginning to hate my current position. How to proceed forward?,"Hey guys. So, the title says it all. I‚Äôm literally seeking advice from any one of you career gurus out there who may have been in my shoes. So, I‚Äôll start off with my background and a little bits of details for context here. 

I‚Äôm currently 30 (literally turning 31 near the end of this month btw) and have been in my City job for about a year and seven months now. I work in a call center environment and the job sucks. It‚Äôs stressful, demanding, and dead-end (I don‚Äôt wanna move up because I hate the job). But‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still a city job. It took me (7) years of being rejected before I finally got in. When I was half-way into this role, initially, I started applying voraciously for other roles within the City that I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd be qualified for. And so far? I‚Äôve only gotten one freaking interview. That‚Äôs it. And the end result was I got passed over for like (5) other people.

Anyways, I‚Äôm literally STILL trying to apply for other positions, but can‚Äôt get any callbacks for interviews since then. And it‚Äôs eating at me. I feel trapped. Stuck. Behind. Wasted potential. And dare I say‚Ä¶incompetent. I‚Äôm currently struggling to decide if I should stick it out until SOMETHING comes up for me or if I should look to work elsewhere. I really don‚Äôt want to leave the City. I‚Äôve been weighing losing my pension, retirement, union membership, opportunities within the City, personal connections, and the various perks that it offers. I‚Äôve been wracking my brain with this and it‚Äôs taking its toll. I‚Äôm just so goddamned tired of getting stuck in jobs where you can‚Äôt move up or go elsewhere internally. 

My resume isn‚Äôt too hot either. It just has warehouse and customer service backgrounds. I don‚Äôt have a degree (yet‚Ä¶I‚Äôm working on getting my Associates by the Summer of 2026), my experience isn‚Äôt really specialized or niche, and I‚Äôm entering into my early 30‚Äôs and the future looks like it could be wasted being stuck here in this job.

Any words of advice, guys? With the current job market/climate/environment, would it even be smart to even think of jumping ship from a City job? Even if it makes you miserable? Even if you feel that it‚Äôs the WRONG job for you to be in? A job that you HAVE to do to pay bills and survive? Should I stick it out? Is my resume and lack of education the sole reason for all of this? Are City jobs too big to run away from? So many questions. Any answers, feedback, criticism, comments, and advice is needed.

1eq28aw,Should I quit my job?,"If you don't wanna read long paragraphs:
I don't like being a teacher at all. Everyday is a torture. The main things that make me stay is money and the stability. Should I quit? I have no back up plan and scared I will end up broke. What should I do?

Now here's the detail:

I'm 27 years old. I've been teaching for about a year.

Things that make me stay:
1. It's a stable job that I don't have to worry about my income until the age of 60.
2. The salary is rising every year.
3. The most important reason is that I can take a teacher's loan to pay debt for my mom. (The debt was for my education and it's a lot)
4. There is no back up plan if I quit. There are some things that I think I can do to earn money, but none of those things is stable and I'm scared that I will not be able to earn enough to pay for my own living. I'm scared of being poor. I was there and it's not fun at all.
5. My family will be so mad at me if I quit because they think I've finally settled at something stable and they don't have to worry about me anymore.

Things that make me want to quit:
1. I don't like teaching.
2. I hate the school system. I don't want to write about how wrong the system is because it's gonna be a very long paragraph.
3. My colleagues are not so nice. Everyone gossips about other people behind their back then act nice in front of them. Plus, I can't fit in because it's kinda obvious that I don't like teaching, so that gives them another topic to gossip.
4. I'm stressed out almost everyday because I want to do the best but I can't because of the lack of support (mentally and financially) and the lack of will to do anything because as I said earlier, I don't like teaching.
5. I used to be good at things I do. I used to like myself for that, but these days I just feel like I'm a failure.

1eq1ip1,My supervisors wife wants to take me to lunch? ,"So I work part-time for a failing IT business with 3 employees, including me, 4 if you count the owner (my supervisor). One employee just quit without notice so we had 4. I left my full-time job for this as I was very burnt out and needed a break. 

But this place has been the most poorly run environment I‚Äôve ever worked in. I‚Äôve tried to make positive changes but it‚Äôs fallen on deaf ears. By poorly run, I do mean probably on the brink of going out of business. 

I have another offer that I‚Äôm most likely accepting so in the next few days I‚Äôm planning to give notice, I just need to jump through a few more hoops to ensure it‚Äôs a secured offer. A full-time benefitted position that pays well, fully remote, 4 day work week. Not bad. I really hit it off with the owner and know he‚Äôll be a great mentor to me. Current supervisor is a very poor cultural fit for me. I feel like I‚Äôve been going against the grain since starting this job. 

Well, my performance has slipped because it‚Äôs such a toxic environment and I‚Äôve been looking for a way out before the business goes belly up. I‚Äôve not had any performance reviews and none are scheduled.

My supervisor doesn‚Äôt live near me but is in town for a couple of days and his wife wants to buy me lunch tomorrow. Very last minute and quite frankly, suspicious. She is a prison warden and has a tendency to be the enforcer for him because he doesn‚Äôt handle conflict well. I‚Äôve only met her once and she doesn‚Äôt work for the business. If she attempts to provide constructive feedback or even let me go, I think that‚Äôs highly inappropriate and not her place to do so. 

Should I decline? It just feels very strange to me. ",NulliusInVerba56,7,0.8199999928474426,21,1723426870,2024-08-12 01:41:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eq1ip1/my_supervisors_wife_wants_to_take_me_to_lunch/,8,2024
1eq1hj7,J.D. instead of PhD? (Parent Issues),"Hi, I'm in my late 20s working in neuroscience research (U.S.). I planned to apply phd programs next year (to start classes in 2026). Have a great CV. However, I'm extremely down on that idea rn. 

I have a lot of student loans (and no savings). My salary is $\~80k which is high for academic research w/ no advanced degree. I lived off $17k for two years before this, which I think has deterred me from the PhD. I would get a $\~25-50k stipend, pending the program. Don't think I can commit to that income for 6 years. Also, the post-phd career path is basically impossible to forecast from the start of the program.

Considering law school b/c patent law seems to be a good intersection between law and science/research. I've been a paralegal (different field), have developed IP at startups (through research and applications). I've read relevant briefs, law textbooks, asked lawyers on reddit, etc. I've been reaching out to contacts IRL. I've spoken with law students going into patent litigation (**I am specifically interested in patent litigation**). Also currently studying for the LSAT.

However, I'm running into this ironic problem. My parents are both lawyers and every time this topic comes up they just shit on law and try making a case for me to stay in research. I think it's ironic because you usually hear about lawyer parents coercing their kids to go to law school, whereas I'm arguing with them until I'm blue in the face in favor of law school. 

Their case is essentially, I'm doing so well in research, why leave? They glorify research and are cynical about their own field. My dad said something like ""you're doing so great right now, in a year you could be the boss!"" and that's literally impossible. That's not how academia works. I need my phd, I need to do a postdoc, I need to move to fricken idaho or wherever will give me a tenure track position (which, is everything but impossible to get), and then maybe eventually I'll get my own lab. 

So I'm a little furious that my lawyer parents aren't fully endorsing my decision to pursue law school, particularly because while I can point out every way they are wrong about research they obviously know law. I'm never the type to need my parents' approval for anything (quite the opposite), however I'm finding myself stuck in the state of frustration that's making it hard for me to commit to applying to lawschool. I value the shit out of their opinions, they've been succesful lawyers for a very long time, it feels fundamentally wrong to go and become a lawyer when the lawyers who know me the most think I should do something else (they don't admit that this is what they're doing, but it is).

And lastly, my formal question would be, do you have any advice in general for trying to make a big switch like this? Do you think there are any career paths I'm overlooking? Any thoughts/opinions are welcome thank you.

1epz9a6,"Career advice for 55/F who doesn't like office work, likes the outdoors. Knows construction, prefers working with men. ","Hello,

I am posting for my mom. 

She is 55.

My mom despises clerical work. 

She said she worked phlebotomy but I never really used to hear about it so I assume she really didn't like it. I think she didn't see a way for her to move up beyond phlebotomist. 

She is only a couple classes away from an associate's degree. 

She prefers working with men over women. 

She was a homeowner for 30 years and did so many remodels and do it yourself projects, plumbing, electrical, etc. Painting. Etc. 

She did her own landscaping. 

She used to do basic things on her vehicles, back when vehicles were easier to work on. 

The problem is she doesn't really want to go for anything that's full-time school. 

Back in the past she said she was open to do  nursing, but I really don't see her being able to stay consistent with the hard 2 year schedule (I just completed X-ray and that was intense, let alone nursing). And she needs to work. 

She's currently working as a contracted FEMA worker as a debris monitor. She saw a guy working with a skid, and thought it was great. They'd pickup debris in a small vehicle with a claw and put it in a pile for the trucks. 

I could have seen her do CDL, but at this point night driving is not a strong suit. 

Are there any type jobs that she can do that requires basic certifications (1 year or less). 

If she's working with a group of guys I would like her in a position to where maybe she's not constantly challenged by them. As the skid driver it seems she works part as a team but mainly independent, if that makes sense. 

My mom is actually very smart, she's better at math than I am and a fast learner. 

She had about every tool imaginable in her garage. 

She is 55, with a few torn rotator cuff surgeries, So nothing with repetitive movements or heavy lifting. 

Let me know! I'm going to send her your replies.

1epy2dp,10 Years in Retail ‚Äî Where Can He Go?,"Hello all,

Let me preface this by saying: this isn‚Äôt for me. This is for my partner. He‚Äôs been working at a popular retail store for just over 10 years now, and worked his way from a part time associate to a key holder merchandiser.

Long story short, I‚Äôve been noticing that his mental/emotional health has been negatively impacted by his superiors. From what he‚Äôs told me and also from what I‚Äôve overheard at outings with his coworkers (weddings, birthday parties, brunches in which I am the +1), their store is a top performing store. They pass their audits, they usually rank high when it comes to sales in their region, and he typically gets praised for being a hard worker. But I guess the managing team makes their jobs a bit more difficult with inconsistent scheduling, piling on responsibilities on the merchandisers, and just being straight up unprofessional and rude.

Yesterday, he had an anxiety attack about work that was (1) kind of frightening for me to witness and (2) making me upset that they were putting him through this much stress. I told him to call off, but he said he couldn‚Äôt because the department managers took the day off.

Anyway, when the time comes and when he‚Äôs ready to transition out of that job, I would like to be able to help him land a role elsewhere. He‚Äôs put himself back in school for fashion marketing, but he‚Äôs always wanted to be a buyer. Does anybody have tips on how to become a buyer?

On a more general scale, what jobs are out there for those with this much retail experience? He unfortunately does not have a degree yet (again, he‚Äôs working on it), but he has great discipline, and learns quick. What jobs have you all had luck getting with just retail history at one place?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Right now, he‚Äôs stuck in a vicious cycle of just needing to grin and bear it.

Upon graduation I had to move back home suddenly to take care of family matters and it feels like I‚Äôve been in survival mode ever since. I also got stuck in my shitty ass town and couldn‚Äôt move back to the metroplex because I ended up having to raise a sibling. 

I have since worked at multiple jobs, starting with child protective services, then moving to a different sector in the child welfare field. I wasn‚Äôt bad at the positions by any means, but I found myself unhappy all the time and working crazy hours. So I left after three years combined. 

I decided to go into the mental health field then. Went to work at my local inpatient psychiatric hospital and loved my patients, but hated the toxicity of the place. So I went into case management. I ended up despising my workplace because I was also forced to do crisis work after hours on a rotation and case management at the same time. At this point my sibling graduated high school in May of this year. So I moved in June back to the metroplex. 

I now work in case management in a more leadership role. And I do like it more than my previous positions, but‚Ä¶. I still hate case management. I have been trying to get my masters in counseling, but I just feel so unmotivated and honestly, burnt the hell out. 

I‚Äôm finally in a place in my personal life where I have a great support system and I REALLY want to try to work for a university (it would be amazing if I was able to go back to my alma mater but I‚Äôm not hopeful) in a more supportive administrative role. 

Has anyone done something similar? Or gained essentially their entire working career in one field only to completely flip flop around? I just feel really discouraged and frustrated with myself that I can‚Äôt hack it basically. I feel like there have been signs that I wasn‚Äôt meant to be in this field and I‚Äôve just ignored them, which makes me feel like I‚Äôve ruined my chances. 

tldr; I feel trapped working in the mental health field and want to try to work at a university in an admin role. But I feel like I waited too long to start the change.

1epvmyl,Manager irritating and harassing me. What do i do?,"Hello I work at a FANG software company. My boss recently has been very much getting on my nerves to the point that it is causing extreme emotional distress on the daily. I am a female and i have been in the industry for around 8 years. Recently, my boss keeps making rude, and often uncanny, hyberbolic statements relating to my work. For example, saying things like ""my takeaway is that you haven't done anything"" and then proceeding to lecture me in front of my peers during our standup meeting about clearly documenting work. This is absolutely not true as I have multiple documents, and pages and tons of comments documenting my work from my daily work dating back months. Meanwhile there are multiple people on my team that haven't written a single word about their work. But it is clearly targeted towards me and me only. He is purely saying it to be spiteful and build a case against me and make me look back to my peers. 

My belief is that it's because i do have a physical illness that requires me to work from home despite the company initiative to drive people back into the office. I suffer from a disorder that sometimes leaves me bedridden, but it doesn't necessarily stop my ability to work but sometimes I will have to take off of work and last year i had to take a whole month off because of it. I have been able to clearly work though, and i do get my work done and do what im asked to do. But i believe he is trying to slowly build up a case against me.

  
He spends alot of time making very rude remarks, often micromanaging my behavior, and lecturing me about very trivial things for no clear reason. Like yesterday he made some rude remarks about me using the company internal meeting tool instead of using outlook. There is no downside to using this tool, in fact me and my peers only use this tool. It was clearly just a display of power and served no purpose to our discussion but to assert dominance over me.

  
I dont know what to do, or how to bring this up to HR or if there really is anything i can do. It is getting to the point where he will make a comment in our meetings and im getting so distressed by it that i cant work or think straight and im having to take off work just to manage the frustration and anger this individual brings me. 

  
And yes, before you say it, i have brought it up on multiple occasions to him in attempts to try and tell him how i feel but he gaslights me and plays victim every time. 

  
What do i do? Do i quit? Do i talk to hr? I really dont want to quit because ive been sending out resumes for the last month and havent even gotten an interview. I think the job market is really not good right now so i feel i have no choice but to just accept this abuse.

1epvcy2,33 and stuck,"First time post but I feel I get the best answers from the reddit community.

I am 33 years old with 2 children and I am currently a general manager of a well known restaurant chain. 
I have been a general manager for a long time in multiple different brands in hospitality and leisure and I have been very successful in every role.

Now I want to prioritise my family more as being a successful GM in hospitality requires a lot of evening and weekend hours and I feel like I miss so much time with them. 
I earn around 40k which is a comfortable salary for us but this also means that in order to change careers, I can only really afford to drop to about 35k.

I am struggling to find a career change that meets both these requirements and have been rejected for well over 100 job applications where I feel that my skill set is transferable. 

I guess my question is: How do I make this career jump without putting my family at financial risk?

I am happy to learn, to study, to start from the bottom but I can't seem to find the right opportunity or support. 

I'm miserable every day at work but I need to protect my family. I feel trapped and I don't know how to start the process of getting out.

1epv5i5,"Four levels of white collar employees at a large company, which one are you? [Humorful, but somewhat based on real experiences]","If you work in a white color job at a large company, its important to be able to realize what category of employees you are working with to be able to understand their motivation. Employees can go from category to category, they are not always stuck in one category, although lack of intelligence may prevent the employee from leaving category 1 or category 2. Also, there is not one ideal category to strive to be in. All these categories are bad in their own way. I made this based on my own experiences and talking with a few of my friends. I myself like most employees are in category 1, but pridefully like to that that my hamster wheel is spinning faster.   
  
**1. Hamster:**

The employees are stuck in a hamster wheel, working on their tasks. Cannot see the big picture of how the tasks they do are usually partly or fully meaningless. If you explain to them how the task they are doing is meaningless (which is never recommended due to the negative effect this will have on the company), sometimes this level of employee may understand and get mad at having to do this task, then after the task is complete/or they are reassigned, they jump on to the next meaningless task and are happy they are now working on something they think is important (they fail to recognize how this new task is unimportant without a smarter employees help). Some of the hardworking hamsters spin their wheels at a faster pace, which is obviously useless. Usually, this employee is not the brightest, (think your average employee). This employee can be identified as usually having strong authentic company pride and having strong belief in their company. ""CEO really personally cares about me"". Employees that are sticklers for following everything by the rules/book and trying to make sure everyone else also follows every single guideline perfectly (even when this is obviously not needed and may only increase cost and time ‚Äúred tape‚Äù) also fall into this category. This type of employee fails to see how following every single individual project step in the perfect manner does not always lead to best overall project result. Not all ‚Äúhamsters‚Äù are sticklers for following all the rules though. Actually, the majority of ‚Äúhamsters‚Äù are either not smart enough to know all the rules they need to follow, or they purposely choose to not educate themselves fully on them, or turn a blind eye ‚Äúsubconsciously‚Äù.  
  
**2. ""Enlightened"":**

The employee while performing the task realizes that the task is usually meaningless (just feels the task was created to give someone work/assigned carelessly). This employee is unsure of or lacks the motivation to find a way how to make the task easier to perform, or successfully eliminate the task all together. This employee may sometimes struggle to be promoted, since they sometimes may voice their displeasure to their boss or go on rants of how the work they do feels unimportant and meaningless. They are sometimes not able or lacking the motivation to formulate a solid solution to make the task easier or replace it, so they are therefore just an annoyance (unlike a level 3 or level 4 employee). It is bad having this employee in a large company cause they lower company morale, which causes more lazy employees. Also, there is a high liability for this level of employee to become lazy, because they may not at the time be smart enough to realize that they will get more satisfaction from actually working, even if the task is meaningless (unlike a level 4 employee). Also, it is a catastrophe if this employee is promoted to a management role.  
  
**3. Team Problem Solver or Go Getter:**

Fairly smart employee who is a problem solver and a very hard worker. Someone who everyone thinks is smart and good at solving problems and good at their job. This person tries to find meaning in their work by making tasks easier to perform for themselves or others, or realizes the task is meaningless and eliminates/reduces the work for it, so that everyone else will have more time to start on new ""more important"" tasks (note the quotes around more important). This employee while smart is still missing the big picture though (wasting the large company‚Äôs money (see NOTE1), and overworking). This employee usually gets recognized for their ""work ethic/problem solving abilities"" and may get promoted faster than the other level employees. Although this is not the case if the boss is averse to ""improvement"". Usually, this employee becomes discouraged and joins a faster paced smaller company or becomes a level 4, or level 2 employee after stupidly overworking themselves for too long.  
  
**4. Lazy Individual Problem Solver:**

This level of employee is smart enough to complete their work in far faster times then the expected time (same as the problem solver, they are usually (not always though) smart enough to problem solve their task by making their tasks easier/quicker to perform). But unlike the problem solver, they realize that parts of the hamster wheel should not be removed (such as eliminating a useless task or making a task easier to perform for someone else, even if they see how this would be done). This is either because they subconsciously understand NOTE1 or they are lazy, or because they realize that the meaningfulness of the feeling of success or happiness after completing a task would be lost. Work would just be so boring, and overall company morale would be reduced with always bored employees. Low company morale encourages laziness. Also sometimes this employee will struggle to work with teams or dislike working with teams and may prefer working on projects by himself.  
This employee would come off as an average worker, who always does his job, who may seem a tiny bit lazy (never seems to be overworking always seems underworked, cause almost always they seem to have extra time on their hands). This employee may also seem a little unsatisfied but never voices his opinion. This employee is sometimes unsatisfied because they complete the tough tasks fast and they do not get the same feeling of satisfaction as someone who spends more time to complete a task. (Think what feels mentally better, solving a problem that takes a long time, or solving a problem that takes a short time?) Usually lack of ambition or laziness prevents this employee from becoming a level 3 employee. Also, usually this employee is scared to quit their job and join a startup, because they know they do not have as strong as a work ethic/ambition as a level 3 employee.  
  
**NOTE1** You might ask, ""making the hamster wheel employee's tasks easier will get these employees to have an easier job, and this will get the company to save money on these tasks?"". But, no it would not. It likely would lead to new useless tasks being created and delegated (this is so company morale is not lost). The workers would still be stuck on a new hamster wheel, but since it takes more time/money to get these new hamster wheels spinning, then to keep the old ones spinning, more money would potentially be wasted by the company by starting new meaningless tasks. An example of this is, new resources being purchased to perform these new tasks.  
The hamster wheels must always be kept spinning at a big company, this keeps morale high, and employment high so that the company gets more recognition and commemoration (awarded more work).  
  
**Honorable mention**  
*Lazy employee:* This is a subcategory of a level 1 or 2 employee who has no motivation to perform his job, either just naturally lazy (subcategory of 1) or realizes that the job is pointless (subcategory of 2). Still missing the bigger picture, this employee is just constantly bored at work and not getting rewarded with the feeling of success a hard-working employee gets after completing a tough (abet usually meaningless) task. Gets promoted at normal/or slightly slower than normal rate in case of 1 or gets fired first during layoffs in the case of 2.

*Nefarious Employee:* This employee category is rare, and it means an employee trying to sabotage their company. Note this does not include employees unintentionally sabotaging the company, cause most employees are actually unintentionally sabotage the company in some way just by their existence.",Large_Cantaloupe8905,1,0.6000000238418579,4,1723409508,2024-08-11 20:51:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1epv5i5/four_levels_of_white_collar_employees_at_a_large/,8,2024

1epss08,Need advice about co workers ,"I am looking for advice on how to work better with my co workers.
I have been a professional nanny for 18 years. I have worked alone for the best part of those 18 years, having sole charge of children-this is quite normal in my particular field. 
I have always had families glowing about what I bring to the job and have always felt very proud and confident in what I do.

Until this year. I‚Äôve had trouble finding the right family fit. I have now started a new job where I am working as part of a team of child carers. 

I am really struggling with this new role. I constantly feel talked over by all three of my coworkers. I will be mid sentence and a coworker will frequently interrupt that sentence-often with something completely different. I have also found that when I am addressed directly, I start to open my mouth to reply and am talked over. This is a frequent occurrence and it is really getting me down. I have tried being more forward-please don‚Äôt interrupt me. I have also tried letting them finish then using ‚Äòas I was saying-‚Äò

We had a new co worker come in today. She is completely new. Yet the interrupting has constantly happened today. I was also told by the boss that I am the lead this week yet it‚Äôs like she has been trying to tell me what to do all day and also been questioning things I‚Äôve been doing which she has no right to be. For example, getting all children to partake in tidy up- or just the oldest.

All of this lately has really taken a knock on my confidence which has meant I‚Äôve dropped the ball on (albeit very small things) a couple of times-it‚Äôs usually because I‚Äôm thinking in my head, why has it happened again. It‚Äôs really really getting to me.

I am trying to be more forward. I don‚Äôt want to be a pushover. I am very mindful to not interrupt my colleagues.

As the title says, i dont have a specific passion.
Im currently in my second year of electrical engineering in a 3 years program(in france a bachelor is 3 years long). Im willing to at least finish my degree even though i dont really LOVE electrical engineering, but whatever in already halfway through it. But after that i have no idea what to do. Im an international student in france so i cant exactly work full time to at least have some money later on. Im willing to leave france but i dont know where to go. Having a very weak passport and a corrupted home country, im feeling pretty lost. What i love is dynamic jobs, a job that requires moving around and traveling even to remote areas. I just hate sitting someplace all day. I thought of maybe moving to a country in east asia maybe hong kong or south korea or japan, but im so lost i dont even know if its possible, i have an algerian passeport and i cant do anything with it, i have living in france, but having studied in a french high school and obtaining a french high school diploma it was the only logical choice. Living alone in france is hell. I feel pretty depressed all year long, i have no idea how i survived last year. Ive never felt safe in france even though i live in a good neighborhood. I wna leave as soon as i get my diploma but i dont know where to go, i maybe wna pursue a masters degree. But i dont know where, my uncle lives in canada and he always tells me that if i want to study there he can help. But i don‚Äôt know. I dont feel like i belong anywhere. Having left my home country when i was 10. I dont feel like i belong anywhere. I just wanna go to a calm place when i can live peacefully in security and not be scared to get robbed or hell even killed when im outside (coz yeah this happens daily in france).
Also i would love to maybe study a masters in south korea/japan or hong kong in the future but i think its maybe way too competitive for me. Does anyone know?

I'm having some trouble making a decision. I've been trying to figure out the pros and cons and decide for a month now. I just need some other perspective. 

I currently hold a BSCS (Computer Science) that I received from WGU earlier this year. I figured the degree on my resume would get me past some HR filters and at least get me one or two interviews. So far I've applied for about a month and a half, probably 300+ apps with no response. I have no internships because I tried to get through school ASAP because I didn't want to have to deal with one or two more terms so I accelerated in one term. So I have a degree, personal projects, and unrelated job experience. 

I'm in my early 30's so I don't want to waste more time. I spent my 20's doing personal training and coaching and I didn't see that as something I wanted to do with my life. 

My pivot options in my head are going into accounting or nursing. Both seem like stable careers. Accounting seems like it might have also been affected by the white collar layoffs or something, so entry level might be in a similar situation to CS but I'm unsure. The accounting sub seems to say that it's all good, just get an internship, but I'm unsure if these are people who have their own interests in mind or just don't know what's actually happening because they have experience. 

Nursing seems to be very stable but it'll take a lot longer. I'd likely be doing a minimum of 1 and 1/2 years to 2 years of school no matter what. Accounting I'd do at WGU which would be faster if I accelerate again but I'd really prefer not to get two degrees in one year and have them both be somewhat useless because of the market. 

I'm unsure if anyone has been in my shoes before, but I'd love to just bounce some thoughts off someone.

1eps88a,Exit interview - To decline/accept?,"I handed in my resignation end of this week for a role that I loved but my manager was impossible to work with - he harassed me on multiple occasions, was disrespectful, didn't notify me of any clear deadlines, tried to throw me under the bus on emails for shit I never did, took credit for all my work, etc.. 

I had put in the harassment complaint to HR but they came back with the conclusion your boss shouldn't have yelled at you in front of everyone, but roles in finance are stressful and things like this are bound to happen and both of you are new here. Basically it sounded like they were trying to defend my boss. I also brought up how he is trying to get me into shit for things I didn't fuck up on and if you look at original data or files, you can follow the trail on who it was. HR completely ignored this concern. I asked for summary of what was discussed as response to my email. HR refused. 

Ever since my boss found out I complained to HR, he just started going after me more and his way of working is one on one onsite meetings, so he could cover his track I imagine. 

HR asked my last day be end of next week despite the 4 weeks I gave in as mentioned on my contract and requested an exit interview. I don't really know what to expect out of exit interview and should I be accepting or declining it? Is it mandatory?

I recognize that I was a bit of a job hopper, but I eventually worked my way up to an Accounting Manager position at a private equity firm.

Since then, I've been struggling to land interviews for similar roles, and the positions I am getting offered pay significantly less than what I was making before.

So i have a choice to make and it makes mw nervous and anxious af. 
So im currently a line cook in a famous restaurant in my city and the team im with is almost perfect for me. 
Though i would like to try something different thats more appealing to me.

I found a bakery/pastry shop which is more in line with what i want to do, and they told me that it will open at the end of August (24th).
Before i started working in my current position in the restaurant, i made it clear that i will work for them until the end of August, and then we will talk again. Ideally they would prefer me to work for them until the 15th of September.

Problem is that the new employer wants me to start asap (when it opens, either on the 24th or the week of 26th- ).

The new job will definitely pay better and will be more into what i like but my current position isnt bad at all and the team im with is excellent, every day i learn something new.

My aunt and uncle even tried to pay for me to go to Stanford for a law and trial program (covid prevented me from being able to go). Either way, it was something I have talked about for years. 
Because of my chosen path, I decided to minor in Criminology for my undergrad. I have only been here one year (starting my second) and am beginning to wonder if I really want to be in law. I'm good at it (my brain definitely has a nac for finding stuff in the law to either get someone in our out of trouble), but I just don't find the work super appealing. I could definitely do it for the rest of my life, but I feel like there are other careers I would much rather pursue. 
When I was younger, I really wanted to be in the army, but my mom always told me that women shouldn't be in the army, so after a while, I stopped chasing the dream. It's still something I kind of want to do, but I feel a little too old for it now. Besides that, I've also considered trying to work for the FBI, or some other criminal related career path that would allow for a more active work environment. 
I don't know if I should just stick with the law path, or if I should go for a different path, and if I do go for a different career path, how should I tell my family. They won't be happy, because of how much money we've poured into me being a lawyer, on top of the fact that I'm choosing a risky field.

People keep saying to switch to real estate but I don't know if my introverted personality would be successful in that field. 

I've done some research but would also love to hear from someone else's experience.

1epkh21,Starting from scratch at 25; Looking to get to Investment Banking or MBB (Top3),"

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm 25 years old and looking to transition into investment banking or consulting, but I‚Äôm starting from scratch with no relevant experience or connections. I‚Äôm eager to hear from anyone who has made a similar transition or has advice on how to get started.

Here‚Äôs a bit about me:
- Background: I‚Äôve had a few different jobs but am currently working as a customer service rep handling invoices and AR/AP work in a financial call center setting.

- Skills: I don‚Äôt have specific hard skills yet, but I‚Äôm very willing to learn and grow. My strong suit is my soft skills, including communication and problem-solving.

- Education:  I‚Äôm essentially starting from zero. I did one semester of community college but had to leave due to health issues, resulting in a poor academic record.

I‚Äôm looking for guidance on how to break into these fields, including what degree I should pursue for undergrad and the best steps to take afterward. I‚Äôm open to starting from entry-level positions or internships and am ready to put in the work to build relevant skills.

Any advice on degree programs, networking strategies, or resources to help me on this path would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help!

1epjy53,Almost 25 and no idea what to do with my life ,"Hey everyone, it‚Äôs been 2 years since I graduated with a degree in law. I‚Äôve been working in customer service for the majority of these 2 years and I genuinely do not have any idea as to what to do with my life, and I don‚Äôt want to stay stuck in customer service. Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with it, it‚Äôs just not for me. My position currently pays well for someone my age and I‚Äôm good at the job, I just don‚Äôt feel fulfilled. 

I‚Äôm conflicted on whether I should pursue a career in law or not as I never really saw myself in law, more-so business or civil service, something along those lines. I‚Äôm applying but I don‚Äôt seem to be getting anywhere despite getting decent grades at uni and the online assessments are pretty difficult. The job market in the UK seems pretty fucked rn which doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping my case. I‚Äôve considered doing a masters but I don‚Äôt really have a set masters I want to study. I also live at home with my family and I‚Äôm getting increasingly desperate to move out and be independent, which I never have done due to anxiety issues. Any advice for someone in my situation? I‚Äôm just mindful of the fact that employers don‚Äôt like it if it‚Äôs been more than 2 years since graduation and you haven‚Äôt really done anything with the degree for grad schemes etc. 

TLDR: turning 25 at the end of this year without any set career or plan, making me anxious and increasingly desperate. Any ideas or tips would be greatly appreciated.

1epfhx5,I'm scared of being poor and not doing enough about it ,"I'm 25 (F) and I feel like I'm not where I ought to be in life. I finished my master's degree a year ago next month and I'm still working a minimum wage part time customer service job, like pretty much every other job I've ever worked. I look at job advertisements and everything that pays more and is at least somewhat interesting requires either years of experience or qualifications I don't have and can't easily obtain. I am currently working in a wildlife park that I get the bus to since I can't drive and couldn't afford a car anyway, always asking to work 5 full days a week, covering shifts, doing 12 hour days on Saturdays, whilst volunteering one full day a week in the conservation sector in the hopes that it might lead to a conservation career in the future. 

My role as a volunteer mainly consists of going around the water vole yard with a wheelbarrow and giving food to the voles, removing old food and replacing their water, cleaning the cages, washing up in the yard, wheelbarrowing large sacks of old vole excrement, straw, and wood chip around, and replacing food in the dormice enclosures. I don't know if I'm reading the situation wrong, but I often feel like I'm more of an inconvenience to them than a help. The girl I communicate most with in the yard has a nervous energy and sometimes either massively over explains things or assumes that certain things are obvious when they're not. I often feel like the people who work there don't know what to do with me because I often complete jobs quickly. It makes me unsure of where I stand or what is expected of me, and whether progression is actually possible or if I'm just fooling myself, when maybe what I should be doing is applying for full time jobs regardless of what they are. 

I want to move in with my partner in a year's time since I currently live with 4 other girls who are younger than me and not the cleanest or most responsible, and my relationship with them is awkward at best. I don't really have any friends other than the friendly but surface level relationships I have with my coworkers. I'm currently booked in to speak to my doctor about getting a referral for an autism assessment (which I've made several attempts over a decade to obtain). I already feel like an alien, and I just want a better life for myself where I can afford a home that I feel safe in and be close to my support system and work a job that I feel some fulfillment out of, and I don't think customer service is it, but I don't know what else to do with myself. 

I don't really know if this is a normal feeling. Is this just what being 25 feels like? ",mysticalcritter,0,0.33000001311302185,9,1723363184,2024-08-11 07:59:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1epfhx5/im_scared_of_being_poor_and_not_doing_enough/,8,2024

There has apparently been alot of discussions about the fact I work remotely, mainly from the new manager. I get the impression he assumes because I am remote, I‚Äôm not working. He has been with the company 2 weeks, and has avoided having any conversations with me, and has no idea what I even do on a daily basis. He‚Äôs started changing how things are scheduled without notifying me, and having meetings with my co-workers without including me. 

A few days ago I received an email from the business consultant with my boss and new manager cc‚Äôed. It basically stated there will be some changes in the coming weeks, and attached was a job posting of my exact job with IN OFFICE ONLY as one the requirements. No one spoke with me about anything before I received this email, or reached out after it was sent. 

I called my boss and told her I assumed from the email I received they are looking to replace me, so I was giving my 2 week notice. She acted offended and shocked and said she didn‚Äôt even know about the email, then promised me she‚Äôd ‚Äúfind something else for me to do‚Äù.

I asked for 2 days off for a small vacation in those 3 years, and it was a huge problem because there‚Äôd be no one to answer the phones.

I am the VP of Operations there, and have been for the past 2.5 years. We're a really small company - we only have three employees, including myself, the CEO and the Founder. I have helped with so many different things in this role, including accounting, recruiting, customer success, SOP development, compliance, etc., but can't say that I'm truly a master at any one of these things.

  
When I look at JDs for other VP of Operations roles at other companies, I tend to feel intimidated, and underqualified. I haven't really managed a team of full time employees at any point in my career (except for a failed 6-week stint at company in Dubai during which I had 20 or so full time employees reporting to me - but that's another story), so that's a big weakness in my application.

Some things I'm good at: very strong excel skills, strong writing skills, good people skills, fairly good at designing operational processes, customer service. If anyone is serious about offering advice, I'm happy to share my resume.

  
I currently make $105k and am trying to figure out how I can earn more. I'm in the middle of a conversation with my current employer about a raise, but I'm not feeling optimistic that I'll get anything meaningful. I'm looking at other companies and applying, and a couple companies have given me multiple interviews, but both rejected me (one was a director of operations role at a nonprofit, and they ended up hiring someone with much more relevant experience than I have; the other was for a VP of operations role at a tutoting startup - I felt that this one was a near-perfect fit, but they rejected me due to lack of experience managing large teams).

I'm feeling a little lost and overwhelmed about what my next move should be. What is the best use of my limited time? Should I just grind it out and apply to jobs broadly? Should I try to go back to school in some form to grow my skill set? Is there a specific type of job I should be targeting based on my skillset? Should I see a career coach? Should I try to get a side hustle?

I'd love to hear from anyone who has been here before and gotten to a better place. My goal, obviously, is to earn as much as possible, but what if I could get to around $150k as a next step, I'd be happy.",musicalspheres,3,0.8100000023841858,3,1723327832,2024-08-10 22:10:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ep4sc5/38m_wanting_to_earn_more_whats_my_best_bet/,8,2024

1ep19b9,Considering moving back to tech,"Hi everyone, 

Trying to get myself out of this limbo for 6ish months and a friend suggested this might be a good platform to get some advice. 

I‚Äôm a 30 yo biz grad from Pakistan who started working with a now subsidiary of uber as a performance analyst back in 2017. That built my foundation of working with tech startups which I pretty much fell in love with. Then i moved to Unilever as Jr. Manager Insights and analytics for a couple years only to realize i don‚Äôt like big corporations and love the idea of working with startups to consistently iterate and scale digital products. 

In 2019, i got an offer from a dubai based mass transit tech startup to go and launch their ‚Äòuber for buses‚Äô product in kenya. Which i took in a heart beat ofcourse. Scaled the team, operations and product for the next two years. This really elevated my confidence. Spent another year with the same startup in Dubai pretty much working in Product Operations before 80% of workforce was laid off including me in May 2021. 

Being from a third world country, at this point the thought of moving back to Pakistan was v dreadful so i had applied for canadian immigration on the side. 

I get my PR after a week of being laid off in dubai. I moved to Toronto and started searching for work. I was so traumatized by tech at this point due to the lay off that i barely had the energy to take more risks even though im naturally a risk taker, i find risks very thrilling. 

My goal was to find something stable so i landed a role with Sun life financial as a data analyst. Mind you, this is completely opposite to the tech environment, extremely slow paced and the only appealing part was a steady pay cheque which I needed as an immigrant in Canada with the whole situation. 

As of today, I‚Äôm almost 18 months into my job and 2 years in the country. My dissatisfaction has only grown with the organization even though I have a great work life balance but the nature of work, remuneration and lack of innovation and experimentation causes the dissatisfaction.

I‚Äôve been trying to ask myself all these questions and i have realised i really like digital product management and the tech industry. 

The dilemma is if I should move back to tech or not, im not sure how turbulent the industry is at the moment. One more lay off might shake my confidence. Although getting into product management isn‚Äôt that easy itself so i will probably have to invest a lot to get in. Any thoughts or advice would be really helpful here or even any clarity on my approach!

2. She walks with the customers around the buildings sometimes.
3. She dresses like extremely formally

1eowla8,Honest help for my career. (Creative field),"Hello everyone. I‚Äôm writing this post in hopes that I can receive some advice on what I should do to reach my goals for my career. I, [21F] am currently in my last year of college at my university and will hopefully graduate in the spring with a degree in English Creative Writing in hopes of becoming a novelist. I know that the career I have chosen is not one known to make a ton of money because it‚Äôs in a creative field and relies entirely on talent and opinions, however it‚Äôs what I have decided that I want to do in life. 

My main question is about what kind of jobs that I can do in the meantime that would allow me the income I need to support myself while I write. I currently work in fast food, (I have worked in it over a year now). however I am not satisfied with the work or the pay. I am wondering if anyone knows the type of job I could do that could grant me time to write while working if this is at all possible. 

I am not trying to ‚Äúnot do the work‚Äù of course however I was reading Stephen King‚Äôs memoir and he detailed how he worked at a laundromat and in between the loads of clothes he would find time to write. 

If also possible I would also be looking for a career in editing, publishing, or at literary agencies. The whole core of my search, I guess, would be to locate a job a little more closely associated with writing or publishing, so that I can get closer to my true aim in life. I understand that even though I will have a degree that degrees themselves (especially in my case) do not mean that you will succeed, and that it still will take a lot of hard work. 

For reference, in my writing journey I have just completed my first novel and am in the planning stage for my second and third books. I am also the vice president of the creative writing club at my university.

1eowhj4,Is it normal to yell before heading into work?," I might get blown up for this post but wanted to post anyway.

I have a pattern where i would regularly yell viscerally at top of my lungs before heading to work and wanting to punch stuff as i get tired of the  routine. It will get to the point where my throat gets sore. Do you guys often feel the same way? It seems it doesn't matter what type of work i do as I tried office work, retail, warehousing, outdoor work, non stressful and stressful, easy or challenging.I don't particularly hate anything in those jobs either.Is this behaviour normal?

And yes my account is burner for obvious reasons.

1eowbva,Need advice navigating office politics amid promotion ,"Need Advice!

Context:

I work in HR for a mid-sized company in the Southern U.S. My job is fine, though it‚Äôs a bit boring as it‚Äôs not very challenging. I report directly to a Senior VP, who in turn reports to the CEO. There‚Äôs also an AVP who reports to my boss. I hold a Senior Lead title. I‚Äôm very appreciative of my boss, as he provided me with this opportunity and has been understanding about work-life balance. However, due to personal matters, my partner and I are facing increased financial needs.

The Story:

Early last week, I received an email from the CEO requesting a meeting. I mentioned it to my boss as a courtesy. He told me I might be in line for a promotion that would have me reporting directly to the CEO and warned me that working with him can be challenging.

Later that day, I met with the CEO, who offered me a newly created AVP role with a 40% pay increase‚Äîa game changer for both my career and life! I was told that I would be inheriting 60% of my boss‚Äôs portfolio due to ‚Äústructural changes.‚Äù I was incredibly excited. The CEO asked me to give him an answer within three business days.

During my one-on-one with my boss, he seemed clearly frazzled and asked about the meeting. It was palpable. On the same day, I scheduled a meeting with the other AVP to understand the CEO‚Äôs dynamics, assuming everyone was already aware of the change, especially since the AVP and my boss are close.

Anyway, the CEO called me later and asked what I shared with the VP because, according to him, the VP ‚Äúseems to be adjusting to the change,‚Äù which I interpreted as being upset. The CEO was adamant about the change and requested that I not discuss it with anyone, except loved ones, until my new contract is finalized and he informs the Board.

The Dilemma:

Now, I have a meeting scheduled with the other AVP, but I‚Äôm thinking of canceling or shifting the focus. I‚Äôm nervous about sharing anything since the AVP has to be aware of the changes, and I don‚Äôt want to upset anyone. He even called me on Friday morning to discuss another project and mentioned he‚Äôs looking forward to our meeting next week.

How would you navigate this situation? I don‚Äôt want to upset my boss, but I‚Äôm also wary of the AVP‚Äôs motives. I want to respect the CEO‚Äôs wishes and avoid causing any disruption within the leadership team. I‚Äôm a bit concerned about the dynamics at play, but I also understand that power and money can make people protective of their positions.

Should I still have the meeting with the AVP? If so, what should I focus on? How can I navigate this situation while maintaining a good rapport with my supervisor? I have a feeling he‚Äôll ask questions.",Nov8-1955,1,1.0,4,1723305302,2024-08-10 15:55:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eowbva/need_advice_navigating_office_politics_amid/,8,2024
1eow1v2,Fired after pre-employment drug test.,"Recently, I was let go from a company for testing positive for methamphetamine on a hair drug test.

I only take a prescribed antidepressant 
called Venlafaxine. After speaking with the MRO, she refused to believe that this medication would cause a false positive on my hair test. After a bit of research online, I've seemed to find info contradicting that.

I verbally agreed to this and nothing is in writing yet. Initially I was told A will be away the end of this month and the first 3 weeks of September and B will be away for a week next month. Now, it seems like B may choose to take a week off in October instead and my boss thinks that works better so I don‚Äôt have to do both at the same time.¬†

B and I do the same things but I don‚Äôt really like most of the work and don‚Äôt wanna stay doing it past September tbh. I‚Äôm going to email my boss about only being able to extend my contact until the end of September. I feel like they might ask why I‚Äôm not available past then and what my plans are afterwards. Not sure yet about other opportunities for me at the company but I kinda just feel like leaving altogether (though I feel bad for doing so). I'll probably spend October traveling with my family and after that I'm not sure. I guess I'll apply for other jobs.

1eouvpp,Thinking about leaving admin position but I fear repercussions,"I work as an admin assistant at a small liberal arts college while I pursue my master's degree at the same college. I originally applied for this job because it came with a tuition waiver benefit (I don't qualify for financial aid). Well, when I got the job, I was told I would be working for two departments because there had been massive layoffs and the university couldn't afford admin assistants for every department. That is, three or four positions were consolidated into one. No problem ‚Äî I had seen admin assistants at other universities, and their job didn't seem so bad. Well, it turns out that I am working for two of biggest departments on campus, and one of the departments has a bad reputation for overworking their admins (and sometimes making them cry). Both departments have several events throughout the year that I help to oversee, among other time-sensitive duties. As of late, they have us admins helping with website maintenance ‚Äî designing, fixing broken links, figuring out what's wrong when it's not our responsibility, etc. The web manager ought to be doing this, but his department is understaffed. And why hire professionals when you can just pawn this off on us admins for low pay?

In the meantime, I am juggling my classes, and while I still get As, it is a struggle because school takes a backseat to work. And I am here in the first place to get the tuition waiver. I get paid $29k post-tax, so it's not an ideal job (I wouldn't even be able to afford rent without my husband's assistance). Recently, I applied for an internal position. I received a verbal offer, which I accepted. Two weeks later I get an email from the employer saying that HR was checking my references, and once they did so, they'd extend an offer of employment. I wait. I get another email from HR saying that the employer would like to conduct a second interview. I accept. I think I did okay, but then I receive an email from employer saying they chosen another candidate. I felt my heart sink. New candidate doesn't even have marketing experience, but she does have managerial experience.

Well, this incident further exacerbated my dissatisfaction at work: 1) I am not making enough 2) I am getting more responsibilities piled on me and 3) school, which is the reason I've sacrificed so much for, is taking a backseat. I've been applying for other positions, and I have a couple of interviews. I am afraid that if I quit, the professors will skew my grade or treat me with disdain for having ""abandoned"" them. I am enrolled in some of their classes, and it just so happens that I work for one of the departments that I'm pursuing a master's degree in (it's the department I would be torn to leave).

Do you think this latte scenario is likely? I am in my early 30s, and I have been in the work force for almost a decade, so I can't justify making $29k anymore...",Ok_Tip_6512,2,0.75,8,1723301531,2024-08-10 14:52:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eouvpp/thinking_about_leaving_admin_position_but_i_fear/,8,2024

1eouip2,How to get a job as a Mechanical/Industrial Engineering Master's student with no industry experience?,"I am about to complete my Master's in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering in Canada, focusing on operations research and mathematical optimization. I did not have experience with operations research before my Master's as my undergraduate was in mechanical engineering and am still not sure it is the right field for me or if I have a strong background or knowledge in operations research. Despite maintaining a high GPA and having strong programming skills, as well as experience with optimization software like Gurobi and machine learning frameworks, I have not secured any internships or job offers. My only work experience has been as a Teaching Assistant.

I have gained project experience in areas such as robotics and machine learning applications in healthcare, but these have all been in academic settings through coursework. While I have accepted the PhD offer and my advisor believes it is an excellent opportunity for me to expand my knowledge of operations research and that I am prepared to pursue a PhD, having received positive progress reports throughout my Master's, I am more interested in transitioning to industry rather than continuing in academia. My knowledge is mostly theoretical and I also want to gain some practical experience and I think this will also help me keep my options open because I could pursue a PhD later once I gain industry experience and have more time to decide if it is the right path for me. Also, I am mostly sure that I do not want to continue in academia or teaching after my PhD and would want to pursue industry jobs. However, most jobs require experience and I have been unsuccessful in being able to find any job in any field related to engineering, applied science, mathematics, or computer science that I applied to during my Master's or undergraduate studies because of my lack of experience and anxiety during interviews.

Given my lack of practical industry experience, I am wondering how I can best position myself for entry-level roles in fields related to my studies, including engineering, mathematics, applied science, operations research, optimization, or computer or data science.

1eotz7b,What do you suggest? Fin Vs CS,"I have recently completed my undergrad in CS and Business Systems.

Given the current IT market I plan to change my career path to finance. I know its vague and it may seem like I'm the resemblance of the quote grass seems greener on other side. But I kindly request you to hear me out...I just need some of your thoughts and suggestions.

We had finance courses ( OR, Financial and Cost Accounting, Financial Management along with management and accounting subjects ) it seemed little tough but learning about money and getting to know how we can play with the numbers etc got me interested.

While randomly surfing reddit and the net I found the CS field is overly saturated and the competition may increase, whereas in finance I think its not everyones cup of tea ( i mean the initial working hours etc ) and most of them don't choose to go into it. I understand there are CFA etc certifications to stay competitive.

I have also seen scenarios where finance students want to shift to CS. So I'm bit skeptical whether I need to do MFin and change my path to Fin or stay in CS, get work ex in CS (I don't think I can be hired for Fin roles).

There are Quant roles etc which require CS skills so that made me into thinking why can't I use both my CS and Fin skills ( if I do MFin ) and stay in the market. My idea is to work for say 5-10 years and do a PhD and become a professor in Finance. This way I would save money and teach (which I love to do).

So what do you suggest me to do?

Option a -> Stay in CS

Option b -> Well you can try to do MFin in good uni

Option c -> (Kindly mention)

It's become clear to me that front-end development isn't where I see myself long-term, but I'm struggling to figure out my next step.

Things I feel I am good with are:

* Coding
* Numbers and statistics
* Analytical skills and problem-solving

Recently, I've found myself spending a lot of time and deeply interested in areas like:

* stock investing and trading
* personal finance
* crypto ecosystem and Defi

and enjoy learning about these topics. So I am looking for your valuable advice on:

1. Are there career paths where I can combine these interests with my current skills?
2. Is my background sufficient for these roles, or would I need additional qualifications to land these roles? If yes, what are they?

Any other advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. TIA.",ninja_from_india,1,1.0,0,1723284668,2024-08-10 10:11:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eopl59/help_me_find_my_next_career_move_and_transition/,8,2024
1eop0ks,Burned Out and Looking for a Career Shift‚ÄîNeed Advice!,"**29F, Bachelor‚Äôs in Multimedia Design**

I graduated in 2017 and got a job in 2018, mostly thanks to my dad‚Äôs connections. I had the option to work in the Communication and Marketing department, which made sense with my major, but I ended up choosing to work with the Projects and Engineering team in Facilities (health sector). Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt super confident in my design skills, so I went with what felt less risky. 

At first, I loved it. I was a Project Coordinator working with some really awesome engineers, and they became like family to me. That connection kept me going for 3/4 years, even when the job got a bit boring. But then, the director, who‚Äôs a total narcissist, started being a jerk to me. Even my boss noticed it and was confused because everyone knows I work hard and really care about what I do.

Fast forward six years‚Äîone of the engineers I was closest to left last year, and ever since, I‚Äôve felt kind of lost. I‚Äôve realized this isn‚Äôt what I want to do anymore. I talked to my boss about moving into project management, and I even took a PMP course and completed the 40 required hours. (I'm still too afraid to take the exam though...) But with the director being such a pain, especially after he dismissed all the effort I put into a project back in April, I just don‚Äôt have it in me to keep going here.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to learn much more here. I‚Äôm tired of doing the same tasks and handling all the admin work. Back in university, I used to volunteer a lot, write for the school newspaper, and do photography and videography. I miss that creative work, but my CV doesn‚Äôt really show those experiences. I‚Äôve been stuck in project coordination, but I‚Äôd love to move into events or work as a project manager in the arts and culture space. I just don‚Äôt know how to make that transition. My portfolio is outdated, and I‚Äôve thought about reaching out to non-profits to offer my video and photography skills, but I feel stuck. I‚Äôm too social and energetic for a boring office job, but I‚Äôm also scared to make a move. Being 29 freaks me out‚ÄîI‚Äôm not getting any younger. What courses should I be taking? How can I gain experience in that field, especially since I can‚Äôt seem to find jobs in it? Or should I stay in this job and hope that the director leaves so I might get promoted? It doesn't help that I lack confidence and a perfectionist that runs away to avoid failing...",hhbbmm8,1,1.0,0,1723282338,2024-08-10 09:32:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eop0ks/burned_out_and_looking_for_a_career_shiftneed/,8,2024

Hi, completely new to redit so I hope I'm in the right place.

I am have been maintaining C average thus far in my course. I also found out that even if I get my batchelor degree it won't mean squat at the end of the day. I need a master's degree to do anything in the career field I want. I want to do a master's in forensic psychology but even if I just want to do criminology I will still need a master's. It is what I want to do but if I don't get Hd's and D's then is there any point continuing. So I should make another career choice, like study something else but I don't know what.

1eoopmi,Stuck in an awkward spot,"Hello everyone,

So basically for some context. I work at a startup as a product manager. I joined a month and a half ago. I got approached by their direct competitor, offering a higher salary.

Heres the thing, i really dont like where im working at. Everybody is rude, they make horrible decisions, and the product is unfinished and flat out terrible. The competitor is established, very well known and flat out better.

Ive been working my ass off trying to help them. The entire board keeps making awful decisions that I have to babysit them not to do. They're inexperienced and unrealistic in their demands. They get rude when I stand up to them.

I cant leave however. My contract states:

Article 7: Illegal Competition of Work
During the two years following the termination of this contract the Second Party has no right to neither establish nor work in a competitive company running similar activities.

So I feel like im stuck. I could really use the money and the peace of mind by moving into the established company, but it seems like i cant do much. Theres someone who did the switch, but I believe she has a different contract. This is extremely demotivating and I want some advice on how to make the best out of this.

I requested in my email that I be paid owing amounts in my last pay. It will be a couple thousand $. Now the leaders are planning a meeting to discuss if they will pay me.
The company doesn't earn much once they pay all business bills and wages.

My question is if I have electronic evidence I performed the hours, can they refuse to pay it? Do I threaten to go to fair work or work ombudsman?

1eof1un,Two job offers... HELP!,"There is no clear winner... I need advice. The job market sucks, been looking for full time employment for about 3 months. No offers until this week, when I received 2. And they are commission only, not what I wanted, but getting desperate.

Job 1: M-F 8-5. Pretty good commission with some residual period. Well established company with proven system and possibility for up to 500k/yr. Phone calls, setting appointments, driving to appointments, selling advertising/brand marketing, follow up monthly with copy of the ad medium. I have sold advertising before. 

Job 2: W-Su 9-5. Pretty good commission, not sure about residual, but the donor can make recurring donations so maybe. New company, ground floor, with proven system so far, unlimited commission and advancement potential. In person at events asking for donations for a worthy cause. I have never solicited for donations before. Side plus... my youngest kid just got a job with the same days off so I can actually sleep in on my weekend.

Lastly, the economy by most metrics looks bad, and looks to be getting worse. When the economy is bad, I believe advertising sales go down and donations for charity go up. So that is one final bit of info to tip the scales.... Please help?

I am torn. What am I missing? Is my assessment of the economic impact valid? Any advice or insight would be appreciated. Training for the ad job starts Monday, and the donations job on Wednesday.

1eoew60,Needing critiques and advice on a letter I'm writing to my boss regarding my resignation. ,"Hello reddit, I‚Äôm not entirely too sure if this is the correct subreddit (if it is, could you direct me to a better one), nor do I know if this is well written and not too offensive to those who read it. I need someone to proofread a letter I wish to write to my job, and give advice on points I need to make, or things I might ommit/change. I suffer from agoraphobia, among other mental issues, and I wish to give some last words to my boss instead of quitting quietly. I also hope the advice I've given might be helpful or non-offensive to the employer.¬†If this is a stupid idea, feel free to also let me know. 

Each name will be censored to ‚Äún‚Äù and the company will be ‚Äúc.‚Äù If there are any further questions then I‚Äôll answer them as soon as I am able to.¬†

¬†¬†To whomever this may regard,

I understand I‚Äôm not the greatest employee. I come in late, often chronically, and as my depression and mental health have spiked to new lows, I haven‚Äôt been able to properly regulate emotions other than sadness, defeat, or anger. However, I believe given my work effort (or how much you say you appreciate my work) that I should be treated better then what I receive. I have written a list of grievances below for why I have decided to quit. Feel free to shred this, throw it out, pin it on a wall, laugh at it, or whatever you decide to do with it. I simply request to not be contacted or bothered about this, nor any work related issue in the future.¬†

I work in 5 departments, the next highest department I‚Äôve seen a non-manager work in a day is 3. It was ‚Äúx‚Äù, and she was working the Dairy, Deli, and as a bagger. I work as a cashier/bagger (I consider them two sides of the same coin), dairy, frozen, general stocking, and now they are pushing Produce on me.¬†A good portion of these departments require lifting, moving, exposure to cold, or other issues. I might be weak, given that ‚Äúx‚Äù has done it all of his life, but I‚Äôm tired of working this hard for less pay then I would be working elsewhere, and I feel as if **this is performance punishment.** Also, I have expressed a lot of interest and desire to be removed from the register, and you‚Äôve been aware of this since ‚Äúx‚Äù started, or the day you forced me to accept employee of the month (‚Äúx‚Äù, ‚Äúx‚Äù, ‚Äúx‚Äù, ‚Äúx‚Äù, ‚Äúx‚Äù were more than worthy candidates at the time (who already weren‚Äôt given the title), and most still are).¬†

I make $11.00 dollars an hour, people are walking in making more than me.

I feel as if I am the only one who cleans or organizes the backroom, takes out the garbage, or for a while the only one checking dates (‚Äúx‚Äù, ‚Äúx‚Äù, ‚Äúx‚Äù, among others also do it). Everyone else piles their stuff out in front of the back door, and I end up moving most of these things out. I understand why the pallets are left, as most of the staff are older folk, however leaving u-boats, buggies, empty boxes or crates, or a full trash can is rather unfortunate.¬†

The work delegated between day and night shift is absurd, most of the fronting/conditioning and date checking could be done by the night crew during downtime. Even if it‚Äôs for 20 or so minutes a day, the passive progress could keep everything up-to-date.¬†

The sales require far too much energy and memory to keep up with, and why not just make a card for members? We have 3 separate kinds of sales, (app sales, general sales, and flash sales) and most of our customers (especially elderly) can‚Äôt keep up with which ones are which. Kroger¬† and I‚Äôm sure many other retail stores have already done this, and I believe ‚Äúc‚Äù could benefit accordingly from this. It would also make transactions quicker, given that the building is pretty much a faraday shield, and cell service is nonexistent.¬†

I immensely dislike being continuously called over the intercom. I also dislike stopping tasks, and answering my summons means that I have to quit the task at hand.¬†

An increase in pay would have been nice, I worked there for almost two years (started 08/01/2022 (got my old license the same day) and I was gone for a maximum of 3 months) and have only received a dollar raise above standard. An alternative to this could have been a simple raise to $13.50 to match someone like ‚Äúx‚Äù pay, or simply $0.5/$0.25 raise for each department ""c"" wanted me to take would have been acceptable. Other retailers, such as Walmart, Kroger, Winn-Dixie, Family Dollar, and more start out making at least $14.00.

When speaking to some managers about ideas or requests I don‚Äôt feel as if my points are worth any weight. Simply saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a bad idea‚Äù would be preferable to ‚Äúremind me tomorrow and we will do it‚Äù just to push it further back every time as it makes me feel rather pathetic.¬†

I don‚Äôt dislike ‚Äúx‚Äù, he‚Äôs really cool as a person, and it‚Äôs sad both I don‚Äôt know how to talk to people, nor the fact that we didn‚Äôt get many shifts together. However during his shifts, he can be seen outside smoking a cigarette or speaking with customers for a large majority of it. ‚Äúx‚Äù is bad about speaking with customers an excessive amount, but her work effort and drive make up for it considerably.¬†p

From as early as March of this year, I‚Äôve been promised and told of a manager position that obviously never existed. Although ‚Äúc‚Äù is a much more maintained and perfect store then ‚Äúc‚Äù, it only took me a week for the approval of a switch there. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs to keep me in line, motivate me, annoy me, or if I‚Äôm simply too bad of an employee to be promoted; however it makes no sense to show me how to check retailers in, or show me new departments if I‚Äôm not getting promoted.

The general lack of incentive and general morale of employees is deplorable. I‚Äôll give ‚Äúx‚Äù credit, she knows how to run a store, how to run it well. To be honest it‚Äôs the best store I‚Äôve personally been in, and what I‚Äôve heard about reports from either word-of-mouth or eavesdropping in on the conversation credits my aforementioned point. The store is clean, and profitable. However, all of the employees are disgruntled, or from what I‚Äôve seen a majority of the dayshift. Employees with low morale don‚Äôt work, they sit around on their phones or darting out back. They‚Äôll also find ways to fake progress, or start massive group conversations that create a major drop in productivity. It also creates animosity between staff and managers, which has resulted in some really good workers either quitting or planning to.¬†

Ways to improve morale might be to increase pay in regards to performance. Target does this for example, giving tiny cent raises every couple of weeks based on an employee's progress. This incentivizes the employee to work harder, and weeds out employees who don‚Äôt meet your standards (I‚Äôd cap it between $15.00 to $20.00 an hour).  Another could be copied from a retail chain in Korea; they give up to 2 weeks each year in ‚Äúmental health days‚Äù or days that you simply don‚Äôt feel like coming in (outside of sick days). This would make employees who are hitting hard times have a little easier time coping, and making the calling-out process less of a hassle.¬†

When attempting to call out, or schedule out, or simply try and hold a work-related conversation I‚Äôm bullied out of the conversation, and forced into very inconvenient positions that could be avoided by simply letting me call out. I‚Äôm a part time employee, and not to mention during the days I‚Äôm calling out, I‚Äôd like a mental break from whatever it is afterwards. Just say okay, or actually let the other person negotiate instead of talking over them, or hitting them with a ‚ÄúHey Listen.‚Äù

However the biggest way to improve my, and probably other employees' morale, is by properly delegating them. For example, me and ‚Äúx‚Äù like to clean, so delegating our spare time to sweeping/mopping isles or cleaning the back rooms/bathrooms would be better than blocking/date checking. I‚Äôm sure there are employees who would prefer the latter, and instead of idling they could passively perform these tasks. A personal focus of moral (which I‚Äôm sure isn‚Äôt a good work trait) is that I hold myself to a standard. For example, with the blocking/conditioning of the store. I like to remove each item, and properly arrange it by tag to help keep it looking nicer longer as the item continues to sell. I also believe that it made the process quicker for others afterwards, as most of the items would be towards the front. Another is mopping, spot-mopping doesn‚Äôt feel like an effective use of my time, however if you‚Äôd let me mop an entire aisle, one at a time, it would stop the process from feeling so off. I know this sinks a lot of time that could potentially be used elsewhere, but it would occupy my free time, and stop me from asking ‚Äúanything else‚Äù so often.¬†

‚ÄúC‚Äù has been good to me for the most part, giving me the work experience needed to thrive, the ever changing environment that motivates me to work (minus the aforementioned points). I also matured to some degree, and recessed in others, both as a person and worker. I‚Äôm thankful towards everyone around me for tolerating me, especially during 2024. Once again I wish to leave no real animosity here, and this was more of a calm response than the coup-de-grace I would have given if said in the heat of the moment.¬†

I wish you all many wonderful years to come,¬†

Sincerely, Sam",xXISammyIXx,1,1.0,3,1723247399,2024-08-09 23:49:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eoew60/needing_critiques_and_advice_on_a_letter_im/,8,2024

1eoetil,My future career is dying,"Hi everyone.

I wanted to get some advice about my career going slowly extinct.

Basically, the point of having a good career is just enjoying what you do, right? They say, love your job, so that you are happy working in it.

I do what I love - I‚Äôm studying to be a musician. However, I think I am going straight into a dead end here. Important, that I live in a country where only pop/wedding music is appreciated, and I‚Äôm not really going to step down to that. (No offense to people who like that music).  Also, going abroad is out of the question. I‚Äôm a patriot and I will live in my country. Fact is, no matter how skilled I will be, there will just be no people to listen to me, for me to really earn enough to live comfortably.  I know this, because even crazy talented people from countries like USA sometimes go broke.

Is it really worth sticking with it till the end? Or should I just turn around now, study something else and hate my job, but earn good money to provide for my family?",kristupasxdd,1,1.0,0,1723247191,2024-08-09 23:46:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eoetil/my_future_career_is_dying/,8,2024

1eobxbu,Thinking about changing majors.,"I‚Äôm in a dilemma and I need help.

Hello, everybody. I've fallen into a dilemma over my major and I need people's input, since my family couldn't care less.

I'm starting college soon, and I thought I was set on what I wanted and needed to do, which was marketing, but that changed last night. I was organizing myself and trying to learn different things that would put me ahead or make me stand out more. I was looking at YouTube videos, books, and online posts, and then I came across a post here on Reddit about how the marketing industry is not doing well at all. There's no demand, but a lot of supply, and it wasn‚Äôt guaranteed that I would get a job right out of college. After I saw that, I started looking more in-depth into it, and everything I found made it clear that if I want a good, stable income, I need to choose another career.

I've come from the worst of the worst, and that's a place I don‚Äôt want to fall back into, so I‚Äôm doing as much as possible to do things right. Thankfully, I've got 90% of my college tuition paid off, but the problem lies in my major. As much as I love marketing and digital creation, I‚Äôve realized it might not be the right thing to do. I've started thinking about finance, and it‚Äôs something that interests me. The one thing holding me back is that I suck at math‚Äîlike, really, really bad‚Äîand I‚Äôm guessing that major will involve a lot of math, or so it seems.

So this brings me to my point. Do I stick with marketing, work my ass off, and hope for the best, or do I change my major and trust myself to be able to pull through?

3. Highly varied resume, resulting in failure to reach ‚Äòexpert‚Äô status (English teaching, coaching, serving, sportswriting, customer service, logistics, analytics/scouting)



-basketball analytics/player evaluation experience has featured \\\~5 contracts over 8 years including work for a prestigious company. caveats: never full-time; non-math background. the positions have demonstrated an involved lack of job security, and may not provide optimal work/life balance



4. have interest in taking on classes / seeking extra degree but historically not the most hardworking student as attention span can wane



-studying abroad in Japan was one of the counterexamples to this as class was genuinely enjoyable: small classes, unique forms of expression, desirable work/life balance

1eoajy3,Am i ruining my career?,"
I hate my job with a passion.

I absolutely hate everything about my job that I‚Äôve been at for around 11 months. I‚Äôve wanted to leave since my second week in but held it together because of the risk of not finding one in this economy. I‚Äôve experienced everything from torturous levels of micromanagement to various levels of disrespect and manipulation to sexual harassment. I did raise the flag multiple times and some of these issues were resolved, but experiencing all of these in such a short period of time has made me irreversibly unhappy at the company, in addition to the fact that after abusing my motivation and energy, I‚Äôm currently cast aside as I‚Äôm no longer the shiny new toy to drive raw. I‚Äôm objectively very good at what I do and every year I‚Äôve taken more responsibility and learnt new skills and challenged myself and I‚Äôm a good leader, people never want to leave my team because they are confident in the direction I give and I‚Äôm fair and respectful.

I‚Äôve recently gotten an offer for an IC level role at a bigger company that interests me more.

1eoa2jy,Feeling Absolutely Lost in Career Change,"So to not make this too long, I think I‚Äôm in somewhat of a unique situation. Immigrated to Norway with my partner a year ago. Have a MA in French/background in Edu, had been teaching since 2018. I have known I need a change for a few years, being extremely burnout and feeling like I‚Äôm constantly overworked/underpaid in education (classic teacher stuff). With immigrating to a new country and having to begin learning a new language, I figured I would give it one more year teaching while studying UX through an accredited program and try to make the switch. Although I am an overly realistic if not pessimistic person, I believed my partner and friends/family in Norway who are in tech saying I could do it. WELP here I am with no more teaching contract, zero responses or immediate rejections to internship and junior positions, and just having had a mentor session for UX to evaluate my portfolio, very nicely telling me chances are low since I have no real experience and I need to completely re-format my portfolio.

Basically, I‚Äôm completely lost. I know I should have done more while I was still teaching but honestly I was just in survival mode trying to deliver quality education and care to students while studying and adapting to a new country. Sorry for the rant. 

I would love some perspective from others‚Äô experiences or just some really basic career advice here, since I‚Äôm clearly bad at this stuff lmao. Please be nice, I‚Äôm fragile atm. But wtf do I do?

P.s yes I have tried tutoring/online education etc. I really would like a more financially stable position in the long run",Busy_Ad8436,1,1.0,0,1723235282,2024-08-09 20:28:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eoa2jy/feeling_absolutely_lost_in_career_change/,8,2024
1eoa02e,I USED AI TO AUTOMATICALLY APPLY FOR 1000 JOBS - AND I GOT 50 INTERVIEWS!,"# How Did I Do It?

I created an AI bot that:

* Analyzes candidate information
* Examines job descriptions
* Generates unique CVs and cover letters for each job
* Answers specific questions that recruiters ask
* Automatically applies to jobs

And all of this while I was sleeping! In just one month, this method helped me secure around 50 interviews. The tailored CVs and cover letters, customized based on each job description, made a significant difference.

# AI is Changing the Game

Artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping the recruiting landscape:

* Job seekers can optimize their CVs in seconds
* Cover letters are crafted with a click
* Perfect matching between skills and job offers
* Recruiters are using automated screening systems

This method is incredibly effective at passing through automated screening systems. By generating CVs and cover letters tailored to each job description, my script significantly increases the chances of getting noticed by both AI and human recruiters.

# Questions for the Future

* Will human recruiters become obsolete?
* How will we distinguish real talent in a sea of seemingly perfect applications?
* Are we entering an ""AI arms race"" in recruiting?

# Soft Skills: The New Differentiator?

In a world of AI-optimized applications:

* Empathy
* Creativity
* Critical thinking

Could become the real distinguishing factors.

# Personal Reflection

Observing this technological revolution, I can't help but reflect on the profound implications for the world of work. While efficient, the automation of job applications raises questions about the very nature of professional relationships. We face a paradox: as we seek to optimize the selection process, we risk losing the human element that often makes a difference in a work environment. The challenge ahead is not just technological, but also ethical and social. We'll need to find a delicate balance between the efficiency of artificial intelligence and the richness of human interactions. Only then can we build a future of work that is not just productive, but also fulfilling and meaningful for everyone.

# Want to Try This Magic?

Here's what it does:

* Enter your professional background
* It generates tailored CVs, cover letters, and responses
* Sends hundreds of applications while you enjoy a coffee

Curious? Try it here:¬†[GitHub Project](https://github.com/feder-cr/linkedIn_auto_jobs_applier_with_AI)

(My project is completely free and open source, unlike other similar services that cost a lot and offer very little value. Since it‚Äôs still in beta, every star on GitHub is a huge encouragement to keep developing it!)

When you‚Äôre ready to quit your job because it feels too hard, it‚Äôs easy to feel like you‚Äôre failing

There really is a difference between giving up and choosing what‚Äôs right for you.

I believe listening to your heart, mind, and gut:

Heartache? You might be longing for something different.

Mental exhaustion? Your mind could be telling you, ‚ÄòThis isn‚Äôt right.‚Äô

Physical symptoms? Your body might be signaling it‚Äôs time for a change.

Background:

¬†I am currently have an apartment purchase pending‚Ä¶ hopefully close in a few weeks time. At this current job (A) that I have been with for more than 2 years, I found out earlier this year I was on their layoff list so I started interviewing for practice at my own pace. Earlier this week, I have secured a position with a quasi-government agency in my state (B) that is very reputable and the money & benefits are just good to say no. They are very understanding of my mortgage situation and can wait till 9/23. Then I do have a 3 week notice period in my contract with A. Here are really a few scenarios:

¬†1.  If my closing date can be before 8/30 (50% chance, everyone is trying hard though), then I can give the notice and complete my 3 week notice period 

2.If my closing date is between 8/30 ‚Äì 9/23, then I won‚Äôt be able to give 3 week notice. Not sure how this would turn out. My manager and I are in a really good relationship and I feel so innocent that I am going to screw him over

3. Look into this with my bank -  They did say if prior to closing they found I have a new job then I will need to provide additional details and at least 1 pay stub. I just wonder if there is a chance because this new job comes with more money and being a public sector it provides more job security.

I am definitely tackling this with caution to not risk my purchase and earnest deposit‚Ä¶ but really I want to also move on and leave my current job so that is also a good opportunity for me to jump the ship‚Ä¶.

I have haf issues wbing queer in my woek place. It started with them telling me I wasnt allowed to be seen with my girlfriend in the building due to ""complaints."" They later retracted this rule but am still uncomfortable about it. 
I then asked my managwr for permission to put up photos like the other frint desk person and was told it wast a problem. They were taken down, hidden, and no one said anything to me. I asked around and a shift lead took them down because they needed to be in a frame. So i painted a rainbow frame and put my pictures back up. Every time i come in I have to search for where the pictures are put even when I make sure they couldnt possible be in the way. My manager sides with me but the people who have worked there 10+ years are the issue. My manager sent out an email to state that people are not to toch other peoples items but dont know what that will do.
I sent an email the the Diversity and Inclusion depatment and I know they contacted my boss's boss but no email response. I know a domino effect has begun.
Im currently looking for a new job but trying to fight the good fight because I wont let begits win. Any and all advice would be massively helpful. Can give more details.

1eo7xqo,Feeling guilty about quitting my job for one offering 10k more,"I started working for a small company about 7 months ago. Everyone is super nice and seems to care about each other. No micromanagement or being overworked. 

However, after working there for a bit I realized the company is in the market to sell due to not being profitable enough. leadership is somewhat old and incompetent and there have been no successful projects in years. Everything is over-budget and the review process is honestly pretty concerning considering the field I work in is power and mistakes can be very dangerous and costly. 

We just got bought out by a larger successful company! But I‚Äôm involved with a project that‚Äôs kind of a shitshow (I‚Äôm doing design and project management which 1. I don‚Äôt have enough experience to do project management and 2. I cannot do both at the same time). 

a few weeks ago our boss pulled the team in in for a meeting to talk about why the project is so overbudget. He brought up that our jobs might be at risk if things continue to be that way and we will have some explaining to do to the new company. The team immediately gave me support and actually helped me complete the project. 

I was kind of freaked out so I started applying to other jobs. One of them offered me 10k more and it‚Äôs at a large profitable company that seems to have a better grip on processes. But the Glassdoor reviews mentioned a lot of overwork and uncompensated overtime, and some sexism (both reasons are why I left my initial job to come work at the small company). 

I don‚Äôt know if I should take the offer, I feel like stabbing my team in the back especially after they helped me so much and also I‚Äôm not sure if the company that bought us out would bring in new people to support, or just fire us for the past projects. What would you do?

1eo6fxd,Am I making a mistake leaving my current job for a new one?,"Sorry for the walls of text in advance. 

I‚Äôve been working at my current role for over 4 years and recently I‚Äôve been feeling really burnt out. The culture has degraded immensely over the last 2 years because of changes in leadership, and because of this the overall work environment has been increasingly negative. Leadership is cold and there is little to no direction, leading to confusion and frustration. It‚Äôs just a very depressing and stressful environment overall and to top it all off the pay is shit for my tenure and the work that I do. I recently found another opportunity that‚Äôs more in line with my career and there are quite a few perks that swayed me: 

1. Pay is higher by almost 25%
2. Fully remote (Current job is 3 days in office)  
3. Culture and leadership seems very positive on first impressions.

The only thing is that it‚Äôs 1 year contract role. I‚Äôd still be a T4 employee and have all the benefits that a permanent would get, and the recruiter mentioned that there would be a high chance of extension and flipping to permanent, but nonetheless I am transitioning from a permanent role to a fixed term one. 

I‚Äôve talked it over with many former peers and mentors and they all say that it is a good decision, the only ones who don‚Äôt think so are my Director and one of my coworkers. They‚Äôre largely apprehensive to the fact that is a contract position and that It would be a risk. My director suggested that I should just use that offer as leverage and get a better salary and role at my current company. It sounds compelling, but honestly it doesn‚Äôt address the underlying issues and my gut instincts say that I need a change. 

I‚Äôm currently still living with my parents and don‚Äôt have any major responsibilities, so in my opinion if there‚Äôs any time to make a choice like this in my life, it‚Äôs now. I know that grass isn‚Äôt always greener, but I just can‚Äôt stand work anymore. I can‚Äôt stand going into office, and I can‚Äôt stand the environment.

Right now a lot of the anxiety I have is from my current work wanting me to stay and the points my director raised against the other job. They really really want me to stay and were not expecting me to leave so it just threw everyone for a loop. Since there have been ongoing cuts to the department, they really weren‚Äôt expecting me to leave as well. Honestly I am pretty excited about a new opportunity and team but I feel like the excitement is being hampered down my by my current employer.

1eo5wef,Seeking opinions on leaving current company.,"The ability to WFH is important to me. Earlier this year, my employer announced RTO for those within a commutable distance, and encouraged those hired remote to relocate. While relocation isn't required for those outside of a commutable radius, we were told that those who make an effort to be in-office will be given preferential treatment when it comes to things like promotions and other opportunities within the company. I would have to relocate myself and my family a significant distance to essentially not be a second class employee. This seems wrong.

I now have an offer to return to my previous place of employment. Higher base compared to current, lower overall total comp by roughly 12%.

The question is, do I take my current company's word for it and stay knowing that any future career growth may be stunted, or worse, have the WFH rug pulled out from under me and end up unemployed if they don't keep their word - but keep my current comp. Or... return to my previous employer where WFH is a solidified part of their culture with a reduced total comp but no arbitrary cap on career advancement based on working location",_illusive_man,1,1.0,2,1723225022,2024-08-09 17:37:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eo5wef/seeking_opinions_on_leaving_current_company/,8,2024

1eo4g40,Should I Dropout of Community college for FT salary offer at FAANG via vendor as a Hardware Test Technician. TC85k at 23,"
I come from poverty and have been struggling to pay for my CS classes I have no aid and I pay cash for school. Despite this, I'm progressing well, though slowly, towards my CS associate degree. My plan is to transfer to a state university for a BS in CS after completing my associate's. I still need 17 more credits to graduate with my AS.

The twist: because of an of internship I had and technical work experience , I was offered a full-time position paying $85k/year at a FAANG. 

The company is huge and I feel this experience is once in a lifetime. Someone told me it‚Äôs harder to get anything else after this because it‚Äôs not really computer science, but I disagree.


This feels like an opportunity I can't pass up. I'm thinking I could always go back to finish my degree or do it online slowly if I take this job.

The job involves working on emerging technology, which would really help me finally gain experience in the field I love so much.

I was looking at them and there is a lot of job opportunities in psychology just non of them seem to interest me. So I was thinking about switching my major before this next term starts.

I‚Äôm just having a hard time deciding. Both of these majors pay well I just need to figure out what best suits me.

1eo2ton,In a dilemma whether I should get into Program Management as a CS student.,"Hey guys! I'm a 2025 grad from a tier-3 college in Delhi, India. Ever since the beginning of my college, like all my peers and the general trend in India, I decided that I'll become a Software Engineer. I got into DSA as well as Data Science.

I maintained consistency in my initial days of DSA but as the time went by, it became toxic and burdening for me to maintain all those streaks. By then, it was the end of my second year.

During my 3rd year, I mostly focused on Data Science and got an internship as a Business Analyst and as a Data Scientist (family network :D). Both were in a startup. It was just recently that my 6 month data science internship ended but I didn't learn anything significant there. In fact, I don't even know NLP/CV as I was busy focusing on the basics and getting them cleared.

Now, during the last 3 weeks, I've been exploring other roles like Project/Program Management, Product Management and Product Analysis. I got an interview call for a startup based out of Bangalore for the role of a Program Intern.

I managed to crack the interview and fortunately, they are offering me a stipend of INR 27,500/- per month which is okay as per Indian standards and I'm also eligible for a PPO after interning for 6 months. The only problem? Well I've been preparing for data roles but all of a sudden out of nowhere, I got an offer for a management role.

I've been thinking about it and I didn't had a sleep last night (I got to know about the offer yesterday). Is it worth it to get into Program Management? What is the future scope of it? Am I jeopardizing my future? Well, I don't know the answer to it. I'm just a 20 year old boy who doesn't even know how to turn on a washing machine, let alone cook. I need to report in on 20th August in Bangalore.

What should I do? It feels like a quarter life crisis situation. Something which will have an impact on my life for the foreseeable future. Your advice would matter a lot. Thank you.

  
P.S. - The tech scene is very competitive and bad here in India. I have no additional offers. I would also like to make a switch in to Product Management or Data Science if it's really possible in future.

1eo2dfg,is it normal to use health insurance as a negotiation tactic?,"I am working out compensation for a new job with a smaller company that has so-so health insurance.  I will likely go onto my wifes far superior insurance.

  
I read that health insurance costs small business owners anywhere from 400-1200 a month to provide.  On the higher end that can be more than $10,000.  Is it normal to try and use this as a tool in negotiation for compensation.  i.e. "" I will go onto my wifes insurance and save you $8000 so can we add $6000 to my base and we both win""

  
If so, is there any way to start trying to narrow down what that employer is likely paying?  Aside from asking them.  

  
On a side question, what is the legality of this?  Because lets say we do negotiate that, and then last minute I pull a switcheroo and decide to use his insurance.

1eo1tn5,Event Management - Expectations,"Hello! 

Going through a bit of uncertainty with my job. I am an event manager at a wedding venue company, full service. Pay is $20/hr. 

My question is, other than going into sales, how lucrative is the events business? I love the job and creating fun and memorable experiences especially for hard clients (like a bride!) but it‚Äôs physically and emotionally draining for almost little reward. I‚Äôm a little disheartened and am wondering if it‚Äôs worth it or perhaps its just this company.

I work 40+ hours a week but am reprimanded for going overtime. 
My responsibilities:
- Hiring
- Labor Costs
- Alcohol Inventory and Budgeting
- Training Bartenders/Servers
- Managing Housekeeping
- Managing Landscaping
- General building inventory
- Meetings with brides/couples
- leading team meetings
- Running 3-4 events per weekend (10hr + shifts)

One thing in the back of my head was that I made more bartending in one weekend than I do working fulltime. 

I also hate the constant communication between literally everyone. Even on my days off, I get and expected to respond to emails/phone calls/texts. 

Now I don‚Äôt mind the constant work but my title is event manager and they keep stringing me along with ‚Äúone day you‚Äôll run your own venue‚Äù knowing
1) they have not started building or even acquired land for a new venue
2) they would never promote me unless my boss quit or got fired.

I guess I just want to hear from those in the industry. Can I make a real living off this career? Is it just shitty pay until you create your own company? What better options could there be?

Interested to hear what you think but I also needed to rant a bit.

1eo1nef,Am I being weak or is quitting the right thing to do?,"I work as a graphic design intern & I was informed beforehand that I would also be fulfilling the role majorly as a Ui/Ux designer and less as a graphic designer. Fine by me, since the place is a start-up.

I started my internship 2 months ago and I have realised my manager is way too peculiar about things. At first I thought I was just bad at designing and brushed it off, but he gets extremely nitpicky and can get very rude at times. He just tells me that, I have a big ego and I am not fluid or open to changes. I have shown my rejected work pieces to my old designing buddies and everyone have failed to find anything bad with it.

I have an inferiority complex, how is it an ego? He calls me 10 times a day with more than 1 task. He'll assign me a major task and within the next hour, he gives me another and expects both to be ready. He sits idly the whole day gossiping about marriages with someone else.  
I am pretty sure the dude above him expects the important designs done by him and the less important things to be done by an intern who is still in their third year of a non-designing bachelor's degree. I don't need the money, I wanted to learn and gain experience. They cut seven grand from my meagre twenty grands because I ate lunch at the office and took five days off for my semester exams. The workplace is nice, my colleagues are nice, but my manager is super rude.

TLDR: rude manager who overloads me with work while doing absolutely nothing all day and is super rude. I am just a frickin intern who is not from a design background.

1eo0vio,UAE vs Canada - Job offers,"Hi everyone,

I received an offer from Dubai for a senior researcher position, with a salary of around $10K USD per month, tax-free. I also have a temporary academic position in Canada for 5 years, located in a less expensive area on the northern side, with a salary of around $85K USD. It's a bit of a dream job, and after taxes, I would make around $5K USD per month, in a place I love to live. I'm also considering buying a house there if I decide to stay.

It's not an easy decision. One part of me is tempted to go to the UAE, make money for a year, and then return. However, I'm uncertain about whether I can integrate and handle the workplace culture, which is likely very different from that in Canada.

As my first year of Software Engineering MSc in Sweden is coming to an end, I am starting to believe that this was not the best career choice I made. I originally was to sure what I wanted to study, so I took the easiest choice. Now in my Bachelor thesis, we wrote about Assembly Line Balancing Optimization and worked closely with a company to provide as software solution. I loved the idea behind it, but was a little bit disappointed that we could not see our fruit of labor being actualized in a real life setting. The company said that they might provide this feature in their next release.  
  
My dream is to open a small fully automated manufacturing company, it's an idea I have had for a couple of years. Different ideas included everything from automated beer brewery to making cheap toys locally.   
  
I talked with my friend about this and he deemed my ideas to be unrealistic and constructively criticized my competence in the field, given that I have not taken any relevant courses nor do I have a clear vision of the product. He also said that I should start with a clearly defined product, and then later on start to think about manufacturing process.

I am humbly asking for your opinions on this subject. Is this idea even worth the mental energy I am wasting or should I just burry it deep inside and focus on just getting a job in my field of studies?

1enzwht,Should I quit or stay on longer?,"I try to make it short... I joined a New Clothing Brand in Paris as an Unpaid Intern during the last week of July and supposed to end the internship at 31/08. At this brand, I gotta do the pattern of the clothing, make prototypes, edit pictures... which is fair because as an Intern, to me is the time to refine your skil.
.
But the red flag about this brand...
1. Established since 2022
2. No permanent employees (the boss switches intern every 2months because if i am not mistaken, French law require the company to pay for the 3rd month)
3. The boss knows nothing about fashion (she don't design, she don't craft the pattern, she don't even know how to use photoshop)
4. She doesn't have any tools to provide (for example, she has no proper ruler, she refuse to pay for paper for crafting pattern)
5. As a clothing brand, she doesn't even have a SEWING MACHINE? (She normally just ask the Intern to use theirs)
6. We work at a tiny coffee table at her place (imagine as a pattern drafter, 1 dress is at least 1 meter???)
7. For the past few days, I have been assigned to edit the pictures from her photoshoot - and she basically not contributing.
8. She has no flexibility in time (1 time we ended 20minutes earlier because she said she had nothing for me to do for the day, but she added a Remark stating that I owe her 20minutes?)
9. She is ruthless and unkind (basically another intern was verbally disrespected by the boss on a daily basis, even the model for the photoshoot was talking about why is the boss so disrespectful and while the intern requested to end her internship because she felt disrespected, the boss has the audacity to claim that the intern can stay in France because of her internship contract otherwise will be deported back to her country so the intern has to be grateful... she also said something about she is 10years older, so she is smarter and bigger and the intern need to follow her rules???) - when this happen. I just joined the brand for 3days and these are actual things that i witnessed.

1enwxor,How do I cope with my fear of authoritarian figures at work/school?,"I tend to fear authoritarian figures at work/school. This has been bothering me for a while. It has been affecting my self-image, reputation at work/school, skills/ability and overall well-being since the last 2 years. I tend to overthink when I am communicating with my boss/supervisor or carrying out some responsibilities. I get jump scares sometimes after coming back from work/school when I think about how embarrassing I really was that day while I spoke with them. 

I either think or work clumsily or overthink and make the task even harder for me to do. I also tend to hurry and finish while forgetting to look at the important details even when I have more than enough time. I suck at prioritizing my tasks too, so I tend to mess up when I am given multiple things to carry out. This has created some unnecessary stressful situation for me at work/school. I know I have the skills, and I know what to do because the moment people tell me that I could have thought about this problem in question in a different way, I suddenly get a moment of realization, but that doesn't help me or my reputation. For this reason, I am seen as an incompetent person. So, I feel insecure and tend to shy away from networking/building connections.  

Is there any way that I can try to figure out where it is coming from and take the responsibility for it, and possibly, find a solution? If there's anyone who struggled with this, please suggest how you coped with it/found a way to reduce that fear. Masking it or faking confidence didn't work for me as the mask fell off during the moments of stress.

1enwwuh,"Ex teacher, current researcher no idea where it's going.","This is a 5 year mark past graduation in chemistry from a top UK school. Doesn't help much since the immediate return to home country where cant trade on the name and chemistry being a mostly straight into PhD research n academia track anyway. Adjusting back had its issues and took a while but ended up as a middle/high school teacher role paying 3000$ a year (livable wage is at the very least 8000$) so quit that after 2 years, and doing a masters still in chemistry with no prospect of improving career wise only opening up academic track. Payed research position while studying again, pays the bills just about. Research doesn't look groundbreaking but can potentially end up being quite coding intensive so that helps to build skills.

So the current idea is starting an ESL for Russians YouTube/TG channel with hope of capturing some tutees, alternatively some English language chemistry content for the same goal and potentially both. Given the local wage situation for high school teachers/researchers Even 2 40$ an hour  students will double the income.

If you‚Äôre serious about making 2024 the year you start your online income journey, don‚Äôt miss this opportunity.
AI has completely transformed the landscape, and if you‚Äôre not adapting, you‚Äôre falling behind.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm offering a free 3-month project where I‚Äôll personally mentor 60 people to build their own profitable niche websites using AI.

My Life Wasn‚Äôt Always Like This
I want you to see it‚Äôs possible because I‚Äôm just a regular guy.
At 22, I failed 9 classes and got kicked out of college. At 24, I got back in and finally graduated‚Äîwith student loans, an alcohol problem, and a degree I didn‚Äôt know how to use (lol).
For the next 3 grueling years, I worked at a pizza place making $9/hour.
It took me 10 years of turning my life around, trying, and failing to get where I am today.
If I can pull myself out of that hole, I want to give you hope that you can do anything you set your mind to.

The sweet spot? Using new AI technology mixed with tried-and-true business models.
But no spoilers‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs enough from me for now.
This project is not just about building a website; it‚Äôs about creating a life where you have the freedom to spend time with your loved ones, pursue your passions, and achieve financial independence.

1enwfwf,Seeking Advice: How to Transition from Architecture to Fashion Industry Roles?,"Hi everyone!

I could use some advice because I'm having trouble finding good info online. I'm about to graduate with a degree in architecture, and I have experience working in both small and major architecture firms. Lately, I've been interested in transitioning into the fashion industry‚Äîspecifically in roles like store planning/architecture or visual merchandising. Honestly, I‚Äôm open to any fashion-related job that ties in with my field.

The challenge I'm facing is that a lot of the jobs I find are either in French (which I don‚Äôt speak, but I‚Äôm willing to learn!) or they require 5-8 years of experience in a luxury fashion brand. I know it‚Äôs a competitive industry, but I‚Äôm confident in my abilities and ready to take on the challenge.

If anyone has advice or can point me in the right direction on how to break into this field, I‚Äôd appreciate it.

1enurgw,I'm working in a very toxic environment but my family pressures me to stay. I'm torn between quitting here and now or enduring for longer. Any advice?,"I'm a cardiophysiologist, working for a pretty meh pay. I've been here for a year for now and the experience was nothing but miserable.
First, I got absolutely zero guidance on doing every single thing and had to figure out everything on my own. It was tough, sure, but I kinda did it and now have solid skills.
The problem is my terrible boss mostly. Me and all my colleagues are constantly faced with insults, yelling, demanding to work overtime/doing the amount of work that usually requires two people and such.
All my colleagues in the department already have resignation papers in their desks, waiting for a right moment. Which makes me think that it's not a ""me"" problem. We are all drained and dread coming to work every single day. 

What's worse, is that everybody started having health issues. My older colleagues has constant arrhythmias due to stress. Another guy got gastritis and then had a mental breakdown. 

But our janitor had really imho. She had her son landed in a hospital with pretty nasty injuries and she asked for a day off to visit her son, which she communicated to our boss' assistant, since the boss was on a sick leave that day. The assistant allowed her to take a day off. Our boss was furious that our janitor didn't call her directly and on during a meeting chewed her out in front of everyone, calling her an irresponsible employee (which isn't true, she is really great). The janitor was absolutely devastated and started crying. She ran off and we come over to her to console her. We couldn't calm her in any way so somebody gave her some benzos to calm her. Our boss found out about that and called her ""batshit insane"".

I also had a similar experience when a person from another department who got into an argument with me over a misunderstanding over an appointment for a patient, and I discussed that over the phone. This person started yelling at me in front of all of his colleagues, then took my phone to scroll through my phone call history and messengers to confirm I didn't bullshit him about the appointment (I wasn't lying btw). This humiliating shit was my breaking point and I experienced something that I can only describe as a panick attack that lasted for two weeks. It landed me in a psych ward.

Okay. Why am I telling all of this? Because my family is really adamant on keeping the job. They tell me that it's normal to have stressful stuff at work and not liking your job. I don't really have anything to say on that really, because they are not wrong in the way. The other problem is that I have no job lined up. My plan was to quit, get a part time job and doing all the necessary paperwork and job hunting for another opportunity in the meantime. Although I feel like it's a terrible plan.

I feel really torn right now because I don't know if my experience is common and what people who were in a similar situation did. Can you share some advice, personal experience, etc? It's only a start of my career and I'm not sure if that stuff will be the same everywhere.",Icy-Internet6486,1,1.0,0,1723193254,2024-08-09 08:47:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1enurgw/im_working_in_a_very_toxic_environment_but_my/,8,2024
1enu4au,"Fired for workplace violence, (its a long story) seeking advice.","So I am an college student, about to start my senior year and have been working my way through college working part-time jobs. This is a long story but I'll try and keep it brief. I worked at ""X"" fast food establishment for over 2 years, one morning a homeless man entered my workplace asking for a water-cup, after receiving a water-cup began to yell racist things to all of our staff and acting aggressive. Our staff asked the man to leave the store and he was notified that the police were being called. He continued to yell slurs at our staff. I eventually told him he needs to leave, I got closer to the man and continued to tell him he needs to leave, he also got closer toward me to the point where we were basically face-to-face (or only a few feet apart). 

At some point he turns toward the doors as if he's going to walk out, I began to follow closely in order to lock the front door behind him so he would not re-enter the lobby. However, after only a few steps the homeless man turn back around and faces me (essentially face-to-face to me) and yells at me ""you keep following me and you're dead"". At this point me and him and standing still not moving or advancing toward one another but still essentially face-to-face. The man soon after yelling that spits on my face, I without anytime to think or reason my actions instinctually made the mistake of tackling him to the ground but it was simply just my split second instinct/reaction to him spitting on my face (again we were only about a foot apart from one another, so me tackling him and coming on contact happened very quickly, its not like a ran across the lobby then tackled him).  

After I tackled him to the ground, I did not hold him down. I stood up from the ground and looked down on him for a few seconds (in total shock of what I did, and in just confusion) the homeless man did not stand up but from the ground looked up at me and said ""I let you do that, I let you do that!"" ( I think he was in shock that I retaliated and also embarrassed). I began to back away soon after I realized he was not going to stand back up and retaliate. My coworkers then told me to go to the break room to separate myself from him, the man eventually got up and walked out the store. 

The cops eventually arrived, one policeman found the homeless man and had him in custody, away from the store while the other policeman talked to me and asked me to explain what happened. I told him everything that happened (the homeless man spitting on my face and them me tackling him instinctually). The policeman told me the act of the homeless man spitting on me is considered ""battery"" then asked me if I want to press charges, me never having any interaction with the law/police before said ""no, I just want him to go away"" (I do not know what the process of pressing charges entails and did not want any stress of enduring that process, I simply just wanted the whole thing to be over with and did not want more stress on top of working and going to school which is why I said no ). 

The policeman did not ask for my name, did not ask me to write any report or ANYTHING in writing. He told me he was going to trespass the homeless man from the store, run his record and hopefully find warrants on his record so that they can lock him up (his partner who had him in custody called him during me explaining things to him and I heard him tell the policeman talking to me that the homeless man was saying a ton of crazy things and acting a fool while in his custody, so they were obviously more worried about him than the fact that i tackled him). The policeman that spoke to me then told me that was all he needed from us (the staff) and left. I was told by supervisor I was free to stay and finish my supervisor or welcomed to go home early if I did not feel comfortable. I ended up going home early. 

The day after this incident I was scheduled ""off"" from work, but scheduled to open the store the next following day. I figured they were going to fire me as result of me going against store policy (they always tell us if there is a threat in the workplace, we must try all attempts to get away from the danger, and if left absolutely no other option to then fight back. But, in my case I reacted continued to ask the man to leave then instinctually tackled him as a result of being spat on). Sure enough my next shift, my store manager takes me to the back and fires me. They told me it wasn't their choice but pre-determined by some hire-ups who revied the footage (they did not show me the footage). My store manager give me my paper-work which stated ""notice of separation"" and ""reasoning: workplace violence"" with a very vague comment below that stating "" On X date, (my name) physically tackled a customer to the ground"" and nothing else, no other explanation or context or reasoning for my actions as apart of the comment.  

  
This was very recent (less than a week ago) and I have been applying for jobs, I have a very good and impressive resume and work history. But I am dreading the idea of being interviewed asked being asked my reasoning for no longer working at my last job. What do I say that question? How do I answer that truthfully without sounding like im making this up and rightfully justifying my actions?? Yes, I f\*cked up by not running away from the threat of the homeless man (and therefore acting in a way that broke store policy). The paper-work my manager gave me honestly just made me feel like some type of I'm some type criminal. Its upsetting and unfortunate, all I know is going to college and going to work and never have gotten into any legal trouble ever. I am not in any legal trouble even after this even, I took a picture of the police report card for the case which had only the homeless mans name on it a comment saying he was acting aggressive and spitting on employees and that he was being trespassed. So no file by the police was reported or done on me, again they did not even ask for me name.

  
The next morning after my firing, I looked up the homeless man's name from the report card and found a article about an arrest of his 3 years prior for the exact the same thing, except in the arrest 3 years prior he stole donuts of a donut shop then threatened to kill the employees if they called the police on him. So obviously this man is either severe mental health problems, not in his right mind or an aggressive drug addict.

  
So I am seeking advice on how to move foward? My question is, how do I explain this in future job interviews, should I even explain??? ( I mean I still have a clean criminal record). All I need is a part-time job to get me through my last year of college so I can graduate and pay for school. Will the reasoning for my firing appear on my background check?? I accept the fact that I messed up by reacting that way, and I will never ever do that again, I wish to learn from this mistake and move forward but just unsure how. All advice is greatly appreciated, thank you.",McSpanky21,0,0.5,14,1723190533,2024-08-09 08:02:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1enu4au/fired_for_workplace_violence_its_a_long_story/,8,2024
1entsvx,Should I quit my job?,"I'm a teacher. I'm 27 years old. I've been a teacher for about a year.

Things that make me stay:
1. It's a stable job that I don't have to worry about my income until the age of 60.
2. The salary is rising every year.
3. The most important reason is that I can take a teacher's loan to pay debt for my mom. (The debt was for my education and it's a lot)
4. There is no back up plan if I quit. There are some things that I think I can do to earn money, but none of those things is stable and I'm scared that I will not be able to earn enough to pay for my own living. I'm scared of being poor. I was there and it's not fun at all.
5. My family will be so mad at me if I quit because they think I've finally settle at something stable and they don't have to worry about me anymore.

Things that make me want to quit:
1. I don't like teaching.
2. I hate the school system. I don't want to write about how wrong the system is because it's gonna be a very long paragraph.
3. My colleagues are not so nice. Everyone gossips about other people behind their back then act nice in front of them. Plus, I can't fit in because it's kinda obvious that I don't like teaching, so that gives them another topic to gossip.
4. I'm stressed out almost everyday because I want to do the best but I can't because of the lack of support (mentally and financially) and the lack of will to do anything because as I said earlier, I don't like teaching.
5. I don't want the weekend to end. I hate Monday. I hate every morning of the weekdays. At school, I wait for the bell to ring so I can go back home and be in my bedroom doing my hobbies. My life these days is not something I want. I used to be good at everything I do. I used to like myself for that, but these days I just feel like I'm a failure.

I‚Äôm just worried about leaving my current role after 3 months, as this will probably look really bad on my CV, but there are far more reasons than just training that I dislike. A ¬£6k pay rise is also a significant pay rise to me. I have spoken to people at my current company who are still on ¬£24k after 1-2 years working there.

I didn't have any other offers at the time and my unemployment was running out. 

Fast forward a year, I've solved numerous significant problems for the company including some code optimization which saved ~100k in compute costs and allowed us to meet the terms of a multi-million dollar contract ahead of schedule. 

The only other person who shares my job title and worked on this project is a total dunce and I frequently have to fix her work or do it for her. 

After completing the contract, I asked for a compensation adjustment to match my previous salary and was denied. My manager says he has no control over it and his boss would like to give a raise but is not able too now because of company Financials (we are a startup and recently partnered with venture capital).

To add icing to the cake, I was invited to present my code add a summit and my manager said no becuase we don't want to ""lose our competitive edge"". So I don't get any internal or external recognition/compensation of my work and lose valuable opportunities to advance my career...

I want to learn about consulting, banking, private equity and everything else. I am also really interested in going to law school because I'm really passionate about business/corporate law and things like patents/IP.

But I have no idea how to start or what to do. I know how competitive finance internships are and my family is all in technology and computer science so I have no clue how to get finance and business roles. What should I do over summer? Are there any books that I should read? How do I go about trying to get internships?

I was kind of confused so I emailed a law firm (idk if im supposed to do this) and they told me to apply for an internship over summer. But for all these other internships I have no business experience and am not as smart as a lot of the other students. I'm really passionate about business law and heard that the best way to get into law school is to have work experience but I don't know what that entails I should do over my summer.

Was wondering if anyone could provide me with some advice on what I should do?",Different_Two2979,2,1.0,1,1723172893,2024-08-09 03:08:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1enp8ls/as_an_incoming_college_freshman_i_have_no_idea/,8,2024
1enp0xt,I keep making small mistakes. Is this normal??,"Is it normal to make small mistakes at work?

Hi everyone, for reference 29 years old, 4 months into my a new agency job. 

I excelled rather quickly my first 90 days. A few minor things here and there, but overall after my 90 day review (the one where you get off of your probationary period) I was told I was set to become Lead Account Manager over one of our biggest clients come January. 

The only ""mark"" I got against me during that 90 day review was attention to detail. I forgot to include someone in an email, and then had to send a second one. Small typos. Things of that nature. 

30 days later here we are at the 4 month mark. I've been ""coached"" the last two 1-on-1s over this same ""attention to detail"" thing. My Director's exact quote was ""I have high expectations, and I expect everything to be client-ready by the time it reaches me"" 

The first mistake I made was there was a typo in a survey we sent to the client for approval. 

The second mistake was I had the arrows pointing the wrong direction in a footprint layout for an event we're coordinating. 

Now we get to this evenings mistake. We are auditing a website for errors, and the wrong document attached to the email that was sent to the client. Major face palm.  I did email the client again after realizing what I did. 

I have no frame of reference, and I'm the only one of my friends and family members that has a true ""corporate America"" job. I just need to know.... is this normal? Should I expect further disciplinary actions??

Should I be worried?","Full context I was a team lead for a small company ran by a husband and wife with four locations. I loved my bosses, job, and coworkers. Overall I felt I was well liked and things went smooth. I had just moved out on my own having calculated what I could afford based on the hours I was used to and the minimum that would be okay. I never had even 40 hours a week, but I was doing okay and happy. Recently my hours were shorter, I asked if this was because of training schedules and if I can expect at least my minimum needed weekly hours going forward in August. My employers said yes. The next schedule is up and I'm only getting less than 20 hours. I start panicking and placing in apps to find a second job. By some miracle I land an actual full time job.

My app logs me out and when I attempt to log back in I have no account. I hear the door open and wonder if it's my co team lead coming in instead of the other girl. I walk out and the wife is holding my keys, which makes me extremely uncomfortable as she has my house keys in her hands too. Obviously I know which one she wants, and I hand it to her. She tells me ""We decided today is your last day"" and hands me an envelope. I'm told it's pay for my worked days and remaining days I was intending to work.

However, I am in the pursuit of earning a mechanical engineering degree for the money. I know it's not a passion of mine but I need the money because I am not from money and do not have the privilege of following my dreams. Out of my options, being a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer, it seemed like the least bad of my three options because the work hours, pay, and flexibility fit my ideal lifestyle. I would then use my future salary to fund my creative endeavors. 

My engineering degree isn't guaranteed though because I haven't been accepted as a transfer in the department and I am making progress towards the requirements but they are draining me. I have failed Calculus 1 once and am on the verge of failing again. If I don't not get into the department the closest major available in my current division that aligns with engineering is a BA in Computer Science but I have heard the market is terrible for computer science majors in finding a job right now.

1ennni1,"New Co-Worker Earns More Than I Do, My Company Is Hiring Again and The Pay is 30K More than What I Make","I'm in my 30s and have 5+ years of experience in my field. 

I started working for this company a year ago. I manage a number of accounts and have great relationships with my clients, so much so that I often get compliments and referrals from them (my bosses are well aware). 

Five months after I was hired, they had to hire another PM, ""J"". This person is in their early 20s and doesn't have the best work ethic but likely because they are really fresh. 

Due to our number of clients growing, my company is hiring a new PM. The ad for the same position I have right now has the salary cap 30k+ more than what I make. This new person would also be starting with an empty portfolio. 

I asked ""J"" how much they make, and to my surprise, their pay is 7k more than mine. They were also pretty shocked that I earned less than they did. 

I asked my boss today if we could have a meeting next week to discuss my one year at the company. I will be asking for a 20k raise, as it would put me 10k below the current cap for the position. 

I believe that sounds reasonable but I'd like second opinions. Since starting at this job I have done a lot to iron out our process and have improved our campaigns quite a bit.

1enn7km,Am I right for believing my boss isn't being honest about department switch? ,"This will be my first official ""real"" job since graduating last May. I was offered a three year contract at a news station last July and starred August 10th. This Saturday will mark 1 year. I was excited about the job as it's in my area of study, and many of the people I work with were former classmates. 

It didn't take long for me to realise that the usual office drama and politics was times ten worse, compared to what I am use to. The girl who was suppose to train me was great at her job, but was a terrible trainer who had zero patient.

 That on top of the fact the my ""trainer"" would change almost every other day, when I first started. 

There have also been several times I've been pulled away to speak with my boss as a witness, regarding drama between co-workers.

Said co-workers will continue to rant and text me regarding their drama, pulling me away from work. It's unprofessional and harrassment at this point, and nothing has been done about it, despite what I do. This on top of the workload I am already getting, has started giving me severe anxiety and stress. My boss's nonchalance regarding everything has not helped.

For several months now, I've been miserable. I told myself in April if things continued to be bad, I'd try to last through August, and start looking for another job, and my friends and family agree.

 Now my boss wants me to spend three weeks in a different department, to which he says ""is so I can learn new skills and bring them back."" I'm going into it open minded, however some of my co-workers say the people who get transfered to this department are always problematic and not liked.

I've also been told that the people who transfer never come back, despite the department making all the money. I know my boss will never tell me the real reason why he's having me make the shift, and am just going into it open minded, with the goal of getting a new job within the next couple months. 

My contract isn't up until 2026, but luckily a family friend who's also an attorney told me the contract was not actually binding, on top of there being several problems with it. I can leave whenever I am ready. However,  I only want to leave when I have something locked down.

1enn5m1,I‚Äôm getting heavily surveilled/gang-stalked at work. Am I suspected to be a criminal? (I didn‚Äôt steal anything) What do I do?,"I work in a local government office. The culture when I first joined was quite relaxed. It was common for employees to chat for long periods of time and be away from their desk for longer periods. But my coworkers both were jealous/threatened by me as well as suspected that my workload was too low. 

So they reported my usage of any time that was not perfect (breaks, lunch,bathroom breaks, etc.) and anything else they could think of. Suddenly everyone in the office secretly stopped the relaxed culture. 

management started using the security team on only me (they try to hide it, but I can tell and overhear what some say) to secretly watch, stare, and stalk me around the building and spy at my desk, watch my computer, etc. 

We have cubicle walls but they lowered them once all this started happening. Then one time I got distracted in my thoughts at my desk and it was visible in my face/head behavior, so they excessively secretly spy on my face now. My bathroom breaks didn‚Äôt always match everyone‚Äôs timing so now that is secretly monitored too even outside working hours. 

They started having team members of all other teams join. Now they all gang-watch me all minutes of the day and non-working hours such as before and after my official work time and unpaid non-working lunch hour. (7hour work day)

My reputation in the office is totally ruined, my chances of ever moving to another team are obviously gone, everyone stopped talking to me. I can‚Äôt network with anyone anymore.

Now I feel so disrespected, angry, and creeped out, but I really need this job and want to stay in government but can‚Äôt find another job to switch to. 

I heard there may be legal limits to the surveillance allowed but I have yet to find out.

1enmaq6,Need career advice,"Hi everyone I need some advice on how to handle this situation at my work. I started at this company back in March and I was really excited to start my new career path. In my first third week the CEO came into my office one night before the end of my shift and started asking me some questions about something that I needed to do. I told him it had been delayed because some things weren‚Äôt ready for me to move forward with, and he kind of snapped on me and went off about how nothing is ready and things that were out of my control or not done, and in a very condescending way, asked me if it would take me more than five days to get him some information when it would only take me about five minutes. So this is what I learned that he wasn‚Äôt happy with me or something. I asked a coworker about it and he claimed that that‚Äôs just how he is and if you can handle that you‚Äôll do great here. So fast-forward to the next month, my second month working there I had a meeting with the entire leadership team, and didn‚Äôt think I would be involved because it was only my second month there, but the entire meeting turned towards my role. And I was confronted with some things that weren‚Äôt happening. I explain to them the process of what I do and why we weren‚Äôt achieving the things they were talking about and, started going back-and-forth with one of the other leadership members about the process of getting some results at a specific location of ours. It got to the point where my other coworker stepped into ‚Äú‚Äú save me after the meeting coworker that stood up for me, came into my office and said that was really weird. Why did they all come for you and I wasn‚Äôt sure and I agreed with her. After she left the CEO came into my office and gave me a compliment sandwich saying that I‚Äôm going to do great things here, but I need to be less defensive and emotionalas a professional setting, this was very upsetting and was the second CEO made me cry.

After that happened, I told my coworker that stood up for me about it, and she convinced me to talk to the COO who is also a woman about it. So we went together and told her what happened. The COO was mortified and told us that she would‚Äôve never let this happen if she had been here and she is so sorry and , it‚Äôs going to be OK to let her know if we need anything. Then the following week my coworker friend got fired out of the blue for creative differences. Two weeks after that the COO quit. So I reached out to them both and asked them what happened the COO told me that I would be foolish to stay at this company so I started looking for another job. Then I noticed at work. My schedule cleared up. I no longer had weekly meetings that I was involved in. I noticed the CEO was now leaving me alone so I thought I was in the clear and I could just focus on my work. Last week, the VP of operations Was no longer at our company and we were also friends so I reached out to him yesterday and asked him what happened and he told me he was laid off and he also told me that he agrees with the COO that I need to look for a new company because the CEO is not invested in me. 
The VP also agreed with me that the CEO does not like women or minorities. 

That‚Äôs fine. I understand he doesn‚Äôt like me. I am now actively searching for a new position and trying to get out of here as soon as possible, but I need help with what to do in the meantime. I don‚Äôt know how to work or act in the office, knowing that my days are numbered and that I am effectively being iced out of the job.

Im in sheer panic because I'm 99% sure I'm getting fired on Monday for not seeing eye to eye with my Ops manager. 
He had a history of getting people term'd for this exact thing and I guess it's my time. 

He is a misogynistic, transphobic racist that has a history of women feeling he's ""creepy"" and it's been swept under the rug for years. 

Our most recent disagreement was over one of my employees bad behavior and I wanted to term her - the GM agreed. However, my GM has no backbone and was convinced to let the Ops manager put her on a pip and manage her himself. He's never on site so I would send him an email at the end of the day if she violated her pip and it pisses him off. He spoke to the GM about it and I was told that my ""witch hunting"" was ""destroying our relationship"" and boom suddenly one of my depts was taken from me and given to him, I was iced out of meetings, he would only respond to communication with a thumbs up emoji and he started approving my teams time off requests and auditing they time cards. 

I'm considering emailing my GM and asking if we can come to a date that I resign so I can have my medical coverage for a little longer (I am supposed to be getting an X-ray and scheduled a surgery).

So on Monday ... Do I go down (calmly and professionally) swinging ? 
I have so much on him. I know it won't save my job but I'm hoping it'll at least draw some negative attention his way. 
I don't want him to continue getting away with wrongfully terminating people, not hiring people because they are trans, not hiring people who aren't white and harassing/flirting with female employees.

- small 100-150 employee company

-much less prestigious, ABA community involvement non profit

-every dept head reports in to me

-company is pivoting to a growth strategy and CEO is at a wall so high expectations

-On site but office is 15 min walk or 3 min drive

- pto as needed

1enl2jq,Seeking advice/validation as a medical office manager with administrative professional to practitioner ratios,"I'm trying to figure out a normal ratio of medical adminisitrative professionals and receptionists to practitioners.  I work in Canada, and am the only full time person (read: an office manager who is not recognized as such), and I take care of all reception duties Mon-Fri (answersing phones, emails, voicemails, scheduling, checking patients in, taking payments etc.) on top of trying to manage the office (private billing, provincial billing, veterans billing, motor vehicle accident billing and subsequent lawyers billing, payroll and any accounts receivable, new patient onboarding, inventory and suppy ordering for the entire clinic including monitoring and ordering our funded vaccines and autoclave machine, creating training materials and training (and educating) new admin staff my boss hires, poorly attempting through all of this to revamp a policies and procedures manual, as well as being a data analyst for all of the above).  I am also the primary point of contact when anything goes wrong in the clinic.  Generally, my other staff are unable to answer questions for both patients and practitioners appropriately.  

We have two other receptionists.  One works ~15 hours per week (but works ""for something to do"" because her spouse is able to provide for her family, and typically calls in sick 1-2 times per month, and regularly schedules personal appointments for herself during work hours because our clinic is central in the largest city in our municipality and she doesn't want to cut into her personal off time.  Generally she just doesn't care about the job as it's not a necessity and not her 'career').  The other works ~25 hours per week (tries her hardest but is very young, and graduated from a completely unrelated field and works with me because my boss couldn't find anyone else).  Neither have education or experience in the field, and on top of everything I've just listed - I have to babysit both of them and check their work daily, in order to avoid more work for me in the future when I inevitably discover inconsistencies while trying to do things like billing, reschduling days when practitioners are sick etc.  I also need to train them both, seemingly daily, on ethics, compassion/attitude towards patients,  medical terminology and testing, outsourced consults,  customer service, and constantly nagging one of them to not be on Instagram or shopping online while there's tasks to be done despite the waiting room being close to empty over practitioner lunch hour. 

We have: one family doctor (who IMO needs her own admin person altogether) four osteopaths, two massage therapists, two physiotherapists, two podiatrists, and an acupuncturist.  My boss also wants to hire another osteopath despite a physical lack of space for them.  That's 12 practitioners in total, with a 13th likely coming before the year end.  My boss being one of those osteopaths, one of the most sought after in my geographical area (think people travelling to my city from *other countries* to see her, subsequently resulting in my having to rearrange her already packed schedule).  She treats patients 95% of her time in clinic, and 5% of her time is spent being the president of our regional osteopathy association.  Nevermind the fact that she has Fridays off, and has a family of her own that she tends to.

Google tells me my city's living wage is currently $26.50/hr.  I make $22.50/hr, and that's after three raises in my two years of employment (which I asked for.  The first time I was literally told ""I can't afford to pay you a living wage right now"").

I guess this mostly turned into a rant.  But, maybe I'm just seeking validation: is this insane?  To me, we should have at least twice the administrative staff that we do have, and at the very least, it seems like we should have at least one other individual who has the slighest clue on how to work in a medical/reception setting/have a related education or relevent experience.",albertspinkballoons,1,1.0,0,1723160823,2024-08-08 23:47:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1enl2jq/seeking_advicevalidation_as_a_medical_office/,8,2024

1enk7ok,Should I take the new job or take a mental health break from working altogether? ,"Hey everyone,

I need some career advice and would appreciate your insights. I‚Äôm currently feeling extremely burned out at my job. I enjoy having a purpose and feeling productive, but I‚Äôm scared of jumping to another job while not being mentally recovered and potentially setting myself up to fail.

Recently, I took a month off work for personal reasons and realized how badly I needed a break. During this time, I received two job offers. One offer is $10k less than my current salary, while the other is $54k less but comes with an extremely generous benefits package that almost makes up for the difference.

Additionally, I have the opportunity to take up to 6 months off work and receive around 90% of my income.

I‚Äôm torn between these options:

	1.	Jump straight into one of the new job offers and stay in the workforce.
	2.	Take a risk and go on a hiatus from working to reevaluate what I want in my career.

To complicate things further, I plan to move out of state in about 1.5 years, which means I will be starting over regardless of my choice.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What would you recommend? Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.

1enitwv,How to feel like I belong at a company?,"This is more self deprecating so like if you have insight into making good coworker relationships or getting over emotional humps in a job that would be appreciated!

I‚Äôve been at my first ‚Äòcorporate business‚Äô job for a little over a year, I was first an intern and now a few months as full time employee. I have nice coworkers, I don‚Äôt feel like anyone wants me to fail and are good about answering my questions or teaching me‚Ä¶ yet I don‚Äôt know I feel like I belong as much as everyone else does. 

It‚Äôs like I feel like everyone else is friends but I‚Äôm just there. I know like in practice everyone shouldn‚Äôt be best friends with their coworkers cause it is a slippery slope, but it‚Äôs hard to feel like everyone else is way more friendly with each other or you don‚Äôt belong in any casual conversation. Again, they aren‚Äôt /mean/, I just feel like I‚Äôm not a person anyone would actually be happy to start a conversation with beyond pleasantries. I mean I know everyone else has known each other longer so they get each other quirks and have their ways of talking but I feel like every time I try to be in a conversation or chat it feels stunted, ignored, or like it wouldn‚Äôt matter if I spoke or not. It‚Äôs a weird feeling. 

There‚Äôs a girl that entered at the same time as me but, maybe just from my perspective, she seems to get along better with everyone like crack jokes or be someone to go talk to. Outside of work, I feel like I‚Äôve always made friends fast and get along with be very well so maybe it just feels weird to me that there‚Äôs not really a person I can turn to and really feel like I got your back you got mine and we get each other. 

And recently my manager (who is nice and such) said that someone got uncomfortable I made a joke about being broke or something. I am unclear about what I said tbh cause my manager  didn‚Äôt really know either but it sounds like maybe someone said they were doing something that cost $$$ or buying something and I said d probably ‚ÄúI wish I could do that!‚Äù Or something like broke gen z humor. the manager told me I wasn‚Äôt in trouble and just that money can be a sensitive subject, which I get, but it just made me feel extra misunderstood and out of place‚Ä¶ maybe I shouldn‚Äôt feel this way but I feel like if someone else it wouldn‚Äôt have been perceived as such. I sit near a lot of people my age but maybe my dry ‚Äòonline‚Äô humor doesn‚Äôt hit. But it just made me feel like oh maybe I shouldn‚Äôt say anything then cause I clearly don‚Äôt get the vibe.

I don‚Äôt know how to get over this feeling. I know part of it is just getting on this new insecurity but I want to be able to know how to get by socially in a corporate America setting. I can‚Äôt say nothing, I need some charisma and to make people vibe with me more to get by, yet maybe I‚Äôm just socially inept with these settings at the moment.

Anyone experience this? Any advice on how not to feel like an awkward person in a corporate world? There are coworkers I enjoy chatting with when I can but I don‚Äôt really work with them.

My new manager is a lot more organized, but the work I‚Äôm doing is so tedious that I can‚Äôt focus on it, and I feel like I‚Äôm being pigeon-holed into doing similar work as my last role instead of actually learning anything new. I also feel very socially disconnected from my team, since it‚Äôs a remote role and the company culture as a whole is pretty standoffish and impersonal.

1enhrtd,Job decision/rejection... Anxiety or gut feeling,"Sorry it's a long one...
I'd been in my role almost 3 years and was applying for jobs because I was getting a bit bored. When I finally got offered one deciding whether to take it or not caused a lot of anxiety (decision paralysis!!!) I had reservations but speaking to family they encouraged me to go for it. Well I went for it,.started new job and it was a disaster. From day 1 I knew it was a mistake and for 3 months of working there I had severe anxiety and panic attacks. I was very close to leaving with no job due to the impact it was having on me, but was fortunate that my old place offered my role back. I've recently returned but have also been offered a new job elsewhere (from interviewing before I knew I'd be returning). It's a 10k pay increase, slighty more hours, no sick pay, other benefits crap but has the possibility of learning and development.
I've been having constant anxiety about making the decision because something doesn't feel right. I don't know if it is anxiety or gut feeling. 
My current job is very flexible, in summary I cram most of my job in 3 days and the other 2 are very chill and lots of freedom to attend appointments/ fit around kids etc. 

A little about me.. I am suffering depression and having been plodding along for a while but the recent job that went wrong exaggerated everything much more, especially anxiety, and it's been crippling. I am awaiting therapy. I think one reason I was looking for another job was hoping that it might lift my mood or give me some confidence. Part of me is struggling to engage and the smallest stressor is like the end of the world. so learning a new job I I'm concerned I won't be able to handle the stress and will crash and burn. 

So do I play safe and stay where i am, get myself in a better place and take advantage of the work life balance. Or take another risk? 

I do know that I will want to move from my current role but not sure if the timing is right, also hoping I'd find a job that I feel positive about the move.

If I make the move and it doesn't work out, I obviously will have burned the bridge with my old/current employer and we all know how terrible the job market is at the moment!! 

Just looking for some opinions. At the moment I'm thinking reject the offer and find a role I feel better about, even if it doesn't have the same pay increase.

1enh4dg,How to tell manager you're resigning ,"I'm a social worker. I spent a year on frontline and knew it wasn't for me, but I had to remain with the company to avoid having to repay the relocation allowance they gave me. I moved over to another team which I thought was going to be better, but after 5 months I have had enough. My team is great and I really enjoy the work, but the case load is way too high. I'm working overtime and struggling to keep up with all the demands. I have tried to raise this with my manager and who has been supportive, but there is no prospect of hiring new members in our team to lessen the load. It's been impacting my mental health to the point where I have decided I'm willing to repay the relocation package to have a better work-life balance.

The thing is, when I joined this team, they were letting go of agency workers in a push to secure permanent workers for the benefit of the children we serve. The goal was for the children to have continuity in their social worker and I had every intention to be in this for the long haul. I've made great relationships with the kids - some have even said I'm the best they've had. By the end of my notice period, I would have only been in the role for 9 months. So what I am really bummed about is letting the team and the kids down. I feel a lot of guilt. 

I've been offered a job at another company that I'm excited about but don't know how to break the news to my manager who has been good to me, given the circumstances. I keep reflecting on my interview, where I talked about wanting to give continuity to the children and being on board with the initiative. It feels like I'm such a hypocrite, but the case load is way above what I was told it would be and I am crippled by the stress so I know it's the right decision.

1eng44h,Is it rude to politely decline a job offer through leaving a voicemail?,"I (F,23) recently got a job offer at a company and they even moved things around regarding placement and location so I can begin the role and cut down on commute time from the original office. The people are nice and I had a great interview but the more I thought about it‚Äî I don‚Äôt think the job aligns with my long term career goals. Along with that another opportunity that better suits me came along. 

I‚Äôve been playing phone tag with the hiring manager all week attempting to have the final conversation on the phone but we keep leaving each other voice mails trying to get back in contact. I had a phone conversation earlier with them where they expressed interest in offering me the role and their last voice message was that they were attempting to place me at a different office closer to me. At that point I was uninterested and didn‚Äôt want to waste any more time. 

I didn‚Äôt want to write an email as it felt impersonal especially since the company has been extremely considerate and accommodating toward me.

1enfho1,My team of three is moving companies post-M&A. How can I use this as an opportunity to get promoted?,"Some things you should know:

* My company was acquired by a larger company in the very end of December '23.
* We've been in the process of integrating our businesses ever since. My company became a BU for a specific product and it was finally decided that my department would be absorbed by the parent company. My team is starting to onboarding in less than two weeks from now.
* New bosses, new processes, new squads, new clients, new coworkers. We're going from a 3 people (formerly 4) team to a 45+ people team. Nobody know how things will play out for sure, yet.

Now, about me:

* I'm an intern. In my country this means that I work part-time (30hrs/week), get paid a minimum wage but am not legally binded to my employer like a full-time employee.
* I've been at this job for 1 year and have 15mo of work-experience in my field.
* Besides general positive feedback, I've received the following from my coworkers: ""You do work as quickly as we do"", ""You're an intern, but your skill level is above a regular intern, which surprised me a lot"", ""When you got here you were already well developed for the work experience you had"", ""When I started as an intern I wasn't able to do as much stuff as you"".
* I'm very good with my deadlines and my work output almost matches that of my coworkers, even though I work 2hrs less/day. The quality is pretty even.
* I've developed skills for this job (ex: basic HTML/CSS coding) and I'm already ahead of my peers with some of them. This is, I learn very fast (have received this feedback from my lead).
* I'm starting to get impatient as I earn less than my coworkers while I'm doing very good regularly.

Now, both of my coworkers have more work experience than me, but I still feel like I could push for a promotion to full-time employee. I want to use the department transfer as an opportunity to do very well and stand out from my coworkers. Kind of taking advantage of a ""leveled"" playing field.

I'm also going to be the only intern for that work-field in the new company, and I'm dreading having to be left to do simple, short activities while right now I do everything, like my coworkers.

How should I go about this? Do you have any tips or general advice?",FluffyApartment32,1,1.0,0,1723146626,2024-08-08 19:50:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1enfho1/my_team_of_three_is_moving_companies_postma_how/,8,2024

I am an HR professional (26 years old) living in Iraq. I have been working with a tech start-up for the past two years. I have left on good terms, however, there's been a legal issue; they haven't paid me any social security dues or even registered me (iny country, social security dues are paid by companies monthly to ensure secure retirement).

I am thinking of suing them to claim my social security benefits (it is an easy case, affordable, and a guaranteed win as per the 5 lawyers I consulted).

I have been really hesitant about this...There has been a change in management and they attempted to reduce my salary and bring a senior officer who I'll be reporting to. Salary reductions are illegal as per my labor law, however, I didn't want any trouble, so I quit politely and found a better job.

I am not bitter towards my ex employer at all, however, will this be a red flag in future background checks? Suing my ex employer isn't an easy decision and while it is a confirmed win, I am uneasy about how this will affect future job opportunities.

I recently got a job working for the state. As a side gig, I hold a bartending job for my local stadium. I got an email from HR for the state telling me what my schedule will be for week 1 and then what it'll be ""starting week 2"". With this schedule, I would be unable to work any sporting events bartending, which bring in a LOT of money. Is it a bad look to politely ask the manager if during the sports season I can switch one day of my training (training lasts a year)? I've gotten mixed responses. Some people give me a hard no don't ask, some people say it shouldn't be a huge deal as long as it's a super casual ask and I make it exceptionally clear I'm not asking for PTO or making it seem like it HAS to be a switch. I would just really hate to miss out on these sports days because it brings in 2-3x more money than the full time job on one shift, so the extra money would be extremely helpful.

Any advice on how to approach this situation would be helpful :) It is an entry level job, however I'm in my mid 20s and I know my generation can already be seen as difficult, so I don't want to start on the wrong foot with anyone, but I also would rather not at least try to see if I can make extra money.

1encbe5,Should i make career switch from IT to flight attendant?,"
Hi,
So im 23 years old, i work as a software engineer in the Netherlands, born and raised here.

I saw a job posting from United Arab Emirates for flight attendant. It also requires you to move to Dubai. They go all around the world and have those Open Days where you can go to physically and meet with the crew 

Now the job seems fun to me, as i am quite bored with IT and i barely experience anything in life except living in my computer screen staring at code. I feel like I am too young to do that. 

I do have a few concerns,
which are:
- if I move to Dubai, I cannot go back to Netherlands (cause housing market is one of the worst in the world, almost impossible to get something, even student rooms are getting charged high), 
and although I can crash in my parents‚Äô house, i prefer not since I come from toxic household. So I will stay in Dubai or another country forever, which doesnt bother me i always wanted to move out of NL. But was wondering if anyone had experience living in Dubai in general, and what they did after being a flight attendant.

- finding a career after i quit being a flight attentant: maybe i find out i dont like this job, maybe too tiring or etc..
Scared about finding a new job as a software engineer or something else with a decent salary to live from, as I put my career growth on a halt basically. If I go back I am inexperienced again and earn lower salary. 

- I do have some goals I would like to also work as a DJ and i produce music since im 13. I was wondering if I can still combine it with a flight attendant job or will i be too tired?

1enbac7,Is it too late to pursue a career in the automotive industry in my late 20s?,"So I have been working for the past few years but don't have a solid career to start on. To be honest, I kinda drifted from one career path to another during my early years in high school. First, I wanted to go to college for art and illustration but then gave up on it after hearing stories from art college students and decided that it wasn't the best career for me. Then after getting jobs that revolved around car parts and developing a fascination for cars, I now realize what kind of career I want to go for.

The problem is that my dad (62 y/o) is still wanting me to go into business administration because it's the ""best"" job for someone like me when it's not really true. And he's STILL insisting on it because you can make more money than any other jobs on the market and apparently, according to my dad, are in high demand. I am not the type to sit in an office for hours at a time and I will go insane if I don't move around (and no, walking around the cubicle/office does not count). I am the type to do physical work because it helps me keep my mind off of things and helps me mentally dissociate. Basically, a job where I don't have to think a whole lot.

Right now, I am trying to enroll in a community college that offers automotive classes but I also need to find a job that offers apprenticeship. Unfortunately, my dad doesn't want me to go into that career path because it would ""take too long"" to complete. Again, he is still suggesting to go into administration because it is considered the FIRST thing you learn when you get into college. Don't know if he's telling the truth or just making it up to get me to believe him, but I don't really buy into what he's telling me.

For the last year or so I've been contemplating making a change. I'm in my mid 30s, have been a top 3 performer for the company since I've started and have generated more than 60 million dollars in sales. the company has changed dramatically over the years and has made it tougher for sales people to earn. couple that with a soft market and no path way to move up within the organization and I'm discouraged about my future with this company and in this industry.

1en93rb,Advice: Balancing Potential Offers,"Hello! I have been searching for a job and have been unemployed for 4 months (nothing wrong with my last job, I just moved states), but I am quickly anticipating both an end to my unemployment, and a conundrum. I am interviewing with 3 companies:

Company A:

* Kinda my top choice. The role is different from my previous experiences, but the company opened this role *specifically* because they heard what I said in prior interviews for a different role, and determined that those skills are more needed at the moment. The hiring manager even said ***""I want you on my team""*** and has been updating me on the process before the recruiter even knows, so I am near guaranteed to get the role.
* Commute is kinda far (45\~60min), but role can be hybrid, and job includes up to 25% travel.
* Big company, great benefits, big growth opportunity.
* **Their process has taken time, and I have yet to officially start interviewing for the new role...**
* An offer may not come for several weeks

Company B:

* A really good fit - very similar to the roles I have done in the past.
* Short commute most days (10\~15 min)
* Interview process was only 2 weeks start-to-finish, concluding in a skills test
* Good benefits, medium-sized company, medium growth opportunity
* **Anticipating an offer by next week**

Company C:

* A really good fit - very similar to the roles I have done in the past.
* Commute is kinda far (\~45min), but after 6 months the role can be hybrid up to 2 days a week
* Interviews took only a week: first a short phone call, and today is 90 minutes onsite
* Good benefits, big company, medium growth opportunity
* If onsite goes well, **offer would come in by tomorrow**

Assuming salary and other benefits are comparable, what are my options?

1. Do I turn down B & C and wait for A?
2. Could I accept an offer from B or C now, and then quit when A gives an offer?
3. Do I turn down A because they took too long?

Thanks in advance!

Fulfilling jobs ideas? ,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm 25F who has a bachelors degree in commerce and has worked as an HRBP for the past 4 years in two different industries: healthcare and in higher education (at a university). I‚Äôm coming to the conclusion that a career in HR or even business or corporate in general is just not for me. I feel like I‚Äôm making no difference, nothing really matters, and all I‚Äôm doing is trying to earn the company more money. I also can‚Äôt stand public speaking/presenting. I thrive in 1v1 interactions and problem solving but unfortunately HR is a lot of group work, big meetings, etc and it‚Äôs just not for me. Overall, the work just feels so pointless and like I don‚Äôt belong. I spend much more time doing the things I don‚Äôt like than the things I do. 

I‚Äôve always been passionate and interested in things like sports, psychology, problem solving, helping people, and things like that. I‚Äôm not opposed to going back to school, but I want to make sure that it is the right move for me. 

The big question is: what‚Äôs next? For people who have left the business world, what did you do next? Any suggestions for fulfilling jobs that also provide a work/life balance? Or just any advice in general for how to decide my next move?

1en8ttx,My manager is like a neglectful absent parent ,"I‚Äôm new-ish in my career (in my 20s) and started my job 3 months ago. And I really don‚Äôt like my manager‚Äôs management style

He is constantly in meetings or travelling for work to have meetings in person (it‚Äôs a global company)

He takes forever to respond to messages/emails and sometimes he just never responds 

He is always on his phone/writing emails, including when we are in a meeting together & during our 1-to-1‚Äôs

He never checks on what my workload looks like, but then I‚Äôll get emails like ‚Äúhey I spoke to [manager] and he said you could help me with X‚Äù

He constantly gives me huge tasks to complete and then tells me to ask another person in the department if I need help. The person in question is a godsend and very willing to help when I ask, however the lack of interest in training/helping me do my job properly in my first 3 months (which I though was part of the purpose of a manager) leaves a sour taste in my mouth 

He seems like someone who overvalues ‚Äúfacetime‚Äù and likes to look busy, as opposed to actually being busy. Like at this point I still have no idea what he actually does all day other than sit in meetings and pipe up with some unimpactful observation every 15 or so minutes. Whereas across the wider company, I can actually *see* the fruits of other managers‚Äô labor

I get the sense that he has found a job where he doesn‚Äôt really have to do much but still gets to be seen as valuable somehow. And he hired me so he would have a direct report to further legitimise this reputation 

To be honest I‚Äôm posting this partially to vent. But also, what should I do? Is it possible I‚Äôm totally wrong? Should I talk to him? Or should I just start on my exit plan?

1en8d9i,Rant/need advice/help lol,"I am at my breaking point. I'm not sure where to go from here. I genuinely do not have any hope for my future, career wise. Over the past year or so, I have probably applied to 500+ jobs, likely upwards of a thousand. I would say half don't get back to me, and the other half I get rejected from. 

A little background on me: I have a bachelor's in psychology (do not really want to do anything related to psych as I worked in mental health for almost a year and hated it), I have about 10 years of customer service experience. Want to get out of this field as well. I currently work as a patient care coordinator which is just a fancy word for receptionist. My day consists of me just staring at a screen for 95% of the day as our business is pretty slow. I am not one of those people who are happy getting paid (and what I do get paid is very little) to do nothing. 

I have applied to a very diverse range of entry level roles: social media marketing, hr assistant, events coordination, writing/editorial assistant, etc. I am starting a course in the fall for editing & publishing as that is an industry I'm interested in, but have learned it is super competitive. I've been applying for internships left and right but can't even seem to get those. It seems like all of these jobs you need some kind of experience for even though they clam to be entry level. 

Like I said, I am really not sure where to go from here. I don't think I have it in me physically/mentally/emotionally to apply for more jobs just to get rejected.

I‚Äôve been at this job for a year this month, but I feel like I‚Äôve seen little growth. This job requires a lot of ‚Äúget up and go‚Äù and requires us to work with different people across the state.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve been dismissed and kept out of different conversations. I‚Äôm apart of a group chat where everyone is sharing photos and engaging with supervisors, and I really feel left out.

1en5hj7,IT worker unsure of how to make next step... input needed <3,"***Please note before reading: I am based in Australia. All financial figures and qualifications are referenced in the context of Australia.***

Hi there,

I am a 21 year-old IT Professional based in Western Australia. I have three years of industry experience acting as a senior helpdesk staff member, as well as an Undergraduate degree in Cyber Security. I currently make $68k/year in my role in which I've held for two years.

At the beginning of the year, I commenced looking for graduate roles as I finished my degree. I ultimately ended up landing a graduate Cyber Security Auditor role at a top 10 accounting/consultancy firm. A brief overview of that role below:

60k AUD/year salary, solid benefits (including free life insurance), a structured graduate program and an assigned mentor. This is at a large company with a slighly longer commute, and a full focus on auditing against industry frameworks.

I handed my notice in in April as a courtesy to my current employer, who came to me 4 weeks ago with an offer for a Cyber Security Engineer role at $73k a year. This would be quite a step up from my current Help Desk role, with significant increases in responsibility and expectations.

I counter-negotiated to $80k a year, with pay increases and milestones separate to that of my performance (i.e. if I get a bad performance review, I may still get a base pay increase). I was told that this would ""be considered"" and have not yet been given a contract. My last day is tomorrow.

My current company, a Managed Services Provider, has about 40 staff. We've recently had a lot of resignations, with around 13 staff leaving in 2024. From personal experience, I don't think there is much room to grow here. Their Cyber Security department is quite junior, and appears to have a lot of services without much depth to them. There are currently two staff members in this department, with one leading the program and one implementation Engineer. 

I've found there has been a lot of broken promises here. I've often been offered promotions, role changes, projects etc which have never come to fruition. Management works slowly, and results that should take days will often take weeks or months. There is no clear growth path for me here - it's essentially ""do XYZ certifications"", which are often certifications from vendors that the company use with no practical benefit to myself. KPIs are the name of the game, with high standards requested and often not met.

I guess my question is: Do I take the grad role, take the current offer or search for another role? 

I'm not particularly keen on going backwards in wages, but I'm unsure if I'd be able to get over my grievances with my current company to be able to work effectively.  However, I worked corporate in my first IT role, and was not a fan of the rigidity of the work and the company structure. I don't see myself lasting long in the corporate role where I'm shoe-horned into a specific function. I like to get my hands dirty.

Alternatively, there is the option of another role, but I am taking a 7-week holiday to the USA and will be returning from my holiday with minimal savings, which may cause trouble if I can't find another role.

Please be nice <3 I am genuinely unsure on how to best proceed and am looking for unbiased opinions, as my friends and colleagues have been pretty much evenly split on what I should do.

After covid happened, I returned back to my hometown and in Jan 2022 started working for a recruiting firm as a TA. Even though, I didn't like it one bit and I only did it just for the sake of earning. Turns out, I'm somewhat good in my job (a monkey can do it) even though I hate it entirely. Now after restructuring and for the peace of my mind, I had to resign. I had been quite interested in Product Management and did buy books to learn and upskill. Even lied on my CV just to get interview calls but I usually get rejected or ghosted. I even learned SQL and Advanced Excel. But the results are the same. This has taken a mental toll, I do have an offer from a recruiting firm but I'm a little worried. How should I navigate from this? What shall be the best course of action?

  
I have a huge passion for travel, learning languages, playing video games, sports to name a few but I do have an inferiority complex and an ego. All of my friends are somewhat doing better than me and I feel like I'm way behind them.

1en3kkl,Staying in a job that needs me but I feel miserable ,"I took a job at the beginning of this year that I thought I would be perfect for. I didn't want to leave my old job, which I liked, but I got a good offer and it looked like a positive career step.

Since I took this job, however, every day has felt worse than the last, I have tremendous amounts of pressure, work with angry people all the time, and am occasionally forced into no-win situations.

I would look for something new, but a lot of people are depending on me for various projects and I honestly think I'm the best person they could get. For the past month however I've been burned out, unable to focus, and dread getting up in the morning. What's the best way to leave this situation and should I?

1en2ygu,Should I accept? - Enterprise Sales Exec. ,"Hello,

I am looking for some career advice from anyone willing to contribute...

I am unemployed, but not in urgent need for a job right away. My previous role was as a BDM for a SaaS; I have previous background in politics, where I worked for a Senator etc. and a Masters in International Relations. I then transitioned into Tech because of the flexibility, innovative and dynamic work environments compared to government.

I wore a lot of hats as a BDM -- I did outbound, marketing, and spearheaded some partnership initiatives.

I got energized by a webinar series I did on my own as well as the partnership project but also enjoyed a bit of the traditional sales. The company I worked for didn't really have their act together -- disorganized, no strategy, no marketing, software is not improving, pricey etc...it left me a bit scared to do another sales role...the pressure and lack of structure I had been poor on my mental health.

I have a job offer now for enterprise sales executive in an exciting field of tech - IoT/eSIM/telecommunications -- prospects here in this industry moving forward? I think it is a great role to refine my sales / account executive skills of course and learn. Likewise, I only have one year of BDM experience; I am a bit fearful...what if I can't close the deals ? But it seems this company has more of strategy/playbook/guidance etc...

I was more keen to go the partnerships' direction; since I'm more into the relationship-building long-term, co-marketing ideas, project collaboration; rather than aggressive close deal mind-set? But seems the two areas really overlap and maybe this role could propel me forward into a partnerships' role down the road or help discover more of the direction I should go?

I like creative, dynamic, and cross-functional projects. Unfortunately, I didn't ask about the potential to do this in the role, but it seems like there could be...(it 500 employee size, 40% growth yoy). The salary they offered seems low for base from my research, but I will counter negotiate...

I had a small interview today for Partnerships Manager but with this offer on the table...

Thanks for reading and any tips or advice would be great!",MadamImpossible,1,1.0,0,1723114665,2024-08-08 10:57:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1en2ygu/should_i_accept_enterprise_sales_exec/,8,2024

1en2551,"I recently started a new job after getting fired from my previous one, and will be attending a conference my ex-boss is also attending. What do I do?","So, this is kind of an odd question.

Earlier this year, I was let go from my old position at Company A for poor performance. Essentially, my workload got to unmanageable levels where I was putting in 60+ hours a week (with no overtime pay) and I became very burnt out and stressed from it all. I tried to tell my (now ex) boss about how I was feeling/tried to discern what I could do to manage it better, but my concerns were dismissed or I was told that I was doing fine/didn‚Äôt need to worry about it. After months of this, I received a verbal warning due to my work quality slipping, and pretty quickly after was fired.

A few weeks ago, after job-hunting and being on unemployment for months (where I was very close to it running out, actually) I finally landed a new job at Company B. So far, the job has been a blessing; I make significantly more than my last role (which underpaid me, so that‚Äôs not too surprising), a lot of the responsibilities are similar to what I did before (but it‚Äôs far less overwhelming overall as the workload isn‚Äôt nearly as high), and based on feedback from my new boss, I‚Äôve already made a very positive impression on my new team. 

However, there‚Äôs one caveat: during the interview process, I told them I was laid off, not fired. Of course, I wasn‚Äôt fired for doing anything illegal or immoral, but from past experience being honest in interviews not working well from me + general advice to just say I was laid off, I figured it would be better to say that and move on with my life. They contacted my references (neither were from Company A) and did a background check which obviously came back clean, so I was hired with no issue.

Unfortunately, I‚Äôm worried this will come back to bite me in the butt in a way that I didn‚Äôt anticipate; I was asked to attend a conference later this month with my new boss, which my ex-boss (XB) will also be attending. I know the odds of me running into XB aren‚Äôt high, but I‚Äôm really worried now that they‚Äôll see me and my boss while there and bring up that I was fired for whatever reason.

Is there anything I can do here? Do I tell my new boss the truth behind why I was let go, or just pray that any potential interaction with XB is as brief as possible? Or should I just decline going to the conference in the first place?",the-celestial-nerd,0,0.5,19,1723111655,2024-08-08 10:07:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1en2551/i_recently_started_a_new_job_after_getting_fired/,8,2024

1en0amu,"Job offer from middle east vs current job in Germany,  need advice ","Hi,

I have received a job offer of 7,500 EUR from a tax-free country in the Middle East. The company is big and world-famous. The package includes top health care for all families, an allowance for children's education even though we have no kids yet, and a few other small bonuses.

I could save 4,000 euros a month if my wife did not work. If she also finds a job, we could easily save around 5-6,000 euros. In Munich, Germany, we currently earn a total of 6,000 EUR and can save a maximum of 3,000 EUR, but this also comes with social security benefits like salary in case of unemployment. I must say I am not worried about pensions as 67 years is way ahead.

My job will be 100% more demanding, I will have to go to the office every day meanwhile I work completely remotely in GER.

My wife's career may be affected, we are not sure if she will be able to find a job easily as she is a nursery school teacher.

It feels like a very difficult decision, I don't have anyone to consult and I wanted to get different opinions. I would be grateful if you could share your thoughts and perhaps give me a new perspective.

1emzl8o,In a Slump after Getting Bachelors,"I graduated from SFSU earlier this year with a Bachelor of Arts in Film/Media. I originally was planning to pursue some kind of career in entertainment, but ever since I graduated, even with a solid resume, portfolio and brief PA (Production Assistant) experience I can't find ANY entertainment work whatsoever after applying to hundreds of different positions. Since May, I've only had 1 actual entertainment related interview for a 2 week long job that I didn't get. I have frequented film/media/entertainment spaces and subs (mainly r/FilmIndustryLA ) and the general consensus is that the entertainment industry is heavily declining after COVID and the WGA strike last year. Also from what I've seen, a lot of my other classmates who graduated with me haven't found jobs yet either.

I am weighing my options right now and I am mainly debating between pursuing a certificate or even MFA in film / tv production to gain potential work opportunities or pursue a career in marketing / advertisement, which is something I have been interested in about as long as I've been interested in entertainment. However I am not sure how I would begin to pursue marketing as my resume and portfolio is basically entirely geared on entertainment / TV production. Possibly an MBA?

1emzdu2,Should I try to get my old job back?,"For some context, I worked at the same retail store for nearly 5 years in the same position for a majority of it (I moved departments at the beginning of the year due to personal conflicts with another employee that I wanted to distance myself from, but the new position was more of the same). Another thing is that I'm pretty sure I may have undiagnosed ADHD and/or Autism as I'm definately some kind of neurodivergant and some things everyone goes through are incredibly difficult for me to get through. This will become important later.

Dor a majority of my time at this store, I was the person people would most ask for help on tasks or figuring out how to do something. I was also the fastest at the job while doing everything correctly. The store had a pretty high turnover rate and at the end, there were only 2 other employees that had been there longer than I. Even though it's retail, it felt like a second family for me. 

However, back in April, I was fired for supposedly doing something against policy in January that was supposedly caught on camera that I wasn't shown. I applied for unemployment immediately, just in case, and I got a letter from the DoL a month later saying that after an investigation, they determined that I didn't do the thing that was alleged.

I didn't want to start anything so I didn't do anything with it. I just started looking for jobs. After several months I finally managed to get one, but the transition hasn't been smooth. Going back to the undiagnosed neurodivergence: starting at a store I've never worked at, with people I don't know, in a department I've never worked, nor have I worked in a similar department, in a shift that completely flips my schedule... it's too much for me to handle all at once and I'm massivly freaking out about it (I'm good at hiding it so I haven't ruined anything at this new job yet.)

This is definately pushing me to seek the help I need, but that will take time. I feel like I need to do something immediately to mitigate it. The only  thing I can think of is taking that letter from the DoL and asking for my old job back, for some stability. But at the same time, that feels like the one thing I shouldn't do considering they fired me.",DarkTheImmortal,1,1.0,1,1723100488,2024-08-08 07:01:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1emzdu2/should_i_try_to_get_my_old_job_back/,8,2024

Currently I feel like my immediate manager and the growth head don't like me or have prejudices against me. 

We have been talking about a promotion (with more responsibilities and salary hike) for about an year now. They promised and every time the conversation happens, my manager mitigates it by saying upskill, show a road map of what you will do, etc. 

Now yesterday the HR called and I thought it's about a hike and promotion, as I've been already doing a lot of stuff that I would do in the next tole. 

But she again told me to come up with a list of courses. The company will fund it and then there can be promotion and hike.

I am honestly very tired of these promises. Every time they give me such promises, I feel hopeful. I have delayed job search for long time because of this.

IT looks like it‚Äôll be more ideal for my lifestyle . I want to have kids soon and although being a doctor would make sure my kids are well taken care of , I want to also be present for my kids and not let my lifestyle & money raise them . 

So my question is if anybody is in Tech or in the medical field (MD , PA, NP, RN) could yall lmk how is yall day to day life with a family ? Also if anybody has a job doing tech thats also aligned with healthcare thats great too !

1emu1nl,"I have no career from my undergrad degree and my early undergrad grades keep me from getting into grad school, so what now?","I graduated in 2019 and never achieved a job in my field (GIS). At this point, I don't think I'm even qualified anymore for a job in my field, I feel like I barely remember my degree at all.

I wanted to go to grad school while working. There's a school near me that offers programs that I could easily do while holding a job. But in my first attempt at college I was an idiot kid who did poorly. My gpa at the school I graduated from is above a 3.0, but factoring in all coursework from all schools (so including the grades from when I was 18) it's more like a 2.5.

So now I'm stuck. I have no career and no qualifications for one. I thought I'd go to grad school and get new qualifications (which I know I could do well in), but I can't because I was an idiot when I was 18. So now I'm 30, absolutely screwed by my 18 year old self, and completely behind my peers who have moved up through their careers and I feel that I will never catch up.

1emtwox,Salary Negotiation Tips,"Hey everyone,

I have been applying to jobs recently and found an opportunity that sounds really interesting as med device support specialist.

A couple days ago, I got a phone call from the hiring manager and it made me think things were looking good and I might get an offer soon: he gave me a ton of details on the job and a possible start date. At the end of the call, the manager asked what my salary expectations were, and said he was proposing a certain amount. I positioned myself ‚Ç¨2k above that offer and gave arguments and he said he‚Äôll see what he can do and that he wasn‚Äôt sure because salary were decided based off a grid.

Today, I got a phone call from HR who asked me to tell him what the hiring manager and I had discussed. I basically told him everything the manager told me including the package and that everything seemed good. He asked me what if I was accepting the offer and I said ‚ÄúYes, gladly!‚Äù

However I just realized that this may have been the opportunity for me to full negotiate the offer. HR never mentioned which salary would be on the job offer so I only understood it as ‚ÄúDo you accept the job with us?‚Äù, not something else.

What should my next step be? Should I wait for HR to send me a written offer? Or should I call or email back saying that I want $2k above what was discussed with the manager.

I‚Äôm still a junior in corporate world (only 2-3 years of experience) so any insight or advice is highly appreciated! üôèüèø",Adventurous-Way7094,2,1.0,7,1723082111,2024-08-08 01:55:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1emtwox/salary_negotiation_tips/,8,2024

Currently, I am debating on switching my major to either Business Administration w/ a concentration in Management Information Systems, Management, or Human Resources.

- After researching for quite a bit on Reddit, asking fellow peers and seeking advice from my high school counselor, this is at the top of my list because I see that it is centralized around both management and technology, which I really enjoy and having a technical skill such as working with computers sounds more secure. I am just scared that this major will limit my career options in the future (e.g., only roles such as data analysts, project management, SWE, other IT roles). I would like a career where I am able to engage and work with people, not just working IT jobs and coding all day.

1emt9mj,"Two months into my first post-college job, feeling so conflicted. ","Hi everyone, this is a throwaway (my main account has my literal face on it, so no way LOL)

Anyways, as the title said I just started my first post-college job about 2 months ago. I work in the PR/Marketing industry and I‚Äôm on the client relations team. 

I really like all my coworkers, and I think I‚Äôm fitting in well with everyone and my boss & other coworkers all reiterate that to me all the time. I‚Äôm pretty close with my boss, she is pretty chill we chat like friends as well as about work. She‚Äôs quite a bit older than me, just for context. 

I fully understand that while I am new, there are going to be things I have to learn. I won‚Äôt just automatically know how to use all our software and who gets what emails and proper language and what not. And to be honest, I‚Äôve learned a lot and quickly. But when I have those slip ups where my boss has to correct me I just can‚Äôt help but feel stupid and unworthy of being there. 

For example, yesterday I had a great day. I was super productive and got lots of things moving around the company & to clients and such and my boss and I and a few other coworkers had fun chit chatting at the end of the day. But today I messed something up (assigned a task in the wrong job, it was an honest confusion an this was my first time assigning this person something) and my boss had to correct me and I just felt like an idiot. I don‚Äôt want her to think I‚Äôm stupid & I want her to see that I am trying my hardest. I even do some things after hours if the work comes in or clients in different time zones send something. 

And I don‚Äôt blame her for correcting me, of course she has to! I just am being hard on myself because I feel like at this point in the job I shouldn‚Äôt be making these mistakes. It makes me worry that they will regret hiring someone right out of college. And I know they don‚Äôt regret hiring me, they make it clear they‚Äôre happy I‚Äôm there. I just can‚Äôt help but have some sort of imposter syndrome every time I mess something up. 

Like, her having to correct me ruined my entire day & I felt like crap the rest of the day. Beating myself up over how ‚Äústupid‚Äù I am. Again - not her fault. Idk why I am like this. 

Is it normal? Do I just feel so self unsure because this is my first job? I guess I‚Äôm just asking for some reassurance‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ thanks :)",Thick_Wolf_9874,1,1.0,1,1723080263,2024-08-08 01:24:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1emt9mj/two_months_into_my_first_postcollege_job_feeling/,8,2024
1emt7cs,What is your advice on how I should proceed in my career?,"Life / previous job context:

Recent graduate with a degree in Information technology. I had an internship for about a year and a half as a National IT Support Analyst (same thing then but needed it for school) after which I took a 3-month break cause I was drained and finished up my degree after which I took another job at a tax center (contracted not sure if it matters) in which I had so a bad break down after a month in that I decide to quit. Fast forward 6 months of looking for a remote job cause that's what I believe makes a job bearable for me with no success I landed an in-person call center-type role at a bank.

My issue:

I recently started to work I get depressed during and after work (9 to 5) every once in a while I get this nauseating feeling of why am I doing this, what the purpose is, and in general feel trapped almost. It has only been two days and it is just orientation and training I sit at my desk and just click nothing hard, the coworkers are nice, and management hasn't really spoken with me but from what I can see everyone is nice I even made a friend although not close. Everything seems to be going well I just don't get what this trigger of sadness or depression is. Am I just lazy and don't like work? So now I'm thinking if I should quit but if I do what would I do I can't live without money for the rest of my life.

Other potential Ideas on why I'm feeling this and potential resolutions that I thought of:

* I have thought about maybe just working for my family at their restaurant maybe this is a good idea for some reason I think that getting criticized by my parents is better. ( weird)
* I could just be lonely at work or maybe I don't find myself with a sense of belonging and that could be my cause of unhappiness.
* I also may have the option of starting a restaurant or a cafe of some kind which I would ask my parents from my parents along with taking a loan but this is very much an out-there thought.

Sorry kind of a long post this is most definitely something that I can just suck up and do in the cost of some mental but I'm just feeling sad and lost. I am hoping to find something to solve my issue, a remedy, or another option in life where I don't feel this way. I would like to deeply apologize if I sound like I'm just whining.

Side Note: For anyone suggesting things along the lines of work-life balance and focusing on what makes me happy after work and finding something to look forward to outside of work I thank you for the suggestion in advance but this does not work for me. I've been going to the gym every day, I've tried jotting down my thoughts in a journal, and I've taken vacation.

1emsif2,Job searching makes me feel horrible. How can I make it easier and be less hard on myself? I think being in the situation I am currently is bringing me down more than anything. ,"In 2020, I started at one of those company's that claim ""we're like family!"".  Lots of social events, charity work, etc. I began in the customer service department and have been there when it had 4 representatives and when it had 15 reps. It grew like crazy since last year preparing for the new client.  That's when everything changed for the worst...

Before the new client, we had summer hours where we were allowed to partake in, we had every holiday the rest of the company did, and we had permission to go to all of the events, lunches, etc. 

Once the new client joined in the fall, we lost all our privilege and had to work late shifts until 8pm. The rest of the company was out hours earlier, had every holiday off, and permission for the events and early releases. Our dept was told this was OK that we dont anymore because we got differential pay of 30% per day we worked until 8pm... on the team, our salaries are only about $45k, in a HCOL state, so it felt worth it at first because it bumped us up to about 58k.  

They originally said they'd raise my base salary to 55k, which was less money but would have set me up for the future there more. The CEO himself said to be greedy with what we request for compensation for all these changes and called me a star employee, saying pretty much said he'd do what I wanted when this new client comes.  I expressed that I wanted 20k on my base, assuming theyd negotiate with me. They offered the differential in the end and in hindsight, I feel I should have seen it as a hoax to get coverage in this time, because that's how it seems to be. 

Ever since, morale has dropped, all of management has changed, and everything has gotten worse and worse. Our team is being denied opportunities they're offering to the other departments to advance and learn more. We are extremely behind in backwork. We still have to work holidays no one else does for no extra money. They are nitpicky and track our screens and mouses, in addition to having us track all of our work, and if you make a mistake it is a huge deal. 

So now I am trying to get out and find something new.  I don't know what I want to do...nothing really appeals to me on the job listings. I am concerned I will get stuck in a similar situation again too once I find a company I do allign with. 

Of course I know now what to look for and such in the next job, but it's so scary and my self esteem feels low. I have had some traumatic happenings in my personal life the last few months and am trying to recover from that too. 

If there is anything more that I could be doing, please let me know. I've been reading the job postings daily and seeing where I'd fit but nothing seems to allign perfectly. I've applied for a couple things but didn't have a great feeling.  I am trying to remain optimistic but just feel like I'm good for nothing besides customer service, which I am trying to get out of. Any advice for getting past imposter syndrome and having confidence would be great too. Thanks in advance!!

1ems9c9,Advice for a jack of all trades?,"Hello,

I'm a 35(M) trying to carve my path and switch careers to get into get creative jobs like: environmental design, building public art installations, exhibition design, interior design, set design, SFX technician, drafting etc.

I have a B.S. in computer science and during college I switched concentrations from video game development to multimedia to cyber security. My minor is in environmental science.

During my senior capstone, I took on two internships. One involved teaching a group of highschool students about computer forensics, where I helped design a mock cyber crime investigation. The other involved working with a team to build a website wire frame.

After graduation, I was only allowed 1 more year to work at the lab before being laid off.

Since then I have; Did data entry. Worked two different IT helpdesk jobs. Worked as a Quality Control Manager/Chemist for a hygienic wipe manufacturer. Temped doing R&D for hair dye packaging. Worked as an M5 Technician.

Side gigs I've done: Tried to start my own business. Did Freelance video editing. Freelanced at a record label. Worked part-time at a dog daycare. Worked part-time at a hotel front desk. Setup & Managed remote inventory for a record label. Created an NFT collection.

I hated working IT Helpdesk, and have no desire to dedicate myself to grow in that industry.

My hobbies are making mixed-media paintings and sculptures, playing guitar, DIY, going to the gym, and hiking/foraging/spending time in nature. I've been making content with my art as well.

From my varied work experience, I enjoyed and was good at anything that required design, creativity, attention to detail, gathering and sorting data, making presentations, and conceptualizing.

The thing is I don't know how to get my foot in the door of any creative job. I don't have a professional portfolio, and to build the skills is going to take sometime, which I don't mind doing, but I still need to make money.

Does anyone know of any jobs I can get with my combined work experience and preferences that pay well? or advice on how to put my diverse work history in a positive light on job applications and cover letters?

1emqdhy,"I (22M) recently gradated college, and I feel completely stuck","**OP, you're a living stereotype!**

An extremely unremarkable position to be in, to be sure! But I am feeling quite a bit of anxiety and hopelessness, and it's still a tough position to be in. I'll try not to give away too many personal details

I live in the Central Valley in California and recently graduated college with a B.S. in History & Political Studies. My college was a small liberal arts college in a rural area, and I wish I had gone to a different school. I feel like I squandered the chance to meet with better opportunities because of that

(I still feel like it was meaningful and valuable! But not economically, unfortunately)

I'm currently trying to find a job now - ANYTHING - but my problem is that I literally have zero experience or skills

Okay, that's not *entirely* true: I was a cashier at a friend's gas station for a few months and I wrote and sometimes designed the layout for my college's student newspaper. And I'm very good at academic writing, and maybe a few other things, but that's it. I have no other skills to speak of

So I've been low-key panicking because I feel like it will be very difficult to develop a career I want from what feels like basically zero. Most available jobs in my area are either highly specialized technical jobs or minimum-wage dead-end jobs in retail

I'll get a retail job if I have to! But it feels like I can't even get into a job like this without some of the relevant experience - and if I do, I feel like it would be very easy to stay stuck there forever. And I hear that retail jobs are often pretty terrible, but I'll do it if I really have to

**What kind of career do you want, OP?**

As for my career, I'm not entirely sure what to do. In my senior year I decided I'd try and work my way into a Master's in International Relations and then get into the Foreign Service, but that's insanely difficult to do, and recently I learned I probably wouldn't enjoy all the traveling, anyway

Now I'm considering something in public policy - related, of course, but it seems like it's best to have fairly specific professional goals and some work experience before getting a Master of Public Policy. The Congressional Research Service stands out to me. I've always found their reports super helpful when wanting to learn about stuff, anyway

Unfortunately, my city's internship program is only for current students. I have yet to apply to internships from my various representatives, but I'm a bit pessimistic about my prospects given what I explained above. Other than these internships, I have no idea what else I could do

**What about your present situation?**

Thankfully I'm able to live with my parents for now and don't have to worry about housing or living expenses. I also sent my resume and some cover letters to a career services person from my college. She said she'd give feedback and I'm waiting on her response so I can start applying - she hasn't responded yet

**TL;DR:** I'm a recent college graduate with basically no skills or experience, and I kind of need to find a job soon. It's making me rather anxious.

1empflg,How to choose between two good career/life options?,"I feel conflicted and would appreciate advice or stories in how others have chosen between two good career/life options. 

My choices: 

1) Stay in current region and accept offer of deeply subsidized and stable housing. Continue to look for jobs that have similar or lower wage than choice 2), in a job market with more variety and opportunity. In this option I stay close to my existing professional and support network. 

2) Accept a high paying (high 5 digit) job in a different region, one that is beautiful and somewhat touristy, but has less job opportunities overall. Deal with trying to find housing in a tough market and have a HCOL which may negate any additional savings in comparison to 1). In this option I move to an exciting place and get the opportunity to reinvent myself.  

Both regions have notoriously competitive and expensive housing markets, and to be honest, having stable housing is like winning the lottery. But I'm concerned that I would be... selling myself short by not taking the really good high paying position in 2). Both areas are far enough away from each other that commuting from one to the other daily would make me miserable. 

Have there been any tools or visualization exercises, or other things that you have done that have helped you make a decision? Is there anything I am not thinking about that I should be?

The location of the job has a COL index that ranges, according to a variety of online sources, between 10% *lower* to 3% *higher* than the national average so not sure what to make of that. 

This would be my first job. I graduated with my BS in ME this past May. I worked 2 summers at the same place and have somewhat related experience. 

This job would require me to move. 

They are offering a 2.5k sign on bonus. I was wondering if I should ask for more. 

They are offering 67k. It would be GS 7 Step 10. But, according to the GS payscale chart, that pay is actually higher than they should be able to offer me. I know the GS payscale chart changes by region, but I am looking at the chart for the correct city. The offer is for more than 2k higher. I read that they can give additional pay if they really want a candidate, not sure if that is what is going on here. 

I was wondering what to think about 67k. I feel like the numbers on what is a good starting wage can vary so wildly. I am reading threads from 10 years ago where people claim that they made 65k out of college, and that was before all this inflation so it has me second guessing myself. It would be government though, so the benefits can add a lot of value. But it is also a security clearance job, so should I expect more from a job with requirements like that? Then again, having security clearance or having worked in a job that requires security clearance can lead to good opportunities down the line. 

What do you all make of this?

1emokh9,Has anyone else made the jump from agency to in-house? Any advice on breaking through the noise in this competitive market?,"Throwaway account, to remain anon.   
  
Agency life is notorious for burnout, and I've hit my wall. 

My current role was supposed to be a breath of fresh air. I was hired to lead the strategy for our content team, but instead of focusing on strategy and vision, I've been pulled into operations, client management, and even design. It's a far cry from what I signed up for.

The company has gone through a ton of internal changes since I was hired roughly \~3 years ago. We've let go of a lot of staff, and leadership has pushed the responsibilities of the team members that we've ""lost"" on to the remaining employees instead of hiring out. I spend a majority of my work week on operations, client and account management, copywriting, graphic designing, etc, and not much at all on what I was hired to do. 

I was lured to this position by promises of a supportive culture, but that hasn't been the case. I can admit I've been a people-pleaser, taking on more and more responsibilities out of fear of losing my job. Now, I'm desperately trying to break into an in-house role.

I've applied to hundreds of positions, tailored resumes, crafted cover letters, and showcased my work through reels and portfolios. Despite strong experience and a solid network/connections, I'm hitting roadblocks.

I have confronted them about this multiple times asking if I can have more tasks and jobs that actually advance my career, and they seem so reluctant to do so for whatever reason.

Instead they give other people those jobs and it's leaving me bitter. I know I can do those jobs or I can learn to do them well, yet I'm not given the chance. On top of that, I'm really not happy with the way they ""fix"" things. Sometimes I believe there are better ways to fix something.

1emmhfi,"Transitioning Back to Development After 10 Years ?
","Hi everyone,I'm looking for some guidance and advice on my career path, and I would greatly appreciate your insights.

Here's a bit about my background:

I graduated with a diploma in programming in 2015 and worked as a developer for a few companies. However, I realized that this field wasn't for me due to the stress and lack of enjoyment I felt. Almost 10 years ago, I decided to leave programming.Since then, I've been freelancing, primarily helping people and product owners manage their affiliate programs. This experience has allowed me to develop various skills, such as technical thinking, problem-solving, consulting clients, and more.

Now, at 30 years old, I'm feeling quite lost. I need a stable salary to meet life's demands and, after some deep thinking, I've realized that I'm not an expert in any particular skill that could secure me a stable job for the long term. One thing I've enjoyed during my freelancing years is working with WordPress, especially solving basic to complex plugin problems. Given my programming background, I'm considering diving into WordPress development.

However, I'm apprehensive about returning to programming. I'm worried about investing time in learning again, only to end up disliking it and quitting once more. I would love to hear your thoughts and advice on: How to overcome the fear of returning to a field that previously caused stress and dissatisfaction.

1. Whether WordPress development is a viable and stable career path in the current market.
2. Any alternative career paths that might suit my background and skills.

Thank you in advance for your help!",ElmouatazSaad,0,0.33000001311302185,3,1723062584,2024-08-07 20:29:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1emmhfi/transitioning_back_to_development_after_10_years/,8,2024
1emmfpg,Possibly stepping back from CFO position,"I'm not sure where to start because I really did not think I would be in this position. I guess a little bit about me is that I am the Chief Financial Officer of a large industrial services company (500M+ revenue) that is a business unit for a top 10 market cap public company. I have been in this role for four years, and I am a forty year old male. I came into this role after very successful runs in financial planning and analysis as a leader at other fast-rising companies, and made the switch making it through my earn-out and selling my equity in my last company after a selling to private equity. I've been considered a thought leader throughout my career, and am generally regarded highly in our industry and within my company. 

Things have truthfully been pretty successful. Profitability has been good, I've successfully integrated a couple of acquisitions, I am on a lot of the larger companies counsels for steering things, etc. Unfortunately, my background had very little exposure to an area where this unit has been historically weak: Billing. I have been attempting reshape our billing and collections for three years now, and it honestly just keeps getting worse. While we have made great strides in other areas like automation, forecasting, operational close, capital planning, etc., I actually think we've gone backwards in this area despite changing up the department and processes. 

I am pretty much at the end about it. I have never really had anything academically or professionally where I failed, but I am demoralized about this area. It is hugely problematic, and I've leaned on other leaders in the company, consultants, and other things to no avail. It's a big negative impact for the company, and I am out of ideas. I am certainly at an inflection point where I think it will stain the other things I have accomplished as a leader, and I quite frankly am feeling totally burnt out with it. 

At this point I am considering taking a step back. The invoicing environment in this company has historically been bad, and I know the industry as a whole is considered lousy, so I'm not an outlier. But I am pretty demoralized. I am considering going back to a lower role in a different company for a while to rehab myself. 

I'm not sure what advice I really need, but I know I am at a bit of a crossroads. The tone of this certainly does not reflect it, but I am usually a very positive person (which I think is partially how I've been successful in past difficult situations) and the negativity of this is really impacting my mental health. I think it would be a black mark for my career to take a step back, but I mentally and emotionally cannot keep up with the toll of this. I have two young kids and a wife I want to be there for fully, and this type of failure really creeps into my energy in all areas. I'm not mean, but I just do not have it out of here. 

I was accepted to a top executive MBA program that I wanted to attend a year ago to fill out the margins for me in some non-quantitative areas, so I have been thinking if I were to step back I'd create some bandwidth for myself to pursue that. I don't know if it is worth that either, because at this point I'm not sure if I am up to the rigors of the top flight management of a company. My analytical skills are very strong, I'm great at presentations, etc., but I do not really have much experience outside of finance. Becoming a bit more well-rounded and recharging seems like a plus right now. 

Sorry for being an Eeyore about this subject. I just am not feeling up to the task, and honestly I do not even know if I can take it until I find another job. Has anyone here ever taken a few year step back and felt up to things afterward? I appreciate any encouragement or honest answers.",Initial_Werewolf_735,3,1.0,1,1723062466,2024-08-07 20:27:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1emmfpg/possibly_stepping_back_from_cfo_position/,8,2024

1emll2a,Questioning my career choices,"Officially ended my internship as a Software Tester (I do a bit of coding as well) on 16 october 2024 as a Software Engineer, and fast forward 4 months later, i got a job as a Senior Operation Analyst (Trainee). At first, i was very excited, because the pays are considered decent, not to mention all the benefits i will receive as a staff. But 1 month into the job, i already feel like the work im doing is pretty underwhelming, and does not requires any degree at all. 

a few of the tasks are (Based on the paperwork given):  
1. Monitor all data, and ensure everything is working fine, otherwise, i need to escalate those issue to their respective department. (i still have no idea what those data represent, even asked a few of my friends and they themselves dont really know what those datas are)

2.  Set a daily backup using the IBM Data Cartridge, and i need to use a windows command to activate those backup. 

3.  Monitor policies using Dell Networker, and ensure every workflow up and running, otherwise i need to rerun the particular workflow, and up until 8:00am if the error still persist, i need to submit a ticket to the respective department. 

4. Monitor other countries (only 2) end of day batch processing, and again, if an error happened, i need to contact person in charge

5.  i have to remote access 4 of the main pc and make sure every processing is down by 12:00 AM, and make sure its up again for use by 8:00 AM. 

6. I have to remote access this one particular pc and make sure all important files there are at a current date

7.  At 7:00 AM, i have to set this one server machine up for a backup, and ensure there are no error during the process, otherwise, same thing, i need to escalate those issue. 

There are a lot more, but im sure these will give you general idea of how the task for my role is.  
As you can see, all the tasks given to me is something people would consider not a high skill ceiling job. Now dont get me wrong, im forever grateful for the job i have right now, its easy, yet pays so well, but to compare it with my friends, who have a much challenging job, makes me feel guilty. Most of them are either a programmer, or working in a security department, which is something respectable. 

If you guys are wondering how i landed on this job, in the interview, i did tell them that i would like to explore other options other than programming/tech support and they asked me right away, are you comfortable with working shift? to which i responded YES. 

Sorry for the long text, but i would really appreciate if you guys give your thoughts on this, or am i just overthinking?

Namely, I am 18 years old and I have one more year of high school left. I live in Serbia and my parents own six pharmacies in several smaller towns, one of which is my hometown. It has about 15,000 inhabitants. They earn very well, relative to the standard in Serbia, and I would even say in some Western countries like France and Germany. Every day I see how much they struggle (due to bad workers, poor conditions in the country, and the overall state of the country is very bad and who knows if it will improve). They can afford to send me to study abroad, which I initially liked, but as time goes by, I am increasingly in doubt. Let's say I study in Italy, I would graduate and have a salary of around ‚Ç¨5,000 per month, which makes me an average Italian. I think that in my town I could have a salary of ‚Ç¨3,000, which is better because the costs are lower, and my family is there. In Italy, I would study something related to finance or economics. What do you think is the best option? Stay in Serbia and study or go abroad and leave everything I have here?

1emjl1q,"passed over on promotion and internal opportunities, need help","So I'm currently 2.5 years into my role and i'm currently doing really well performance wise but have had trouble making a movement internally. I work in B2B sales and for the past 3 quarters have been over 100% in performance.

  
For more context, management over the course of the past year had told me that i would get promoted, and even in emails had an outline of my promotion timeline. At start of this year that changed, and suddenly they won't promote me because it would take too long to get me ramped up. Interestingly enough, I was told a different story from HR, saying that they do not promote people who are not ""sales convicted"".

So the only options were for me to explore roles internally but after 3 tries they aren't giving me any more chances. I tried my hand at client success, was denied due to lack of attrition. I tried lead qualification, but was denied simply because I just didn't do that great in the final round roleplay (I tried hard but knew it wasn't a good fit for me). Recently I tried talent sourcing, and I was passed over by an external candidate even after getting excellent feedback in the second round.

  
I feel like this company has dragged me through so much, I've worked so hard to be a one of the best on my team. I don't feel like I'm wanted and that good work doesn't mean anything at my company. Would love to hear anyones thoughts, or if they've been through a similar situation. Some advice on what I can do next looking for another job would be super helpful as well.",Imaginary-Ad-3843,0,0.5,0,1723055692,2024-08-07 18:34:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1emjl1q/passed_over_on_promotion_and_internal/,8,2024
1emjcci,Advice on Adjusting Job Titles for Resume and LinkedIn: How to Handle Discrepancies?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm seeking some advice on how to handle job titles on my resume and LinkedIn as I search for my next role.

I‚Äôve adjusted the job titles on my resume and LinkedIn to better reflect the responsibilities I undertook:

* **Original Titles**:
   * Project Coordinator for my first role
   * Project Manager for my second role
* **Adjusted Titles**:
   * Project Manager for my first role
   * Program Manager for my second role

I made these adjustments because I believe the roles I performed were more aligned with these higher-level titles. However, I‚Äôm concerned about potential issues, especially with reference and background checks due to these changes.

Specifically, I‚Äôm worried about:

* How significant the difference in titles might be during background checks.
* Whether it‚Äôs better to stick with the official titles or use the adjusted ones.
* How to effectively explain these adjustments if questioned by potential employers.

Has anyone faced a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice on the best way to navigate this issue would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your insights!",No_Actuator_7706,0,0.5,0,1723055123,2024-08-07 18:25:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1emjcci/advice_on_adjusting_job_titles_for_resume_and/,8,2024

1emj8f2,"Promotion possible only if I campaign for myself and ""kiss babies"" and be noticed by other team leads","When I had a career conversation regarding promotion, the takeaway was that the highest likelihood to get promoted is by jumping to another department. And that is most likely to happen if I am noticed by other leaders of other departments and if they see the value in me.
I was surprised that there is barely any emphasis on being promoted within the department itself.
My question is, is this normal? Usually there is room to grow within the job you are in, the department you are in. So you can start junior then become senior, then manager or whatever.

1eminu2,16 year old - can't get a first job anywhere,"I'm 16M in the UK and been trying to get my first part-time job for the past 3 months. I'm applying for all the typical minimum wage jobs (retail, fast food, kitchen porter, cleaner etc.) and have applied to 150+ so far but gotten a grand total of 1 interview. Most places don't even send a rejection email, they just completely ghost me.

I've been using Indeed and I've also gone multiple in person to pretty much every shop in my town centre to ask if they're hiring (nowhere was). I put a lot of effort into each application, I've spent ages making my CV look the best it can be, and I write a cover letter for each application. I'm not being picky at all - I don't care about salary as long as I get paid full stop, I'm happy to do the most boring job that no one wants to do, and I'm applying to jobs that I can get to within like an hour and a half by bus which is a pretty big radius. (In Scotland young people get free bus travel so that's not an issue)

I have great grades at school (over 97% for all classes this year), always on time, very hard worker etc. I volunteer at a charity shop which has given me experience with working a till and customer service and stuff like that. My manager commented ""fantastic customer service and attention to detail"" on an award certificate I recently got for my volunteering. But still nowhere seems to even give me the time of day when I apply for jobs.

None of my friends have jobs and my parents don't have many connections so I can't really get a job through just knowing someone. Most people at school seem to have a job but I have no clue how they get jobs so easily. The constant rejections are really getting to me and I don't know what to do to improve because nowhere ever tells me why I'm rejected, just that I've been unsuccessful. I feel like such a failure because I can't even land a low paid job at somewhere like McDonald's.

I'm desperate at this point, does anyone have any advice?",job_help_,0,0.5,1,1723053534,2024-08-07 17:58:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eminu2/16_year_old_cant_get_a_first_job_anywhere/,8,2024

1emhb1d,I (28 F) feel stuck in my current role as an admin assistant ,"I (28 F) feel stuck in my current role as an admin assistant at a local school. I have a bachelors in business administration and various management skills learned in previous roles. I will add that I am 34 weeks pregnant with my first baby and I do disclose this information if I get invited to any 2nd round or final round of interviews. I feel like that's important for them to know since I will be on leave, plus I don't want to surprise them when I do an in-person interview. Recently, I applied for a position that hit everything on my list: good benefits, a hybrid work schedule, and a company that really values family and employees. Plus it would have been a pay bump for me as well as an opportunity to grow my career. I went through all the rounds of interviews and met with all the executives I would have been working with. They even called my references as well. They finally called me, but it wasn't to offer me the position, it was to tell me they went with a different candidate; they said that they loved meeting me and also told me they would like to stay in contact for future opportunities but it was really competitive and I just didn't hit their mark. I don't know how I should feel about this. Did I not get the job because I am due soon? Do employers tell candidates they would like to keep in contact for future positions all the time? Am I overthinking this? I really needed this new position to stay afloat financially with a new baby. Should I keep looking for something once the baby is born?

1emgriu,How do you gently tell your manager that they're not helping you?,"Hi All, 

I've started to notice a trend that my manager is becoming less and less interested in helping me manage the complex tasks and projects I deal with everyday, vs. some of the miscellaneous things we execute every once in a while, that are far less important and visible. For example, I picked up some additional clients the past few months, and my workload has increased by about 30%. Rather than jump in and help knock some of those pending items out, he seems focused on ""improving"" small existing processes. That's not to say these small things aren't important, but they are so far down on my to-do list, it gives me the perception that my manager doesn't really care or understand about my overall workload. 

In general, our relationship is really good, and naturally i need his advocacy to continue to move up in the org, but dumping little random tasks on me only pulls my further away from the real meaningful and visible work. 

Is there a nice way to tell him that he's focused on the wrong things? Or should I just bite the bullet and play happy corporate cog?

I am ESL as well, if the grammar isn't great.

I asked for a promotion in my current job as I feel as though I am doing the work of a senior position, I took on two new projects that are big ones and both went super well and maintained all the other duties of my job as well. I received a stellar yearly performance review and asked if a promotion would be possible. My leadership team returned to my boss and let him know that I won‚Äôt be receiving a promotion this year but I am on the right track to receiving one someday. My coworker who should have been promoted a year ago was promoted instead. Which I guess is okay news, but I worked so hard last year and I‚Äôm feeling a little undervalued and discouraged as I really though I had a shot and I fear I‚Äôll lose my motivation from this rejection.

1emcfj2,Asking for a raise,"I need advice on asking for a raise. I am the youngest at my job by quite a lot and also everyone in my team has been here for 5 years or longer. I have been here for 6 months. When I initially got hired I was part time but became a full time employee 4 months in. When I initially got the job I didn‚Äôt negotiate for a higher pay because the field is something I‚Äôm unfamiliar with, I wasn‚Äôt confident in my abilities, and I was finishing my associates in business still. Now I‚Äôve graduated and I‚Äôve more than proved I can do the job. 

My boss always tells me that she is so grateful for me. I appreciate it and my boss is amazing. I am also taking on more responsibilities as I am a regular member of the team now. I am going through a major life change in November and making $25/hr would make the change much easier and more manageable. I currently make 21.50/hr. Would asking for 25 be unreasonable? 

I have a lot of outside pressures to ask for the raise by November but I worry that I haven‚Äôt been here long enough or don‚Äôt deserve a raise. What would y‚Äôall do?  I work in compliance and suspect I may be getting severely underpaid but I‚Äôm insure. 

I truly love this job and I‚Äôm very happy here. It aligns perfectly with my working style and I have a lot of independence and flexibility. 

Any advice on how to ask and what I should be prepared for is greatly appreciated. Thanks! ",LikelyStoryMrPrez,0,0.5,6,1723038927,2024-08-07 13:55:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1emcfj2/asking_for_a_raise/,8,2024

1embwuz,Emotionally Abusive Boss,"Hi all- I am in need of some serious advice regarding my current position and work environment. I have been with the same logistics company for approximately 2.5 years now, and I would first like to recognize that the pay is decent and I am very good at what I do. I truly pride myself on my work ethic and ability to multitask and take on plenty at once. However, my boss is making it incredibly difficult to work here. Here are just a few things that my boss does that have profoundly impacted my ability to complete my tasks and lead a happy life:
- ÔªøÔªøWe never know what version of him we will get each day. He often comes in irate (screaming, slamming things, and making very hurtful remarks to my coworkers and I), which automatically gives me anxiety. I have had full-on panic attacks at work resulting in me hiding in the bathroom unable to breathe.

ÔªøÔªø- He has very clear favorites. More specifically, there is one woman that he refuses to reprimand or hold to the same standard as the rest of us. She is allowed to exceed her allowed time off, and makes numerous mistakes every day (all of which I have to fix). Her tasks are simply neglected, she is never expected to learn from her mistakes, and the burden is thrown onto me to ensure the job is done correctly and in a timely manner. When others have brought up her negligence and incompetence, he defends her and says that ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not going anywhere, so I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù


ÔªøÔªø- We received a significant pay cut last year due to funds being low. I was absolutely understanding of this. However, despite low funds, he continues to hire new individuals who are not qualified for the job and often pays them more than those who have been here for years. The woman I previously mentioned (the favorite) has gotten multiple raises in the last year because she tells my boss she is going to leave as she is broke. Because of his uncanny obsession with her, he caves each time and she walks out with a higher pay.

ÔªøÔªø- He makes very inappropriate comments to us all. Sexual comments, racist comments, hurtful remarks. You name it- he has done it.

- He makes personal digs at us all. You can tell he quite literally wants a reaction out of us for his entertainment. 


There are a plethora of other factors contributing to my unease and dissatisfaction with my job. I find it very hard to wake up in the morning and go to work. I often cry on my way to work. Over the last few months, I have lost over 30 pounds from the constant state of stress I am in. Each day, I have to assume the roll of multiple people, as no one is held to a standard, and excuses are constantly made. I have never felt so drained in my entire life, and unfortunately, this has started to impact my personal life as well. After being treated like a doormat at work, I often come home crying and anxious. The last thing I want is for this to impact my relationship with my fiance and family members. However, I am so scared to jump the gun and leave. I have been trying to find another position. Any & all help is appreciated.",One_Attempt_2836,1,1.0,0,1723037610,2024-08-07 13:33:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1embwuz/emotionally_abusive_boss/,8,2024

1emaum5,How to turn down training without telling my boss I'm planning on leaving?,"So I work for a construction company, I'm 20 and started at 18 after highschool. 
I was always planning on going to school but I was really depressed all through highschool and never made any actual plans for my life. 
Because of this I started working construction because I needed something to do, I ended up going from a student to labour to having a full time position in the company.

Now I'm doing better and want to apply for school and leave in the spring (in about 10 months). 
The issue is they're putting me through a course in a week, the course is about 8k a person and I will be the only person in my area with it aside from my boss. 

I don't think there's any point in me taking the course as I know I won't be around to use it and make it worth it. 
Not that I care if the company loses 8k, but I do care that I'll be only one with the training and it'll inconvenience my coworkers. 

I don't want to tell my boss I'm planning on leaving in 10 months because why would I do that, but I also don't think I should get the course since I know I'll only use it for one summer. 

Maybe I'm over thinking this and should just take it and not overcomplicate things, but idk I can't decide and I do the course in a week so I need to figure it out.

Now i have two choices either i go for communications trade which is pretty much guaranteed and see where life takes me or decline that offer and stick with aircraft technician application which has very high competition and there‚Äôs no guarantee i will be selected as they already pre selected me for communications.

1em7i65,Should I negotiate my title?,"TLDR: I took an entry level temporary position. They are now offering me a permanent position. With my previous 5 years work experience in this field plus what I‚Äôve done at the company currently backing me up, should I ask for more senior position title?

Hey Reddit , I‚Äôm looking for some advice. Let me give you some background first: I worked my previous job as a Department Coordinator for a local government office. Feeling unsatisfied with the pay, career progression, and working in an office with very low morale due to elected official‚Äôs decisions I looked for a new job. As Department Coordinator, I did a lot of administrative tasks but I also trained new employees and wrote all of our training materials and procedures. So, I have some background in learning and development. 

A local engineering firm was hiring for a TEMPORARY Learning and Development Training Coordinator. Someone was out on emergency maternity leave (and was also one of 5 employees on the team) so they needed a warm body to hold the fort down. I applied and was offered the temporary job, they made it very clear it would only be for 3 months. It also was a slight pay cut ($4,000 less annually). But, I thought it was worth the risk to at least get genuine HR/L&D experience so I accepted. 

About half way through that contract, they were very pleased with my work and they asked me to extend my contract for another 3 months, fully disclosing that they are talking to the CEO and COO about hiring me full time permanently. I have been given the green light and the official job offer is coming August 15th. 

In my 4 months with the company I have taken on managing the website for our department, created and implemented a Job Shadowing program, assisted with migrating to a new Learning Management system (which as part of my duties, I will be the main admin for this system), and then filled in where they needed me. But I believe I have done more than just fill in for the person who was out on leave. 

With my last experience plus what I have brought to the table is it out of pocket to ask to be titled a Senior Training Coordinator? They have the position listed on the career progression chart for this department but no one currently holds that title. The girl I covered for is also just a plain Jane training coordinator but from what I understand she didn‚Äôt have a background in this field so I think the entry level title suits her. 

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. Is this a stretch to ask for? Am I being entitled? Does a title matter that much? Please help. ",jcrawfish,0,0.5,0,1723023325,2024-08-07 09:35:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1em7i65/should_i_negotiate_my_title/,8,2024

1em60ws,"Asked for a raise, they told me prepare a proposal & we will discuss it in the meeting. I have social anxiety. I'm thinking of pulling back my request. ","So, every one in my team is getting paid  X amount which is twice of what I am getting paid. And I have been here for 8 months now. 

Everyone started their contracts with X amount but they started my contract with Y amount half of X. I got to know that after I joined. Though my workload was less that time. Not quite half though more than that. 

But after three months they told me they expect me to contribute more and ofcourse they will  increase my pay as well and I said sure. And in the next couple of months I started working more almost catching upto the current members. 

First, you will have to know where I am coming from. 

I have got depression and some serious social anxiety and I feel like maybe I am a pushover sometimes and people just take advantage of me. So I m very sceptical. 

I wasn't even sure I was fit to work but landed a remote gig anyways. I love my team. I like the work. It's something I can do. I even received positive feedback on my progress on multiple occasions. 

I just always felt like 'less' somehow. I know I'm not the best on my team and sometimes I struggle with the deadlines. It's difficult when somedays you just don't want to wake up to another horrific meaningless day and cry your eyes out and struggle to justify your self worth. I have thought of quitting a lot. The reason I haven't quit is probably because it's such a pain to tell them and explain this face to face. (I haven't told them about any of my personal struggles). 

I can also ghost them and block them but man that's jus pathetic so I stick to it. Some days are better than others. 

But I have a team and I feel responsible and I want to keep my promise. I get very nervous between people and groups. My thoughts get all jumbled. And I constantly freak out incase I embrass myself.(&,i have a lot, though nobody talks about it.) 

Last month two new members joined and they started with X amount too and double my work load and I thought it's finally time I tell them I can do this too. 

I want them to treat me as an equal. I mean if even new members are getting paid more than me something must be wrong with me. 

I just told them. Told em I want a raise after some immense internal struggle. I jus want to get treated fairly. 

Heck it's not even about the money I just want to feel like I matter in this team and that what I do means something. I volunteer when something new comes up, i go out of my way to look for solutions. I try okay. I try. 

So when I heard that they want to specially prepare for a meeting to discuss my raise i freaked out. I can't do meetings I barely hold up on daily brief meetings and it's so stressful to do them and one focused on me is where people would dicuss me. 

Idk it makes me look like I have asked for something I wasn't supposed to and now I will judged whether I'm worthy or not. 

I'm thinking of just texting my senior that it's cool.
 I don't feel like getting a raise anymore or that I'm not ready. I don't want to this. I'm not sure. Please help. ",FunMemory5642,2,1.0,2,1723017240,2024-08-07 07:54:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1em60ws/asked_for_a_raise_they_told_me_prepare_a_proposal/,8,2024

1em5r02,Considering leaving my new job of 1 month for a different job offer. Any advice ?,"About 1 month ago I started a part time job at a firehouse subs. The work is very easy, and I am the hardest working employee there of the other  team members, excluding shift leaders. Others hired around the same time as me are just simply not as motivated. I am continuously going above and beyond in my work. The pay is minimum wage ($12/hr where I live)

I don't mind the work but the commute to work is about 2 hours each way by public transit. I do not mind this really.  Although I enjoy working here and the people are cool, I would much rather be a busser at a restraunt. Initially that's what I was looking for, but because of my lack of money and facing homelessness I had to take what I could. 

My real problem with this job is a moral one. The management as well as most of the employees are LGBTQ. Although this in itself does not bother  me outright ( to each their own) I have certain morals that make it unconformable for me to work in this environment.  I am a Christian. My GM used to be a woman but wants to be viewed as a man.  I have trouble referring to him as ""He/Him"" 

I respect everyone and never have I made this an issue but personally this goes again my own morals.

I have an interview tomorrow for a busser position at red lobster very near to where I live.  

Would it be wrong of me to accept a position at red lobster and quit my current position because of these reasons? The pay at red lobster seems to be more of course, taking into account daily tips and less money spent daily on commute.

1em4z3n,Scared of choosing wrong job offer,"Hello everyone,

I know this is a real luxury problem to have but I am so bad at making decisions I kinda wish one of the companies would have just turned me down. For context I am in the EU so the salary is in euro

offer 1:  
Company itself has only 85 employees but it is part of a network of several companies (2000 employees) and is part owned by an established bank. So the area would be FinTech

The pay is 80k with a possible bonus of 5k on top

They ask for two days in the office per week but say they are also cool if I can't make that every week and the office is just 35 mins away with public transport

They offer 2 months of remote work from within the EU and an option to buy up to 20 holiday days additionally to 30 paid holiday days. The office is pretty modern and even has a gym.

So the point I am struggling with is that it would be a bit of a boring field I would be working on, I tried applying for jobs which have more purpose but either the pay is really bad or I got no responses at all. The colleagues seem nice. I would have the usual update meetings like daily standups but I was told the team was pretty mature and has been working for them for many years. Also I would be part of a fairly new project so I can still have some influence in shaping how we work together.

offer 2:  
Company is very small 45 employees owned by the founders. He said they have been growing healthily for over 20 years and since their customers are governmental organisations around the world I believe that. They are working in a cybersecurity niche.

The pay is  70k and no bonus

They are working pretty much remotely and have an office day on Wednesdays where people are free to come in if they want to

30 days of paid holiday. working remotely from other countries: though its not like a set perk that they offer  I heard that some people are working from other countries for some weeks to visit family.

What I liked when interviewing for this role was that the team seems very mature and independent, so there won't be a lot of update calls needed and the field they work in is more interesting. My fear is that with a small company the workload can easily become a lot and your work is much more under scrutiny if you know what I mean? You will always have an owner whose ""money"" you wasted. While I am a good worker I would say I also like to slack off sometimes.

Both would be full-time positions (40h/week)

Now I am wondering if could possibly negotiate 70k for 30 hours in the second position. Do you think this would be doable? Do you think I would be crazy not to just take the safer option (I can still buy 20 additional days of holidays and just have 2 free Fridays per month)...just wanted to get some outside perspectives here

Thanks so much in advance!

1em3o5u,How to ask HR for a travel meal per diem,"I work at a law firm as a trainer for some of the staff, which requires overnight travel about once a month or so. I have been told by HR that they will not cover food (they cover hotel and rental) as I would be eating anyway. They have also brought up the issue with ‚Äútechnically‚Äù having to expense these costs to client‚Äôs cases and not being able to justify that. This hasn‚Äôt been a major issue as the traveling has been relatively infrequent, but we have recently started hiring outside of my area in towns 2 to 5 hours away. We have also implemented more in person training for new highers, which will mean traveling at least once a month, if not more. These stays will likely be 2 nights, sometimes longer. 
I want to approach HR and ask about the possibility of a per diem rate for food while traveling. I live with a significant other, and we cook most meals, so I tend to bring in left overs for lunch that only cost about $3 a serving. It‚Äôs not impossible, but difficult to eat that cheap while traveling, and the thought of having to pay these costs more frequently is making me anxious. 
My question is, what would be the best way to approach it and arguments to use to support my side?

I've always been interested in computers and math, but I decided to settle (or at least I feel like I did) for a business degree. Currently, I'm working as an administrative assistant. Lately, I've been contemplating a major change in my career path, and I'm trying to navigate through two options.

My current position ties into the insurance industry, though I'm not currently licensed. Recently, my manager mentioned that he thinks I would make a good insurance agent. He also mentioned that getting licensed could lead to an estimated 50% increase in my salary. He believes I have the right fit for the role. I would just need to pay for obtaining the Georgia Property & Casualty licensing fees.

On the other hand, I have a buddy from undergrad who's working in the cybersecurity industry. He often talks about how great his job is, working remotely and making double my current salary. He's offered to guide me through the transition, and he feels confident that I have the competence to make it.

So, I'm at a crossroads. Do I pursue the insurance path with a tangible pay raise and the backing of my current manager? Or do I take a leap into cybersecurity, a field I'm genuinely interested in, with the potential for a significant increase in salary and the perks of remote work?",Low_Acanthisitta_241,0,0.5,0,1723007571,2024-08-07 05:12:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1em3k4w/career_crossroads_insurance_or_cybersecurity/,8,2024

1em39fb,"Boss told me to change what I do outside of work to get sick less or I'd lose my job, this seems like its overstepping","My boss put me on a PiP for being sick due to a new work policy where we can only get sick 5 times in an annual rolling year. My partner and I got sick multiple times since we moved to a big city from a small town where we didn't get out much. Otherwise prior to the move we rarely got ill. Over time I accumulated enough absences that I got put on a PiP. This caused me to have panic attacks anytime I coughed and I got sent home. Finally in my second year at work we've stopped getting sick as much but my partner gets sick almost every 1 to 2 months. I think he has something going on and I've been begging him to get it checked out as I have exclusively been getting my illnesses from from him. In a recent talk with my boss, she told me I should change my habits outside of work. I've been getting sick from my partner, so I'd basically have to break up with him to keep my job.. This seems like its overstepping as my job shouldn't be dictating what I do outside of work other than not being an awful person. I would basically need to break up with my boyfriend and never go outside to stop being ill.  I told her I'm not breaking up with him for my job. To give more context, I work at a hospital, I CANNOT go to work sick. To get off this PIP I'd be at the mercy of random chance. So I've started looking for other work, networking, and building my skills behind her back. In the meantime, I think she has gone WAY too far. I'd contest the PIP For being sick but I did not have doctor notes for some of the instances I was out as per policy if its only 2 days I don;t need a doctors note and the days I was out >2 days it was mostly due to policy and not required. I'm applying for FMLA for the anxiety attacks and FMLA and doctors notes any point I get sick again for now. But what I'm wondering is if I should go to HR. By going to HR it puts eyes on me which I don't want, but i don't want my boss to get the idea she can overstep like that without some consequence as she's using it as a management tactic to scare people into compliance. She basically yelled at my coworker from absences too so I'm not the only one in this boat and we're both trying to leave. My boss is also retiring in 9 months but I don't feel like I want to stick around.  my gut instinct is to lay low and wait it out till i find new work and her having to re-hire someone will be enough punishment as we take 2 years to train.

1em1uo2,Reference Check Woes,"I'm in a weird situation. My field is in tech sales with startups and I've been unemployed for over a year. Recently I went through six rounds of interviews. Furthest I've made it in this entire time I've been unemployed. The team, including both co-founders, were impressed and we've gotten along very well. Not to mention this was my ideal company. Not just because of the great pay, but I loved the product and the team.

I was asked for references and gave four - their requirement - with two references from each company. I reached out before to all four and got zero replies.

When I left my first company the leadership team was pissed. They just raised their series A and hired a ton of people in sales. They were afraid my departure would hurt morale as I was one of the longest tenured people on the team and was doing well. I only left as it wasn't a right fit for me anymore. And this company has a policy where if anyone leaves they notify the entire company on Slack and ask that you limit interaction with this person. Doesn't matter your role.

At the second company things were vastly different. I got along well with the VP who hired me. Unfortunately, after two months he was fired and someone replaced him. He wanted to bring his own people and slowly started firing everyone this VP had brought in. I was the second last to go.

Feeling like I had no other choice, I used those four people as reference. I was hoping they would just ignore the reference request email. Nope. The Head of People told me she had two calls scheduled; one from the first company I worked for and one with the second company I worked for.

I was told I was the only person who had made it this far and today I get an email saying that they went with another candidate. Just a day earlier, on Monday, I had a call with HR for close to two hours to finalize my salary, commission structure, and benefits. Only bad references would have made them not make me an offer.

At this point, I have no clue what to do next. Even if I get this far with another company I'll still run into this issue. I've been thinking about my options and can't think of anything.

I've been sick all day, can't hold down food, can't sleep, and am beyond stressed and riddled with anxiety. I have no clue what to do other than hope that I'll find a company that is willing to hire me and won't do a reference check like both of the previous companies I worked for.",x058394446,1,1.0,0,1723001847,2024-08-07 03:37:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1em1uo2/reference_check_woes/,8,2024

1em16fe,Am I overthinking about my performance?,"I started a new job about half a year ago & everyone in my team is at least 5+ years older than me.

Ive been the industry for close to a decade and was consistently a top performer (across different managers) at my previous companies which meant that I was always assigned the most desirable projects. 

Over the past half a year in my new job, I was assigned a project that was supposedly an ‚Äúeasy starting project‚Äù but then came with a lot of unexpected challenges along the way which I effectively mitigated and got a lot of cross-functional recognition for. My manager does not compliment me all the time (and I don‚Äôt expect him to) but he has made just subtle comments on my great work and quick ability to learn. I never receive any feedback about areas to improve in so it sort of feels like my manager is happy with my work?

However, what has me concerned recently is that I am not being assigned more desirable / challenging complete projects, but rather ‚Äútasks‚Äù which are rather undesirable & that I feel very over experienced for. In the meantime, my coworkers are constantly being given lead roles and other desirable, high visibility projects and they have been around for maybe 2years at most more than I have. 

I keep overthinking ‚Äî is this because I‚Äôm not performing at this company as well as I did at my previous companies / throughout my career? Or is this simply to do with that fact that I‚Äôm way back in line compared to my coworkers who have been around for longer.

I did apologize and try to explain myself, but since then she's cut me off and our relationship has been strained. Well I reached out to her about a month ago as some time has passed and she works at another company. I was like do you want to start over and be friends again, and to my surprise she said yes.

1em08fw,"Quitting job after 8 months, but boss wants me to stay. Any advice?","
I emailed my resignation letter to my boss today, and during our meeting he expressed he really wants me to stay, and to reconsider leaving. I have nothing bad to say about the people, but my main issue is the role I‚Äôm in and what that entails (dispatching coordinator for a corporate, power company). I‚Äôve been in this role for 8 months and been stressed for the last 7. My stressors may be alleviated in the next few months (adding more resources to team, etc) but I really don‚Äôt know if I could hold out for that long. He says I‚Äôve done such a great job so far and the account managers I work under have always had good things to say about me. We‚Äôre already short staffed as it is and I feel guilty about leaving, especially since the people in the office are nice to work with. 

I do have another job lined up, for a small family owned business and the manager understood I was coming from a workplace filled with stress and she reiterated I would not have as many responsibilities in this new workplace. A chill, ‚Äúboring‚Äù job is what I was looking for in this recent job search and it sounds like this would be it

Has anyone let guilt take over and stay at a job for the people, pushed through the rough patches, and for the potential of things getting better? Or did you go with your new job offer?

1em062o,I want to change my job but I can't afford the paycut. Do I have any other options?,"I'm in a field that I really enjoy, at a company that I like, and make a pretty good salary but I hate my position and despite my best efforts I haven't been able to change that. 

I started 2 years ago and had originally applied for an entry level position with our project team, but my final interview was with the VP of Operations and she convinced me to work for her. At the time it made sense: she told me I'd basically be a jack of all trades in the company and would be working with all of the teams in the company. I thought this sounded good because I was still trying to figure out where my skills and interests aligned in the industry. I was also told if I ever wanted to switch departments it would be a pretty easy switch. 

Unfortunately, that boss left after my first 4 months. No one knew what to do with me, I hadn't recieved a lot of training yet, so I was mostly handed random HR tasks. I thought things would change when we got a new department VP. Then a year later we hired a manager who became my direct supervisor. I have told both of my bosses during 1:1s and performance reviews that I would like to try and re-align my job duties away from HR and back to what I was originally hired for. They always seemed agreeable to this but nothing changed. 

Recently I took it upon myself to go directly the department heads of two teams I'd be interested in switching to. One of them I've known since I started and we were able to have a more candid conversation. He basically told me that internal politics were stopping him from getting involved with me, and he was afraid of retaliation if it was perceived he ""stole"" me. 

The other department head is newer, so in our conversation I didn't immediately mention I was looking to change teams. But from that conversation I did learn that the position I was hoping I could switch into was already filled by a new hire. 

I don't really know what to do at this point. I could stay in my current position and be well-paid but miserable. Unfortunately I'm just not someone who can show up to work and be a robot. I find myself being resentful and jealous of my coworkers for getting to do projects I want to do, and I don't like feeling that way. 

I could quit and find a new job in a department I'm interested in. I want to stay in my current industry but because I don't have experience outside of generic HR tasks I'd have to start at the bottom and take a $30k paycut, which isn't financially possible for me. 

I could go to grad school and try to gain more experience that way, but all the programs I've looked at are full time and I wouldn't be able to live off a stipend if it was even offered. 

I feel stuck. I'm 29 which feels so young but also so old. Right now my only hope is to keep schmoozing with the other team directors and hope if a position opens up they'll let me switch but that's not a guarantee.

1elzlpd,Computer Science graduate wanting to switch to Marine Sciences. Which path to take?,"
Hello everyone. 

I‚Äôm 24, so let‚Äôs assume if I were to pursue further studies, I would start at 25.

I‚Äôm from South America. 

Firstly, I am aware that marine sciences is a very competitive field and that I will earn more (probably) working in computer science. 

I never really loved computer science, I just did it because it was what was recommended to me by my father. 

My true interest lie in marine sciences, or anything related to nature and animals, to be honest. 

I researched some options:

1. Pursue a master in Marine Environmental Sciences in Germany, as they take CS graduates. (Duration of 2 years)

2. Pursue another bachelor, but this time in Biology/Marine Biology, then a master‚Äôs in the same field. (Duration would be 5 years)

3. Pursue a master in Bioinformatics in Queensland, Australia, as they have a strong connection with the marine sciences department to conduct joint research. (Duration of 2 years)

4. Pursue a graduate certificate or diploma in Marine Sciences, then a master‚Äôs. (Duration of 2.5-3 years)

And then after each of those options I would pursue a Doctoral degree in Marine Sciences. 

The shortest paths would take around 5-6 years, and I would be 30-31 by the end of it. 

The longest would probably take around 8-9 years, and I would be 33-34 by the end of it. 

I‚Äôm not sure which path to take. 

Ideally I would prefer to work in a more hands on way, so occasionally doing field work. Due to that, I kinda think another bachelor would be more ideal, since I would have all the foundation that employers, particularly in the research field, may value. 

I worry that with a master in marine environmental sciences or bioinformatics, but without a bachelor in the field, PhD programs wouldn‚Äôt take me, and if they do, I wouldn‚Äôt get a research position after. 

I would really appreciate a more insightful view of my situation. 

Thank you.

1elymhp,I was drugged on a work trip and acted out. Now being investigated by HR.,"Had drinks with a local friend of my coworker and he suggested a second venue. We walked over and he let me hit his vape. I thought it was normal weed but later he mentioned spice ‚Äî which I avoid like the plague. I should mention we flew in from the UK to a legal state. I‚Äôm still not sure if it was the vape or something else in the club.

But I was fine after drinks (had about 4 beers) buzzed but in control. I was fine enough to get carded and given a wristband at the door. And I was fine for ten or so minutes after that. I only had a water at the club and didn‚Äôt leave my coworkers‚Äô sight who I should mention are all 30 or approaching it (I‚Äôm 25). I‚Äôm the most junior of the bunch. 

It was catastrophic. I made a fool of myself on the dance floor, shoved some people and then literally died. Got narcaned and lifted out by the police where I suppose the adrenaline was enough that I was lucid and convinced them I was fine. But someone had just told my coworker that the narcan would be short lived and that the effects of whatever was in my system would return. And they did.

I was a complete mess. Screaming and punched a dudes car window. Hurt my fist and elbow pretty bad and fell backwards on my head. I don‚Äôt recall any of this. I was sitting in the back of the cruiser cuffed when apparently the cops just decided to send me to the hospital.

Met later with my coworkers and apologized. They were obviously shook up but we laughed it off and implicitly agreed to leave the shitshow behind us. We were good. Sadly, I had a work related disagreement with one of them. And now HR had been made aware. The story is I was negligent of my duties. God knows what they told them about the incident but I‚Äôm to plead my case soon. Have to work from home but I just took unpaid leave because I just can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ 

While I was apologizing it did seem they were planting seeds for their potential extrication. They asked me if I ‚Äútook‚Äù anything. That was pretty offensive but I shrugged it off. I didn‚Äôt. They all hit the vape. But only I had my reaction. Then they started saying that while I was freaking out I grabbed one of their wrists pretty hard and left a bruise but they said that I was panicking and they bruise very easily so they said it was fine. The other (who‚Äôs a friend of the first coworker). Said I smacked his chest in the club but I remember that and I was fooling around with a sticker I found on the table tried to put it on his chest. Annoying and stupid but I was not fucked at this point and was probably fooling around from the alcohol. I apologized and we laughed it off. 

The event was pretty traumatizing. Hospital staff didn‚Äôt really tell me what happened. Just diagnosed with me with altered mental status. I‚Äôm on ssris so maybe there was an interaction there but I just don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just so alone and confused. Feel like they‚Äôre using the event to start a witch hunt because of the work related disagreement. I understand that they are probably quite shocked too but what happened was not me. I was not in control but from the tone of my manager, it seems they gave the impression that I had intention.

I‚Äôm probably done for but how can I make them see that this wasn‚Äôt my fault? I‚Äôm apologetic but I‚Äôve never take something that made me behave this way. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

1elyg0m,Stay or leave?,"Hi guys,

I need help making a decision, I've been working at the same place for a couple of years and since I joined the company there was a girl who started at the same job from the beginning, we weren't friends but we've worked together and we haven't had any problems until now.

A few months ago our manager (Male) was moved to another team, and they put a new manager in his place (Female) and we found out that this happened because the director (Female) is a friend of my new manager, so the director decided that her friend was going to be our manager.

After changing managers my colleague and I were basically promoted to the same position, the main problem is that I've seen my colleague doing things just to benefit herself without considering the needs of the team and she doesn't even care about them.

Recently she even started stealing some of my ideas and implemented them when I was on PTO, I noticed that she started stealing my ideas when the directors and other managers recognized my initiatives as they have had a huge positive impact on the team, obviously the last one she stole hasn't worked or helped the team at all because she only stole the idea but not how I was going to implement it.

She also started giving bad advice to our new boss and gained her trust to the point of making her believe that she is her friend, but only to get what she wants, based on that bad advice, the rest of our colleagues started questioning her decisions and didn't agree with most of our boss's decisions, thanks to that most of my colleagues started getting more work and even some of them are exhausted and very stressed, I have tried to point out to them how to help the team and the problems that could arise in the long run due to these decisions but they just don't care and don't want to do anything.

Another thing is that my boss makes us do her job and basically make the decision that she should make, and since in our job most of my coworkers are men, both of them have this toxic idea that if you are not on her side you are against women and you can't do anything.

This month we both will get a raise for our good performance (basically thanks to me), but to be honest I'm not sure if I should stay in the same job with all these problems, with my coworker trying to steal everything from me, my manager not caring about anything, the director being friends with her and also ignoring the problems and making the team more stressed and having bad results.

I have applied for other positions in the same company but I haven't had any luck, do you think I should keep trying and change to another position?

1elweim, Feeling Uncertain About Law School - Need Career Advice,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently a senior majoring in political science and was all set to apply to law school before I graduate this upcoming fall/winter. I've been interning at a law firm under a business lawyer for a while now, and it's making me question if law is the right path for me. I've started to feel like I might actually hate the work or at least not be happy doing it long-term.

  
I've always said I wanted to be a lawyer, and my parents are willing to help me pay for law school, which makes things feel even more complicated. I feel guilty about having doubts now that everything seems lined up for me to pursue this path. I don't want to waste their support, and it's tough to shake the feeling that I might be letting them down. This makes the decision even more overwhelming, especially since I've been committed to this plan for so long.

During work, I often find myself browsing jobs where people seem happy or careers that offer a good work-life balance. I'm starting to wonder if I'm just not cut out for this type of work. I'm scared of being inside and at a desk for so long, as well as merely working on monotonous cases with disgruntled people.  

One big reason I'm reconsidering law school is my girlfriend. She‚Äôs really passionate about the film industry and wants to move from Seattle to LA to pursue her career there. I've been dating her for 3 years and would really like to pursue a life with her. My original plan was to get a law degree and eventually join her in LA, but the thought of staying up here for another three years just feels dreadful.

I'm open to the idea of grad school, but law is starting to sound less appealing. Part of me just wants to graduate, take my chances, and move to LA with my girlfriend to job search, but I‚Äôm worried about making such a big/silly decision. I would have no support system. 

I should mention that this internship is my first major full-time job. Last summer, I worked about 32 hours a week as a barista/shift supervisor. While I didn't always love it, I didn't hate it either. At first, I thought maybe I just don't like working in general, but I know I want to work hard and enjoy what I do.

Am I in over my head, or is this just a typical career crisis moment? I‚Äôd love to hear any advice or experiences you might have.

1elw16q,Masters or return for Bachelors after an art degree?,"Hi everyone. I (22m) graduated from art school a year ago and started my own creative company. I‚Äôve been living (not thriving) off of it full time a year now but am considering a career change into finance. This post would be too long to explain why. 

My undergrad seems useless. BFA in Film Production. Ideally a masters is shorter and apparently cheaper especially returning to my school (decent ms program). Is this even possible with my undergrad? And if so, does switching to a masters even give me career options with no undergrad or previous financial  work experience?

1elw166,Should you follow your passion or logical reasoning when it comes to picking a career?,"Hi! I have been reading many Reddit posts on career advice but might as well make my own post and see if anyone would be willing to share their input!

I just graduated this spring 2024 with a bachelors in Interdisciplinary Health Sciences. I am now trying to figure out my next steps as a 22f. A little background, I was a transfer student and initially wanted to go in to major in Nutrition/Dietetics. However, when I told my advisor this, he told me that I‚Äôll hate my life taking all those chemistry classes and advised me to stay in health sciences so I did! Now, two years later, I‚Äôm struggling to find a job, I don‚Äôt think I want to do nursing (my mom works as a nurse and growing up she always told me NOT to do that) but she told me to look into sonography bc many job opportunities and salary is good! But I am still stuck on the idea of nutrition and am thinking of going to get my masters in nutrition but I know that dietitians don‚Äôt make a lot of money and I‚Äôm scared that I will spend a lot of time in school/unpaid internship just to make MAYBE 50-60k (I live in Illinois). 

I had read somewhere that following your passion is the way to go. However, just because you have an interest in something doesn‚Äôt mean you have to make it into a career. I was interested in nutrition initially for myself but it got to a point where I focused a lot on what I was eating and honestly had to go see a dietitian myself so a part of me is thinking me wanting to continue pursuing nutrition might be because it all feels familiar. I think what scares me going into this field is the pay and minimal job opportunities especially with the amount of school and time it takes to become one. If anyone would like to share their input that would be great and I very much welcome you to do that!! I am open to anything.

1elvw1z,Should I clarify interview question in follow up email?,"This is for a peer interview. One of the peers asked me if I've ever had conflict with coworkers and how I would handle it. I said that so far I haven't had any conflict but that I've thoroughly enjoyed working with the team. After the interview, I felt really stressed and didn't feel good. I panicked after interview. I sent the thank you email.

Now it's been about a week and they haven't  answered so I still have time for a follow up email, just to check on them. I thought that I would include in the follow up email that although I haven't had any conflict so far, if I were in a situation like it I would ensure that the conflict doesn't delay or interfere with the progress of completing the project we're working together on then after one of our sessions, I would talk to them privately about the conflict, admit my faults, focus on the actions/events rather than behavior, and work to do better.

 Since this question is pretty important when evaluating if I'd be a good fit for the team and in a team setting, should I clarify my answer via follow up email?

1elvtrs,How to Explain a Long Gap of Time Since Graduating to an Employer,"I graduated from college in December 2023 with a degree in Engineering. I had already researched jobs prior to graduating and applied to some jobs at the end of my time in college and increased my job search starting in January 2024. As of this writing, I have not yet received a job offer.

Despite not yet finding a job, the experience has been good for me and I have learned a lot and feel I am improving. While I am disappointed in not finding a job yet and not sure how much longer this will take, I am most nervous about the passing of time since I graduated without finding a job and how this gap will look to employers.

Those who interviewed me one month after I graduated saw that it had been one month since I graduated, and now, all employers see that it has been seven months. If I still don't have a job by December, employers will see that it has been a year since I graduated and so on. How can I communicate to employers that I have not spent the last 7 months goofing off and that I have instead been applying for jobs? 

I have been putting in an effort to pursue my career and I don't want to be perceived as someone who doesn't care. I believe that my resume and relevant internship experience will improve my chances, but regardless, an employer may perceive the gap of time since I graduated to be unproductive and be less inclined to give me an interview and potentially hire me.

I understand that not finding a job within 7 months of graduating is not ideal, but what I am curious about is what employers think of this and whether or not I should either say nothing about the gap, explain to them my situation (that I have been searching for jobs for 7 months), or something else. I want my hard work and dedication during college to be overlooked and with every passing day, I fear that this will come a reality the longer it takes me to find a job.

Thank you and any advice would be appreciated.",Visible_Price_2835,1,1.0,0,1722984818,2024-08-06 22:53:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1elvtrs/how_to_explain_a_long_gap_of_time_since/,8,2024

1elvnh2,How do I tell my boss I am no longer interested in a transfer that I asked?,"I work at a department store in Northern California. My location was announced for closure with a timeline of 1-3 years.

I begin searching for internal transfers after learning the news and found a perfect role at a location I previously worked at in Southern California. I interviewed for the position and got an verbal offer from the store director. Few days later the HR team contacted me and said due to a change in budget, the open position has been frozen, but they did commit to me if anything opens up in the future I would be contacted. I then told my current store director what had happened and asked him if he has more knowledge on the closing timeline and if he would help me look for other internal opportunities. He told me the current store would stay open for at least until the end of 2025 so I have plenty of time and he would look out for other opportunities for me in the meantime. This gave me a lot of peace of mind as I knew there would be a high probability for the SoCal position to reopen before my current store closes.

Last week, my director told me about an open position at another store nearby and asked if I was interested. I was hesitant because I wanted to wait for the SoCal position because it was better suited for my skillset but I did ask him to help me look for other opportunities and I felt bad if I said no, so I told him I would love to interview. Since my boss had already put in a good word for me, the interview was more of a formality, and they are ready to move forward with a job offer. I now regret not tell him earlier that I wished to wait for the SoCal position. How do I salvage this situation without burning bridge with my boss?

1elv9n5,"Job way below your skill level when unemployed and desperate - How to answer the ""why are you interested in here?""? How to not have them think you're likely to immediately quit? (When in all honesty I probably will)","Senior software engineer, laid off in June. Been launching a CV at absolutely everything remote-OK with a skill match, and one of those jobs emailed me back, but went with the usual ""what makes you interested in working here?""

I really don't know what to say. The money is less than half what I used to make. The skillset requirement is all stuff I do well, and am familiar with, and find easy, which is perfect for a job I can use to pay the rent while looking for something better, but I don't think it's somewhere I'm going to learn anything much new. Genuinely, I don't particularly want to work there - I have a couple of interviews with better companies coming up, and this is basically a safe fallback so I don't need to resort to begging for help from my family in case those fall through, because the response rate recently has been so much worse than even as a new grad with 0 experience (and the money isn't far off, when adjusted for inflation...).

Somehow, I think ""The money is better than nothing and the work looks easy enough that I can keep jobhunting every day"" isn't going to impress them, and I'm also wondering how the interview is going to be, because anyone with half a brain can see I'm overqualified and I'm not sure if they're expecting me to not be there long or not. By all means, if I do work there, then I'll absolutely put the work in, fix as much of their stuff as I can between interviews, but I don't see myself staying for more than a month or two in the worst case, and knowing my luck I'll probably be giving notice a week in if I do take it.",Financial-Milk-1,7,1.0,7,1722983375,2024-08-06 22:29:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1elv9n5/job_way_below_your_skill_level_when_unemployed/,8,2024

1els2qt,"Left My First Job Early‚ÄîHow Do I Explain This in Future Interviews?

","Hey everyone, thanks for reading this, and please do reply with some suggestions because I‚Äôm really confused with this.

I'm Ayush Sagar, and I recently completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science (2019-2022). After graduation, I planned to pursue an MCA at a top college like an NIT, but I decided to gain some work experience first. I joined a pay-after-placement course where I learned DSA, Front-end, Backend, and prepared for placements. Fortunately, I landed a job as a Junior Software Engineer with a 4.03 LPA salary, starting in March 2023.

However, my time at the company was challenging. I joined a project that the team had been working on for months, and because I was new, I found it hard to connect with them. They often went on breaks together and kept each other updated, but I felt isolated and left out.

Before joining, I had informed HR and my supervisor that I needed 15 days of leave in April to visit my hometown, but they only approved 7 days, with no option to work from home. After returning, I was assigned backend tasks like creating APIs, but I received little guidance. I was confused about the project‚Äôs architecture, and when I asked my manager for help, I was directed to other engineers who often gave negative feedback about my performance.

Eventually, I was left without tasks and spent days watching courses. On May 9th, I was informed that my performance wasn‚Äôt meeting the company‚Äôs expectations, and since they needed someone who could work faster, they let me go. I was given the option to take a full-time experience letter or a 6-month internship letter, and I chose the internship letter. However, HR couldn‚Äôt adjust the dates, so I ended up with just 2 months and 9 days of experience.

Now, I‚Äôm facing a tough situation. In every interview, I‚Äôm asked why I left my previous company so early, and I struggle to answer. I‚Äôm worried that this short stint might hurt my chances of landing a new job, and I‚Äôm unsure whether I should show this experience or leave it out, which would create a gap on my resume.

Currently, I‚Äôm pursuing my MCA from VIT Bhopal (2024-26), but I‚Äôm still unsure how to handle this situation. Has anyone been in a similar spot, or does anyone have tips on how to address this in interviews? I‚Äôd really appreciate any guidance or suggestions.

My long-term plan is to move to the US, either as a doctor or a healthcare administrator. Given my Year of Graduation (YOG), I have limited time to take the USMLE exams while also considering a job offer as a Project Manager at a reputable international hospital in my country.

I face two main paths:

1. Pursue a Career as a Physician in the US: This would involve dedicating myself to preparing for the USMLE and applying for the 2025 match. It's a very challenging route but feasible.


2. Accept the Project Manager Role: Gaining experience in this role could eventually lead to a well-paying job(?) in the Middle East or possibly the US. 
(Ps. I've a very limited knowledge of financial stability in this pathway so any heads up would be nice).

At 29, I feel reluctant to make a drastic career change, such as switching to astrophysics, despite any latent passion for it. This decision makes my situation more complex and exacerbates my Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).

I started at my current company making 40k, which felt very low and I tried negotiating but ultimately accepted because of my goals. We are supposed to have annual reviews, and I have only received one, which was 1.5 years into the job. I received a 9k raise. This past May I received a 1k raise putting me at 50k. Without getting into too many details about my job, I have taken over many roles and have gotten various certifications, as well as created a new source of revenue for the company. It is extremely stressful and I feel overwhelmed everyday. I have already felt I deserved a raise, and then I found out two of my coworkers, who do less than I do and just started last year right out of college, had starting salaries of 54k and 56k. They both just received 2k raises as well. To make things worse, another coworker recently changed positions to do somewhat similar work as I do, and he went from hourly to salary of 65k. He‚Äôs only been here two months longer than I have. I feel extremely embarrassed and disheartened. I have no motivation anymore. 

I was told I should wait until my start date anniversary and ask to have an annual review, but I don‚Äôt know if I can hold it in. Do I wait? Should I bring up the pay differentials?

A couple years ago, I was asked if I wanted to fill in as a scrum master at my place of work to make up for a scrum master that had moved into the role of project manager. I said yes because it sounded like an awesome growth opportunity. The caveat was that I‚Äôd be scrum master part time and filling my same job that I‚Äôd had for a few years at that point. 

It started out busy, which I expected, but I‚Äôm still performing my old role at full-time capacity. I am completing more work than some coworkers in the same position without the scrum master role. I told my boss in 2023 that I think I had done an amazing job and deserved a promotion because my salary is only based off my previous title‚Ä¶which does not make as much money as a scrum master. And two years in a row now, my raise has been the same or less than my male colleague that only has to do his singular role. He also started this job two year after me and our salaries are quite similar. 

On top of that, I am compensating for other male colleagues. We work in tech and my boss hired a person he seems to really identify with. Only this person is so bad at their job. I tried telling my boss this and he wouldn‚Äôt hear it and got mad at me. I am taking on some of this person‚Äôs job responsibilities because they can‚Äôt fulfill their work duties and my boss is aware. He is aware our customers have complained about this individual and have refused to work with him, so I have to work with his customers as well as my own. 

Promotions were announced this month and I did not receive one. People that I know take it pretty dang easy at their job received promotions and I did not. I am still being paid my base salary with no significant increase in salary.

My boss and I were speaking on a call last week and I told him I was committed to the job and I loved the company and wanted to stay with the company. I told him I wouldn‚Äôt mind working here for 10 more years. 

However, I actually broke down and cried when I saw the list of promotions within the company. I have received STELLAR reviews the past couple of years but people that others complain about frequently have received promotions over me. People even are like ‚ÄúOmg how long has it been since you‚Äôve received a promotion?‚Äù

I prepped my resume as soon as I saw the list of promotions and I just saw a job I wanted to apply to.

My worry is that I just told my boss one thing and now I‚Äôve done a full 180. I feel like they don‚Äôt think I matter and ‚Äúadvocating for myself‚Äù didn‚Äôt seem to work. 

Would it look bad to anyone but my manager if I jumped ship? Having told him one thing and now changing my mind?",wildly_domestic,737,0.9599999785423279,326,1722973226,2024-08-06 19:40:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1elr2ul/i_told_my_boss_that_i_was_in_this_job_for_the/,8,2024
1elqpv5,Need to move back to IL but recruiters only reach out to me for local (contract) jobs on the East Coast - help!,"Hi, first time posting in this subreddit. As the title states, I‚Äôve been looking to move back to IL for work. For context:

Last year I moved to NJ for my current full-time job (senior-level IT admin and support lead), as I‚Äôm required to reside in this state for said job. It‚Äôs a decent 6-figure salary, helps me pay the bills and all regardless of how expensive groceries and rent can be.

But over the past few months now, I‚Äôve been applying for hybrid/remote jobs that would allow me to move back to IL, so that I can be with my family. The thing is, my family hasn‚Äôt been the same since 1) we lost our Pomeranian to a tragic car accident, and 2) one of my siblings is dealing with a domestic abuse-sort of situation themselves. So, I‚Äôve been wanting to go back home to be there for everyone, and for that I need a full-time job that will allow me the flexibility to balance work and home stuff.

However, I keep getting rejected every time I apply for IL jobs from out-of-state, and recruiters keep reaching out to me for contract-only opportunities that are based in NJ, PA, Washington DC, etc.

I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end here. I don‚Äôt know what to do that would help‚Ä¶ if anyone has any sound advice for me on this, please let me know. I‚Äôm open to any options I may have at this point.

1elqihr,I feel stuck in advertising sales in my mid-30s and don't know what to do for a career change. I feel overwhelmed and paralyzed.,"I went to college initially to study journalism and get into film criticism, as cinema was one of my passions and I loved writing about film. I saw the writing on the wall with newspapers shuttering and firing staff writers, so I decided to switch majors to Telecom my senior year and thought I might get into media production.

Unfortunately, after school I had zero luck finding a relevant job, and worked a retail supervisory position for about a year. Then, I worked at a bank and tried to get into their management trainee program with the hopes of joining their marketing department, as I thought marketing might be an interesting path. Unfortunately, that didn't pan out, and then I took a job in advertising sales which was listed as a marketing role, but my first day on the job they sat me at a desk with a phone and told me to start making cold calls. That was how I fell into sales.

I love the client relationship building aspect of sales and have always excelled at account management, but I don't really like the cold calling. I ended up taking a job in cable advertising sales and have worked there now for 7 years, but it's a tough sell in 2024 and I'm burnt out. It's become all about new business and the account management side of things has fallen off. I'm having my first bad year and just got assigned to a new manager and am worried that I'll be put on a performance plan / fired by year's end if things don't turn around.

Unfortunately, I just don't know where to go from here. I don't really want to stay in sales unless it's something I'm passionate about. I am really into health and nutrition, wellness, film, music... I just can't don't know what that might look like for sales. I could never be a telemarketer or someone who just dials the phone all day, but if I'm selling something I believe in and am passionate about, I could see myself at least being happy or feeling somewhat fulfilled.

But then part of me thinks I should just get out of sales altogether, but I feel very little sense of decisiveness about what else I'd want to do. I just feel kind of lost and aimless. And then when I try to narrow down what I'd like to do, because I don't have any real sense of what it might look like, I tend to get frozen in place.

I've thought about trying to get into marketing, but at the end of the day I just don't really feel like I have much purpose in life right now and I'm very unhappy at my current job, and it's making things tough. I have started to fall into some self-destructive patterns like drinking too much on weekends and looking for escape because ultimately I don't think I'm happy and I feel a lot of anxiety surrounding my professional life and I don't want to suddenly be 40 and stuck in a job that I resent, and with too much experience in sales to pivot to anything else.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what industries or roles I could translate my skills to? I'm great with the account management side of sales, but I don't think I can keep doing what I'm doing right now much longer.",PeterLoew88,1,1.0,0,1722971846,2024-08-06 19:17:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1elqihr/i_feel_stuck_in_advertising_sales_in_my_mid30s/,8,2024

1elpwxc,I‚Äôve got a career problem that‚Äôs concerning me. ,"To give some background leading up to this:

- I went to university non-traditionally. Took me ten years but I graduated in 2017. I went to class part time and enjoyed sharply discounted tuition by working for the same university in their IT dept. It was a great setup and I‚Äôm thankful because it means graduating without any student loan debt. It also meant ten years of learning a lot in the IT world. 

- I moved on to work for a major healthcare corporation as my first post-graduate job and I loved it. Got stuff done, tickets closed, got to be part of project work, and change requests, and enjoyed the casual corporate culture. It was amazing. 

- then came the hiring boom of 2021. Several of our knowledgeable engineers left the company for other roles that paid better. Great for them, not great for me and those who stayed to see where things would go with the company. A private equity firm bought out a controlling stake in the company and began slashing everything in sight to position it for a major buyout. My team went from 40 down to 10.

- I was then approached by our director to consider a management role within the company for our team of ten. Thinking I had finally made it big, I accepted. It came with a big pay raise so I was excited. My first six figure job!! But‚Ä¶‚Ä¶this is where the problem started. 

- almost a couple weeks in I noticed I was starting to lose sleep. I wanted everyone on my team happy. So I did everything I could within servant leadership style to get what they needed. But then HR and folks in finance started the ‚Äúbell curve‚Äù ratings system meaning I deliberately had to lie about my team‚Äôs performance on reviews so that only one or two got the top ratings and the rest got ‚Äúmeh‚Äù ratings. It was disgusting to me and I felt dirty. 

- fast forward another two years‚Ä¶.and I‚Äôm overwhelmed. Our company is bought out by a larger corp, my awesome director has been transferred away from us, while big corp sends in a new director who has no clue what he‚Äôs doing and is standoffish from all of us. My team looks entirely to me for answers on their jobs, where things are going, and I‚Äôm asking our new director‚Ä¶‚Ä¶no one will tell me anything. I ask our VP, and she won‚Äôt even tell me, she has no clue either. So I have no answers for the team and feel worthless as a boss. 

- it was at this point I was beginning to enter what I think might‚Äôve been depression, and a low point in my career where I just wanted out any way I could. I just wanted to quit. 

- I talked to a former colleague who put in a referral for me at their workplace. A management job but it paid WAY better and came with some nice perks and would get me out of this other job. Out of desperation, I went for it, interviewed, and got the job. All remotely. 

- Four months into this new job, I had definitely been a fool. I was in over my head, overwhelmed, sobbing every night after work, stressed, and barely sleeping. My health was going downhill, and I was gaining weight from stress eating. Eventually, a family member started showing concern and I also learned of a situation in the family I had to help deal with at the same time I was going through this. At this point, I made the difficult decision to resign from that job and take two weeks off to deal with this issue and focus on trying to gain my health and sanity back. 

- two weeks later, I‚Äôve interviewed and stated a job at an MSP. Things start off well and fine. I‚Äôm just a level 3 support engineer here. No people management required in this job. However, where things started off great, now the company has begun to clamp down hard on cost cutting measures, corporate initiatives, and making micromanagement moves that‚Äôs starting to stress out and unnerve a lot of folks on my team. I‚Äôm seeing the same patterns unfold as I did when my previous company from two jobs ago got positioned for buyout. 

So with all of that background above, here is where I am today. Tired all the time, stressed out every day, health going downhill again, ready once again to jump ship after 8 months here. 

From a career standpoint I was full of optimism and hope for the future when I graduated university. That‚Äôs all but gone now. I don‚Äôt know what to do or where to go from here. I‚Äôve been from IT help desk all the way to management and back. All I‚Äôve ever actually wanted to do was project and implementation work especially if travel is involved. But I‚Äôve never been given that chance. 

I don‚Äôt want to job hop too much since that looks bad on the resume, but what else do I do? Not sure if I‚Äôm burned out, in a bad spot mentally, or what, but it‚Äôs scaring me and I‚Äôm not sure where I need to take my career right now. I‚Äôm just tired of being tired, stressed, and overweight in IT jobs that don‚Äôt bring any enjoyment or fulfillment anymore.

1eloja1,Feeling discouraged at work.,"I recently started a new job in the corporate world, and I'm finding it challenging to adjust. The environment feels a bit like high school with a lot of gossip and cliques. Even though I'm usually very confident and resilient, this situation is starting to get to me.

As a new hire, I'm expected to figure things out on my own without much guidance from VPs and Directors, who aren‚Äôt the most helpful. I was hired alongside others, and it seems like the same VPs and Directors are more willing to help them, but not me. I feel like I'm left to make mistakes in order to learn, which is quite disheartening. I also have the sense that my colleagues don't particularly like me. While being liked isn't the most important thing, it does play a role in getting promoted and being involved in key projects.

Lately, I've noticed I'm being slowly pushed off deals compared to other analysts. This makes me feel even more isolated and unsure about my future at the company.

I have a mentor who works at a competitor, and their advice is to learn everything I can for the next 2-3 years and then consider leaving for a better opportunity. While this seems like a sensible plan, I'm struggling with the day-to-day reality of my current situation.

1elndh6,Started new job one month ago and requested to have 4 days off around Christmas and was rejected (with no comments or discussion). How do I approach this? ,"
So, I completely understand that my vacation request was likely denied because they are desirable days off that other staff may have requested. I also understand that I am a new employee. However, I can‚Äôt deny that I was completely gutted to see that my request was rejected with no explanation (we enter our requests online and the manager approves/denies). My family lives in another city, my partner is in an intensive school program with no days off and I am also a master‚Äôs student with limited time off. I am fully aware that these are personal circumstances and my employer does not HAVE to approve my requests, but I didn‚Äôt expect this because they seemed so ‚Äúchill‚Äù/reasonable when I accepted the job. 

Basically, I want to know if there is a way to approach this situation without coming across as entitled. I had a full time permanent job before this, with full 3 weeks vacation and great benefits. I left because I was not happy and was able to negotiate for this new position and specifically discussed vacation before accepting the job, but not specifically in December because my bf‚Äôs schedule was not out yet. I purchased 10 days vacation and this was my first time entering a vacation request. After it was rejected, I kind of expected an email explaining why, bur maybe my expectations are unreasonable. I‚Äôve never been rejected vacation without an explanation, so I would like to reach out via email. I‚Äôm very upset about this and was trying not to cry at my desk when I saw it. I worry that I made a mistake accepting this position or that I have done something wrong already.

1eln9yb,Quitting my job is going to be a disaster. What should I do?,"Hey everyone, new here and honestly looking for some advice! 

Some context:
Graduated college last year w/ a degree in computer science / system engineering. 
Got a job working with data, or so I thought. 
Working for a small company with like 3 people  for just over a year and a half. I hate it. Hated it ever since about 6 months in. I got hired to do job office work, but I always find myself doing manual labor here which is the actual product side of the business. Regardless, I hate it, and I have decided I‚Äôm quitting with or without a line up of a new job. 

Some more context: 
I have my final interview today for a new job, a really good job with actual beniifits and an actual employee base rather then 3 people. It‚Äôs good and it‚Äôs something I really think will be fulfilling in my young adult life. Position is totally a different direction too which I‚Äôm excited about. Of course I‚Äôm not sure how this final interview will go but wish me luck haha. Hopefully looking to just transition to new place long as I get it in 2 weeks time. Or continue search more full time in 2 weeks

The problem:
Well yep, there‚Äôs your context. I‚Äôm 100% leaving my current job with or without a line up but it‚Äôs at this point for my mental. The plan is to get this new job, search for one, or just start something of my own. But, if I have to give in my two weeks I really do believe my boss is going to flip shit, or bitch like a kid. (He is a shitty boss at times). I dont want to burn this bridge as regardless of the work I did, for the most part my position has and will continue to help my future career. 

I definitely want to give 2 weeks, but how should I do it? What should I say. Should I go the typical letter of resignation route and explanation oe just text it in. I want to pretty much get out of here with as little collateral damage as possible. Remember, there is 5 people total at this place including owner and manager, so losing me will hurt them and I just don‚Äôt want to leave here without the ability to really use them on my resume.

- My boss will 100% be mad. Not a doubt in my mind. Want to minimize this. 
- Yes I know, definitely most toxic work environment I‚Äôve been in, and I‚Äôve had some shitty jobs but I just want to do my best - for myself only - to preserve a good relationship. 
- No, I would never stay.

1elmlop,Career advice for a 19 year old,"Hey everyone,

Thought I‚Äôd just come on to ask something which has been non stop on my mind for around 5 months now.

I started a gas engineering apprenticeship when I was 16. I am now qualified, however have another year before I go on the rate of my colleagues (¬£40-50k per year).

For the first few years this was a good job, I enjoyed it and everything was so new and I was constantly learning etc. Fast forward to the last few months and it‚Äôs been pretty boring. I literally do the exact same thing every single day and it can be so boring. 

I always look at other routes I could take whilst using my experience - construction management  side of things has always interested me. 

I don‚Äôt have amazing qualifications but I do have the basics which could see me go some places. 

Basically looking for guidance:

Option #1 - just stick with it and hope it‚Äôs a phase and I will enjoy work again soon. I suppose a 40-50k salary at 20 wouldn‚Äôt be the worst.

Option #2 - apply for a part time college course (evenings) in a field and have the income whilst also learning a new industry 

Option #3  - I don‚Äôt even know. This would just be to leave my job and go all out on finding something else lol.

Anything appreciated. Even any industries that I could go into with my skills/experience!",Electrical_Taro4792,1,1.0,0,1722962547,2024-08-06 16:42:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1elmlop/career_advice_for_a_19_year_old/,8,2024
1elmg3h,Do recruiters filter out resumes without degrees for swe positions?,"Is filtering applicants without the diploma actually the case in today's market or do people overexxagerate it?
 
For context: I am 20 years old, currently focusing on web development, particularly Back-End. It's been around 6-7 months since I started studying at home. I have no obligations and unlimited amount of time, which gives me freedome to study 6 or 8 hours per day. Pursuing a degree would mean subtracting substantial amount of that time, to study some unrelated subjects along with some related subjects, taught by lecturers, who are mostly not that great. The universities, that are generally better, cost significantly more and I don't want to make my family pay that much. My point is that, in theory I can try pursuing a degree in a relatively cheap university, although I can find better and more comprehensive resources online, so I have no reason to go there unless there is an absolute necessity to have a degree to compete at entry level positions.

Note: I know I have to make some impressive projects to stand out, I'm interested wether or not it's realistic to compete without a degree, even with decent skills and resume.
 I'm not hoping to get an an universal truth in any way, Just an advice would be appreciated.

1elm2u5,Is it worth jeopardizing my current role to apply for another job in the same company?,"
I just wanted some outside perspective on whether I should show interest in a new role within my company.

Background:

I'm currently in management for a midsize construction company with multiple divisions, and I have become the second in command of my division within the past year. I'm comfortable at this level for the short term, but this leaves me stuck in advancing, as my manager is young and not going anywhere. 

The company as a whole has made very clear they want to keep me for a larger management role, but despite this, my manager has made clear that I won't see any significant raises in my current division due to its small size. 

She's said if it's a deal breaker for me, the company would rather me go to another division than leave for another company entirely, but me leaving our division would cripple us. We're very small, and do very niche work. My leaving the position will make my current manager's life hell.

Situation:

The company is now recruiting for a bigger role in another division that I would generally apply for, but there are hundreds of applicants already, likely including internal applicants. Many of these applicants would likely be a better fit than me, plus they wouldn't need to temporarily cripple another one of their divisions to hire them like they would with me.

Is it worth rocking the boat and telling my manager I'm interested in moving if I likely wouldn't be in their top 5 candidates anyways? It would make things awkward and difficult day to day, all just to basically say ""keep me in mind"" for the future.",FuckTkachuk,3,1.0,1,1722961294,2024-08-06 16:21:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1elm2u5/is_it_worth_jeopardizing_my_current_role_to_apply/,8,2024

1eljzzb,Should I quit my job?,"So basically Ive been working as gate agent for the last 2 years. My salary it‚Äôs slightly above minimum wage and I feel like there is no progression in my career, in fact I‚Äôm actually taking an almost 10% salary payout from this month and beyond. For the last two days I‚Äôve been working on the 4am shifts ( it‚Äôs like a week every 4/6 weeks) and god damn it feels like I‚Äôll never get used to this. I‚Äôve slept an total of 5hours in the last 48hours and I know this must have some impact on my health. And I‚Äôm not even talking about dealing with angry and misbehaved passengers almost every single day‚Ä¶
Currently and for the last 4 months I have a business with my father (tobacco/convenience shop) and I know that could support me financially for a while. And although I have some fun running this business I don‚Äôt want to be working on a convenience shop selling vapes and lottery tickets all my life too. I feel like I could do something more challenging. I‚Äôm thinking about going back to college someday.

Up to this point it seems easy to tell me I should just quit my gate agent job and stick with my business for a while but im going to share what‚Äôs been holding me back:

First of all, I don‚Äôt hate my job, I hate the conditions of it.. I‚Äôve had way worst jobs in the past tbh. 
I enjoy being around with my colleagues after all, there are really nice people in that job.
I enjoy working at a fast pace environment, and under pressure like the airport.
If I just stay running my own business my only colleague will be my father, which don‚Äôt get me wrong, and I love him but that would have it‚Äôs impacts on my social life.

What should I do? I feel like I should move on and quit but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll have to find another thing eventually and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to find something better.

Thank you all.",checaralho,5,0.8600000143051147,9,1722956387,2024-08-06 14:59:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eljzzb/should_i_quit_my_job/,8,2024
1eljt8u,22F in corporate looking to get out,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm a 22F and feeling a bit lost in my current position. Here‚Äôs some background:

- I graduated college in 2023 (a year earlier than I was supposed to) with a 3.4GPA and a degree in Marketing Analytics. 

- I got a job almost immediately out of college in an industry that I‚Äôm not super passionate about, but is still interesting for my field of work. The job is great. It has amazing benefits, good pay, and is family owned which has its perks. I‚Äôve been at my current job for a little more than a year and haven‚Äôt had the best experiences so far.

Since the beginning of this year I‚Äôve been feeling indifferent towards my current job. More recently, I‚Äôve found myself dreading going into the office/work in general. Not everyday is a bad day where I currently work, but I definitely have more bad days than good days. I often find myself without tasks due to poor management in the upper levels and I sit in the office most days making myself look busy. In college, I worked in busy restaurants so I always had something to do, so coming into the quiet office life was a bit of a change for me. It was fine at first but now I really find myself no longer enjoying the same aspects of my job that I did a year ago. I also don‚Äôt feel like the typical Monday through Friday 9-5 fits the lifestyle I want and I feel like because of that schedule I oftentimes am not able to focus on the things I enjoy (working out, gardening, etc.)

Let me say this: I love what I do. Market Research is a passion of mine and I really enjoy learning about the consumer and their habits. However, since I‚Äôve been feeling stuck in my current position, I have looked at other jobs to apply for. My issue with this is that I‚Äôm not technically ‚ÄúEntry-Level‚Äù anymore with my experience but I‚Äôm also not ‚ÄúMid-Level‚Äù either. This has made the job search harder for me because entry level jobs pay nowhere near what I am currently making but mid-level positions don‚Äôt even give me a chance due to lack of experience. I should also mention that I am currently engaged and getting married in November. Because of that, I‚Äôve decided to stay with my current company until the end of the year. My fianc√© is in Law Enforcement with a 7-day working, 7-day off schedule. His schedule is something that really appeals to me because I see him being able to pursue his passions outside of his job on the days off he has and I can see how happy his schedule makes him.

The past few months, I‚Äôve been volunteering as a firefighter in my community. I really enjoy the work that I do for my community through that outlet and have looked in to pursuing firefighting full-time. The schedule would be 1-day working, 3-days off and then 2-days working, 3-days off. That sort of schedule definitely sounds like something that I could enjoy. Firefighting is also relatively fast-paced and every shift is different, so I doubt I would get bored with the mundane aspects like I do in my current position. I would also be getting better benefits and retirement, but the pay would be lower than I currently make, especially starting out. The money isn‚Äôt much of an issue for me since my fianc√© makes enough to supplement the income we would be losing if I leave my current position.

All of this to say: I don‚Äôt know what to do. I love the field I work in and want to continue my career and education in marketing analytics, but the stereotypical corporate world is not something that appeals to me. My biggest issue with firefighting is that I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll get into it and then in a few years hate it and want out. I don‚Äôt know if I should try to find another job within my field (maybe even remote to give me some more freedom in my day) since the management at my current company is terrible, or if I should completely get out of the corporate world and pursue something completely different in every aspect.

I am young and have time to figure things out, but thinking of changing careers completely scares me. It‚Äôs not like I would be going from Marketing to Finance and still be in the business world. I would be getting out of the corporate world completely and starting something totally different that what I currently do.

1eljh3a,Conflict in mind- should I take this opportunity?,"I am currently interning as an internal auditor at company A this summer and was given the opportunity to extend my internship. The reason why I got the extension was because I raised the question to ask for an opportunity, and they agreed to extend it until I graduate next year (when I obtained the masters program). However, I already have a full-time offer from a different company (company B -more prestigious) whom I will start right after my graduation next Spring. Company A seems really like me and would expect me to re-apply and change the status to full-time after the end of this internship extension aka when I complete the master program. 

I am debating if I should accept this opportunity with company A since I am settled to start my career at Company B. The reason I want to work with company A was because I need to accumulate years of experience for certifications (CPA, CISSP, etc), and company B allows me to intern before I join the firm.

My plan is that I will continue interning with company A for next 2-3 months and will find an excuse to leave before the end of the term. Will company A have the right to keep me, and if I decide to leave, will the put me in black list? Any insight will greatly be appreciated.

1eliqrq,Client expectations do not align with my company. How can I navigate this mess?,"I made a previous post how my company basically misled me to hire me and I‚Äôm kind of stuck until I find a new job. Long story short, the expectation was a remote job assisting a client and assisting my company when needed. Reality is the client sees me as a contractor that is dedicating 100% of my time to them on a hybrid schedule. The whole thing is a shit show and I‚Äôd quit if I could have another job lined up. With the job market as it is, the only thing I can do is keep applying and tread water.

Other than having to commute 90 minutes 3 days a week, the biggest issue right now is my clients expectations and my companies. My company has been hammering me with deliverables and meetings that you would expect from a consultant. However, my client is very unhappy that I‚Äôm dedicating working hours to the consulting company. They see me as a contractor and that is how the contract between my company and them was set up. My paperwork even calls me a contractor, states the hybrid schedule, and says I need to dedicate 40 hours a week to them. I did not have access to this paperwork until I started with the client.

I‚Äôve talked to both sides and both don‚Äôt want to budge. The client is pissed that I have other responsibilities outside of them and that was not what was sold to them. My company is pissed I am having trouble meeting deliverables. For example, at 1pm last week I got an email saying they needed a PowerPoint completed by end of day (5pm). The client is giving me daily responsibility that takes me a full work day to complete and also needs to be done by 5pm. I prioritize the client, then get scolded for not meeting deadline for the PowerPoint. 

I fucking hate this job and want to quit so bad. Clearly the client and my company do not have the same vision for me and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Do I go to the clients management and explain the situation? Do I go to my companies HR and grill them for the awful management of my employment?

1eliazt,Need Career Advice: Doctors Without Borders or Sales Team Lead Promotion?,"So I‚Äôm currently at a crossroads in my career and could really use some advice. I‚Äôm 29 years old and have to choose between two vastly different career paths: working as a Public Communication Officer for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) or taking a promotion to become a Team Lead for a Sales Department.

On one hand, I‚Äôve been a long-time donor to Doctors Without Borders, and working for them has always been a dream of mine since I was a kid. The role seems a lot more chill with benefits like 30 days of holidays and 3 days working from home, compared to 25 days of holidays and 1 day of working from home. However, it comes with less pay and possibly fewer growth opportunities.

On the other hand, becoming a Team Lead in the Sales Department looks great on my resume and offers a gross salary increase/difference of 1k, which is significant here in the EU. It also promises a lot of valuable experience, though right now as an inside account manager I work overtime, for up to 5-10 hours a week which I will most likely continue. Plus, I‚Äôve found being in sales to be quite stressful sometimes.

I figure I could use this experience to move to a better-paying position in another company within 1-2 years. I‚Äôve been asking around, but opinions are pretty divided.

1elgqqw,Job A or Job B - can‚Äôt decide ,"Hello everyone, I am a fellow engineer with about 3 years of experience in Business development / technical sales.

I have been working with a local supplier for the last 2 years now and it has been great with the working environment and i really enjoyed the work but my learning has been stagnating. 

Job A

I got a couple of offers from other competitors but i denied them until last month; I received an offer as BD rep at a big contractor in my country with many subsidiaries regionally so I decided to take the offer to try something different with new market exposure  (the pay increase wasn‚Äôt that big).

It‚Äôs been a month now and I regret my decision: the work environment is less engaging, I didn‚Äôt get any proper training and the commute is longer, however there is some opportunity for growth but it will take some serious hard work and self dependence.

Job B

After just starting, I received another offer from another supplier as Sales with better benefits and 30% higher pay. Knowing that this company is still starting up in my country (with other global presence).

Should i take the offer and leave after only 1 month getting blacklisted probably or stay and keep my head down.

I feel a bit lost ngl

1elgob2,I hate my job of 10 years,"I have been at my job for 10 years now.   I've been in several roles,  but I'm just done.  My job is an office setting contract-based, so,  every few years I end up with a new employer even though the job is basically the same.  Problem is, everytime this happens,  our seniority is reset so I'm basically a new employee even though I'm not. 

I'm consistently one of the most depended upon employees, I'm in good standing with management and have always received great reviews.  I just can't take it anymore.   I used to love my job, but with my current employer, I hate every moment I'm there.   My anxiety is through the roof,  I wake up and immediately feel sick just thinking about going in.   The only advancement opportunities now are not worth the stress the comes with it.  I've talked to management and it goes as expected. 

Every single day I think about just quitting and being done with it,  but I know that is the absolute last resort.  I have savings, so if it did happen I'll be fine for several months.   I don't know what to do anymore.   I've been at my job so long I've just let it control me.  Any advice?

1elfi7s,"Aspiring to Start an NGO Focused on Education, Women, and Elderly Care ‚Äì Seeking Advice and Support!","






Hello everyone,
I am 21F 

I'm currently a UPSC aspirant and working in a proptech company. Over the years, I've developed a strong passion for social work through my experiences volunteering with Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a traffic rules drive, and an NGO called Hariawal Punjab.

Inspired by these experiences, I aim to start my own NGO focusing on three critical areas: education, women empowerment, and support for the elderly. However, I have no financial backing at the moment.

I would love to hear from those who have walked this path or have insights to share. Specifically, I am seeking advice on:

Funding: What are some effective ways to secure funding without an initial financial base?
Starting Up: What are the first steps I should take to establish this NGO legally and operationally?
Sustainability: How can I ensure the long-term sustainability of the NGO?
Resources and Networking: Any recommendations for resources or networks that could be helpful?
Your guidance, experiences, and any potential collaborations or partnerships would be immensely valuable to me.

1elf0jw,"Similar financial offers, different settings","I'm a physical therapist. I was put in a unique situation. I was looking for a new job and a skilled nursing facility offered me a large pay jump to join them from my outpatient job. I don't really enjoy SNF very much, but the work is easy and the company is fairly lax and it's nicer than majority of SNF's I've seen. 

I had all but signed the offer when my clinic told me the director was stepping down and the clinic was closing down. They wanted to know what I would like to do. I told them the offer I was given and my company said they would match it if I worked multi-site in a small area near where I live.

Now the SNF seems to have better ethics than my company. My company is only matching because of the situation and because my boss that's leaving heavily emphasized my value to the company. He problem is, I do enjoy outpatient work more. I do want to keep building my skills in outpatient because I plan to open my own side business and I don't feel like I'll be developing skills at the SNF. 

The flipside is the SNF has a better work life balance. I can come in almost whenever I want as long as I see my patients and finish within a certain time and it's easy to call out if I can't make it in that day. Outpatient the days are very fast paced, you need to be there at set times, you can't leave until the end of the day. However the outpatient I could work 4 10 hour days vs 5 8 hour days at the SNF

 I guess I am trying to decide if I should stick outpatient and keep honing my skills or take it easy for a bit but risk becoming complacent at the SNF. I also feel guilty backing out from the SNF since we had finally settled on an offer and again I have the contract but haven't signed yet.

1elexza,Need help deciding between two paths to take,"**TLDR at the bottom**



I currently have a CS degree and I'm in my early thirties. The CS degree is from WGU. I got it earlier this year and it hasn't paid off so far. While I don't want to give up, the fact that layoffs seem to be bathing the white collar world in blood, make me less hopeful that I'll end up with a job in tech. While I'd love to have that SWE salary and WFH life, I'm trying to be realistic. I'm not fully giving up but I'm weighing my options.

It may be narrow viewed but I really only see two paths for myself going forward. Whether I get there in a straight line or not is debatable but I have two end goals. I'm deciding whether to be go for an accounting degree and a CPA, or go to nursing school and work towards becoming a CRNA. I'm in my early thirties. 

The CRNA path seems more interesting to me in general. I like science, I like exercise and sports and all that, the human body is interesting, etc. From reading about nursing in the their sub, I know how much it can suck.

For accounting, it seems like a way less hectic environment to start out in, and you still make decent money, but it is quite dry of material. I'm not great at excel at all but I'm sure I could learn. Anyone can learn.

The accounting path would likely be faster as I'd get my degree from WGU again, and work towards my CPA right after, and ideally have an internship. Nursing would take longer as I'd still need to become an RN and then work in ICU for 1-2 years and then CRNA school.

My goal is WLB and money, and maybe retiring early? I'm not sure about that yet. But I enjoy rock climbing a lot and I don't want my life to be all about work where I have to sacrifice my health and physical fitness for money. I mean I get there have to be sacrifices but you get what I'm saying.

Anyone have any advice on the subject from someone who is either a CPA for a while or a CRNA for a while? What do you like about your job? What do you dislike? How was the path to get to where you are now? What is your job search like? Do you feel financially stable and like you have job security?

  
**TLDR: Want WLB and Money. Job Security and Stability. Accounting to CPA or RN to CRNA.** 

**CPA = Certified Public Accountant** 

**RN = Registered Nurse**

**CRNA = Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist**",RandomStuffGo123,2,1.0,0,1722942502,2024-08-06 11:08:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1elexza/need_help_deciding_between_two_paths_to_take/,8,2024
1elerwv,How do I bullshit my way into a job I am intentionally not 'qualified' for?,"I have never understood the way the corporate world operates. The usual requirements that 'qualify' you to get the job, are a piece of paper (degree) and an arbitrary amount of experience.

The thing you have to know about me though, is that I am a voracious learner and i thrive on novelty. If I were to walk the academic halls for 4 years, if I developed all the necessary skills, knowledge and experience, to finally get the job, I would blow my brains out after the first day on the job, purely out of boredom.

The only reason I like the whole concept of 'jobs' and 'working' in the first place, is because I see them as potentials for learning NEW things. Take that away from me and there is nothing appealing about having a job, not even the money necessary to survive on this big blue planet we call 'Earth'.

Which leads me to the question in the subject line.

"" How can I get a job that I am intentionally not 'qualified' for just so I can immerse myself in new knowledge, activities, people and environment and ABSORB all the exquisite novelty with delight? "".

I appreciate any and all advice and book recommendations.

1eldw8l,"I'm going mad over a hiring process, please help","Hi everyone,

This is the first time I am writing here. I did an interview in May for a position in Europe. I think the interview went flawlessly, and afterward, the hiring manager told me that no positions were open at the moment but that I would be contacted if something opened up. I wrote a ""thank you"" email two weeks later and got no response. I sent another email a month after the interview, again with no response. The last email was sent about a week ago when the same vacancy reopened, expressing my interest, and still, I got no response.

What is very strange to me is that the interview went very well. There were no technical questions, but it still involved an hour of ""tell me about yourself,"" which I think I handled very well. Also, the hiring manager insisted on the interview, so I don't know what is going on. I also emailed another person from that office a week ago and still received no response.

I don't mind being rejected; what kills me is the uncertainty and opacity of it. What should I do?",marisketo,4,0.8299999833106995,14,1722938671,2024-08-06 10:04:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eldw8l/im_going_mad_over_a_hiring_process_please_help/,8,2024
1eldn4c,Feedback not matching experiences at work. Am I insane?,"Hi everyone,
I guess I‚Äôm just looking for outside perspective on this situation. 

I started my job a few years ago. I seemed to get along well with my manager. People seemed friendly enough but didn‚Äôt really engage much with me even though I do feel like I put in the effort. I wrote it off as people not wanting to be too personal at work. Not a huge deal. 
It was a very small company and as I spent more time in the office (we‚Äôre all hybrid working), and as the company grew it became very obvious that it wasn‚Äôt a case of people not wanting to be personal and chatty at work because they would be this way with each other but it seemed like they were just leaving me out. 
When I am in the office, almost no one speaks to me despite me making effort. For instance, I will say good morning to people as I come in and no one will acknowledge me. 
There have been many times on a Friday where every single person sat around me has been personally invited to drinks after work but I have not been asked. 
I feel like I could go on and on because everyday there seems to be very small things that signal that I am not worth acknowledging. The way people that I sit in meetings with and produce work for will walk by me without even making eye contact etc. 
the manager I thought I got along quite well with in the beginning seems to have pushed me away. For instance, we went to see the same band play (different dates). I found this out from a colleague because he didn‚Äôt tell me. When I asked him how the show was he changed the subject abruptly. We actually have a fair bit in common (similar age) but he seems to do his best to not engage with me (but will with other team members). 

And to be clear, I am not looking to be best friends with these people. I am just looking for human treatment. I feel like I‚Äôm being outright rejected every day but I have no idea why and I do feel like it actively hurts my prospects in the company. 

As more people have joined my team my work was slowly taken off of me and replaced with what I would call ‚Äòbusy tasks‚Äô - solely in charge of updating a clunky spreadsheet and then reporting on it, doing data entry- things that are very far from what I was hired to do. I brought this up with my manager countless times and he has said that my work is fine, I‚Äôm not being given these tasks it‚Äôs just the way it happens to have happened. 
It got to the point where I needed to sit down with him and provide him with two years worth of evidence to show him that he was indeed assigning only me these tasks while giving the other guys in my role the ‚Äòactual‚Äô work. 

Although I have never raised the issue of feeling like people don‚Äôt like me I have been quite direct with my manager about the quality of my work which he says is fine. 
The feedback that I get is that my work is very good and I am quick when I do it. I have gotten a few constructive points which I have aimed to address in the few instances where I have been given the actual relevant work but this goes un acknowledged unless I bring it up. 
I am always told how friendly and funny I am. I‚Äôm approachable and helpful. I‚Äôm really well liked. 

The feedback I get is so misaligned to my experiences that I feel like I am going crazy. 

I honestly can‚Äôt work out why they haven‚Äôt fired me (they are pretty ruthless in their firing so I have no doubt that if they didn‚Äôt want me there I wouldn‚Äôt be there). 
They are paying me a reasonable salary to basically do a data entry role (something that would be far cheaper to hire someone younger with no experience) and they don‚Äôt seem to like me personally (the company is actually very social). 

Fwiw I am actively looking for a new job elsewhere but I am honestly feeling like I‚Äôm crazy. This has never happened in other companies I‚Äôve worked for but it seems like such an odd situation that I can‚Äôt work out if it is just me or not. 

Thanks for reading sorry for the length. 

tldr: sad times for me because people seem to reject me socially at work and also I‚Äôve been given entry level tasks instead of the job I‚Äôm paid to do. Feedback is almost glowing and doesn‚Äôt represent my experiences leaving me feeling like a crazy person.

1elb749,"Limited time position termination, alcohol involved but not sole reason?","Sibling was terminated from their Limited-Time position, meaning they basically were on forever probation. They were warned multiple times for their alcohol use, never directly stated but were told they smelled an aroma from them (once again, never mentioned alcohol directly).  Did mention slurred speech, and falling asleep at their desk. Of course my sibling is in the wrong, and has been dealing with alcoholism for a long time now. I hope this is a wake up call for them, and they have tried to quit multiple times, but they have been dealing with mental illness for awhile now, have been 5150d in the past, and always resort back to same habits. I warned them that his place of employment wouldn't tolerate this behavior, and this would happen, and it did.

On the letter for being let go of their position, they were told that their prior place of employment was the cause for the termination, because they couldn't verify that they actually worked there, and their contract to continue to let them work would now cease.

Would it be better off to not challenge the termination by providing proof of prior employment? Would they be able to apply to new positions in different departments, or would the alcohol warnings come up if being listed as a reference of employment?

1el917g,"Burnt out, checked out ","I am a 33f, and I've worked in mental health and community services for 8 years, My jobs have included things like mental health support programs, Corrections programs, Student Wellbeing/Counselling, etc. But I am so tired of this sort of work and dread each day of it.   
  
I went into this line of work as I am a sensitive person and wanted to help people.  However, after spending a number of years doing these roles,  I do not believe our socio-economic and cultural circumstances are conducive of anyone's wellbeing. Many people work so hard just to make ends meet. Many are isolated, many have family issues, many do not have positive communities or meaningful pass times. Our economy does not provide many with the time and energy to prioritise their wellbeing. Our culture is focussed on promoting ourselves and not looking after or being good to each other. Mental illness and distress should not be as widespread as it is. 

Since I've worked in education (Student Wellbeing) I've noticed that so many people have children when they can not or do not prioritise giving their children a good life. Many families engage in services to gain access to funding and do not (or perhaps can not) change the circumstances that are resulting in their children's lack of wellbeing/welfare. 

I'm really over it all. I just want out. I do some self-employed work, however, I'm not sure this will be enough for me to live off. I don't know what other work to pursue.

I enjoy it, but the major is small in my university, and I‚Äôve found it to be worryingly easy so far. I see all my friends with different majors learning things and stressing over assignments, while I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve learned much at all. This worries me, especially since UX/UI (my chosen concentration) seems to be pretty portfolio-based. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôll reach the end of college SOL without a job lined up. If I‚Äôm on the wrong track for my career, I want to know so I can course correct ASAP before it‚Äôs too late.

My options:

1. Work on my career/portfolio outside of classes. I took an introductory web design class abroad last semester and really enjoyed it, so I‚Äôm thinking of independently studying HTML/CSS/Javascript.
2. Minor in something. I started to minor in CS, but I found it boring & frustrating. When I tried my hand at data science, I felt the same way. I think backend technology frustrates me because it feels too abstract due to the lack of visual feedback. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs not for me or if I‚Äôm just lazy and need to push through it.
3. Switch my major/start a double major ASAP. I enjoy art and psychology, but as my main concern here is job security, I don‚Äôt think those are good options. If I were to choose this route, I‚Äôd probably go for accounting, as both of my parents are accountants. I‚Äôm also fairly charismatic, so I could try insurance or sales.

1el71wr,I may be fired in January,"Hello everyone, 

I am currently working as a state auditor (auditing other state agencies). I have been at this job for a little over a year. I worked as a tax auditor for five and a half years before that. 

I have come to realize that tax compliance is my passion, and while I don‚Äôt want to pivot back to my old job, I do want to pursue that career going forward. So, in the long term, I am feeling good. 

But in the short term, I am feeling miserable. I am underperforming at my current job, because I am a very rules-driven person, and there is a lot of ‚Äúprofessional judgement‚Äù that one has to apply at my current job. My yearly evaluation did not go well, and my probation got extended, with a warning that my performance would be reviewed again in six months (January). 

Normally, I would be applying for other jobs right now. But the problem is, I was planning to leave my state next June anyway. I don‚Äôt want to take a job, knowing that I would almost certainly leave in less than a year anyway. Frankly, I would like to move somewhere I am closer to family, where the job opportunities are better, and where my wife can pursue a higher education at better schools. 

I am not sure if I can turn my performance around in time, as they want me to learn how to perform an audit efficiently with minimal revisions. I don‚Äôt think I will be there in five months. 

To be clear: I don‚Äôt KNOW that they will fire me. It just seems likely.

1el716k,First sales job: Should I stick with it?,"Hey guys, I am 20 years old and just got my first sales job. I really want to build a career in sales but I am unsure if I should stick with my current job or try something else. 

The job that I have consists of only cold calling. I am expected to make around 200 cold calls a day. The base pay is $14 an hour and I also get 5 dollars for each appointment that I book. I typically lead my team with around 15-20 appointments booked a day. 

My main issue with this job is that I am starting to get a little burned out after about 7 months of doing it. The leads that I am provided with are ice cold and the appointments that I am trying to book really aren't all that relevant to the people that I am calling. I don't really believe the service that I am trying to sell, hence the job is beginning to get a little hard for me. 

In these 7 months, I feel like I have already gotten a lot better at cold calling and my communication skills have drastically gotten better. I also noticed a huge improvement in my mental toughness and work ethic after straight cold calling people all day long, every single day. 

I know for a fact that I want to stay in sales, at least for the next 10-15 years and I am looking for any recommendations that you guys might have for me. My current company doesn't really have any advancement opportunities and I don't want to stay at this job for much longer.

1el6rai,Clueless with the direction my career should go in!,"Hello everyone,

I'm a 25 year old who recently did her master's in computer science. I graduated from undergrad with an electronics degree, but wanted to make the switch into machine learning, so decided to make the jump to computer science. I landed a job after my masters as a software engineer in a cybersecurity firm. I occasionally get to dabble with some data science, but that's it. 

Though my interests are in the data science domain, I am not sure if I am good enough for it. Also, I feel just having a background in machine learning may not be enough, but rather I need to focus on more hard core domains like systems or cybersecurity that may use applications of machine learning. 

Somedays I just start to feel like I am not good at anything and I don't know anything and there is so much to learn. I want to learn, but there is just so much out there and I spend so much time not able to focus on a domain. 

This is my first job and it's been a couple of months since I started. Any advice would be really helpful.

1el527g,Should I start college this fall or continue to work?,"Hey all,

I hope you are all doing well.

I am looking for some advice. I am currently 19 years old, I will be 20 this December, and I‚Äôm debating if I should work another year or start college. 

I graduated in 2022, but I early graded so I didn‚Äôt go to school the second semester (not really due to my own choice, I had to move to a different city due to family issues and I decided to just early grad as I had enough credits). 

Since graduating, I have been working full time. I work as an administrative assistant and the place I work is quite good. My colleagues are all very great people and we occasionally hangout out of the office. I make decent money ($26/hr (CAD)) and live with my grandma. I have started to travel as I decided I should do something of significance (if you want to call it that) with the free time I have. Since then I‚Äôve been to Japan, Mexico, Italy, and Scotland. All for about 3 to 4 weeks besides Mexico. 

I‚Äôm pretty certain I do want to start college just to get the ball rolling (hurry up and get my degree and get into my career making (hopefully) decent money). But, I‚Äôm still not 100% sure what I want to do. I think I want to study political science and become a policy analyst (hopefully landing a gov. job), but I‚Äôm not really sure if that‚Äôs what I want to do. I think it is though. 

I‚Äôve currently been working on losing weight as I‚Äôve been very obese most my life and I‚Äôm currently 60lbs down. My grandma who I live with is huge into education and academia but she recently suggested maybe I wait another year so I can focus on losing weight as it might be tricky while in college. 

I‚Äôm a bit unsure now with this. On one hand, I do want to start college just to get it started (not having to wait another year. If I start now it‚Äôs a year less I need to wait to get into my career and start actually making okay money) and I have been talking about it for awhile, but I also would love to take another year off to be able to travel more and just have expendable money. I however don‚Äôt really want to stay as an administrative assistant for another year.

What do y‚Äôall think? What do yall suggest? I‚Äôd love to hear what your thoughts are.

Notes: I thought I would add some extra details that might help. My grandma will be paying for my post secondary and I will be living with her for the first year until I transfer to my local university. All expenses will be covered besides gas in my car and food. The commute to the college from my house is about 10 minutes, and I have a new reliable car so that isn‚Äôt a concern (2021 Mazda3)(it has extended warranty as well). The car is also paid off. I plan to have about $14k (CAD) saved prior to starting school and I plan to not really work my first year or maybe after the first semester depending on how things go.

1el4un7,"How to deal with difficult, time sucking manager?","I‚Äôm writing in regards to my wife‚Äôs work situation, so that I might offer her some form of advice, but I don‚Äôt know what the correct course of action is. She‚Äôs been incredibly stressed out with her superior. I want to help her but I don‚Äôt want to do that typical man thing of telling her what I think she needs to do. I‚Äôve made the mistake in the past of offering advice, instead of just listening to her concerns and complaints. I don‚Äôt necessarily want to fix her situation, I really want to understand what others would do in her situation so I might offer words of advice and support.

She works for a small design firm. Husband and wife owners have hired my wife (senior level, three years in), and another guy (principal level) to mostly run the operations of the business, with three lower level support staff. Owners are involved but it‚Äôs obvious they want to let off the gas and enjoy life a little while my wife and this guy take care of business.

My wife is the only senior project manager (and only project manager for that matter). Meaning she does all the heavy lifting to ensure a project runs smoothly. That means communication with clients and sub contractors, overseeing design drawings, delegating work to support staff, redlining drawings for support staff. But she‚Äôs also tasked with actually doing the work of support staff because either there isn‚Äôt enough people power, or they‚Äôre not proficient enough. So that‚Äôs a big job on its own and she‚Äôs stretched thin. 

Now this guy at the principal level. Workaholic type, but stereotypical upper management type that produces nothing and fills his days with unnecessary meetings. The problem is that his meetings are with my wife. He‚Äôs not efficient. He bloviates and turns what could be a concise 20 minute meeting into two hour lectures and deep dives into the minutia of unimportant details. He schedules her back to back and doesn‚Äôt leave her time for lunch, let alone doing all the actual work I described above. As a fucked up aside, he stocked the office with a meal in a can product called Solent, so people can drink their lunch. 

She‚Äôs expressed her frustrations with the husband/wife owners and they agree and understand. They‚Äôve talked with him about it and he‚Äôs completely oblivious to the issues but with zero course correction. But this is the rub - he brings in the work through his connections so he‚Äôs more ‚Äúvaluable‚Äù than my wife, despite my wife actually making the firm run, and moving projects forward. Like if she left tomorrow they would flounder because all this guy can do is dictate. He can‚Äôt lead or manage.

She won‚Äôt provide an ultimatum without something lined up, which is smart. But there isn‚Äôt a whole lot out there right now for her to jump too. She‚Äôs told the owner she can‚Äôt work with this guy for the rest of her life so they understand her perspective. He‚Äôs already broken a lower level staff member.

How could she approach her situation in order to improve it? In case it wasn‚Äôt clear, they would choose him over her because of revenue if it ever came to that ultimatum. It seems like she just needs to deal with it if she chooses to continue working there, but how can she make her experience more bearable?

So I have a question that I feel needs to be addressed with tact that I lack experience with. I‚Äôve been working as a senior staff member for a small IT firm for a month. I was hired at $20 an hour with a promise of $25 an hour after a 60 day probationary period. The old place I worked for paid me $22 an hour, but I took advice I heard here and told my interviewer (who owns the company) an inflated rate of $25 an hour was my previous income. 

He told me the maximum wage for the position I interviewed for (which was part time help desk) was $20, and that‚Äôs all he could approve on my hire date. The next day though he called me and offered me the senior IT help desk management position for full time. He said it‚Äôd be a 2-3 month probationary period for $20 an hour then they‚Äôd bump me up to $25-$28 an hour after. This was all verbally said, with nothing in writing besides my offer letter stating a pay rate of $20/hr.

I‚Äôve been here for a month and I‚Äôve completely revolutionized the company. I‚Äôve streamlined workflow, fixed the infrastructure for our biggest clients, and reduced new ticket volume  to the point where we went from constantly putting out fires to having significant downtime and only about 3-4 tickets a day. I also helped lay off two employees that were nothing but deadweight and nuisances. Given we have over 50 clients, I think this is a massive improvement in efficiency in such a short period that I should be asking for even more pay sooner than agreed upon.

Is this reasonable? We‚Äôre a small MSP of 8 employees, and after I was hired most employees don‚Äôt have anything to do for most of the day. I want to mention to my boss/owner of the company that we could further reduce staff, but I also think that if I‚Äôm not offered more pay that‚Äôd be a stupid suggestion. I handle most tickets because I know I can do it quickly and properly, and only need my coworkers when something can‚Äôt be done remotely and needs to be addressed on-site (my license is suspended so I can‚Äôt drive or I‚Äôd be able to take on all that work load as well). Part of me feels like I should just go ahead and start my own MSP to be honest lol.

To make a long story short I don‚Äôt have the best home life or much to look forward to back home. My job in Spain says I should I come to Madrid with a savings of 3,500 but they are also saying If I budget well I can make it off 3,100. I‚Äôd be moving sept 2nd with 2,300 (but I‚Äôd spend some on hostels, transit, food and miscellaneous) all while apartment hunting. 

I‚Äôd be getting paid another 1,168 on September 13th which would have to hold me over until the first week of November. That‚Äôs when my job abroad gives me my first check. I don‚Äôt have the best home life but I don‚Äôt know if I should just suck it up and stay home find a 9-5 save up for a car and try to move out. I don‚Äôt know how long that would take since I do live in one of the most expensive states in the country. I want to live in a walkable city with third spaces. I‚Äôm extremely extroverted. Can someone let me know what they would do in my predicament or offer advice! I‚Äôd be discontent with a 9-5 living in the suburbs but my parents did say they‚Äôd help me find a therapist which is great! I‚Äôm at cross roads and need to make a decision quick any advice would help!",Worldtravler222,1,1.0,0,1722904307,2024-08-06 00:31:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1el3zpa/moving_abroad_for_work/,8,2024
1el3n0u,What do I do?,"I am 23 years old, I graduated in Dec of 2022 with my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Communications. I‚Äôm 1 short year away of getting my Graduate Degree in Professional Communications. Throughout all of this I‚Äôve only been able to snag sales jobs. I can‚Äôt get a public relations and or media like job to save myself. I can‚Äôt even get a simple customer service rep position making more than $16hr. 

I have 11 months as an management trainee Intern at Enterprise 

I have 1 year of tour guide experience with S.C Johnson 


I have 15months of Residential Project Manger( outside sales representative with more responsibilities) experience at a heating and cooling company.

I was a college track athlete and maintained a good gpa and worked part time jobs the throughout my entire time in college. 

I can‚Äôt get customer service jobs above $16hr 
I made it to the last round of a staffing recruiter position but the entire department is white females so I ended up losing that position to a white female. Then the same company offered me a financial advisor position I have to pay for which is $2k for training then 100% commission with me finding my own leads. Which I told this company 2 years ago when I graduated that I‚Äôm independent with a lot of bills and responsibilities and that position just won‚Äôt work. 

I‚Äôm now at a car dealership no one is training me the hours are shit and I have no product knowledge and or training on the systems used to work with customer as well as no sales experience with cars. They keep just saying to ‚Äúsell a car to this customer‚Äù. Been here a week and just now got a time clock. Still haven‚Äôt gotten my computer training on the vehicles I‚Äôm supposed to sell.

I‚Äôm in the process of trying to commission as an officer in the army/marines. Only problem is they need specific scores on the ASVAB test. I haven‚Äôt taken algebra since 10th grade and I‚Äôve always been slower learner when it comes to math. The quicker option is just enlisting and getting a solidified job. Cons are taking very much lower pay and throwing my 6years of school and hard work down the drain. 

Pros are: my significant other and I can get housing with benefits that the military offers. As well as having a solidified position that would provide experience that maybe in 4 years could actually help me get taken serious. 


Sorry this is a long rant. I feel so stuck. It‚Äôs just that I feel like I did everything right and still lost. Every successful person I‚Äôve ever met just ‚Äúknew someone‚Äù and got connected. Even doing outside sales I met people making 150+ doing very easy jobs but the question is how did they get the job??

I‚Äôm a people person so sales comes natural. Doesn‚Äôt change the fact I hate it. Hours are so terrible you are always on edge because you are earning commission and it‚Äôs always unsteady. I just want a secure job. Not looking to even looking to make an insane amount. Entry level 55-60k is acceptable for me.

1el37gg,Professional Business Qualifications or Full Degree?,"Hi, looking for some opinions and insight into what I should / can do:

I studied Biomedical Science at Uni and completed it but lost all love and interest for the field while doing so. I've recently developed an interest in the Business world and have started to wonder if I should do a Business degree at Uni to open up some more career options and widen my eyes to the field.

I'm not sure which aspect of Business appeals to me the most though - and I've read many posts stating that a lot of business degrees are ""useless"" or ""not valued"", and that the specific professional qualifications you can get are worth more to employers than any degree could be.

My question essentially is; is it better for me in my position to complete the online foundational level 3 professional qualifications in a range of things (CIPD, CIM, etc) to learn & add them to my resum√©, or is it better to do a full business degree and THEN do those qualifications anyway?

I'm aware the online professional qualifications cost money, but as I've already gone through Uni, I'm 90% sure I'd need to personally fund ~2+ years of a full degree regardless. (Also worth stating that if I do a full degree, It would be part time, which obviously takes longer AND will cost more).

Hoping to get some clarity on if these professional qualifications really are the gold standard and if anyone can start & complete them, even without a background in business. 

Does a CIPD Level 3 Foundation really give you the skills and qualify you to become an entry level HR assistant like the official body says it does? Does a Google Digital Marketing Certificate course open entry level options?

I fear my resum√© would be taken less seriously if it was decorated with these online course certificates and qualifications as opposed to if it said a full degree. 

Hope you can help, sorry for the waffle.

Cheers.",CaesarFPS1,1,1.0,0,1722902157,2024-08-05 23:55:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1el37gg/professional_business_qualifications_or_full/,8,2024

Reality hit, and I couldn't find a job for months.

I now work in a patient care facing role, and I don't hate it, but I don't love it. I have some joint pain and walking around all day can be tough sometimes. The alternative to the masters is finishing up the bachelor's in software development online from the community college I attended for the associate's degree. What do you all think?

I have some decision making issues so I don't know what's best. The bachelor's is from a community college, versus the master's from a reputable university in my state.

1el31wl,Seeking some ideas and guidance planning my next move - 27M making $18.50/h,"27M - My current job is sort of poor man's ""golden handcuffs"" situation (at least for me) -  I get decent benefits and excellent job security, and my job is absolutely crucial to the function of my retail store, but the skill and care it takes to do my job actually demands a much higher pay than they offer, so I can't imagine it would be easy to hire someone else (I build and install displays in a flooring and tile shop). I really like the job in general and I don't really have to play by anyone else's rules.



November will be my 1 year anniversary here, but I feel like I need to be seriously upskilling to move out of making $18.50/hr. I've toyed with several ideas, but I'm so indecisive that I haven't really settled on one, and honestly I'm afraid to put all my eggs in one basket (which is why I'm 27 making $18.50/hr)



Some of the options I've thought over:

- IT support ( I have half an A+ cert, been thinking about getting back to seriously pursuing the trifecta and just trying this path)

- Get an associates in robotics/mechatronics, something CAD-related, or business

- Try to build up my own handyman/woodworking business - just afraid I'll get stuck here HAVING to make money as a business owner with nothing to fall back on.



I'm not sure what to do. I think I'll semi-passively continue pursuing IT certs as I really love learning about cybersecurity, hardware specs and all that. But I'm also a creative person, and my current job role would make for an amazing career if there were some way to make an actual living doing it long-term.",nlightningm,1,1.0,0,1722901731,2024-08-05 23:48:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1el31wl/seeking_some_ideas_and_guidance_planning_my_next/,8,2024
1el2of3,Reverse recruitment success story,"
Hey guys,

A couple of months ago, someone posted here about their experience with a reverse recruitment/headhunter service and how it helped them land a job after being laid off. I wanted to share my own story as a follow-up because that post was impactful.

I was working as a robotics engineer at a company I wasn't really happy with. The work environment was toxic, and I felt stuck in a role that didn‚Äôt excite me and paid like crap.

After a few weeks of job hunting (while still employed) and feeling pretty lost, I remembered that post about the reverse recruitment service and reached out to the op.

I just signed an offer, im doing something completely different and couldn't be happier. I landed a job as an energy storage specialist at a smaller local company, and it's been an incredible fit. The work is challenging, the team is supportive, and I finally feel excited about my career again.

Baby on the way too so the timing has worked out perfectly. Wife can leave her current job now and just focus on her pregnancy.",Future-Revolution201,3,1.0,4,1722900733,2024-08-05 23:32:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1el2of3/reverse_recruitment_success_story/,8,2024

1el2ein,My job is trying not to pay me,"So I have been working at a pub as an Assistant General Manager for 9 months. When I was hired the idea was that I would get a raise from 37.000 to 40.000 and potentially become the GM of this pub after my probation (That would have been a massive underpayment so I stayed at AGM and didn't want all of the responsibility). The GM that worked before I joined got sacked so me and another AGM were running the pub. Up until January we didn't have any kind of support and I wasn't getting a lot of training to eventually become GM.

The Problem: I stupidly never really got any of this formally in writing (I know, absolute idiot) the only thing I have in writing so far is one sentence in a short meeting In February: """"boss"" to finalise pay increase (passed probation)."" I'm still trying to see if I can find any other paper trail of my pay increase.

I calculated how much money they owed me since Feb: ¬£1215 (which isn't a lot for this company as they have multiple pubs that are doing well) And I also know that the bar manager (my subordinate) that was hired to support me is earning the same as me and has half of the responsibilities that I have.

They initially told me that I had to improve certain areas to get the raise recently when I brought the conversation back up. I said that isn't true and sent them a screenshot of the meeting notes as mentioned before. In between all of this I have handed in my notice as I'm moving back home. HR got involved as well and they have now said that the raise was never fully confirmed so they can't pay me, they have however offered me a bonus of ¬£500 as a thanks for all my work (yuck). 

I would like to go to court as I feel like they have fucked me over royally as I would have left months ago had they said this before. Does anyone think I have a chance? 

I have been in good standing with everyone in the company and have done a lot for them. I feel this is such a kick in the face after all the grey hairs I have sprouted because of this job. I haven't always been perfect with timings and deadlines but this was also due to the fact that I was running the pub on my own for an extended period of time without being fully trained on everything. Multiple people (including some people that have told me I'm not getting the raise) have said that I was left alone without any support for too long.

I work as a senior office administrator, with my main responsibilities including auditing and organizing data from our EMR and fidelity software and then presenting that to the directors for it to be corrected/implemented into training. 

I got lucky getting this job, but I am incredibly bored. It is way too simple and after 4 months in it, I have tapped out all the learning opportunities anyone is willing to give me. With that said, I enjoy auditing, I enjoy Excel, and definitely love the level of attention to detail it requires. 

So onto my question, I have an undergrad double major of Business Administration and Psychology. Because I got sober in my last year of undergrad, my transcript prior to that is a wreck. Lots of fails, retakes, withdraws, etc. All my classes after I got sober were As, and I was miraculously able to finish with a 3.4 GPA. I finished this degree three years ago. 

I am wanting to pursue a MS in accounting, but because my Business Admin degree was not at all accounting focused, I am missing 4 prerequisites for the programs I have looked at.

1el08zm,Should we move our family across the country for a more lucrative job?,"We are currently in Wisconsin and have a 9 (4th grade) and 6 year old (1st grade).  We are both from WI, but have lived in other states over the years.  We lived out of state with our children for 2 years, but a job unexpectedly brought us back to WI.  We do like the community here and live in a good school district.  However, my husband does not think he has anywhere to go in his current company and has not found anything local that interests him with similar pay.  He is also concerned about his current job and the long term stability.

My husband is a born and raised Wisconsinite.  He has an attachment to the state of WI.  I moved to WI going into the 3rd grade, because we moved a little bit for my Dad's job.  I did not grow up around extended family.  I do not have an attachment to the state like my husband, and am open to other locations (particularly warm climates).  We were in a western warm climate state for 2 years with our children and loved it.  We were supposed to move to NC, but the housing market and overcrowded schools sent us back to WI (it was an option).  I was not ready to go back to WI, if ever.  

My husband has been presented a job opportunity in Idaho that he thinks he would really enjoy.  He currently makes about $190,000, this new job would be an extra $50,000-$90,000 (depending on bonus) after taxes, higher cost of insurance, etc. etc.

My husband's parents are currently 2 hours away from us now, as well as other extended family on his side.  My sister and her family are 30 minutes away.  We are not very close to our extended family, but do appreciate time with them.  We don't want to hurt our children in any way, whether through leaving family again, or changing schools again.  However, we don't necessarily want to pass up this opportunity.  Do we leave our current location and raise our family in ID?  Are the opportunity and pay increase worth it (savings for college, retirement)?  We realize nothing has to be forever, but we are looking at this as long term, as we wouldn't want to move our children again.  Are we clinging to familiarity?

Being the bread winner of my small family (dog, fiance) if I lose my job my fiance can't float us on her salary. Roles I could get here would pay 50%-75% less than what I'm getting paid now, which is unsustainable. I have a very significant emergency fund so I'm not concerned about being homeless, and we own a house. We've been considering selling and moving to something smaller and cheaper since it's just the three of us. I have considered switching careers but that isn't on the table because I would need to invest significant time and money (school, loss of income during that time, lower salaries even after switching) to have more opportunities here. I'm not super happy with my job, its soul-less, but it pays a lot and in a decade of consistent earning my fiance and I could FIRE. 

I've chatted with my fiance and she's open to relocating. She's a physical therapist and can get a job practically anywhere. We're considering cities like Atlanta, Charlotte, and Raleigh due to their proximity to my immediate family. We want to be within a 6 hour drive in case we need to come back for an emergency. 

**Costs:** In my preliminary research there are plenty of homes cheaper than what we have now within 30 minutes of the city centers of each city in consideration. We didn't get in on the ground floor of super low mortgage rates, so when rates drop later this year they'll be pretty close to our current rate. Also considered state income tax and it would have an influence, but not as much as taking a huge pay cut to stay where we currently are. 

**TL;DR -** I'm thinking about relocating to a larger city to have access to more jobs. I'm the bread winner and concerned about losing my job, 6 month job search has yielded nothing for remote roles. Looking to get thoughts on this and if anyone has done something similar, would love to hear your story.

1ekzlpg,What carrer should I chose?,"This is a rambling train of thought from a teenager:

I want riches but I know business or law will make me miserable. I like bio and chem but I want a good work-life balance and being a doctor requires constant study. I like writing and that's my best subject but I write my best by absorbing the works of others and warping it to fit into my essays and stories; I have writer's block and I don't know if I can write without plagiarizing. I like computing sometimes and I am passably good at it, but the field is going to be oversaturated and I don't know if I will flourish there. I like maths but I get bored easily and I'm good at it but not great. I can write really well but can't speak as eloquently.

I like almost all of my subjects and love to learn, but I'm not passionate about a specific thing. I'm very picky too. I also have financial need to go to uni.

1ekz80j,Can you help me?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm a 21-year-old man struggling to settle on a career choice. I‚Äôve tried college but am awful at academics. I completed 1 math and 1 English course BARELY, in the 4 years of attempting community college. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like I could complete a certificate program if I have my heart set on something.

The only things that interest me right now are:

	1.	Coming up with solutions to problems.
	2.	Creating and improving.
	3.	Investigation.
	4.	Strong interest in spirituality and the mind.

After stating my interests, I want to share that for some reason I have this big mentality of prioritizing my well-being. I fear I will work too much and not be able to enjoy my life. In my eyes, life isn‚Äôt worth living if it isn‚Äôt enjoyable. I have severe anxiety and OCD. My mental health is not the best right now, especially dealing with this tough situation. I‚Äôm not somebody who needs expensive things to be happy. I can be very happy making 70-80k a year. As I am very independent and don‚Äôt even have an interest in owning a big house with more than one floor. I am all for a simple lifestyle.

As for family wants, I don‚Äôt see myself having a family of my own. I am a homosexual and only see myself with a husband at the most (obviously a few dogs along the way, lol). Sorry, I really am rambling, but I want to put everything on the table to get the most accurate feedback.

It would greatly help me if anyone is willing to share their thoughts on this post. Or if you think similarly to me and could share some thoughts, I would really appreciate that!",Adept_Flow5086,2,1.0,0,1722892088,2024-08-05 21:08:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ekz80j/can_you_help_me/,8,2024

1ekym7x,Are my job responsibilities unrealistic??,"Im a full time content creator for a small family company. Im part of a two-person marketing team. Essentially its just me and my boss. Considering how laid back the owners of the company are and decent my pay is (which is barely enough to cover my monthly rent and groceries), I still think it's a pretty cool opportunity to be doing what I love to do. I went to film school so I'm very knowledgeable when it comes to filming, photography, editing, lighting and dabbling with visual effects. But over the past few years, as social media only seems to change faster every day and reaching outside my age range, I'm beginning to feel like I'm pretty underpaid for the amount of work I have to do and/or have been reeled into. It's already very taxing to manage equipment, video files, project files, and juggling the content output for all sorts of platforms while I'm simultaneously trying to create it. On top of all this, I'm beginning to feel the pressure from my superiors for me to manage social media; which includes over 3 channels to try and increase engagement each month and it looks like we'll be trying to expand into TikTok (ugh).

My question is this: is it realistic to be a full time content creator, editor, curator, AND social media manager (which essentially includes scheduling, copy writing, strategizing, publishing, and constant engagement of social media channels)? The company is very touchy about what is published most of the time because of hight-rate product turn around and claim sensitivities. So even if I'm ahead of the curve in my work, I'm bottle necked by the approval process of my marketing manager who puts on too much on their plate.

The marketing department is pretty fragmented because of this. And the work I'm doing today is normally something an agency or outside company would be hired to complete with a whole team. I also haven't mentioned that I'm in charge of many internal company-culture messaging because I'm bilingual and HR managers have come and gone over 3 times since I was hired. I've also asked for a raise and was almost fired. I don't have an official desk in my equipment-filled office I crammed a studio set up in and my tiny desk next to. For the first three years I used my own camera and lighting. I use my own phone for work and only work one day from home after I had to fight for it because I'm more productive in a comfortable environment.

I've thought about throwing in the towel and trying to do my own business but I'm deathly afraid of the law-involved paperwork, contracts, rates, and public-facing elements. All of this for hardly 60 a year.

Thanks for reading.  Part of this is a vent. The other part is to see if I'm just crazy, lazy, or have the right to feel burned out and pissed.

1ekw1z9,Strategies for moving to part-time/contract work,"I am 60 (F) and I have almost 40 years work experience. I am currently in a senior leadership position and I have a breadth of skills and experience in strategic leadership of large projects or initiatives. But not just the leadership parts: I can be very tactical too able to write job descriptions, develop project charters, write business cases, develop strategic roadmaps, form a budget, build a team structure etc etc. I've pretty much done it all. 

I currently work full time but my plan is to be able to semi-retire by age 62 or 63. I've even written that into my current project roadmap that has me out of the project by 2026. I have an excellent pension, savings etc and I am tired of the corporate grind. 

My goal is to be able to contract out for short term assignments so I can still bring in some additional earnings but on my own schedule and time. 

I'd like to hear from people who are self-employed in a similar ""gig"" capacity, how you do the following:

- Networking/getting the word out that this is something I am available to do: when should I start this? Should this be something I begin talking to people about before I plan to semi-retire? 

- Safeguarding my income: I've heard from contractors that there are often issues with getting paid. If you are an independent contractor, did you develop a standard work contract to ensure you are protected? 

- Advertising my work: are there platforms in Canada (I am Canadian) that one can join or subscribe to where people can find you to do these types of short term assignments?

1ekvw51,How would you define Coaching vs. Micromanaging?,"Was having a conversation with a coworker where were discussing our current bosses management style, which we both believe relies heavily on micromanagement. Trying to play devil's advocate I purported that they likely think they are coaching us, or giving valuable feedback, not realizing that it's actually micromanagement. 

It got me thinking that it's not always clear on the difference between the two, but I tried to think in terms of sports, and the analogy that came to me was a coach trying to help a player hit a curveball. 

Coaching in this scenario would be grabbing them after they've struck out, and telling them to watch the laces on the ball or being patient. 

Micromanagement would be telling them how to stand, how to grip the bat, etc, etc, every time they step up to the plate. 

Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that coaching is in the moment, valuable feedback given to someone to help them avoid making the same mistakes. Micromanagement is incessant guidance on how to handle simple tasks that have already been mastered. 

Anyone else have thoughts on this? ",Kac03032012,1,0.6700000166893005,6,1722884126,2024-08-05 18:55:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ekvw51/how_would_you_define_coaching_vs_micromanaging/,8,2024

1ekvmtl,How to cope with the fact I made a big mistake leaving my old job? ,"Hi everyone,
Thank you for reading this. Back in June I landed a job in the insurance industry. I absolutely LOVED my previous job. I worked on a very small customer care team for an extremely specialized product. The work was challenging but provided lots of down time and I worked remote 3 days a week. However, in the past year the company has gone down the toilet and there were several rounds of layoffs. Though I was never affected, I decided to look around. In addition to the lay offs, there was zero room for growth within the company and the annual merit increases were laughable. 

After about a month of searching, I got my current position and I feel as though my soul has been put in a box and sent to hell. The pay is better and there is significantly more growth opportunities, but the work itself is so unbelievably soul crushing and non-stop that I am at the point of tears at my desk some days. I have tried to tell myself that I'm just having a hard time adjusting to the contrast of working fully in office and having an enormous workload as opposed to my previous position. 

But the discomfort I am feeling is deeper than that. Being busy all day is not the problem. I have seen so many red flags since my first day it's unbelievable. I feel like I made an enormous mistake and my gut feeling is that I can't do this long term. It's actively making me a more depressed person and a less fun person at home. 

I know that for my mental health I can't do work like this, which involves me being the corporate hack who tells people who are struggling TOO BAD! 

Does anyone have any advice for me? Has anyone else found a different job successfully after working only 2 months?

But this interview with a showroom made me rethink my plans (great hours and pay, good environment, fair employers, job security, product I can see myself becoming passionate about, etc.). The interview went really well and they offered to let me come shadow for a few days to make sure the fit is good, said they were letting all candidates know if they had moved on without them, etc.

I said I was going ahead with the other opportunity but would love to keep the door open and remain under consideration for this role (I was worried this would be a red flag but my friends were like ""You have bills to pay and people should understand that"").

so i have 2 options 

1 ) continue with my current college do some side skills  online , try to get online internship to make my resume look good and start preparing for cat in 2nd year itself and try for cat 2025 and cat 2026 .

2) leave my current course join the course mentioned above related to entrepreunuership work for some time or as fresher go for mba

is it worth spending so much for ug now as im already going to spend around 15-20 lakhs for mba also not to be negative but im also not the smartest , am a bit shy and nervous and introverted thats what contemplating me to go to another city to get that social skill and getting over my fear ,also education!! haha.",Otherwise_Gur5563,1,1.0,0,1722878830,2024-08-05 17:27:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ekto80/help_me/,8,2024
1ektmkt,Life science degree need help finding a career.,"Hello everyone, I am interested in finding a career and am open to different industries. I have a degree in biology and have dabbled with many different ideas but I‚Äôm still having trouble finding something for me. I‚Äôve considered physician assistant studies and nursing. I‚Äôve always had an interest in subjects, such as Anatomy and Physiology. I never applied to PA school because my GPA  was not competitive and I was tired of working low paying jobs for patient care hours.

I am open to different industries , but I know that I would like to pursue a career where there is an opportunity for financial growth. I‚Äôve worked as a technician at a lab. I feel like I am wasting my years trying to figure it out. I am not the best at math although I took calculus, chemistry and physics . I did it because I had to and had to work EXTREMELY hard just to get good grades.

Pursing a degree in something such as engineering seems a little daunting to me considering the fact that I did have to retake calculus in college. I don‚Äôt really have much experiences in other industries. I was interested in clinical research but realized how the market for that industry fluctuates. I do really like learning and I still have the stamina to go back to school.

 I‚Äôm in my mid 20s and want to establish something for myself because, I feel as though I‚Äôm not doing the best I can at life. I even considered going back to school to become a medical laboratory scientist. However, I worked in a lab once and I didn‚Äôt really enjoy working as a technician. Mostly because our job was to process specimens such as smelly urine. I know as a MLS, I would have to examinine those items.

 As I mentioned, I am open to getting a masters degree. My folks are always telling me go back to school, but they don‚Äôt realize I can do that but I need a plan as well. I even thought about working in healthcare consulting. I have applied to jobs and I guess because I don‚Äôt have the experience, it‚Äôs hard to break into certain careers. Tech also seemed really interesting to me, but coding seemed so mundane and boring to me. 

I did consider going back to school to become a nurse but like I said I‚Äôm not too keen on bodily fluids, so I gave up on that idea.

1ekth5b,Taking a pay cut to improve quality of life,"I currently have the opportunity to move into a job that would, seemingly, provide such a vast improvement in my overall quality of life/work-life balance (something I have been longing for but had not yet felt an opportunity was right) but it will inherently come with a significant pay decrease (from ~$85K to about $55K per year)

It‚Äôs just myself and my husband and our cost of living is pretty low; we can certainly maintain a secure life on the new salary, but I‚Äôll be ‚Äúlosing‚Äù much of our expendable income (no second thoughts for regular $$ dinners, taking vacations, buying some new clothes, a bottle of wine that I want vs. what‚Äôs cheap, picking up the tab for friends, feeling like I can donate to whatever charity/cause I want etc)‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll also be losing constant stress/anxiety, the feeling that my job is my primary purpose in life, perpetual ‚ÄúSunday Scaries,‚Äù and having no physical/mental/emotional energy to pursue things I WANT to do in the free time that I do have (focus on my physical and mental well-being, my art practice, community building, spending time with aging parents)

1ekt6qq,Post high school plan/ a career in radiology,"I‚Äôll be a senior this upcoming school year and have created somewhat of an idea for after I graduate high school and could use some advice
I plan on taking a year to work and save some money for schooling (to become an x ray tech) by working as a patient transporter to get experience in a hospital setting. Maybe even begin getting some of my general ed classes out of the way for the program during this time as well
Then eventually apply to a community college that has an accredited radiology program.
I‚Äôve done research on the x ray field and it‚Äôs something that I could really see myself doing and enjoying. Especially with all the different modalities and ways to expand in that career. Overall I‚Äôm very interested in whether this is a good plan or not. Would love to hear some feedback

1ekstri,I just got fired. How should I frame my most recent job experience during an interview?,"Context: I'm in a major US city and work in marketing.

Last September, I was part of a large-scale layoff due to budget cuts. I do not have a bachelor's degree and struggled to find a new role as a result, so I decided to go back to college and finish my degree.

Unfortunately, I still had bills to pay, so at the end of last semester I resumed my job search and landed a marketing manager role at a small financial firm. It was far from my dream job and there were a lot of red flags from the start, but I was desperate for work.

Some red flags:

* Salary: It was very low paying for the type of work I was meant to be doing, and they stonewalled me when I tried to negotiate the salary.
* The company was highly disorganized. They actually never had me sign an employment contract!
* I quickly realized this was less of a marketing manager role and more of a catch-all role for all the projects the managing director and sales team didn't want to do.
* Almost immediately, I was tasked with managing a massive project that was outside the scope of work originally outlined during the interview process. I tried to use this opportunity to grow my skill set, but instead, it just looked -- to my boss, anyway -- like I didn't know how to do my job.
* My boss seemed very checked out. There was zero onboarding and very little in the way of expectation and goal setting. When I tried to get him to set expectations for me, he told me to set some goals for myself that he'd sign off on. That's totally fine, except a few months into my tenure, it turned out the goals I set (and he approved) didn't align with the work they wanted me to do.
* The non-marketing projects I was assigned took my attention away from *actual* marketing work, but I still managed to get a strategy and content calendar off the ground. However, getting anything published was like pulling teeth: my boss wanted to approve everything, but he would sit on a piece of content for weeks before approving.

I figured I could stick it out for six months, then start looking elsewhere. However, they beat me to the punch and let me go last week.

Fortunately, I have an interview this week, but this is the first time I've ever been fired and I don't know how to frame it. I know the old, conventional wisdom was ""never talk badly about your previous employer,"" but I also know honesty can go a long way.

Here's what I'm thinking of saying when they ask me about my last job:

""It was a mutual parting of ways. I don't think I was the right person for them and that wasn't the right role for me. They needed a jack of all trades who was well-versed in the sales pipeline, but my skills are highly specialized in marketing strategy and content creation.""

# TL; DR: 

I took a job in a moment of desperation, and the job ended up being very different from what was advertised. I was already planning on leaving after six months (around September), but I got let go last week. I have an interview this week, and I'm trying to figure out how to frame that experience. Here's what I'm thinking:

""It was a mutual parting of ways. I don't think I was the right person for them and that wasn't the right role for me. They needed a jack of all trades who was well-versed in the sales pipeline, but my skills are highly specialized in marketing strategy and content creation.""",MalleusMaleficarum_,5,0.8600000143051147,14,1722876802,2024-08-05 16:53:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ekstri/i_just_got_fired_how_should_i_frame_my_most/,8,2024

1eks1fs,Should I quit my desk job and do this?,"I graduated college in 2023, and started working a couple months later. I worked at that job for 8 months before I left. I didn't mind the job itself, but I didn't have much to do + hated the place I lived, and on top of that I wasn't making good money at all.

I left to join my current job. I saw it as a more ""professional"" environment. Well, that ended up with a hawking boss and me sitting in a cubicle for 8-9 hours a day, making $70k. The boss is not a fan of anyone, but particularly me. She seems to have a problem with me for some reason even though I've always been respectful.

I'm in psuedo-real estate type of work right now. I like actual real estate sales (my friend and I own a rental property in fact), just not the specific type of real estate I'm in right now.

I'm thinking I may just drop everything and be a waiter/wine server for like 3-5 months while I study for my real estate license, so I could become a realtor. I live in a wealthy place with lots of wine and nice restaurants, so I think I could get a waiter job that pays me hourly (with tips) similar to what I get now. When I did get my license, there are tons of extremely expensive houses here. If I joined a good team and gave it time I'm sure I'd make good money.

The plan would be doing wine serving in the afternoon and waiting tables at night, while I work on my personal business and study for my real estate license in the morning. Yeah it would be busy, but I'm already busy working 8-9 hours a day and then working on my business after anyways. 

It's obviously a ""risk"" so I haven't pulled the trigger yet, but I'm starting to seriously consider it. ",ronaldmcdumfries,0,0.5,2,1722874908,2024-08-05 16:21:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eks1fs/should_i_quit_my_desk_job_and_do_this/,8,2024

For 4 of those years I was a data analyst consultant. I'm switched to a manufacturing company last year as I was tired of the overtime, long commutes,...

I love it here. I have a great team where I'm allowed to work quite autonomous. However all the roles I could grow into are on located in a different site, country and hierarchal structure. Meaning unless they're going to make exceptions for me there's no future outside of my current role. Currently no such exceptions have been made for others and technically my role doesn't belong in my current department either.

I'm torn on what to do as I love my team, pay is good, I like the content and my commute is very nice. On the other I wanted to quit consultancy with the hopes of working towards managing a small team or being technical lead. There's probably no future for me in those roles at my current site and it feels crazy to quit over this.

I will bring this up with my boss during my personal development plan but I fear it's an unrealistic expectation to create a role because that's what I desire. I do see a lot of potential in such role at our site, so I will try to sell it.

I'm 35 and have been in the same position at my current job for the past six years. While the salary is decent ($48K in Texas), and I enjoy excellent benefits (20 days of PTO along with a hybrid work schedule). The problem is that this is as far as I'm going to be able to go here.

Despite my efforts to transition to other divisions or departments, my manager has refused to approve such moves, saying they 'need me' in my current role. My role involves customer support/internal support for a single product our company offers and I mainly just create tickets for actual techs (located in another division) to fix the problem.

I work a great job in engineering at a consulting firm. I really enjoy the work we do along with my group, everyone is great and has taught me a lot. The thing is, work is the only thing I like about this city. 

Being from NJ, 99% of my closest friends live in New York City or work in the area of where I‚Äôm from (45 min outside of NYC). A few of them did live here in Boston but have since moved away.

I‚Äôve really toyed with the idea of moving to NYC, since my company has an office there. It would be nice to do the same work in the same company while being close to friends and also close to my family at home.

Another thing too is that my job is hybrid. I go into the office 2-3 days a week and the majority of my coworkers never do. I‚Äôll see some of them once a month or once every other month.

1ekokhz,New graduate nurse feeling stuck,"Hi everyone:) I recently finished nursing school and passed my NCLEX. I had really high expectations for post graduate life which is honestly my fault but now i feel totally lost.

I am extremely passionate about women's health in any unit and I think I had too much false confidence in believing I would get hired on a specialty floor as a new grad. I was involved in all the extracurriculars you can think of throughout nursing school and worked as both a tech, extern, and I did undergraduate research. I did all these things because people told me the more in-hospital experience and connections I have, the higher my chance of getting a job in a specialty.

I do live in an area where there are a lot of hospitals so I applied to every single one of them, even hours away, but they either never got back to me or they reached out to let me know they did want to hire me but the women's health unit wasn't open to new grads, so I had to start in med surg. After this my confidence was kind of shot and I just started applying anywhere and jobs labelled for new graduates weren't contacting me either. I finally got an interview for one position and I kind of went in with the thought process that this interview was just going to be a practice run to see what kind of questions they ask new grad nurses, but they ended up offering me the position on the spot. I didn't want to turn it down because the hospital that offered me the position is #1 in women's health in my area, so I'm going in hoping to transfer when my probationary period is up.

But I'm really kicking myself right now because I should've just been a little more patient. I recently saw a nurse residency for labor and delivery and a job opening for postpartum a a different hospital that says no experience is required. I'm really mad at myself for rushing to find a job because at the time I felt behind but now I'm realizing a lot of my cohort still are not employed. I wish I was more patient and really only applied to women's health units because that's my only area of interest instead of settling. 

I still ended up applying to the nurse residency but what's considered the normal amount to stay at a position before resigning? I don't want to cut ties with my current hospital because it has a really good reputation in women's health also, but if I get this residency I don't want to miss this opportunity. 

I'm trying to be positive because i know at the end of the day, this is going to be a good experience and I'm going to learn a lot, but I can't help but get more and more angry at myself as the days go on. Does anyone have any advice or encouragement? I just don't know what to tell myself to make myself feel better because all I feel is angry and embarrassed

1eklyky,Stay or Go? ,"Need some advice. Been at my company over a decade. I have a decent salary, decent bonus package, 6 weeks vacation (up to 8 if I carry over) hybrid work schedule & I‚Äôm 10 minutes from home. Ive always had stellar reviews & good solid reputation & relationships. Sounds great & it is. The issue is I have been trying to branch out & do something different so I have applied for 4 internal jobs over the course of the last 6 yrs or so & have been rejected for all of them. I lost 2 of them to younger, less experienced employees. 
To add insult to injury, I was asked to cover for the employee who got promoted until they backfill her position. I am getting increasingly dejected, despondent & frankly pissed off that I‚Äôm not getting opportunities. Like I‚Äôm cursing under my breath every freaking day. Ive also decided to stop going above & beyond because it clearly didn‚Äôt do me any favors. I do what I have to to make sure I will meet my goals & get my bonus,but nothing else. 
I‚Äôm scared if I leave the ‚Äúgrass may not be greener‚Äù & I also won‚Äôt have these perks anywhere else. I should mention too, I‚Äôm in my mid 40s. Which, lets face it does play a role. Do I just suck it up & stay & reap the benefits ? Or tell them see ya you‚Äôve stunted my growth long enough?

Ever since I joined this job all I get to hear is that the company is in loss and they might do layoffs. Last month they did close a bunch of departments and layed off some people. Fortunately, our department was not impacted since we are critical resources. My team is working on migration of legacy application which will be completed maybe by first quarter of next year. So the scenario is that I was told that I will be sponsored once my graduate visa ends which is in 2026, but with all the budget cuts and instability in this company, I am not sure if I should take sponsorship from them. The company has gone into a hiring freeze and they have stopped replacing people who leave a position as well.

1ekhaey,Does an MFin Make Sense for a Consulting Career with Limited Experience?,"Hi everyone,

I need your expert advice on a big decision regarding my career path!

I recently graduated from Northeastern University with a BS in Computer Science and Business Administration. Currently, I'm working as a Project Head at a startup called Edysor. By Fall 2025, I‚Äôll have about one year of full-time work experience.

Here's a snapshot of my internships:

* **KKR & Co. L.P.:** Developed AWS Sagemaker AI algorithms and created Power BI dashboards.
* **DipJar, Inc.:** Refactored codebase to microservices and integrated Stripe API.
* **Fusion Business Solutions Pvt. Ltd.:** Automated form-filling with AI and NLP.
* **E Connect Solutions Pvt. Ltd.:** Managed development lifecycle with CI/CD and unit testing.

I'm contemplating a Master‚Äôs in Finance (MFin) to pivot into consulting, aiming for top programs like:

* LSE
* UCL
* Imperial
* Warwick
* Columbia
* Princeton
* MIT
* LBS

I‚Äôm not looking to do an MBA, so I need your insights on the MFin route.

**My main questions are:**

1. **MFin Fit:** Given my background in computer science and business, does an MFin make sense? Will it strengthen my profile for consulting roles and provide a solid career trajectory?
2. **Career Transition:** Has anyone successfully transitioned into consulting with an MFin? Which programs facilitated this transition smoothly?

If you've been in a similar situation or have experience in consulting, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and advice. Your insights could be incredibly valuable to me as I navigate this decision.

1ekfze5,3 Job Offers in 6 Weeks: Sharing My Strategy and Data,"I have been looking for remote job as a Front-end developer for 3 months.. I was going crazy from applying for jobs on LinkedIn for months without any results. I even upgraded my LinkedIn account to Premium and messaged the hiring managers at the companies I wanted to work for, but it was all in vain.

At this point, I realized that I needed to change my strategy. Instead of just applying for job postings, I started looking for ways to reach a wider audience. Thanks to my new strategy, I landed three fantastic job offers in just six weeks. In this process, I will share what I did and how I succeeded, along with my resources. I am confident you will find it very useful and will be thankful.

**Instead of contacting companies one by one, I aimed to reach out to recruitment firms.**

1) Since I was looking for remote jobs, companies from all over the world were offering me opportunities. So, I opened Google Maps and collected the addresses of recruitment firms in each country one by one. For example, if you are trying to reach companies in Germany, zoom in on Germany and search for ""recruitment."" It will list the companies one by one for you. When you visit these companies' websites, you will see an ""upload resume/cv"" button. I sent my resume to each of these places. One thing to note here is that if you are looking for jobs in the US and Canada, your resume should not have a photo. For companies in Europe, it is the opposite; you should include a photo. (I used another tool for this, Canva and Google offered free solutions, but I didn't like the results.)

If you are looking for remote jobs, the list I have already prepared (currently, the list contains the website addresses of 450+ firms, categorized by country) will definitely be useful for you. If you follow my strategy, I believe you will love this share. It took me two days to prepare the list. You can access the list here (it only covers Europe):[¬†\~Google Spreadsheet\~](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VxSdTyCHBR1PcIcrEVwrzBD1HChtgOFbihvYHmw1ric/edit?usp=sharing). If you are not applying for remote jobs, you can find these firms and send your resume by conducting similar searches in your local area on Google Maps.¬†

2) For the US and Canada (they also send to Europe), I used a tool that sends your resume to companies and helps you prepare your resume during this process. With¬†[\~this tool\~](https://rabbitresume.com/resume-builder), I created both photo-included (for Europe) and photo-less resumes. After sending my resumes to the firms in the list from step 1, I used the feature here and sent my photo-less resume to over 200 recruitment firms in the US, Canada, and Europe with a single click. So, unlike before, I didn't need to upload my resume to each company individually, and it was very helpful.

These two strategies became a turning point in my job search process. Sending my CV to many recruitment companies at once connected me with more companies and, therefore, more job opportunities. In a short time, I started receiving positive feedback. Thanks to this method, I not only found one job but received three different job offers. I accepted two of them and am now working in two jobs remotely. I dedicate four hours of my day to one job and three hours to the other, so I can work without much stress and wear.

By sharing this process and my success story, I wanted to help and inspire people who are going through tough times and looking for a job, just like I was. Change your strategy, try new methods, and never give up. I hope this article helps you and that you find your dream job and take back your life as soon as possible.",adellasimo,5,0.7799999713897705,1,1722835643,2024-08-05 05:27:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ekfze5/3_job_offers_in_6_weeks_sharing_my_strategy_and/,8,2024

1ekfuic,Regretting accepting a full-time role ,"Around 3 months ago I took a casual role as a customer service coordinator with a real estate company. Up until now I‚Äôve worked around 3-4 days per week and recently was offered a full time, permanent role, which I have taken.

It‚Äôs slowly daunting on my the decision I‚Äôve made. I don‚Äôt mind the role itself, it‚Äôs not particularly enriching or interesting but also not too stressful. However I feel like up until this point I haven‚Äôt been provided with adequate training to succeed in a permanent role. 

To further that, my manager just resigned as well as three other permanent staff in the past month, which makes me worried about what I‚Äôve possibly gotten myself into, also also suggests that I will not be receiving the training I need. 

Shift times are strict, and the vibe I have gotten is there is not really any flexibility e.g. leaving early to attend a doctors appointment. I‚Äôve also heard from my co-workers that there is no prospect of any pay rises and upper management is toxic.

Have I made the wrong decision going full time? Is it worth seeing it out for the first couple months before looking for something else? Currently stressed out!

1ekfici,I need help for my salary increase conversation. What increase should I go for?,"Hi Everyone!! I have my salary increase conversation this week and don't know exactly what increase I should go for.

My current tittle job is Associate fashion designer/Associate marketing and I've been in the company for 3 years, my current salary is $55,000 gross annually. I work in a very small company so what I do does not go necessarily with my job tittle so is hard for me to compare and see what the range salary is. These are some of the things I do:

*seasonally.*

- Creating fashion sketches, totaling *between 100 and 150 designs¬†per collection*

1eken6x,HELP! I have been falsely accused of making sexual comments about a female coworker at a bar which led to a fight. ,"I live in Canada. A couple days ago upon returning to work I was called into a supervisors office to discuss rumors, ramblings and gossip about me making sexual comments toward female coworkers. I was appalled by the accusations and taken back but quickly denied them and began trying to understand where the information was coming from. The supervisor(A) that brought out this information was being told to talk to me from a different supervisor(B) who I had issues with in the past. This said supervisor(B) is on his last leg and has been doing some wild things lately. The first supervisor(A) who discussed these matters with me told me he believed me and was only told to investigate because it is a serious matter. I argued that it is just rumors and if they have no proof then it shouldn't be brought to my attention. He(A) said they have little information and just want to keep it between us 3 ( myself, Supervisor A and Supervisor B). I told him this is helping into spreading the rumors they said without more information it wouldn't proceed and to keep it between us.

  
With my livelihood and reputation on the line I decided to take it to the highest level I can by contacting HR and Government workforce organizations. The government organizations lead me to Human Rights numbers in case they do let me go on false claims. And when I talked to the HR rep she seemed very biased and told me not to worry that they would reveal their findings within a month. I feel as though I am backed into a corner. I want to fight back but I'm unsure of how to proceed. I doubt they will find evidence proving this false claim but it seems like this witch hunt may continue unless I make a stand. Any advice would be appreciated.

1ekdqie,"I was trapped in a ""yes"" culture that led to burnout. Here's how I learned to say no without the guilt.","Our work culture glorifies the always-available, do-it-all employee. I thought saying yes to everything made me a team player, and showed my dedication. But all it did was push me to the brink of burnout. I had to learn how to say no - and not feel guilty about it. It wasn't easy, but it saved my sanity (and probably my job). Here are a few things I learned that might help you push back without burning bridges:

‚úÖ Assess the request before responding: Take time to evaluate requests. Ask for details to understand the scope and timeline. Consider how it aligns with your priorities and workload.

‚úÖ¬†Communicate your priorities: Explain your current focus and workload when declining. This provides context and shows your decision is based on strategic considerations.

‚úÖ¬†Don't craft complex excuses: Stick to simple, honest reasons for saying no. Concise explanations like being at capacity or having conflicting deadlines are often more relatable and understandable.

‚úÖ¬†Be kind, but straightforward: Decline firmly while showing respect. Avoid wishy-washy language or false hope, but don't be overly blunt. Strike a balance between politeness and clarity.

‚úÖ¬†Use your daily planner to see your workload: *I use the Sunsama app workload visualization* to support my decisions. It helps me explain why you can't take on additional work.

Did you recently say ‚Äòyes‚Äô to more work even though you wanted to say ‚Äòno?‚Äô What stopped you from declining the request?

*PS: I've got 9 email templates for saying no in different work situations. If you're interested, drop a comment and I'll share them. They've been real lifesavers for me!*",samayash,92,0.8500000238418579,31,1722827971,2024-08-05 03:19:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ekdqie/i_was_trapped_in_a_yes_culture_that_led_to/,8,2024
1ekczom,"Career switch at 26, worth it?","I'm 26, turning 27 next month, unemployed since last October, from India and I'm at a standstill career wise. 

Little background, I'll try to be brief. 
Passed highschool with decent grades, got into probably one of if not THE BEST college in India (St. Stephens, DU). 
Had it not been for the prestige of the college i probably would've opted for B.A in psychology instead of B.A in eng and philosophy which I did and despised most of the semesters of. Ended up being held back a year due to attendance. 

I had always planned on joining the army and did my undergrad as a backup plan, so that's one reason why academics never interested me, except for the time when I was preparing for the Army. I had ambitions to join the infantry, being regarded as very charismatic, athletic with the makings of a soldier (per my family and friends).
I was also influenced to join the forces because my immediate family and closest relatives were in the forces. 

Well, that didn't happen, I couldn't crack the written exam because I gave myself too little time to prepare, I took my time for granted. Anyway, I'm past the age limit to try again. 

I started working as a copywriter for an agency, and copywriting came naturally to me. At present with 2 years of experience as a social media specialist I've dealt with a lot of aspects and verticles inside of social media, from copywriting, client servicing, design concepts, campaigns, pitching etc. and I had to quit last October due to their extremely late salary disbursals due to which often times I and my colleagues were spend out of our own pockets, large amounts which were rarely reimbursed. Every month we had to beg the accts dept to release our payment.  Toxic work culture, late hours, lack of a team which caused the workload to pile up. 

After that I focused on a side hustle, invested savings and it failed. Can't say it was a waste because the hustle was tied to social media which just didn't pan out due to investment required which I just couldn't afford to continue. 

I'm at a point now where I have realised that I don't have the passion, or drive to work in social media. Idk if that's the joblessness insecurity, or an ""aha' moment. I like stability and certainty, which in the world of social media keeps changing, and if you can't keep up with it you're as good as a monkey with a pen.

The career switch I want to make is from a social media specialist to a clinical/counselling psychologist. 

I have always been the type of person that seeks to look deeper than what's on the surface, and that personality of mine has only grown recently when my family and peers pointed it out. My friends who are close to me or know me personally often seek advice from me about different subjects like sadness, helplessness, social anxiety, bad self image, doubt, suspicions, assumptions. I keenly observe people's body language, emotions or language (words that have heavy connotations). 

Anyway, with this switch I'll probably be discarding my professional experience as a SM specialist and I don't want to earn in breadcrumbs if I am unsuccessful with psychology because I'm not great with academics. (Aside from the army exams, Ive never been interested in academics. But maybe if I study a subject that interests me, I could excel?)

1ekbzie,Interview help-Should I take the interview,"I have been in my industry now 20 years. First job for 14 years but was part of reduction in force twice with same company. Each time I stayed within the company finding roles with other areas. I left there on my own accord in 2017. Since then I have been with 4 different companies. Mostly lateral moves but each time taking about 10% increase. My current role I am just under 2 years, the company has great benefits, 10% bonus (almost guaranteed), fully remote and a pension I'll be fully vested after 3 years of employment. 

I stay active on LinkedIn due to having been through reduction in force layoffs in the past.  My industry is always changing, due to trends in the market and of course advancements in technology.  I have been talking with a recruiter and she wants me to interview for a job with a company that has almost exactly the same benefits and again lateral move and about 10% increase.  I would walk away  from my pension at current role which only is about $10k in there now (would lose it all because not vested), and my year end bonus.  There literally is nothing wrong with my current job, I'm acclimated, like the people and fully remote is great. However, I anticipate a future shake up which would prob be announced Sept or Oct.   I know there is no harm interviewing. My question is how do I say to the recruiter that I want to continue with interview but not sure the overall compensation would be worth me to voluntarily move?  I also feel like constantly moving ever 1-2 years for lateral moves takes me about 6 months just to acclimate to new systems, workflows and people even though the job is exactly the same. This 6month onboarding is slowing down the trajectory of my career.  If I knew my job now was 100% safe I would not bother interviewing anywhere else.  

Can I or should I just follow it through with interview just in case I am correct about my current role being in jeopardy?  I don't want to waste anyone's time but also want to be in their pipeline for the near future incase I'm forced to job hunt soon.

Any thoughts and or advice would be helpful. The recruiter is from outside the company so I know I can be honest with her.

Are there ""registered"" career paths after a data science degree?

For example, an actuarial career is registered and can be pursued after a data science degree, perhaps by taking a master's degree in statistics for actuarial science.

I don't want to be considered just a ""data analyst scientist"" and end up working on different things outside my field of data analysis.

If necessary, I would also take the time to study another degree.",Additional-Wind8186,0,0.5,0,1722811142,2024-08-04 22:39:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ek81j9/registered_careers_after_studying_data_science/,8,2024

1ek4uww,Should I Choose a Stable Engineering Job or Pursue My Dream in Formula 1?,"Hello everyone,

I'm a final-year university student in the UK facing a difficult career decision and would greatly appreciate your advice.

I have two job offers on the table. The first is a permanent engineering position offered to me last November. This role aligns well with my long-term career goals, and the company has been very accommodating. They've agreed to a location change, been open to salary negotiations, and have shown flexibility with scheduling. This position provides stability and clear career prospects.

The second offer came recently - a one-year contract in Formula 1, which has been my dream industry since childhood. While this opportunity could be incredibly rewarding, it's a shorter-term position with less certainty. However, I'm willing to work hard to extend my stay or explore other positions within the F1 company if possible.

My dilemma is this: While the F1 position is incredibly appealing, I'm concerned it might divert me from my long-term career goals. The one-year contract also adds an element of uncertainty. On the other hand, the permanent position offers stability and aligns with my career objectives, but I'm torn about possibly missing out on my dream opportunity in F1. I am willing to take risks but I don't know how much I can afford my expenses in employment after the 1 year in F1.

I would greatly appreciate any insights, especially from those who have faced similar decisions or have experience in either industry. How would you approach this decision? What factors should I prioritize?

1ek42au,What jobs should I apply for with my health condition? ,"I‚Äôve had to leave two jobs in the span of 2 years because of sciatica which turned into Cauda equina syndrome. I had a second spinal surgery for Cauda equina syndrome beginning of this year and I am lucky I can still walk. The first time I had this surgery I was 18 and doctors say my case is rare. Part of my right foot and leg is numb due to nerve damage from the condition. It is uncomfortable for me to stand for too long as it triggers sciatica and sitting down too long is not good for me as well. After two spinal surgeries, my back and health is not what it used to be. 

I eat healthier and try to do 10k steps every now and then as any other exercise such as weightlifting is a big risk. I‚Äôm a 23 year old female who has been unemployed since November 2023. Now I want to go back into work as I need to start saving for my future. I‚Äôm fed up of being stuck inside most days unemployed while everyone in my family works and has something to do. Being ill has made me stay indoors often and now that I don‚Äôt work, I have little social life now and feel like my social skills have deteriorated. 

As much as I want to work, it‚Äôs difficult applying to jobs given that it is competitive and I need to consider my health as well. I‚Äôm also scared of becoming ill once I start working again as this happened to me TWICE in the past and having to leave my job. I have a trauma over this tbh. Any suggestions on what kind of jobs will be suitable for me to apply for? I no longer want to be career obsessed I just need a job that does not trigger high stress and puts strain on my back, as this flares up my condition.

1ek3zvp,Burn Out,"The title says it all, I am at a job that has been a constant struggle for multiple years. To start off I loved my job before two years ago. I was doing job estimation and designing spreadsheets for a multi million dollar company to track work and cost estimation in multiple states. I had a workload that I felt like I could handle and had the freedom of working from home. Two years ago there was a job vacancy and I was asked to take over invoicing and payroll on top of my previous roles with a small raise (~6k/yr). I have gotten to the place where it is managed well and I can juggle everything decently. With that being said I cannot take a vacation or any time off without completing my work. No one else has the capability to do my job or substitute for me. I can complete the managers job while he is out and fill in tasks but there is no reciprocation or distribution of work load. It burns me out pretty frequently. I have expressed to my bosses how frustrating it is and provided locigal solutions to these issues with no prevail. My first child is about to be born any time now and I will have to take my work with me and hope that I can complete my tasks at the hospital. I do not like having to think about my job before my family. Not to mention I am topped out at only $55k a year with potential bonuses and overtime which is frequently every week(average 5 hours). I have been steadily applying to other jobs for the past year and only managed to take a few interviews that didn't work out. Working from home will be beneficial and I calculated without commute and daycare cost to save a significant amount. I have also pondered starting a consulting agency for personal financial audits/financial tracking as well as busines audits with the option to teach or manage financial or tracking spreadsheets. I want out but keep reaching and can't seem to grasp at anything.

1ek3tm1,Is switching jobs while pregnant (without needing to) a terrible idea?,"
I‚Äôm 36, first time mom, currently early second trimester. Another mama friend of mine told me about a position at her company which would be a good career step, good benefits, and more money (+ 43% more than what I‚Äôm making now). It‚Äôs an IC role with similar responsibilities to my current position, but I would learn some new skills and an IT system that I don‚Äôt use in my current role. She has really positive things to say about the wlb, culture, and leadership, and there are a lot of working moms at this company.

But this new role could be a good career move and obviously a significant salary boost. I applied not really thinking I would necessarily get super far, but I‚Äôm at the final interview, and I‚Äôm trying to decide what to do if they offer.

My question is that I have no idea what 3rd trimester, birth and post maternity leave is going to look like, and I wonder if I should stay at my current position where I am comfortable until I‚Äôm less health (physically and mentally) compromised? I have a great reputation at my current company, and so even though I imagine my work quality may wane when baby isn‚Äôt sleeping, and I‚Äôm physically recovering, at least I can fall back on the years of success I‚Äôve built. But with this new job, I‚Äôd have so little time to establish a reputation prior to mat leave, I worry I won‚Äôt have a successful transition.

I'm incoming college student struggling to pick my college degree/program. The reason why I'm struggling is that, I'm kinda torn about being ""practical"" or pursuing what I think suits me. For context, practicality wise, my aunt said that taking ECE (electronics eng) would be much more practical than IE (industrial eng) because it has a board exam certification. On the other hand, she deemed IE as impractical as it's ""too broad"" and has no board exam (but has certification exam).

What's confusing for me is that, I think I can quite love the program I'm gonna choose as long as I have a kind of validation that it'll be worth pursuing in the future. I'm kind of interested in both fields of ECE and IE that's why I'm considering it as my programs of choice. 

For more context:  I'm interested in finance and marketing, and I think among the engineering programs, Industrial Engineering is the most closest to them. I can imagine myself being a project manager or some sorts to leverage my creativity.  However, I'm also quite interested in ECE because I figured I can become a broadcast engineer in the future and work in one of the biggest broadcasting company in my country (quite a dreamer eh--).

This job sucks DO NOT work here. 

In the last month several policy changes have been made that have made this job go from worth the grind to absolute BS.

* The sales quota to qualify for better quality leads via online sign ups was raised. If you take a vacation or are ever sick or take a one day off you will get behind and lose progress. 
* Policy changes regarding weekend shifts. Weekend shifts get you certain leads. Employees used weekend shifts strategically for appointments and lead opportunities. Changes now make this difficult

What I liked about my job is that my team was great. The salespeople on my team are incredible and smart. My manager is super nice and very supportive. 

What I HATE about my job is the awful feeling I have about the sales I make. The meeting about the compensation plan opened up a whole can of worms. Many people expressed their resentment for the lack of support and declining quality of the product. It is a hard job and sales people get very little help in supporting their contractors/pros. There is no spanish app and no plan to make one. Only a few teams have spanish speakers. We are expected to talk to and sign up contractors who speak little to no english. Most contractors I call need their kid to translate and this is not unusual. I feel they cannot agree to entering an agreement with us without a full understanding. And I cannot guarantee they understand everything being translated/communicated to them.

Many top sales people are going to leave when the compensation plan kicks in later this month. I‚Äôm ready to leave and want to write a letter giving notice. Any advice? I am a new employee so I don‚Äôt want to get my manager in trouble.

This job sucks DO NOT work here. 

In the last month several policy changes have been made that have made this job go from worth the grind to absolute BS.

* The sales quota to qualify for HSOs (better quality leads via online sign ups) was raised. If you take a vacation or are ever sick or take a one day off you will get behind and lose progress. 
* Policy changes regarding weekend shifts. Weekend shifts get you certain leads. Employees used weekend shifts strategically for appointments and lead opportunities. Changes now make this difficult

1ejyjt6,Setting up my ducks; looking to December,"I am currently in an internship position at a company that is not my passion, but pays decent for the area I am in. I am very confident that this will be extended to October, with high probability of turning into a full tine roll in between Septemberand end of Ocotber. I didn't necessarily seek out this opportunity, it just kind of happened. I don't find myself aligned with the company mission and ultimately their goals don't align with my values. 

This being said, I really enjoy working with my boss and he has put himself put there to try and get me a full-time roll at the company. 

I had an interview for my dream job and didn't get it, however I met with the hiring manager again after and he has been passing around my resume and has told me they are hiring again in early winter for a very similar position. He will be asking me to apply. I am very hopeful that I will be hired.

Ultimately, I don't want to continue working at my current company for 2 months and then quit on my boss after he has put his name in the ring for me. I do want to work at my dream job (obviously), and would drop my current roll in a second if given the opportunity. 


I know this is thinking way ahead and a lot can happen in between then. I like to have my plans in order.

1ejxh8b,How to choose next role?,"Hi all, 

I'm currently in my early thirties with 10 years service with my current company who provide accommodation, maintenance and support services to people.

In those years, I have gathered the following experience: 2 years housing officer, 3 years operational management, 1 year senior operations management, 1 year stakeholder managment and 1 year senior stakeholder and safeguarding management.

I'm 5 months away from receiving an honours degree in management and leadership and hopefully accreditation for CMI as an accredited manager. Once I obtain this qualification, I want to try my hand elsewhere, however I'm not sure what I'd actually like to do. I want to stay in management of some type and work for an organisation that provides support services to disadvantaged people, as I find money alone doesn't give me the fulfillment I'd like to have from work.

Has anyone used any particular tools or processes to guide them in making such a decision?

1ejx21f,"Took a job with a competitor, old boss not too happy. Should I request a conversation? ","
I, 31F, was recruited by a consulting firm and was told that I would be receiving $50/hr as a 1099 contractor. After I quit my original job, the president informed me that he lost the main contract but would still bring me on at $25/hr. He mentioned that he was signing a new contract that should be finalized in about 60 days, at which point he would adjust my pay. We agreed, signed the contract for $25/hr, and he promised to send me a new contract soon. I started working for him, but only a couple of hours a week, so I was making minimal money, but I was okay with it because my savings were enough to last for a couple of months.

Payments were inconsistent‚Äîjust a few hundred dollars here and there or $60, $80 etc. Sometimes at night on a Saturday, or whenever, In total, I was receiving $500-$800 a month. I kept asking for the new contract, and he kept saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send it soon.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt press too hard because he assured me that everything would be back-paid. Fast forward to February, I set up a meeting to discuss my pay. He told me that he would not be giving me a raise because I was already earning above minimum wage. After that, I informed him that I would be looking for another job and gave my notice.

He was a consultant at an institution where I had previously worked. They made me false promises about a new position, but never followed through, so I felt like I was being used. He believed that I should be paid more for the amount of work I was doing.

I trained my replacement, whom he found within the same week, likely with similar false promises. Lol.

Two months later, a friend referred me to another firm that is his competitor. I was hesitant, but they have a great reputation, so I applied. I interviewed and got the job. It‚Äôs a salaried position, and I‚Äôm receiving a great salary plus quarterly bonuses.

There was a contract he was supposed to assist my new firm with, but the budget was slashed, and his portion was no longer needed because the company that hired my firm decided to handle it internally. I feel that he is telling people it was my fault that his firm couldn‚Äôt partner with mine because it would have been a great opportunity for him. However, the budget was slashed even before I applied.

I‚Äôve been attending conferences where I occasionally see my old boss. Of course, I say hello and try not to feel any guilt, but I do because I feel like he‚Äôs the type to paint me as the villain in his story.

Am I the asshole here? I wasn‚Äôt paid properly but kept working and doing everything I was supposed to do. No adult can survive on less than $1,000 a month. I don‚Äôt want to explain my side of the story to people in the industry because it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs business, but I don‚Äôt want anyone damaging my reputation. I work hard, and he even used to speak highly of me before all of this. We will always be in similar spaces and I hate the anxiety that comes with it.

1ejwpz1,Portfolio manager career?,"Hi Guys,

I'm 23 years old and fresh out of university I'm looking to get into a career in portfolio management. The problem with this is I don't have an educational background relative to finance, in my undergrad I studied political science. I did my bachelor's in political science because it originally interested me, but over time I've been trying to shift to a path of portfolio management by working in any industry like banking for example. My question is if I were to go back to school and get my MBA or master's in finance would it be sufficient to get into a portfolio management career or should I focus more on related career experience (If I can get in with what I currently have) or getting smaller professional designations such as levels of the CFA?

1eju7n1,How to bounce back after negative feedback?,"I‚Äôve been in my role about 1.5 years and up until two months ago I had only received glowing feedback and I felt really good about my contributions to my organization. Two months ago the negative feedback I received were about 1) not going into bleeding heart details in an email to my CEO as to why I was could no longer attend a voluntary dinner  (my manager knew the reason - I just didn‚Äôt think it was appropriate to be that personable with the CEO) 2) I try to solve problems too much on my own (instead of asking our admin about a mail question I just went and looked into it myself because I was already going to the area) and 3) out of left field I was told that I was slightly behind where they wanted me to be in terms of understanding our new-to-me industry. This feedback wasn‚Äôt very helpful because my manager yelled the feedback, was resistant to clarifying questions, and then didn‚Äôt give anything actionable for me to do to improve. This was squared away after I made a very concerted effort to be overly personal in all my communications, added a middle man to any task that was slightly out of my wheel house, and publicly demonstrate my expertise. I also am taking two classes on my industry and reporting on those to my manager. 

Now to last week, I disappointed my manager (their words) with two big items I worked on this month. I was really overwhelmed with my workload this month as I had to do my regular duties and quickly complete 3 new projects ~3 weeks. My boss was out most of the month for either work travel or vacation and I have been feeling very nervous to ask for additional guidance/help with anything since the negative feedback two months prior. I also had to move during this time. The mistakes I made for one of the big items (stats report) were extremely dumb and they would‚Äôve been addressed if I had not effectively run out of time to proper QC review. The press release I prepared with the report was fantastic (their words) but it‚Äôs unacceptable I did so poorly in the draft report I submitted. Even though my boss was out, I should‚Äôve asked to split up the report or just communicated I was struggling with completing these items effectively in the short time frame. The feedback for the other item (large legal review) were primarily stylist, but my manager also wanted me to balance out our other boss‚Äô edits to the document when I instead just accepted them and worked around them. It‚Äôs important to note this is only the second time I‚Äôve done this review by myself and this was the only time I got some dialogue back/forth about the document. It was never stated I should veto some of our boss‚Äô edits because this was the first time I‚Äôve ever seen them live. The other mistake I made was missing an email update for an item in the document. I had read the email before, but didn‚Äôt recall that there was an update for that specific thing. The final piece of the feedback was that my manager would‚Äôve liked to be able to send me out on the ground, on my own, representing our org and our industry but I‚Äôm not quite there yet. I would also love to be at that point but I haven‚Äôt had enough on the ground shadowing with my manager to do that. 

My manager recognized I have done really phenomenal at some parts of my role and made many good contributions at this point. They said they believed in me, that I will do amazing things, and have a strong foundational understanding of the industry. They also acknowledged that they‚Äôve been largely absent and unavailable for much coaching for the first half of the year. I want to bounce back from this and learn from the experience. 

I think I need to work on managing up (to get better instructions and actionable feedback), asking for help, and getting comfortable asking a lot of questions again. I want to provide a plan for how to I mitigate the chances of making the same errors in the documents I mentioned and also a plan for how I can get to the point to where I can be on the ground by myself by January (I‚Äôm in politics so that‚Äôs when legislative activity really begins). I also think I need to look for opportunities to create a feedback loop on smaller scale projects and items so I can get better acclimated for how they want things communicated. I would love to hear your thoughts on my plan (planning to share this next time we meet) and how I can make this into a positive.

1ejtzs2,How Can I Better Define My Role and Career Path in Marketing?,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some advice on my current job situation and how to better define my career path.

* I started at my current company (around 60 employees) as a Marketing Specialist and was promoted to Digital Marketing Manager about a year ago, after 2.5-3 years of employment. It was a relatively easy ask, and my boss was supportive of the promotion.

* However, I feel like I don't have a clearly defined ""path"" in my role. I work on a variety of different projects, but I don't feel like I have ""my thing,"" whereas my colleagues have more specific roles like ""events,"" ""SEO,"" or ""advertising."" The projects I work on are quite varied, and sometimes I struggle to succinctly explain what I do.

* I currently have one direct report who works on loyalty email projects. My job doesn't feel like it's in danger; they have me presenting to our clients on local marketing efforts at our conference in September.

I'm thinking of discussing a more direct/updated job description with my boss. Is this the right approach? Are marketing roles generally difficult to explain, or is it just my situation? I tend to overthink, so please call me out if I'm doing so. Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated!

1ejte40,Should I quit my job?,"So this is my first job. I've been here for more than 2 years. But am feeling extremely burnt out. Every second I think about work and get anxiety/panic attacks thinking what next fcuk up might be. The first year here I learnt so much. The way to function, to manage and handle things and platforms. 
But since the last couple of months it feels like my trajectory is just going downwards. I have been shifted to a new dept with same working system but different client. I'm the only person who is responsible for all the things. There's a new joinee but they're of no help. Due to the amount of workload I don't get time to eat with back to back calls and ever increasing requests.
And despite working late hours, putting my interests aside there's no appreciation. I'm okay with no getting appreciation but atleast I shouldn't be getting yelled at every now and then.
All this has impacted my physical and mental health. I'm starting to forget and miss out things, I have lost my appetite and weight, waking up with constant dread and anxiety. 
I don't get a moment to myself.
Even on my sick days, my boss calls me for work requests post 7 as technically the work hours are done and so is the sick leave.
The reason that I am hesitant to leave is because what if this is all inside my head and that maybe I'm not working hard enough? What if I'm just lazy.? What if I don't land a job even though everyone around me says I'm capable.

I just need to understand what the heck to do?

1ejs3lg,Thoughts on long term career plan/what to incorporate? Engineering degree to navy to finance,"Am currently mechanical engineering undergraduate at Imperial College. Considering applying to the Navy after graduating for the role of Aircrew Officer Pilot. This involves officer training at Britannia Royal Naval College and flying jets, and has an initial commission of 12 years. I do not know if I would want to stay on for 12 years, but the required return of service is \~7 years I believe. After this, I would intend to enter into finance: my current interests are investment research, investment banking and quantitative analysis, but I have not decided which is most attractive yet. I have two short work experience stints from when I was in school, at Deutsche Bank and PwC, through a Pathways to Banking and Finance programme hosted by LSE, but I have not yet done anything relevant in uni. Additionally, I did not take the first year of uni seriously (am yet to resit 6 exams) so have poor academic credentials for the last year, which is an obstacle in applying for spring weeks this year. The idea is that a period in the Navy will grow me professionally and as a person, in terms of leadership, work ethic, attention to detail, pressured decision making and provide an exciting career. Then I am aware that some firms like Goldman have veterans schemes and finance would be a good outlet to transfer these qualities. Such naval experience I imagine would also keep me open for engineering jobs and potentially working at space companies (where aviation experience is highly valued). Some considerations I have are whether I should seek some finance work experience in between uni and applying to the Navy (i.e. a 'gap year') and whether I should look into pursuing further education alongside work should I be offered a position in the Navy, in some quantitative subject (such as postgraduate study in applied physics/quantum algorithms or a qualification in finance) if that would be advantageous in the corporate world. I am also aware that it would be a lengthy commitment to the military, in which salary progression is nothing like the ridiculous figures you see in the world of finance.

I‚Äôm pretty lost about what I want to do and feel incredibly behind, or have the constant impression that I didn‚Äôt understand the stakes of choosing the right first job, feel like I shot myself in the foot. 

I‚Äôm hesitating on attending the Ecole 42 (a coding school that‚Äôs well known) in August to acquire coding skills in python, shell, c and hope to become a data analyst. 

Any advice/opinion?

I‚Äôm 22 and live in a third-world country, which feels pretty old to have not made a single penny and been doing nothing. I used to be a very good student, but I messed up big time in my A-levels due to family problems.

I was in a pre-med track and did very well in the MDCAT, but my A-level grades (ABB) weren‚Äôt good enough to get into medical school. The other option was to attend a private medical school, but those are way too expensive.

This year, I took a test for admission to a business school, arguably the best in my country, and I got in easily without even needing an interview. I thought maybe this was my calling, but as the university start date approaches, I‚Äôm starting to doubt whether it‚Äôs the best choice.

I also had the option to pursue Computer Science (CS), but my mother advised against it, so I didn‚Äôt take the test. Frankly, I don‚Äôt know much about it either, aside from the fact that people in tech are making way more money than business or accounting and finance graduates.

I still have the option to take the IMAT test and study medicine in Italy. I might end up giving it a shot, but I‚Äôm scared‚Äîwhat if I pass and get in? What will I do then?

I‚Äôve shared my entire story here, and anyone who has experienced gap years knows it‚Äôs not a comfortable situation. I‚Äôve had two gap years now, and it‚Äôs really weighing on me.

What should I do? What‚Äôs the best path for me to take?

1ejj6q5,I want to quit my job so badly,"Hey, I'm writing here because I need some advice, I apologize if it's a long read but I want you to understand my situation in depth.

I recently got a job as a tracer for a trucking company honestly it sucks, the reason why it sucks, in my opinion, is because half the time I'm just staring at the screen watching trucks on Samsara and google maps. The whole point of the job is to keep track of trucks and update brokers and dispatchers if anything happens.

The majority of people at the workplace are miserable and pissed off, not to mention I'm the youngest person there as everyone is over the age of 30. I can't find a connection with them and I don't want to honestly everyone pretty much hates each other and I always hear someone talking shit about someone else. Not to mention the shifts are all over the place where sometimes I would randomly work night shifts, and morning shifts. Also, there are cameras in every room monitoring us and I can't help but feel uncomfortable having someone watching me work every second.

My first job was as a broker for a freight company for about 3 months, I enjoyed it at first but quickly got overwhelmed with the work and got ""let go"" without any warning or a second chance. it was a shame because I did like the atmosphere and the people working there were friendly and easygoing. My second job was fleet management but I left halfway through the training as the trainer was terrible at explaining the job and at times didn't even seem interested in teaching me.

Now it's my second month as a tracer and all I think about is quitting as this line of work, this whole trucking field is not for me I think I've given the whole trucking experience a try personally and I don't just don't see myself doing this in the future. I'm sick of these office jobs and honestly want to switch to something else, the only reason I chose to work is that I needed money and money alone but you see that is also a problem as I don't want to work at some job I have no will to work for money. I'm scared to waste my life on something I'll regret and by the time I try to change, it'll be too late. I know I sound dramatic but I've started to think about my life and where my path will lead me ever since I turned 20.

Unfortunately, I do not have anything lined up as these jobs are popular here and it's rare to find something else. I have two options, I can stay and work as much as I can while looking for a new job or I could quit now and fully commit to finding something and take a mental break for a while. It might take months but I'm determined to find a job not for the sake of earning but to keep.

""What is your dream job or goal?"" Might sound strange but I don't have a dream job, but I'm interested 3d animating, music, I even thought about being a zoo keeper. I love animals and the thought of working at a zoo isn't that bad, to be honest. Now it might take some time and I might need to job-hop a little but whatever it takes.

""Why don't you talk to your family about it?"" I tried but my father doesn't understand, he said ""Who cares where you work as long as you earn money"" My father has never worked in an office before, he worked his whole life in retail so he obviously doesn't get it. Practically everyone in my family tells me to take whatever job I can get and not to be so picky.

So basically that's my situation again it's a long read but I felt like getting it off my chest and just hearing what you guys think about it all, what would you do in my shoes? Should I quit or stay? Am I sounding like a baby? What would you do differently?

1eji7fw,1 year of working in corporate and I want to quit to travel... should I? ,"I graduated in 2023 and now work in consulting where I can tolerate my work, but I absolutely hate waking up to work and feeling like I am wasting my youth. I'm 23 and love to be outside and painting has always been my passion, its currently my side hustle but have considered pursuing it further. My lease ends in a couple months and I am seriously considering quitting and taking a year to travel and figure things out. I am career motivated but also consider myself a creative and feel like I'd regret not pursuing it even a little while I am young. If I stay at my job, I'd probably get a promotion and continue climbing the corporate ladder. I also started seeing someone that I really like, and if I quit I would have to break things off I think in order to travel.

I know there is never a ""good time"" to drop everything, but now feels like as good a time as ever. I know the job market is bad for people my age with only a year of experience, I'd have to stop seeing my partner and face the unknown, but I just can't keep waking up every day riddled with anxiety staring at a computer all day. If you've taken the leap, any advice? And if you didn't, do you regret it? Just young and trying to figure out what to do.

1ejhhck,Is it normal to be worried about getting comfortable? Along with concerns of being seen as arrogant,"Ive been in my current role (software dev) for 2 years now. For the first year I had a lot of anxiety regarding lack of knowledge and meeting new people in the job. I think this drove me to do a lot more, in and out of work, to make sure i was seen as capable and could keep up. 

Fast forward a couple years and im starting to feel more comfortable, ive gotten to know my coworkers well and really getting to grips with what my role in the company is. 

However, im concerned this comfortability is really going to hinder my development. What ive realised is i get a lot of motivation for trying to prove myself. It might not be healthy, but now i know my coworkers well, i almost feel like ive taken my foot off the gas. 

As applies to many areas, there is never a shortage of things to learn in software; im not claiming to have even scratched the surface. But in the specific role ive been given these past 2 years, i think i‚Äôve learned enough where i have a place in the company which wont change any time soon. 

To add to this, as the youngest in the group, im hesitant to show the things ive learnt and to add in meetings and discussions. And the times where i do, i find myself overthinking, worried about portraying arrogance and overconfidence. 
 
Apologies for the text wall. I guess my question is really about how to handle the feeling of getting comfortable, as well as a sense of guilt (imposter) regarding getting to grips with a role.

I immediately apologized but the HR person sitting beside had already booked a hotel and a flight back to where I came from. I asked if I could get another chance to improve myself and that's when my manager snatched my work laptop. I also asked if I will be barred from applying to the company again and the HR person said no. I asked them to give me another chance and my manager said no and snatched my work laptop from me. 

I asked the manager for an instance to when I was combative and he said during the national intern event you asked some questions to the HR regarding employment discrimination with international students ( I am an international student) and then he left to fetch my other office technology.


Since I was an intern I feel this is unfair as I wasn't given a warning about my behavior. It's been three days since I was fired what could I do for now?

1ejg6g5,I'm a job hopper. How to stop??? ,"Hi everyone, I don't often post on here, if ever, but I've been thinking a lot about my future and life lately. My past and life itself has definitely had its ups and downs, including a lot of bad experiences and trauma, but I don't look to the past anymore. I never did well in school and could've progressed in my early adult life but chose the wrong path when I was sofa surfing/homeless in my teenage years and in bad areas and around bad people. I was always a good person, always have been, but a lot happened. I've worked on and off and lived alone since 16. Mostly minimum wage jobs. I've done everything from warehouse, Customer service, retail, call centres, hospitality etc. My jobs have ranged from a couple months to a couple years. I think in the past 11 years I've had around 10 jobs. My longest recent one was over a year at a casino, I left that in January-February last year. Since then I was unemployed for a few months and completed a level 3 course. I've had a couple jobs since but only for a couple months and then I seem to get fed up, hate it and quit. I've also noticed I tend to get overly emotional at work, often when it's near that time of month, but to the point where everything gets too overwhelming and I feel like breaking down/crying. I completed my theory in March and currently doing driving lessons. The plan is to do my driving, get a car, and go into the trade I did on my course, or something I will actually enjoy. I want to stop job hopping. I need to stop. I'm usually such a positive person and everyone always comments on my smile and bubbliness etc, but then sometimes I just feel so hopeless, lost, down and when I feel rubbish I tend to do stupid spontaneous decisions. After working a couple months at my new job I quit today again. I'm already regretting it. What is wrong with me? What can I do? I need to change.

Anything to do with a time constraint is a possible trigger to panicking and/or leaving. (Work schedules, meetings, promising to call a client at a certain time, etc.)

I've worked corporate, worked from home, and have had my own business. The shortest stint has been a few hours, the longest 4 years (I burned out & am now jobless and with lower esteem).

I've not had a passion for any of the jobs (mostly administrative). Despite personality testing, tests & quizzes, I really don't know if any job would motivate me enough to quell the  sudden urge to leave. I've left jobs mid-shift, taken a long nap & then would be ready to work again but I'd be fired by then. When I am okay, I am a good worker. Not just by my standards but based on employer reviews and quick promotions.

1eje0gn,"Feeling a Little Lost at 30 with an MPH and years of experience
","Hi everyone-I would love just some input or advice on next steps in my life. For context, I'm 30 years old with an MPH and living back at home with my family since I quit my job in January doing grants and contracts. Long story short, when I started college I wanted to become a doctor and ended up doubting my skills and didn't want to study for 10+ years so switched to public health. I was interested in health and business so wanted to combine both. HOWEVER, at the time I also was still thinking maybe PA school but developed an eating disorder and that took away from my mind and critical thinking skills. So I ended up getting an MPH. My first job I hated and shadowed PAs, nurses and for some reason just decided to see if maybe doing something else would help. Fast forward 7 years later, I quit my job since it was making me suicidal. I still struggle with severe depression and decision fatigue.

What I do know is I love talking to people and want to feel challenged in my job. I do need something a little flexible since too much stress may cause me to flare (I have a chronic illness as well). I don't know if it makes sense to switch to UX design/Research in this market, stick to hating my jobs in public health, or go down the nursing route. I do want to make more money as well, but just not be so miserable while doing it. I am all over the place hah. It's been 7 months of living back at home now and I am slwoly feeling like a failure and regret so many life choices. I keep getting overwhelmed with options and think of so many things I could do, but end up doing nothing and the cycle continues. ah decisions fatigue. If anyone has any advice or input, that would be lovely!

I'm an Australian tertiary student working part-time in photometric testing for a local LED manufacturer.

Despite the specialized nature of my role, my pay has remained at AUD 24 per hour, the same as when I started as a factory hand.



1. \*\*Fair Pay:\*\* Given my skills and responsibilities, what would be a fair hourly rate in Australia for my position?

2. \*\*Career Path:\*\* Is this role too niche to continue part-time while studying? What is the typical trajectory for someone in this field?



I love my job and perform well in it, but I‚Äôm uncertain about its long-term viability and appropriate compensation. Any advice from those experienced in photometry or related fields would be greatly appreciated!

1ej6we0,Am I wrong to leave at a terrible time for my team?,"I work on a small team of 10-20 people. Up until recently, there were 3 of us doing my particular job (let's call my coworkers Mike and Kyle). It's a very important job to the team that I'm on, as 5-10 of our other coworkers rely on us to do our work. I've been told by management that the team could not function without Mike, Kyle and I doing our jobs. Mike is expecting a child soon, so everyone was bracing for the team to be understaffed and for me and Kyle to carry the load for a couple months while Mike is on paternity leave.

A few weeks ago, I came across a job opportunity that was very attractive to me. I applied to the job, and started the interview process. The interview process seemed to be going well, and I was looking forward to taking the next step of my career. I am expecting an offer in the next couple of weeks.

Now here's the kicker: last week, Kyle suddenly left for a different company. This was completely unrelated to me pursuing my own job opportunity, and I had no idea that Kyle was even interviewing elsewhere at all. So now the team is panicking because we lost Kyle permanently, leaving just Mike and I to shoulder the work that was done by Mike, Kyle, and I. And since Mike is going on paternity leave soon, the team is expecting for me to carry the burden on my own. Management is scrambling now to hire a replacement for Kyle and get me help. They have put up job postings to fill that gap.

No one has any idea that I'm about to leave also. So now, I will look like an enormous asshole when I drop the bomb that I am leaving too. This will only leave Mike to shoulder the burden for a short time, and then he will go on paternity leave and there will be no one left to do our job while he's gone. I have no idea what the team would do. It is making me lose so much sleep and giving me a ton of anxiety because I feel like I am letting my team down. I am so worried that me leaving might lead to management laying off people because they no longer have the support of Kyle, Mike, and myself.

I feel absolutely awful because I feel like I will be screwing my coworkers, but this is a rare opportunity that I don't know if I will get again. I'm trying to rationalize that it's not my fault that management didn't hire backups to do our jobs, they chose to risk it by running lean for a while and only have 3 people do it. I had been asking for almost a year at this point if we were going to hire a 4th, only for them to prioritize hiring elsewhere. Also, the timing is awful but it's not my fault that Kyle left right before I am, and that M is going on paternity leave right after. I also try to remind myself that the working world in America is ruthless and that my company would cut me in a heartbeat if there were layoffs. 

So do I owe them any loyalty if I know that if shit hit the fan, they would show me none? Am I in the wrong for leaving now and pursuing this great opportunity?

tl;dr I am leaving my job at a time that would be screwing my team due to lack of resources. Is this the wrong thing to do?",Neocarnage,32,0.8799999952316284,37,1722701123,2024-08-03 16:05:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ej6we0/am_i_wrong_to_leave_at_a_terrible_time_for_my_team/,8,2024
1ej6pa9,My Boss Is Forcing Me Into a Role I Don‚Äôt Want (IT Related) - Need Advice!,"I really need some advice about my career. I started out as a pharmacist but switched to programming and joined a web development bootcamp..
I landed an internship at one of the Big 4 companies in software development, but I‚Äôve always been more into data analysis and data engineering. I finally found a company offering an internship for a Data Engineer position. They trained me for a month on Power BI, but for the next two months, I was doing web development.. I told them about my concerns, but they reassured me that after the internship, I‚Äôd work on data. Also, in the interview, my manager offered me a development job, but I refused because I wanted to focus on data.

I finished the internship and signed a contract as a Data Engineer. But now, my manager wants to move me to the web department. I told him I‚Äôm not into web development, especially front end, but he said their projects are data-focused and I‚Äôd learn a lot. So, they put me in web, and now I‚Äôm supposed to learn .NET, which I really don‚Äôt want to do!!! 

I‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôve been looking for other jobs but haven‚Äôt found anything yet, and I‚Äôm not happy in my current role. Should I talk to my manager again? I‚Äôm afraid if I ask him, he might fire me and I‚Äôd lose my job, especially since I‚Äôm still in my probation period. Is this a stupid idea? I really hate my job right now. 

For context, I have Microsoft certifications in AZ-900 ,PL-300, and DP-900,and I‚Äôve worked on small projects related to data, so I do know my stuff when it comes to data.

1ej6fmy,Is this normal company behaviour or am I being taken advantage of,"I have been working for a county utility company for a year now doing various blue collar related work and while the benefits are great I'm starting to get sick of how the company treats our department. Our departments gets paid the same amout on a pay scale as another department in the company while already doing their work while having to learn and do 5x the work that is way more technical, involves a lot more learning, driving, and dealing with risks they other departments don't have to deal with.The head manager of our department yesterday had a meeting with our department and thanked our department for getting the company caught up while being short on two positions that the company hasn't filled. He then admitted that my company acknowledges and has the evidence to show that our department does way much work than other departments and derserves to be paid more but then admitted that it was up to the higher up manager. This issue of our department not being paid enough in comparison to other departments has been going on since the company started and whenever someone tried changing it, the company would immediately shut it down. After telling us this disheartening news, he then told us that our department would have to learn to do additional things that other departments wouldn't have to do. After telling us all that he proceeded to tell us about a project for our department that would involve even more learning and starting jokingly ask different people if they wanted to volunteer. As you could imagine, many people were not excited after what he told us and were just fakingly going along with it.  The thing that's more concerning is since I got off probabation after being a year with the company my manager during my review told me that the company  wants me to learn the job duties of a higher up role while my job title wont change and therfore my pay will be the same.  I'm assuming this is what is going happen since this is what happened to my younger co-workers that have been with the company for a little bit longer than me.

1ej6a6v,Do I choose money or training?,"I am 21, I just moved to practice (in accounting) to study my chartered qualification. I have been there about 6 months, after not being satisfied with the quality of staff, management, quality checks, training, business growth prospects and pay. I decided to look for a new job, where I could do more due diligence into the company. I was pretty quickly offered a new position. Salary to go from 24k to 25k, better training, salaries regularly reviewed as training progresses, higher standards, better employee benefits and flexibility, bigger office with more experienced and qualified people to learn from. 

So I handed in my notice, and pretty instantly the boss man was like we will pay you 28k (I told them that was the other companies offer), restructure job so I can choose what I want to do and drop anything I don't want to do. Gain experience in another firm they own nearby which offers more services and from a training perspective do 6 months do each type of work of my choosing to develop. Although this doesn't take away big list of things of what is fundamentally wrong with the company and why I don't believe in its success. This is also just there initial offer, I am pretty sure I can get at least 32k + additional paid study leave on top of what I already receive. I have prepared a list of reasons why I also feel this cheap and boss man is not very assertive and a bit of a pushover.

My dilemma now is essentially, better training and work environment or being overpaid which I can hoping I can use to get myself on the property ladder earlier than I had planned.

To add to this, the current job is also a top 20 firm (not by building a quality company but M&As funded by PE) which will look better on my CV and the new job is bigger office with a local company that is growing at a decent pace and while may not look as good on CV it will make me output work to a higher standard.

1ej5xda,"My manager complains that I don't rely on them that often to other associates, how to handle?","Hello,

I have a district manager that manages about 10 stores in a district. I manage a store where everything runs smoothly and I hardly ever need to escalate an issue past store level. My store is one of the highest performing and rated stores in the district.

My district manager is going around complaining to everyone that I don't rely on them, that I don't reach out when I need something, and they take that in a way that I'm going around them.

The thing is when I really need something from my district manager, I'll reach out and send several emails, or bring something up in person. Then nothing ever gets done. They may message me a couple of months later and say ""Hey we took care of that right?"". My district manager is not proactive and will mention that ""you shouldn't wait til last minute when you need something"" or how I didn't ""keep them in the loop"". This is all despite several emails and conversations in person.

I've taken to figuring things out on my own for the most part. I can handle almost any issue and get it done in a timely manner.

How do I play the game, to get my district manager to saying these things about me and to stop thinking that I don't rely on them? I'm not looking to get a target on my back or be eventually thrown under the bus.

Thanks

It's an unrealistic target to complete the whole year's syllabus by November if you start in July 
I will be paid an ammount per lecture but they have not been clear about when the payment will come..like per month per week..or after 10 classes or something..
The major problem is ki they only recently sent me the offer letter which said that they have the right to use my content even for their future courses. And as syllabus doesn't change in years they can practically use my content for 10s of years. as I'm doing the recording the classes on their platform (whose name is Graphy, same as Unacademy)

I'm afraid that they can remove my access to my videos , I also want them to keep paying me a royalty or an ammount for my content if they use it in the future.
Now these people are like a bunch of young entrepreneurs , engineering dropouts, with like no chain of command or professional rules.. they don't even have the communication skills of being say polite..I feel this more because in schools where I've worked previously it's all so proper.

1ej3ysu,"Quit my recent job I got hired for, unfairly. ","Hi everyone, I need a space to vent and get some advice / support. I know the job market is trash right now- so I tried really hard to not quit my new job. It took me a year and a half to find this since my last and this is my first full time job and it‚Äôs actually something I‚Äôm great at and enjoy with a big company. 

I have only been there 2 months though and I had the hardest time. The main issue was the massive language barrier in which they knew from the beginning I was not fluent in my 2nd language as English is my native tongue. Despite this, they put me on the side of the company with only speaking said language and not the English speaking side when they very much could have. They also misrepresented themselves in my offer letter (the brand I got put into is a sub brand but I was not made aware I‚Äôd be placed where I did). So I didn‚Äôt understand any meetings, we struggled to communicate in English, I couldn‚Äôt get close to the team etc. 

My manager was massively micromanaging everything I was doing even though I am still in my intro period, would sigh so heavily if I‚Äôd make a mistake / complain why I didn‚Äôt do this or that. None of team members could speak English fluent either and they would hate if I asked them for help (you could tell they were annoyed). 

One in particular told me 1/1 I don‚Äôt do a good job, need to show more effort and that there are plenty of others who speak English here and can do a better job than me. He even went as far to say if someone gets fired it will be me and it‚Äôs not even worth putting the company on my resume should I quit earlier (mind you he is approaching 40 and we have the same exact job, same level). Which I don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôd say that.. the higher up manager definitely took a liking to me, and he could‚Äôve felt jealous seeing that as he only started a month or 2 before me and didn‚Äôt get the same treatment. And the team very clearly needed me to help with their English needs, even though that wasn‚Äôt my main task. He even would tease me about other things and ask very invasive questions. 

With all that being said, the convo to quit was taken well by my managers, but they would not even give me the option to transfer to a more English speaking team- which was the main reason for quitting and I feel so defeated by that and done wrong. It‚Äôs my first full time job and in corporate. The job was great, but the environment was terrible, I‚Äôm glad I quit but now I‚Äôm jobless again and afraid how long it‚Äôll take me to find the next. Would love some feedback / support. 

Ps. I‚Äôm looking for social media /pr management related jobs or editing jobs- if anyone knows of anywhere I should be looking like certain websites, please let me know!

1ej2hps,My current employer is quietly laying off people. Is it time for me to change jobs?,"I work for a large consulting and professional services firm (about 35K employees), most of our revenue comes from contracts for our clients that are staffed by consultants performing billable work.

I've been at this role for 1 year.

A teammate on my project was laid off all of a sudden (in a similar position to myself), even though the project was funded for at least another year. I strongly suspect that this is related to an announcement by the CEO. While there aren't large layoffs yet, but if I read in between the lines of the CEO's announcement, I'm concerned that I could also be laid off, I'm especially vulnerable because I'm not on billable work, I suspect they might be trimming the internal non-billable positions.

I've tried to use my company's internal staffing tools to try and find billable work, but I haven't had much success.

1ej1lnw,Australian Student in Niche Photometric Testing Role‚ÄîHow Much Should I Get Paid and Is This Career Path Viable?,"tl/dr: What should I get paid for working only in photometric testing as an Australian tertiary student? I currently get paid 24ud an hour.

Hi everyone,

I used to work as a factory hand during my gap year for a local Australian LED manufacturer. I was then transferred to work with the R&D team. My job was to learn the basics of how to create IES and LDT files by testing the luminaires and using their photometric reports as a basis for the file creation.

After learning the above I was basically left alone to produce these two file types and send it over to anyone who asks for it - particularly overseas customers.

I continued learning new software beginning with: Photometric Toolbox, Dialux evo, the softwares to operate the goniophotometer and spectroradiometer+integrating sphere, as well as editing the files on notepad++ to fix naming and conversion errors. I later began using: Photometric Power Tools for bulk editing/calculations and a basic Macro Recorder to automate some of the production steps.

Since I began working as a factory hand during my gap year in 2023 my pay has remained consistent with my former role (around 24aud per hour.) My first question is: How can I figure out the value for my role? The company is happy to negotiate with me.

One thing to note is that I'm the only one who can do this job for the manufacturer. When I took a hiatus to study the lab becomes empty - except for 3D printing. My role is not core to business functions but it helps both the R&D team in product development as well as overseas lighting designers for their models.

Final question; is this role far too niche for me to continue working in, even part time? I see few people online who work in photometry and all of them have bachelors or masters and it makes me feel like I'm not meant to be working as one who just entered tertiary education. Basically, what is meant to be the normal trajectory for this role in training and education and can it be a viable role by itself or is it usually paired with other roles in R&D?

I'm very new to work in general so I'd love ANY response, not just from those experienced in photometry (they are few and far in between, especially in Australia.)

Edit: I've posted this same question elsewhere and sometimes I got negative responses. I'm not sure why but forgive my tone if it comes off as highfalutin or naive. I love this role and I perform well in it - I just need to understand its value.",Good-Measurement-614,2,1.0,0,1722686207,2024-08-03 11:56:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ej1lnw/australian_student_in_niche_photometric_testing/,8,2024

1eizcxy,Notify my network that I am no longer working with someone? ,"In a quandry. Notify or not notify the venues and events?

I have my own small business. In a simplified way, I provide musical and creative performers to events. Most of the performers are ones I work with direct. I contact ""Band X"" (or ""Band X"" contacts me and asks to be placed) place them with ""Event Z."" 

Sometimes an outside road manager/agent, Mr. P, may contact me and ask ""Can you place one of my bands, ""Band Y"" and ""Band B"" in some events?"" Sure. \*Mr. P is not the bands actual manager, but operates as a sort of link or agent to find them gigs.

Usually, I communicate directly with the bands to give them information on venue, equipment, answer questions, let them know what promo expectations are, timetables, etc. I am also able to get their assets of sample video, promo pics, stage plot, etc for venue or event. 

In the case of Mr. P bands, he is supposed to get the correct assets and give them to me. He is supposed to pass along the promo expectations, etc to band so they fulfill. 

Unfortunately, Mr. P has trouble paying any charges he has for special services - Paypal open, then closed. Then uses ex gf's Paypal, then can only use cash... Mr. P has trouble getting correctly formatted assets or passing them to me in timely fashion. Mr. P does not inform bands of their promo expectations or other information that could be helpful for their success. (It is worse than this, but time is limited.) 

I have tried to communicate to Mr. P that current, correctly formatted assets are needed and needed on-time, not late. I've informed Mr. P that any payments to me should be paid on-time, and via bank transfer. Not 1-4 months late via his cousins Paypal or in cash 6 months late. I've informed Mr. P that venues and events have requested bands do minimal promo, show up punctually, etc. I told Mr. P that if the issues are not resolved, I can't work with him. 

Mr. P seems to have issues following these things. I'm going to notify Mr. P that I will no longer work with him. Mr. P has already, before this, been contacting the venues and events directly, saying he wants to work directly with them. He is also contacting bands I work with that he does NOT work with, and telling them he is going to collab with the events and they should use him, not me. (He has said worse than this, but again, space limited.) The ones he has contacted have declined - they do not want to work directly with him. 

As I am sending Mr. P a letter to end the business relationship, should I send a general notice to my networks and tell them ""I am no longer working with Mr. P due to several business related concerns. He may contact you directly, and while it is your choice to work with him or not, I can not recommend him."" 

I want to notify my network, as it is some members of my network that have told me of the shenanigans, but I want to come across professional, not a whiner. 

I often see in my industry (entertainment, music) big public notices on social media. ""Due to x, y, z, we are no longer collaborating with ABC,"" however I don't feel right about doing a big online post.

My current job has been getting worse month by month due to being understaffed and a big project going on.

So, the question I‚Äôve been going back and forth on is if I should even apply to this other job. I know everyone typically recommends to keep job applications on the down low from your current employers, but I just feel like I‚Äôm being sneaky and backstabbing if I do that. My boss is a friend (I know, red flag) so I‚Äôm nervous she will feel backstabbed and angry if I go behind her back to do this. She‚Äôs told me about another job opening before so I know she is open for me to grow and thrive, but everyone keeps recommending I don‚Äôt say anything.

I also feel overall guilt if I leave my team to be even more understaffed. Or if the group I am leaving will be angry and feel betrayed, which might prevent me from ever returning years later if something opens up again. Plus, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going from one company to a totally different one..I will still be in the same building with these people, just a different department. 

HOWEVER, people usually say to not say anything until you even get a job offer. Why shake the entire boat if you don‚Äôt even get the job? So I can see why it would be good to stay quiet.

Need your advice guys. Before I get into it, here's a bit about my career. I work as a social media and influencer marketer. This is my second full-time job, and I have a total of 3 years of experience in this field. When I joined my current company, there was no social media person, and even when they did hire someone, they only stayed for 2 to 3 months. I decided to stay in this job because my manager provided me with a lot of opportunities for growth and also listened to my feedback. I have been with this company for 1 year and 3 months now.

I asked for a raise and was only given a 25% increase. While some may think that a 25% raise is good for someone early in their career, my initial salary was very low, so a 25% raise doesn't make a significant difference. I have a colleague who handles the paid side of marketing, and when he completed 1 year, he got a 50% raise. To be honest, I believe I work more than him. Even my manager acknowledged that I deserved a better raise. However, my manager is not the final decision maker, the director is.

1eivgfc,"Everyone‚Äôs quitting at my job, now I want to quit.","Hey guys, using text to speech on this one so I apologize if there‚Äôs any typos, I recently picked up a second job to help pay bills and get out of some debt that I‚Äôve been struggling with. When I first got hired everything seemed OK but one by one within less than a couple of months time everyone started quitting, and I feel like the majority of the responsibility is slowly falling on me

For context, I got hired as a manager which I have plenty of experiencing, so I was comfortable entering the role at this new organization within a couple of weeks my colleague who trained me was headed out the door, and all of this was communicated, and I was prepared to say the least. But shortly after things started escalating quickly. 

it started out with one of our employees having a feud with another employee, which then led to one of those employees being transferred out. that‚Äôs two men down. then recently someone decided to quit on the spot. I‚Äôm not exactly sure what the issue was but my supervisor seem to have a plan so I wasn‚Äôt too worried, plus we had assistance from other organizations were sort of like a chain finally just today just as we thought help was on the way with a new hire. The new hire did a no call. No show on their first day of training which apparently they were scheduled a week before that did the same thing and the icing on the cake is that same day? My district manager called to tell me that my supervisor is no longer with the company I was delegated to scheduling and to make sure that there were employees to cover for the oncoming dates of this week while I was being stretched to perform not only my normal duties, but the duties of two other employees, admittedly were small organization, but the amount of workload our organization receives has made things bleak. It‚Äôs making me worry about my future with this company

Our current staff are a ragtag team of people who are inflexible and picky when appointed duties and often come up with excuses of‚Ä¶ I pulled my leg muscle so I can‚Äôt work, or, my stomache hurts so I‚Äôm gonna take my sweet ass time, and my fellow colleagues, which I am very sad to say, just aren‚Äôt fully competent for the position. For example, we had a register go out for the whole day, which could‚Äôve helped with a busy crowds, but when I took a look at it the next day, it turned out that the power button was just off. I really don‚Äôt want to sound like a person who is just focusing on the negative, but it‚Äôs hard to see anything positive when everything negative is happening around me I suppose I just need to vent

If you were in a similar situation, would you stay with a company or would you leave?

1eiui1b,"What should I choose when in a severe dilemma between the GATE, CAT, government job, and entrepreneurship?","Hey folks, this is M(23). I recently graduated with a [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) in Electrical Engineering from a Tier-3 Govt.-Aided institute. I am facing a career dilemma.  
  
Despite decent academics, I wasn't selected by any of the 25+ companies I interviewed with, always making it to the final round. I settled for a 5 LPA with 9-5 timings and 2+ hours of daily commune (I had a 8.5 LPA offer from Vedanta but couldn't join due to circumstances), this has affected my confidence, and I'm considering competitive exams for a better package.  
  
I desire PSU job security (I am confident I can rank under 250 in GATE EE, General Category or under 200 in GATE CSE) along with the initial IT package of 30+ LPA to fund my entrepreneurial dreams. However, I am doubtful about taking the CAT exam looking at the admission criteria for a GEM (I scored 97 percentile in CAT' 23) and skeptical about GATE EE due to PSUs' policies against starting a business.

1eiu5yq,I am considering quitting my job after 2 months,"Hello everyone. It is my first time making a post here. I need your advice. I am a foreign national with a US green card. I am 34 years old and I have bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering. When I was doing my master's, I was working in a chemical engineering lab as a research assistant and finished my thesis. Also, I was able to publish 1 first-author journal. After my education, I have about 4 experience in the chemical industry.

In my previous job, I was working and studying PE chemicals at the same time and I passed it this year. I wanted to improve my knowledge of chemical engineering wishing that I could do more design-related work in the future. about 3 months ago, I got a call from a recruiter and she recommended me a position and I liked the position because it was doing a lot of design work and process engineering work. I thought it was a great opportunity.

I started my job about 2 months ago and I am already quite struggling. My boss is getting a lot of pressure and he is giving me a lot of pressure with very hard deadlines. For 2 months, I was working overtime every day for working or studying to finish my projects. Even on the weekends, I am either working or studying as well. There were days that I was leaving after 9 PM and I come to work at 8 AM every day. Now I am building a pilot reactor on my own (I need to design everything) and he is putting me under a lot of pressure with hard deadlines. And nobody is really helping me. I do not think the work condition will be improved in the future as well. My boss and my coworker seem to be working very long hours as well.

For these reasons, I am considering quitting. Do you think it is a bad idea? Should I just push forward working and studying long hours no matter what for like at least 1 year? What would be the best choice for my career? How's the job market right now? If I quit now, I am thinking of just not including this experience on my resume. Explaining the gap period with some good reasons.

I've been looking for help with my resume and I've been stuck  on that. Most of the jobs listed wanted experience or don't want to train or even fake ads. I also thought of just a temp agency but I was told its more than meets the eye and they want folks who already have some experience.

1eirqud,"I don't know what to do with my life, I need some help.","Okay idk if this is the right sub to be posting this on but here it goes.

I'm 18 I just graduated high school and well my grades were not as great as I expected them to be hence led me to being rejected from my dream school UCL.

So I have a few options but they all lead me to different career paths. TBH idk what I want to do or be in terms of career, I have so many interests but I also lack a lot of skills. I just want some advice now. In no particular order.

1. I got an offer from KCL for global health where I can do 3 different streams. 

The thing is job prospects after this degree are very bleak. I will mostly have to do a masters in either finance, law or pharmacy after this. Even after masters pay won't be great. An alternative option is to medicine after this course. I have been interested in medicine but always hated the lifestyle of medicine I don't think I can handle the pressure but I also don't know. 

This course is only 3 years so I can save time and money. KCL is a great school and being in London the location is pretty good but due to the recession, I might suffer with the cost of living and jobs. 

  
2. I've applied for a foundation year at kcl for engineering and maths but haven't got in yet. (i feel like i might  get in but idk)

I recently only found out I love the jobs related to engineering not only cause of the pay but also the versitility of it and the impact it can make. I've always been intrested in sustainability and medicine and by doing chemical engineering or biomedical engineering I could probably persue my intrest. The hours, work load and pay is rly good but I suck at math like sooo bad. I have liked the idea of engineering but since I was shitty at math my teachers told me not to do physics/chem in high school. So I currently have no foundation in chem/physics or math that is required for UK engineering. The pro of this is I have 90% guaranteed admission into KCL for biomedical engineering and also have a chance of reapplying to UCL. But like I said before I suck at math and haven't done it in a while so I'm scared about how I will cope and don't want to waste a year. 

3. Go to Australia for biotechnology 

I got into a great school in australia UNSW for biotechnology it is 4 years but I'm scared that I wouldn't like it there. Just going through their reddit page scares me everyone says it's hard in terms of academics and also social life and finding friends. From what ive heard UNSW is not that recognised as much as kcl or ucl and jobs might be hard abroad. IDK where i want to work so i'm just so unsure. UNSW also has a lot of options for study abroad which i love as it was initially a dream of mine to study in the states but i was rejected from most schools i wanted to go and got into the schools which was tooo expensive and just wasn't worth the investment. Also people have transfered to us unis from unsw which is nice as it's impossible to transfer from the uk to the us. 



  
also this is just a big rant sorry if i sound ungrateful i am i just dont want to make the wrong decison and i want a 3rd party to weigh in on this cause everyone ik is giving differing opinions so yes please send help.

1eiridh,Anybody feel like working a traditional 9-5 career is a means to an end?,"Hi, I am a 38 year old software developer making $145k per year in New York. I have good work life balance and a pleasant work environment so I realize I am very fortunate and since my salary is considered well above average for a working professional I know I have little to complain about. However I can't help but shake this feeling that I am never really going to achieve any significant level of wealth beyond living relatively comfortably...at best. 145k in 2024 is not what it was 10 years ago and while I hope to make more money in future I don't see myself ever getting in to those very high salaries over 200k. So living in an expensive part of the country where real estate is absurdly high I don't see much opportunity. However on paper I am ""doing well"". I feel like to ""make it"" these days you need to be an entrepreneur or work in an industry where you can make several hundred thousands of dollars per year. So you basically need to be exceptional. I am not exceptional..I consider myself average at my job and don't love it enough to become exceptional. I was exceptional at a former career but it was extremely difficult to even make 6 figures in this so I pivoted to tech around the pandemic. Anyway just wanted to share my thoughts.

I'm 16 year old, I know it's way too early but i like to have my life planned out in advance and in 2 years 
I'll have too choose what degree I should get so I have to start thinking about it now.

I've wanted to be a game developer ever since my childhood but the more I think about it the more I'm lost.
I don't want to work in AAA because of way too many reasons (crunch. Not enough creative control and a lot more) 
I really think that corporate culture is not for me so if I can avoid it it would be better.
I also think that starting out as a indie game dev with no savings is a really bad idea so yeah I have to forget about that. 
As for mid size studios I think that they have many of the same problems as AAA so I don't know if I'd like it or not.
I also can't be a solo game dev because the only thing I can do is programing. 

I'm a big fan of Alan resnick's work (and args and unfiction in general) . Mainly unedited footage of a bear, this house has people in it and Alan tutorial and I would love to be working on stuff like what he does. 
But again the only thing I'm good at is programing.
 
In summary: I would like to find a programing job that makes me able to use my creativity.

1eio7nw,Can I give my leadership an ultimatum? ,"I‚Äôve been a high performer since I‚Äôve gotten to my company and am recognized as an integral part of my team. Earlier this year, my boss left, and immediately (I didn‚Äôt ask or anything) my leadership gave me a large retention bonus because they were afraid I‚Äôd leave and they know they need me. Unfortunately, my new boss is awful. She has no respect for me, the team, or our stakeholders and she burdens me with having to babysit her to follow through on what she‚Äôs supposed to be doing. After almost a year, I‚Äôm done with it. 

Early on, my leadership and HR was involved because she was pressuring me to quit, was offending the team and stakeholders in an egregious way, and multiple colleagues told HR she was bullying me. Of course, nothing came of it and she still works here. In the past few weeks things have been better but I‚Äôm reluctant to just continue to work for such an awful woman who is still making my job difficult. 

All this to say, I‚Äôve been looking for jobs. I think I‚Äôm about to get an offer. I don‚Äôt want to leave this company because I like everyone else, and I‚Äôm valued here, but I can‚Äôt stand working for this woman. Coincidentally, my boss now has a new boss who knows me from a previous company and likes me. The other team leaders told him what had been happening to me under this woman, so he asked me how things were. I don‚Äôt know him super well, and I was caught off guard, so I said things were better than they had been (which is true but the scale is skewed!). 

If I get this offer, do I just quit or do I go to my boss‚Äô boss and give him a polite ultimatum‚Äîthat I can‚Äôt stand to work for her anymore and I have to leave unless they can have me report into someone else/work with someone else. I‚Äôd not even ask for more money or a higher title! 

The challenge is, we have the same stakeholders and I don‚Äôt want to work with her anymore period, and I think the only way that would be possible is if they fired her. HR has records from multiple people complaining about her and leadership on my team has heard even more about problems with her. But is it even possible to fire someone because someone said it‚Äôs her or them? 

Good news is I‚Äôd rather leave than keep working for her so if it didn‚Äôt work, that‚Äôs fine. I just hate to leave just because of her and I know my leadership will be disappointed when I leave.

1ein4uz,Tips for working with a difficult/competitive coworker? ,"
My company created a new position and I was selected along with an equal counterpart who was let go after a year. His role was back filled by another worker a few years older than me. Our limited interactions in the past had been seemingly pleasant. Since we‚Äôve been partners I‚Äôve noticed he‚Äôs the butt of the jokes with men but tries to assert his dominance with me (F). After working with him for a year, he‚Äôs become increasingly difficult to work with. He is visibly uncomfortable when I receive a compliment and since has seemed to be in competition with me. He has been trying to take all of the high visibility work for himself. I‚Äôve drafted emails for us that he has completely re-written (and then apologized about how bad it looked but continued to do it again). His writing style sucks and everything he does just comes across as pretentious and more concerned about how he looks than the quality of the actual work.. which unfortunately is representative of our team.

Have you worked with someone like this and how do you deal with them? I feel like he may be in competition with me and he‚Äôs been going out of his way to out-do me (on imo insignificant things). He mentioned having OCD, not sure if that plays into it. My concern is this progressing.  My boss is part of the issue, he‚Äôs not one to provide warmth or positive feedback and he‚Äôs close to retiring (doesn‚Äôt give a shit). If I bring anything up to him he gets bothered and doesn‚Äôt care to hear me out so I to just leave it alone and have accepted I can‚Äôt look to him for guidance or professional advice. There‚Äôs been a lot of changes in my company and the morale has shifted to a highly competitive/dog eat dog one. Any advice is appreciated!

1ein31m,Bad communication with recruiter,"Hi everyone,

I need advice regarding a situation my partner is in. She applied for an IT-traineeship via LinkedIn and got an enthousiastic response initially about her profile, and that the company wants to have a phone interview. 

The company called on the same day after a meeting was agreed. The interview was very positive and the recruiter said she was a good match. He then said he will send her some videos explaining the job and tasks so she could make sure it is something she's interested in because it's a traineeship and they are investing in people. The recruiter stated that the company wants to make sure my partner would like it so she doesn't realize after a couple of weeks that it's not something she wants to do. 

The recruiter promised to call in two days to see what she thinks, so they could plan a meeting in the office with other staff members and ex trainees. The first planned meeting had to be rescheduled due to some inconveniences on her end. Then the second time the recruiter missed the meeting and didn't call so she sent him a message after two hours had passed to confirm whether she's still being called today or whether they should reschedule. He apologized and explained that he couldn't call due to some techincal difficulties. He also promised to call the next dady, but he didn't.

The question is; how could she respond in a friendly way, but also in an urgent manner so the recruiter calls her back? It's highly unlikely that the recruiter didn't select her as he was very enthousiastic.

1eilb3v,Seeking Guidance: Navigating Career Challenges and Big Decisions Abroad.,"I need some advice because I'm really unsure what to do. I moved here (couple years ago) for a promotion in the same holding group, but in a different location (I'm foreign). I had two bosses‚Äîone in the U.S. and another in Asia where the headquarters is. Both of them liked me, and everything was fine. Then my U.S. boss relocated to Australia, and I took over his job. My boss in Asia was supportive. 

However, a couple months ago, my former boss (who was living in Australia) requested to come back to the U.S. for family reasons. My boss in Asia, who is very close to him, and also facing there was not chances to give any job in any other area, created another role above me, effectively downgrading me. He offered me the option to leave unless I wanted to stay. There were no changes to my salary or compensation, but I wanted to quit. 

Unfortunately, the market conditions are awful, and I've had no luck finding another job (I have applied for 100 roles). 

I've been doing my job for a couple of months now, but I feel super weird about the situation. I'm no longer invited to meetings, have no contact with the CEO, and don't travel anymore. I'm considering going back to my home country, but I'm also close to applying for citizenship at the end of the year. I want to pass the bar exam since I'm qualified for that and see if it opens up better opportunities. Right now, I'm staying mainly because of my kids and wife. I feel totally vulnerable at this point and don't know what to do.

Any advice is more than welcome.

1eil33l,100% remote or significant salary difference? ,"Hello all

I received two job offers that are quite similar in terms of responsibilities. The main difference is that job A allows 100% remote work, while job B offers an additional 6,000 euros gross annually (my rent is about 800euros per month to give you an idea) but requires commuting without the option for remote work, with a 1.5-hour round-trip commute.

I have never worked 100% remotely, nor have I needed to commute for such a long time before, and I'm having trouble understanding the impact of both scenarios.

Could you share your experiences with 100% remote work and whether it bothered you a lot to spend a significant amount of time commuting to work?

1eiiznh,Corporate Burnout - Depression,"I am an immigrant in the US working on H1B visa and have been for 7 years after studying here. During the second year of the pandemic I may have fallen into depression; I say may because I wasn't aware of the signs and convinced myself I was just lazy. Later, when things didn't improve I had some sessions of counselling with no success. After moving here I have been noticing a steady decline in my mental health and it has reached a point where I find it difficult to work with focus and drive. The academically and otherwise driven student/person in me has died and absolutely nothing makes sense anymore to me. I have zero interest in even waking up everyday. 



When it got to a point where I realized I need help I started therapy again. It has been a few sessions and my therapist suggested that I am going through a burnout and it could lead to a breakdown sooner or later if I don't take a break from this country and work. It wasn't something that I hadn't thought of. I had been pushing that plan aside considering the general situation of the job market here and the possibility of losing my job if I stay away from here for long, especially since I am not a citizen of this country. My boss is a considerate man and had supported me when I wanted to take a few days off to stabilize my mental health due to the mini breakdown I had, pre-therapy. 

  
Any opinions on taking short term disability leave and going away for at least a month? Has anyone done that before with zero consequences? Or is there any other way I can be better? Can I actually afford to treat myself to this break without the imminent danger of losing my job and my place in my team? I work in one of the top design consulting firms in the word.

1eifwcb,Interview in a remote resource town - how do i negotiate for risks of moving there?,"Hey all,

I am an accountant with an upcoming in-person interview in a resource town far north in BC, Canada. I like the company, I think it'll probably be a great move for me (always wanted to live in a small town because i generally hate the vancouver area), but there's a certain risk that can occur in these types of communities that won't occur elsewhere.

With these one-trick pony resource towns, generally the town is 1/3 - 1/2 employed by one company, that given market or other external conditions could pull up stakes at any particular time. The rest of the people generally work in services selling to the people who work in this 'company town' (i.e. there'll be an A&W or something)

The issue is, I have a home here in the Vancouver area, and if i sell it to buy a place up there, there's a risk that should said big resource company pull out, the property will be severely devalued because the town would half-die in the process.

Has anyone here negotiated for any sort of severance that contains any guarantee on the property value of a home or other risks related to moving? While renting is an option there, it's not an attractive option for sure.

1eidw41,Should I quit my job?,"I've been with this company for close to 6 years. I started when it had less than 10 employees. I have one of the most important roles at the company, outside of the CEO. I've been able to generate the company millions over the years and contribute to much of its insane grown. Literally this year alone I have generated $12 million.

In the beginning it was amazing as I was enjoying the journey but as the company got bigger my boss became more and more of A-hole. Many people have came and went and all say the same thing about the amount of lies and bullshit my boss does. Though my pay has gone up substantially since we started, I am still making over $100K less per year of similar people in the industry. My boss constantly expects more results and even when it seems impossible I always deliver. I was given a small percentage of the company and every year he has a new business idea that the profit have to go towards.

I recently discovered that all of our additional businesses under our umbrella are not included in my equity agreement because they were put under separate LLC's. This has me absolutely pissed as I put in some much work, all of for someone to be able to decide they don't want give me a piece of the entire pie I helped bake. 

 I know the day I leave, this entire company will begin to crumble. I could care less about him and more about our 50+ employees between all the businesses that would be effected by this.

  
if I leave tomorrow and go out on my own I would make life changing money based on the connections I have created over the years and the current offers on the table. Do I have a conversation and see if he is willing to increase compensation? or do I just throw in the towel ?

1eidkev,Need advice!,"

This may be a long one but just need some advice‚Ä¶

I started working for my company ~5 years ago in January 2020. I started with one role department A and then received a promotion within the same department in 2023. I loved the department and what I was doing, had great colleagues and great bosses and really felt like I was doing well and making a difference, felt valued etc. 

Then I received an offer (for a lateral move)  from a different internal department doing similar type of work but in a completely different side of the business, in a more global setting. I really went back and forth on this for a LONG time and was really unsure what I should do, but ultimately decided to take the plunge and try it out. Since this is a large global company I work for, I thought it would be good to diversify my skills and learn new things to keep adding to my resume. 

Now I‚Äôm six months into this new role and really just not clicking with it. It was sold differently in the interviews, the environment is more toxic and political and I feel as though my best skills really aren‚Äôt being utilized. 

Fast forward to this week, my old boss reaches out to me and advises me that there is a lead position coming to my old department to be posted next week and they would love for me to apply and to have me back if I would want to do so - which is great news right? But I just feel really stuck! I feel terrible that it‚Äôs only been 6 months so I can‚Äôt imagine what my new team would feel after all the training and I can‚Äôt imagine that my new boss would be impressed that I‚Äôm wanting to go back to my old team. I also don‚Äôt know how that would look to everyone - would they think I was regressing? Is it really unprofessional of me? (I know I shouldn‚Äôt worry about what others think, I‚Äôm just more scared of burning bridges..)

My company does not have any rules or restrictions about when you can apply for internal positions so no worries on that front, the managers just have to come to a mutual agreement. 

Has anyone been in a situation like this before!? Can anyone offer advice!? I need help lol! ",ollie20202,1,1.0,0,1722613963,2024-08-02 15:52:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eidkev/need_advice/,8,2024

1eid88i,Wildlife jobs?,"I'm a 22yo brazilian/portuguese girl graduated in Animation Design who recently moved to Dublin and is working full time as a hotel waitress. One thing I found out during college is, even if I've always loved drawing, it does NOT work as a job for me. I hate animating, I hate drawing because I have to, I hate Adobe so much. It simply does not work.
It was hard coming to this conclusion because if not this, then what the hell am I supposed to do with my life? Working as a waitress is ok, but definitely not something I want as a career. The only thing I've ever seen myself as talented was drawing. However, the more I think about career, the more I end up with the same feeling of ""I want to be close to animals"".
Maybe my dream job would be a zookeeper, or a park ranger, or something like that. Honestly I have no idea. I just know that I love animals, always have, and the idea of working with research, field work and wildlife is very appealing to me.
But how to be sure? I'll probably need another graduation course, and I really can't invest much time and money into it unless I'm sure that it'll pay off later. I'm searching for voluntary work with animals but it seems that it's not that common.
Also those kind of jobs usually don't have high salaries, right? I've seen the average pay of a park ranger in Ireland is ‚Ç¨21/h, which is better than a waitress, but not super high.
What do you guys think I should do? I don't know where to start, neither where to go. Advices would be very helpful right now :/",revekawn,1,1.0,0,1722613147,2024-08-02 15:39:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eid88i/wildlife_jobs/,8,2024

Grades: Average
Age: 23 (turning 24 in 2 months)
Gender: Female

I was forced to study Psychology and, as a result, I don't have a passion for it and don‚Äôt want to pursue a career in this field. I really want to move away from India and start a new chapter in my life. However, I don't plan on studying further or working in the field of psychology. I‚Äôm open to different job opportunities and industries.
Switching careers is not an option for me right now because I‚Äôm broke and still living with my parents, who currently pay for everything. Given my background, what steps should I take to secure a job abroad? Are there specific resources, websites, or networks that could help me in this process?

1eibaad,Would you drive 6hours for an in-person interview or ask for a virtual one? ,"Interviewing with a big company for my dream job. The recruiter told me they will hand me over to the team manager, and asked me whether I prefer to do the subsequent interviews virtually. I said yes, because I live 6 hours drive from company's office. 

Later, I hear back from the manager inviting for an in-person interview. I've only done the online assessment and the interview with the recruiter, so I believe this would be a technical interview. So the job isn't guaranteed yet. Plus, I don't think I'll have the mood or energy to do an expectantly difficult technical interview after waking up at 5-6am and riding for 6hours.  

What would you do in this situation? Would you go to the in-person interview or ask for a virtual one, and how would I justify asking for a virtual interview?

1eiaa7r,What should I do about my manager committing time theft?,"So, I am a team of two in my office comprised of myself and my manager. Directly above my manager is the HR director. 

When I started, I noticed my manager often came in 1-2 hours late and took many days off, but I figured they had the vacation hours. Recently it's gotten much worse with my manager coming in 2 hours late, taking 2 hours for lunch, and leaving an hour early just about every other day now.

The HR director moved to a different branch location and can no longer see in-person when my manager leaves, so this is why it's been getting worse.

My manager does this under the guise that they will pick up the hours they missed at night from home, yet I can see from their Teams status that they never get back online after they leave the office at 3:30pm.

I would hate to be a direct snitch or tattletale about this, but it's effecting me now. My manager has admin access for many of the features I use in our softwares and I need my manager to approve email codes in order for me to work on certain things. It's hard to ask questions like that when my manager is never there or available. My manager also typically just hands THEIR projects to me the day before they are due and asks me to complete them when I am drowning in my own work. And as of late, my manager has told the HR director that it was all their hard work, when I can hear this and know it is me doing 80% of all of their work. I am getting zero credit. But maybe that's how corporate usually is? 

I don't have proof or anything that this person is committing time fraud, but there is simply no way they have the vacation hours or sick hours to cover this. They are awful with technology and not aware their Teams status shows how long they were away either. 

But how do I go about this tastefully? Since we're a team of two, I feel like it's going to be obvious if I outright snitch. At a minimum I think I should bring up to my manager's boss that the workload this person gives me hours before their deadlines isn't conducive for me.

Thanks, any advice on what to do is appreciated.

1ei8ymr,Do you pick roles that challenge you more or you‚Äôre more comfortable in / excel at? ,"
I [30F] recently received two offers for internal product positions at my company (outlined below) and ended up taking the first. I felt like I was heavily influenced by my team because they were more familiar with that team and also have worked with that team in their previous roles. They also claimed I would supposedly grow a lot in that role but I don‚Äôt know if this is based off of biases 

Part of my reasoning also was because I knew I definitely would be challenged more in this role. However now I‚Äôm getting a little anxious knowing that this would be new territory for me and that my hiring manager is also virtual to me. I know there‚Äôs no going back but I can‚Äôt help but wonder why I also didn‚Äôt take the second knowing that the team culture and leaders would be great.

Wondering what others take into consideration when they search for their next opportunity?

Also does it look bad if I wanted to reapply to that team again later on (at my company they encourage internal movement a lot to retain talent)?

For background I‚Äôm a product manager that is more on the GTM side and I wanted to get more technical experience.

1) Front end digital platform product management / development 

Pros: 
- this role is a highly visible role because so many different products operate on this platform so I would really need to understand the hierarchy of how these products are all set up
- the team is very well known in my org 
- both my manager and VP were very well connected to the hiring manager and VP
- I would definitely grow more in terms of owning more requirements and driving features forward 
- there are very tenured people on the team (not older necessarily but they are definitely SMEs)
- same org 

Cons:
- the hiring manager is virtual (to me) and commutes into a different office
- there‚Äôs a 3 hr time difference between me and the hiring manager 
- the team is a little scattered location wise 
- it would be a really big learning curve for me
- it‚Äôs a new role 


2) Digital product operations 

Pros:
- this is a more operational and tactical role and I‚Äôm very familiar with this type of work and know i would naturally be really good at this work 
- I really got along with the hiring manager and VP
- the team is all based at the same location as me 
- the team culture seems great and the team seems to really like the hiring manager 

Cons:
- it seems like there have been some people that have left the team due to pursuing other internal opportunities for more growth 
- it‚Äôs in a completely different org (that being said I was also interested in this org)

This monday the company reopened the role that i initially applied for but my recruiter hasnt told me anything yet.

1ei89p0,corporate life recently,"
I was recently reprimanded for missing a deadline, which left me feeling disheartened. Despite being relatively new to the role, I‚Äôve dedicated myself over the past two years to become proficient at my job. I take pride in my performance and have consistently been a top performer.

My colleagues often joke that I shouldn‚Äôt have worked so hard because it has resulted in an increased workload for me. Initially, I viewed these jokes positively, believing that my hard work would be recognized and validated by our boss.

While I appreciate my colleagues‚Äô praise, what truly matters to me is validation from my boss. This recent reprimand has been particularly difficult because I was hoping my efforts and dedication would be acknowledged, rather than being overshadowed by a single missed deadline.

Now, I‚Äôm contemplating resigning. My supervisor recently received a well-deserved promotion, while I was reprimanded. This has made me feel like I‚Äôm regressing while everyone else is advancing. I admit my fault in missing the deadline, but it feels as if all my hard work has been overlooked. This situation makes me question whether my efforts are truly valued here. I guess i‚Äôll stay until I can find a new job.",Tiny-TigerPaws_5124,1,1.0,0,1722600120,2024-08-02 12:02:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ei89p0/corporate_life_recently/,8,2024
1ei8236,What would be a great double major plan so I can pursue a specific career?,"The ultimate goal is that I want to a film director. But I let life scare me out of it. I been writing stories and studying storytelling since I was 10. I haven‚Äôt pick up a camera yet but I planned to go to school and use that as an advantage because I didn‚Äôt come from wealth, I‚Äôm not born into nepotism and it doesn‚Äôt matter how good I write my stories. If Tim the producer want an A list celebrity son to work for his company before me with less talent, he will choose him.

So, I decided to change my major to either Economics or Finance while doubling a major in film/writing. Meaning I‚Äôll go to school and get a degree in my safety net then network and learn cameras somewhere else in this same field because nobody is going to catch me if I fall. I‚Äôm scared to bet on it.

Or if anyone has any comments of a better suggestion I‚Äôm all ears.

I love my job but I hate this part because I can foresee people leaving due to burnout or annoyance and then whenever people leave it puts our whole team into disarray again and the pattern continues. 

He just wants to fit in as much work for as cheap as possible until something breaks and won‚Äôt stop until it does (which it has a few times) myself and a couple of other senior staff have been warning him but again it comes down to ‚Äúdon‚Äôt see it as a negative thing but a challenge‚Äù.

I recently received an offer to work as a data scientist in the oil and gas industry. By way of background, I'm a registered mechanical engineer who transitioned to data science. I've been working as a data analyst for the past 2.5 years, while also working on data science projects on the side and posting them in my portfolio.

I applied for a data scientist position at a company and passed their exam. The offered position will pay me twice as much as my current data analyst job. However, during the final interview, the boss mentioned that they have high expectations for me.

Given this situation, I'm uncertain whether to take the opportunity now or wait until I feel more confident in my skills. I would love to hear your thoughts and advice on this. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you decide what to do?

1ei6fad,Help me decide between engineering and commerce.,"I kind of already dropped out of engineering but let me explain further, my mental health away from home in a really huge university was fucked up, I took 34 paracetamol pills and hoped it would end, and it sucked and my roomies took me to theh hospital when I was puking a lot and passed out, anyways that's not what I want to talk about.

I hated the subjects and the university and probably the people around me, I am not an introvert but I hate communicating with people unnecessarily. This was probably one of the reasons I held myself back from taking up commerce, my parents talked with me after I went back home and I ended up taking commerce or atleast doing it from home(ACCA).

I realised a lot and I know now that I need to provide for my family as soon as possible,  I can still join the engineering college and go through the subjects again or continue with the commerce course, what's of essence here is whether or not the commerce course will be on par with the engineering course at a really really good university (prefer to not mention it).

I am fine with anything if it pays well, I love tech but the course I took up is ECE and I really hate the course but I am loving the commerce subjects and I love finance too.

Please help me out and I will elaborate if you have any queries in light of helping me out.

1ei1hmk,Leaving Teaching ,"I‚Äôm a teacher in Florida. I make 50K a year.

I work 10-11 hour days (paid for only 7). I also work weekends and summers (for free). 

Why do I work so much outside of work hours? Well, I work at a school for troubled youth. Every little altercation (whether verbal, physical, or online) requires 10+ pages of documentation and witness statements.  This is in addition to lesson planning and grading and just grasping the weird things that Florida wants you to teach. Also, IEPs and other student documentation that is needed on short deadlines. For what it‚Äôs worth, ‚Äútraditional‚Äù schools are just as bad with paperwork and meetings. 

Some may say to set boundaries or learn to say no.  Well, that‚Äôs how you get fired.  What happens when time-sensitive paperwork isn‚Äôt in on time? I get a letter in my file. Then I get flagged as not-renewed. Teachers are on yearly contracts that need to be renewed at the end of each year. 

And yes, we are unionized‚Ä¶ not that it carries much weight in Florida. 

‚ÄúSay no‚Äù just isn‚Äôt possible in this profession.

THE BIG ASK ‚Ä¶ 

What is the best way for me to transition into corporate America? How can I get into Learning and Development? Or curriculum development? Or are there other areas that I can do well in with experience as a teacher. 

Or, are there other better options? How do I supplement my income?

What are some good options that may allow me to continue being a teacher but allow me to consult or engage in remote work? 

Why corporate America? At least get paid for the insane hours I put in and be able to afford a decent vacation. Retire with something in the bank. Yes, the work hours will be extensive, but hopefully the gross income will match the hours.

Why more income? 50K BEFORE taxes is not enough for a single person who also wants to enjoy life (like a road trip to Bucees and the beach or maybe a cheap cruise or buy all the BOOKS to read!) Also, the Disney area is expensive!

1ei15k4,I just need advice ,"I‚Äôve been with my current employer for almost 5 years. It‚Äôs a smaller company where most of those three years it‚Äôs been just three of us with a fourth and or/fifth employee coming and going. It‚Äôs been decent pay, not great, but I‚Äôve progressed well in my career here. I just got a performance bonus equating to a month‚Äôs worth of pay. 

The owner of the company has been known to be unhinged at times screaming and shouting profanities at his employees on occasion when very upset. This behavior has decreased over the years especially as we‚Äôve expanded, however, it still exists.

The boss knows not to direct it towards me because I will just walk away right after without saying a word or just ignore as I believe it‚Äôs not professional behavior or a valid form of work place communication. On occasion, when I feel it is very unjustified, I‚Äôve fought back. Typically, however, I wait for them to calm before approaching them and the concern gets addressed collaboratively.

Today the owner decided to storm into the office I share with a colleague who supports me after lunch. His sentence began with ‚ÄúWhy the FUCK would you‚Äù before transitioning to full on yelling. I stood up for this coworker as I supported their decision, which resulted in me being yelled at for doing so in a manner laced with profanity. The owner then insulted me personally before storming into their office, then leaving for the day. Because of this they forgot to run payroll and notified everyone they would be paid 2 days late. 

At this point, I am done. It took me 15 minutes after to compose myself and ended with me shaking in the bathroom texting family and friends for advice. I so badly wanted to quit on the spot. 

I have nothing lined up and not enough savings to support me through a full on job hunt. I‚Äôm overwhelmed to the point of throwing up after I got home because I realized I can‚Äôt keep working here anymore. 

Just two weeks ago my direct superior, who I love, stormed out and was asked by the boss to take the rest of the week off. They were fully audited while gone, then served with probation papers when they came back citing ‚Äúperformance‚Äù as an issue after the boss compiled a list of whatever he could find that they had recently missed. 

I‚Äôm looking for anyone in a similar situation or any advice on how I handle it. Outside of work, I need a full resume overhaul and don‚Äôt have too much time other than weekends to really search for new jobs.

I feel lost, but know I deserve better.

For over three years, I survived by taking warehouse jobs, doing whatever I could just to get by. Eventually, I learned about my condition and began therapy. Over the next three years, I continued working in warehouses, where I struggled to keep a job. Despite the challenges, things gradually started to improve. With the help of therapy and by reigniting my passion for data analysis‚Äîthe part of my marketing job I enjoyed the most‚ÄîI began teaching myself new skills. I worked on projects and continued to learn, and now I‚Äôve reached a point where I‚Äôve acquired enough skills to start a career in data analysis.

I‚Äôm currently looking for entry-level positions (not to be confused with data entry), and I‚Äôm hoping to leverage my digital marketing experience as domain knowledge to enhance my prospects in data analysis. However, I‚Äôm facing a few challenges:

* **Explaining My Career Transition:** How do I explain to potential employers that I transitioned from being a Digital Marketing Executive with five years of experience to working in a warehouse for nearly five years?
* **Poor Attendance:** My attendance in my last job was poor, as I often missed a day each week to focus on developing my data analysis skills.
* **Employment Gaps:** I have significant gaps in my work history, largely because I disliked my warehouse job, felt unappreciated, and saw it as a dead end.
* **Relevance of Marketing Experience:** Can I still use my experience in digital marketing after being out of the field since early 2016? While my knowledge might seem outdated, I believe the fundamentals‚Äîespecially in PPC and SEO‚Äîremain the same.

And how do I tackle this (and reflect it) on my resume, cover letter, interview and LinkedIn profile (it's a big part of the hiring process).

1ehzvob,Good idea to reach out to recruiter?,"Hi all, 

I interviewed for a role awhile back and it went really well, but they felt my experience was more aligned for a different team and stated that a role should be opening up in 4-6 weeks. Is it a bad idea to follow up with the recruiter to express continued interest and see if that team is still getting headcount or does that look bad? If I do reach out, how should I go about phrasing that kind of email. 

Would appreciate thoughts specifically from hiring managers or recruiters. ",SelfMysterious9778,1,1.0,1,1722568822,2024-08-02 03:20:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ehzvob/good_idea_to_reach_out_to_recruiter/,8,2024

1ehzfiu,New boss - red flag? ,"My new boss started yesterday. We haven‚Äôt had a 1:1 yet, minimal interaction over our messaging system. Previous to this, I worked directly under our CEO.

After a client meeting today which admittedly was a bit chaotic (we‚Äôre blindsided coming into the convo around things that we‚Äôre out of our control, there was 1-2 questions that admitted I forgot to ask), my CEO started going through past emails (this is a project that started 5 years before I started working for this company) as well as more recent emails since I was brought in on it to find some details about what needed to be done still. (It‚Äôs a complex installation, this is also super normal behavior for our CEO. While compassionate, He‚Äôs super chaotic and scattered - to the point that his name is an adjective amongst our whole team.)

Understandably new boss was confused all around and asking a lot of questions in our recap. She kept interrupting our ceo and me to give her opinion. (Again this is her second day, so she doesn‚Äôt have a lot of context or product knowledge yet.) Our ceo didn‚Äôt answer those questions because of time constraints and she asked me to stay on after he left.

She then quickly intro‚Äôed herself, let me know she was going to send out questions to our team about ourselves and where we feel like we need help, and then less than 5 mins into it, jumped right into giving me feedback about how that call went and how things could have handled things better. Didn‚Äôt say it had to do with me but also said ‚Äúit seems like you‚Äôre the project manager on our side.‚Äù So it was very obviously directed at me. Then asked me to put together the follow up email and send it to her to review before I sent it out.

For context: I work at a tech start up as a mid level team member on our sales team, and our company is trying to put a lot of focus on making our sales team way more efficient. I have always been praised for my high level of organizational skills at this job and in the past.

I was really excited for her to start because our team has been trying to function without a real manager from before I even start 1.5 years ago, but feel blindsided and disappointed by my first interaction with her. Our team was really hoping she‚Äôd be an advocate for us and a mentor with availability but I feel like I was micromanaged already by someone who doesn‚Äôt even know me.

I‚Äôm normally very open to feedback (need time to process it because I tend to be hard on myself and get a lot of validation out of doing a good job but I always try to listen and learn) but feel the way it was approached/timing was inappropriate.

Is this a red flag? Am I letting ego get in the way here? I feel so unsettled about it, and nervous about what the future holds now.",meow0827,1,1.0,3,1722567426,2024-08-02 02:57:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ehzfiu/new_boss_red_flag/,8,2024

I want something that has a name to it like lawyer, doctor, electrician, or teacher. You get the idea. The thought of spending the next 30 years reading and writing emails for a living sounds disgusting. I want a career I can really sink my teeth into. It doesn't have to pay exorbitant, although I would like that. The common thread I have found in my career interests is helping people. With lawyer I could help the less wealthy criminals have a fair shot at a legal defense. Doctor would be great. I would be directly interacting with people and helping them overcome there maladies.

1ehxokd,Why am I getting ignored at work ?,"I started a new job about 8 months ago at a really big company. The team im in has about 8 people. They all go to each others' offices and say hello and literally PASS by my office NUMEROUS times a day to get to other offices and completely ignore the fact that Im there. They go to the office next to me and then go right back to their own offices. What really blows my mind is that my own manager doesnt talk to me during the day. This entire WEEK, ive probably spoken/seen her once for like 10 minutes and it was because she needed something. My manager literally SKIPS my 1-1 meetings but goes to everyone elses. I keep thinking if they dont need me, why not just get rid of me and save money? I am doing a LOT of work for them though so maybe they want me to keep doing that for the horrible pay im getting. I get thrown under the bus and never get recognition for anything I do. Anytime theres something wrong, the blame is on me. Yesterday, everyone left 2 hours early and no one said bye so when I went to the washroom I noticed everyones door was closed and lights were off. I was dumfounded.

My manager went on vacation a week ago and i was the last to know and that was only because i tried calling her and she told me she wont be in for a week. Shes going on another vacation and I found today from someone else. Shes leaving when we have a project that is starting so it's going to be all on me and if something goes wrong, it's my fault.

1ehxa19,Need to figure out a plan,"Hello Reddit,

I (31M) am currently at a crossroads. I‚Äôm broker than I‚Äôve ever been. For the sake of brevity I‚Äôll give some context about where I‚Äôm at right now. I got a divorce last year per the request of the love of my life. We were together 2012-2023 n got married 2016. We have a son who is 3 and is a the treasure in my life. I screwed up pretty bad. During covid after the birth of my son I ended up trying meth at my neighbors. By far the biggest mistake of my life. Expected something similar to adderall and I know what that is since I did a bunch in college. I was sober at that point from everything else and thought it to be harmless. Fast forward that one time ballooned into a full fledged addiction and pretty much putting myself into treatment (family and friends forced me because I just couldn‚Äôt get passed 4-5 days cold turkey on my own.) this is my the first year since 2019 I‚Äôm not in some type of inpatient/outpatient rehab. I‚Äôve been sober since April 2023 and I‚Äôm trucking along fine. My ex and I get along and might reconcile. Now, I live alone and I have a degree in economics and a full stack engineering certification for web development. Anyways I‚Äôm massively stuck  in a rut feel depressed and need some guidance on what the best course of action should be. I have a ‚Äújob‚Äù now as an ambassador making 20$ an hour. I‚Äôm grateful I have it but it‚Äôs not anywhere near what I had before so I‚Äôve decided to get back into the tech industry. Only problem is NO ONE is giving me a shot. Even for like a basic desktop support role using servicenow and tickets. Apparently a recruiter told me that if you dont have an IT related role for over a year then employers just don‚Äôt even want to hear anything. So I‚Äôm wondering what can I do to get back into the loop of making some good money? I don‚Äôt take loans from anyone and sometimes my fridge is empty but my pride won‚Äôt allow myself to ask.  How do I get employers to take me serious ?

Tl;dr I am a recovering addict who had nice jobs but can‚Äôt find a nice job in IT because of the amount of time it‚Äôs been since my last IT role. Please be advised.

Sorry if post is a bit long, I tried to provide enough detail so that people could provide general advice, but I can elaborate on specifics more if needed.*

**tl;dr form**: I am a 29-year old male living in Massachusetts. I've recently chosen to step away from working as a college professor and want to change career path to college/university student affairs. I am feeling extremely lost on how to find a new job to keep my finances stable while I get the prerequisite education to pursue that path.

**More detail:** I have Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science, and spent the past ~3 years working as a professor of Computer Science. I was unable to adapt to the workload/stress and experienced intense burnout, so I am stepping away for mental health's sake. Through that, I discovered I am passionate about and skilled at working with college students in general. For example, I was credited with reviving our student Computer Science club, and also spent large amounts of time volunteering in our LGBTQ+ Pride Center.

To explore that further, I plan to get a second Master's Degree in Higher Education, with Student Affairs as my long term goal. I'm not currently educated/skilled enough to apply to the vast majority of positions in that umbrella, so I've been feeling extremely lost on what to do for work so that I can afford that degree. I don't know how to kill time until I can do the things I actually want to do for work.

I recently applied for an internal lateral move at my company. Initially, my potential new boss said an interview wasn‚Äôt needed since he already knew me.

1ehup7f,Do I have leverage to ask for a raise?,"Trying to keep the details minimal. I work full time remote salaried role in the US for a software company. I have been at the company one year.


When I came out of training after starting at my company, I was given a book of business. Pretty soon after that, I started feeling a bit overwhelmed by my workload. The clients that I work with have pretty complex needs and require constant attention.


About a month ago, it was announced that someone on our team was leaving. Of course it made me nervous because the book of business has to be transferred to someone, so I was a bit on edge after the announcement. Welp, that someone ended up being me. I was pretty much given the entire book of business from my coworker who quit. From my understanding, this was almost like a ‚Äúlevel set‚Äù because I had less clients than the other team members, despite feeling overwhelmed by my clients. I pushed back a bit but was told I would have support and we would be looking to hire.


Shortly after that, another person on my direct team went on a LOA. I received their entire book of business. Again, I was told this would be temporary and there was no other option. Our entire team is bogged down and at capacity and nobody else can take these client accounts except me, apparently. I was tasked with what I would call a blind transfer- basically taking over these clients with absolutely no internal meetings or transition, just expected to learn the client accounts through internal documents, emails, and past client relationships. Since the previous rep went out unexpectedly, there was nobody for me to talk to about this transition. I‚Äôm already drowning in my own work and have been spending hours and hours doing internal research on these clients so the transition is seamless and the client does not see a quality change.


I‚Äôve pushed back numerous times to management, politely telling them I‚Äôm overwhelmed, I need more support, and I cannot do this on my own. It‚Äôs been really hard for me to ask for help because I want to show ambition and willingness to help. I‚Äôm aware that taking on more work and not complaining about it could potentially mean a promotion in the future. but I‚Äôm also feeling a bit taken advantage of. Every person who worked with this coworker is running to me with SOS issues and fires and questions.


I also wanted to add that our team is small and our company has a generous pto policy. There are requests to cover multiple times a week. I am covering my coworkers 1-3 days a week on a consistent basis. I offer a cover because I hope that when the time comes around the favor is returned, and also, there‚Äôs just not many of us to cover so I kind of have to.


I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed, stressed, irritated, and just down in the dumps. It‚Äôs effecting my life outside of work. I don‚Äôt take lunch breaks anymore. People schedule meetings with me all day long or request for me to call them within a 10 minute notice. I get a MINIMUM of 20-30 emails an hour. I can‚Äôt get my work done. I cry multiple times a week. I‚Äôm not handling this well, at all.


I don‚Äôt know how, or if, I should ask for a raise or a bonus. I‚Äôm still considered ‚Äúnew‚Äù and I don‚Äôt know if I have the leverage to. Or should I suck it up and put a smile on my face, and do the work of four people because it could mean a promotion one day? Is covering for someone who is on a LOA grounds for a raise or bonus?

1ehup0q,My boss hasn't paid me over the last couple of months.,"Hello r/careeradvice 

I‚Äôm currently facing a challenging situation at work and could use some advice. I work for a small beverage distributor where I'm the only full-time employee. For the past month, my employer has not paid me, offering a variety of excuses each time I inquire about my paycheck. Some of the excuses include, ""I'm writing your check now,"" ""I left it at home,"" and ""I need sales to pay myself so I can pay you.""

To address this, I have meticulously documented all financial details, including a comprehensive breakdown of amounts owed for each pay period on an Excel sheet. I've also kept records of all text messages and conversations related to previous agreements about pay. While I signed a W-2 when I started, we never formalized the payment, commission structures, etc., in a signed agreement, which I realize may complicate matters.

I have not quit yet because I am in the process of filing a claim with the Department of Labor for lost wages. I‚Äôm determined to resolve this and ensure that my rights are protected.

Has anyone here experienced something similar? Any advice on additional steps I might consider to ensure I get the wages I'm owed? I appreciate any guidance you can offer.",Embarrassed-Ant-1588,106,0.8999999761581421,65,1722553750,2024-08-01 23:09:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ehup0q/my_boss_hasnt_paid_me_over_the_last_couple_of/,8,2024
1ehuehu,Pushing for a manager role,"I'm looking for some options on this. Maybe some outside eyes. 

TLDR: old not great manager is on Mat leave and now may be the opportunity to come in and get things running smoothly.

I came from a larger company in a specific field and went to a smaller one. To give some background it's medical  sales and equipment. I started out as a technician, worked my way up specializing in many areas, then became a sales specialist (top)

At the new small company I'm not exaggerating when I say I am the most experienced and most versatile as I have worked all the levels. I also took a territory and increased sales 300%. I am in my third year here, 14 in the industry.

I worked with the owner and mentioned becoming (on top of my sales) the technical department head to help get that department up to the next level. They are hiring me an assistant to offload some duties so I can do this. 

Now the dilemma....my manager was always a backseat manager. Left us to our own devices and did more of the supportive admin work. They have since gone on maternity leave. To cover for her the idea was for a couple new admin hires to do most of her duties and some was outsourced. But with HR moving people, new people starting and confused, one person quiting, there is just chaos and confusion. The rest of the sales team is worried not having the manager as support and the new hires not knowing their duties. 

I think this may be the right time to just go to the owner and HR and just advocate and say ""look, it's not really great down there and everyone is worried. Give me the reigns and I will get things in order"". ( In professional terms of course)

Now this isn't a great time for me either as I have several people to train and keep up with my sales. But this may be the opportunity to make the company I want to work for as well as become a leader and manager. 

Thoughts?

1ehtri2,My wife makes $100k and I have no motivation to find a job.,"Don't get me wrong, I have tried nearly every day for the past year and half. 

We both graduated from college last year (we are both a few years older than the normal graduating class). She studied electrical engineering, I studied mechanical engineering. We both did really great in our classes and senior year she landed a really competitive job offer, the only catch was that we would have to move to a new city every couple months for the next year.

So that's what we did, we moved 4 times in one year. Never staying in any one spot long enough for me to actually land a career worthy job. Remote work in the M.E. world is pretty tough to find and really only exists for senior engineers, not entry level. 

I of course did find \*\*some\*\* work I could do to help keep me busy. I started designing websites for people but its not work that I really enjoy all that much. 

After a year, we moved for our final time and ended up in the greater Seattle area. We absolutely love the area but there aren't a lot of options for me. It seems like almost no one here wants to take entry level engineers except Boeing (I did interview with them and felt the company was not for me). 

A part of me has always hated how specific job positions are. I really like doing a bit of everything. I like to do the brainstorming, the design work, and the manufacturing, but corporate jobs really only let you do one small part of one of those pieces. I feel like working for a startup/small company may be more suitable but none of them wants to hire an entry level engineer. 

I've applied to hundreds of job applications. I have contacted and interviewed many engineers at their current roles and tried to build a network. But in the end, the results are always the same. I really just want to jump in and start working on projects again. At this point, I feel like its been so long since graduating that I'm not as ""fresh"" as those who just graduated. Although my academic achievements in schools were impressive, I now feel like an imposter among the hundreds that compete for the same positions as me. 

I want a job because I promised my wife that one day she wouldn't have to work (she enjoys her current job but working doesn't bring her a lot of fulfillment like it does for me) but finding a job doesn't even seem possible now. Has anyone ever been in a similiar situation?

1ehtg42,"lost between passion, practicality, and/or long-term satisfaction? please help. ","Hey there! So, i'm currently troubled in mind about what i want to do next with my life. Sp basically, before I went into college, I always thought I wanted to be a doctor because both my mom and my grandpa are doctors. I was always interested in pediatrics or psychiatry, as I've always had an interest in children and mental health. Growing up, I also had interest in writing (I've always been good at it and my mom told me to try to pursue it), as well as nutrition and exercise. Had I stayed in Latin America (where I grew up), I probably would've pursued medicine, but because I came to the U.S. for college, I decided that wasn't the career path for me, since in the U.S. it is a lot of time and money, and I didn't know if i had enough of a passion for it. In college, I explored the possibilities of studying kinesiology, food science and psychology (this last one was the one I wanted most, but was unable to transfer for it because the number of credits I had surpassed the program's credit transfer cap). When i couldn't get into psychology, a friend mentioned that i would make a great teacher, and so i started to look into this career. Since i had always had an incline for children and was interested in child psychology, I ended up pursuing a career in education. Additionally, being an immigrant, i know teachers are in high demand and thought they are able to obtain a work visa or green card more easily than less demanded professions. I'm currently about to start year 3 of teaching, and I don't know what to do. Ever since my student teaching semester, and even more so after my first year of teaching, i knew i didn't want to be a classroom teacher. I liked working with kids, but the education system is not very good, the pay is awful, and I do not like the lack of flexibility in my schedule. I started to look in to speech and language pathology, and I'm currently taking pre-requisite courses to get into a masters for it. However, I'm not sure this is the right career path for me either. It checks many boxes (better pay, can work with children if i want to, more flexible schedule, great middle point between my passion for health and humanities), but I do not know that i am passionate enough about it. I've begun to question whether i should pivot in my career completely. I want a career that is lucrative enough, but allows me to explore all areas of my interest and still maintain the flexibility I want. My mom is a dermatologist and that seems like a career I would like, but i'm afraid I'm: 1. not passionate enough about it 2. not dedicated enough to go back to school for a career path that would allow me to work in the dermatology field (nursing, physicians assistant, medicine). Please help. I love mental health, but also love overall holistic health. I love kids, but also can see myself getting tired at some point. I love flexibility and work life balance, but also want something lucrative and would eventually love to have my own business.",Far-Victory1814,1,1.0,0,1722550438,2024-08-01 22:13:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ehtg42/lost_between_passion_practicality_andor_longterm/,8,2024

1ehssas,"Seeking Career Advice: 35F with Advanced Degrees, 7-Year Gap, and a Desire to Upskill","**Hi, Throwaway account here.**

I'm a 35F seeking advice. I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering from India and a master's in Electronics Engineering & Engineering Management from Australia. I've never failed a course and maintained a CGPA above 7.8, though I'm not sure how relevant that is. I also have one year of experience in academic research during my postgrad studies, with a published journal article. 

Unfortunately, I've had a 7-year career gap. I'm an average learner and feel unsure about my next steps. I'm wondering if there‚Äôs a job where my educational background could be an asset. What should I learn to upskill? I have some interest in machine learning and am open to exploring fields where I can use both technical and management skills. 

Currently, I‚Äôm feeling a bit lost and under-confident. I need a work-from-home option due to an autoimmune disorder that limits my mobility during flare-ups. I‚Äôve also been on psychiatric medication for MDD and PTSD for the last 6 years. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

**Additional Notes**

Half my life feels like it‚Äôs passed by, and I‚Äôm unsure where to begin. I‚Äôm fortunate to have a wonderful spouse who supports me through it all. For the last 5 years, I've been living with my parents as a caretaker, but I'm hoping to move in with my spouse soon ( currently he is finishing his post doctoral research )

1ehskjy,Bad to Counter Signed Offer with Another Offer?,"Hi, I received a signed an offer letter at JPMorgan within the past week for a less senior product role (not a PM, which is what my last role was). I will start the week after next and the salary is a bit low, but because the YOE was 1 more than what I had, I decided not to counter. Also I have been exhausted applying places. I have been unemployed by choice (happily left TOXIC boss) since mid June and have been applying and interviewing since then. 

Today I received a call about a position at Fiserv for a Product Manager role (which was my last title), and during the recruiter screening I mentioned that if the salary wasn't within a specific range I wasn't interested. I did not think they would match it. Fast forward to an hour or so ago, and Fiserv wants to move forward with my candidacy and has scheduled an interview with me and two directors tomorrow afternoon.

My question is: If I were to receive an offer after the interview tomorrow‚Äîhow bad would be if in between now and the week of my start date, I ask the JPM recruiter if there is any wiggle room on the salary? The difference in salary would be at least $25K based on my chat with the recruiter today. The JPM role is 3 days in office and 2 at home. The Fiserv one is 5 days in office until 90 days, and then I can have Fridays at home. The commute distance is the same with each (40 minutes with traffic).

1ehri9g,"My staff member makes ""more than"" me","This is going to come across as a rant because I am so upset.

  
I, 29f, have been overseeing a small department for 2 years now, today is my 6 year work anniversary with this company. One of my staff members, 22f, is my star agent! She exceeds her work every day and I really have no worries with her. Her quarterly and yearly reviews since she started in 2022 have been great. We get along great too. End of June she left to try to pursue a different job in the same industry, just not the same company. A week later she called me crying and wanted to come back, we sat with HR and of course, we took her back. There we're stipulations but overall, I was happy to have her back but sad that it didn't work out for her like she wanted.



I was not involved in pay plan process, as in our company, most managers aren't and its up to the directors and HR. I still submit payroll and can see everyone's pay for my staff, its not a secret but the actual coming up with pay rates is left to the higher ups. 



Payroll makes a lot of mistakes in our company tbh. Checks are messed up a lot as most of our industry is commission or bonus driven. Some have multiple ways of being paid (commission, bonus, hourly etc) on one check.

When she left, she was being paid $21/hr flat. When she came back, I noticed she was being paid $27.50/hr. She brought it to my attention as she was confused but its been 2 weeks now and they are still paying her $27.50. She said the pay plan she signed was for $1,100 a week salary. I am not sure how the logistics work but I assume they broke down the salary into an hourly pay because $27.50 x 40 hours is $1,100. I was shocked and annoyed but did not show that expression to her. She deserved a raise regardless, she got one on her 1 year anniversary last year, her 2 years is not until October. I was like damn, if I quit and come back will I get a raise ?? lol



I make $24.50 per hour with a $1k bonus per month. This bonus only applies if we meet our goals, which I have only missed 1 month so far this year, so most months, I can rely on getting that $1,000 bonus. I guess its just hard for me to wrap around the fact that she makes ultimately $2.50 less than me as long as I hit my bonus, god forbid I don't, then she would make more than me. 

  
I don't know how to go about this. Part of me is obviously like get your money girl, but the other part of me is like wtf?? How can you quit and come back and get a $6.50 raise. When I asked for $26.50 after they offered me $23/hr they met in middle with $24.50 and I just accepted it. I just am upset with my directors that I fought so hard with to get my raise and someone else gets it handed. Again, I am not even mad at her. I am mad at my company. And to be fair, I still would make more on monthly/ annual basis. So its not that she makes more than me but that we are very close in pay range. We don't work a straight 40 hours its more around 43-45 so we get OT pay at a higher rate. 

  
As a side note, I feel like they are taking me less and less serious as my due date approaches (I am 30 weeks pregnant with my first kid). I get asked once a month if I plan on coming back. which I have been upfront since telling them in March that yes I do plan on coming back and already have childcare set up for when I return from my paid leave (which is 6 months). I feel less and less included in on things. Like not being in meetings I would typically be invited into etc.



Do I just leave this alone or do I talk to HR or my director as to my confusion? More so as why are we on a similar pay scale when I have been with the company 6 years and manager for the last 2. Or is this something I just take the L on. The problem is, I don't want to come back next at the same pay rate. It makes me not want to come back working here if that continues. Knowing this is killing me and annoying me. I have dedicated so much time and energy into this place the last 6 years.

Although I am very anxious on how I should approach this since I have never quit one before. I read from the document my boss gave me about if I ever wanted to leave and it says to put in a 2 week notice, preferably in writing. Now first of all, does this mean I can type and print it out or I should just hand write it. These might be a simple answer to google, but I just want another human being to tell me. I also dont see my boss often on days I even work so the chances of seeing him in person is slim. Anyways, I just feel guilty about leaving since I just got a raise a while ago and I am probably about to get another one from training in upcoming days. We are sort of understaff but I just can't work anymore. I just feel stressed all the time and can't think about anything but work and its been making me really upset.

1ehqkm3,Would this be a mistake?,"So here is my predicament. 

I have been at my job as a sales and applications engineer for about 3 months now and I hate it. When I took the job I was under the impression that I would be much more customer facing than I am. Instead it is just another engineering job, sitting in a gray half cube, listening to white noise over the speakers, and have management walking past every 5 minutes. While going from 55k to 80k was nice at first. Losing all of my remote work and now having a 30 minute commute along with this draining and depressing office has sent my mental health to the worst it's ever been. 

After being at my old job as a design engineer for 4.5 years, I wanted to find something new. I think I would really enjoy a true sales role and this one is definitely not. So my question is, would it be okay to leave this job after 3 months to just focus all my energy on finding a new job? I am only 26 so my resume would consist of two 4 year stints and then this short 3 month one. Would that really turn off potential employers right away or would they see it as not a big deal. 

Thanks for the advice!

1ehpms3,I need urgent help,"I‚Äôm a year away from finishing high school and I‚Äôm being asked to decide what degree I‚Äôm going to study and where as I‚Äôm planning to study abroad (I‚Äôm Spanish) and preparations need to be made in advance.

I‚Äôm currently about to enter IBDP 2. I take high level math, physics and business, and standard chemistry, English A and French B.

I‚Äôve always been good at math, above average though not exceptional. The main path I had in mind until now was some engineering degree such as mechanical or mechatronics. I figured these would keep my options open regarding the job market. I think I don‚Äôt wish to be an engineer, and that I‚Äôd be more skilled in a job in which I can interact with others and be constantly challenged, not in a technical sense but intellectually, if that makes sense. I like to think my way through problems and persuade others without feeling the constant pressure of having to have extensive, specialised technical knowledge. I‚Äôm not sure if I expressed this last part well enough

The career that comes to mind is sales/anything business related, but I‚Äôm constantly told by everyone around me (and which I might also believe) that studying engineering is a good starting point to then get into business. 

The thing is: I‚Äôm not sure whether I should study math, engineering (if so, I‚Äôm not sure which), or data science, for instance, but all I read about it is that the market is saturated regarding entry level jobs.

To be honest, I just want a fulfilling job that pays well, which I guess is what everyone wants. But I‚Äôm only sixteen, I have no idea about any of these options in reality. I need help. If someone can provide valuable advice it would be very much appreciated.

1ehpdae,Job hopping?,"Looking for some advice on how long I should stay at this job to avoid looking like a ‚Äújob hopper‚Äù

I work in construction, won‚Äôt say what sector.  I was at a company for almost 7 years before I moved across the country to be closer to family, and to escape an abusive manager.

The first job I took when I moved turned out to be a horrible fit.  I was unchallenged, bored, and the firm itself was sketchy (our health insurance was cancelled because they failed to pay for several months‚Ä¶ things like that).  So, when a recruiter reached out after 3 months, I went for an interview, and I really liked them, so I accepted the job.

I do really like this new firm.  They‚Äôre great people, the work is challenging and diverse, and my direct manager and I work together extremely well.

However, one of the clients we work with is a monster, and there is no escape for me for at least the next 2-3 years.  I‚Äôm still relatively new to the profession, so that‚Äôs like 1/3 of my career.  And, unfortunately, I have been told that I am organized and ‚Äúextremely good‚Äù at my job, so I‚Äôm the best person to have on this complicated job.

I had a meeting this week where the client full-on screamed at us for 25 minutes straight for a normal, completely unavoidable part of the building process.  Like, it‚Äôs literally the law, we have no say in complying, but he didn‚Äôt like it, so he screamed for 25 minutes straight, calling us incompetent, etc, etc.  Apparently, this is what every meeting is like with him.  And we will have them extremely often throughout construction.  I did have to turn off my camera about 20 minutes in because I started to cry, it was unavoidable at that point.

Unfortunately, this is an extremely powerful client, so no one can or does say anything to him.  My bosses have just accepted it as ‚Äúthe way he is‚Äù. 

So I‚Äôm basically staring at the next 2-3 years of my life having to take more abuse from this man, and I don‚Äôt think I can do it again.  We also will continue to get more jobs from him, so there is probably no escape even after this project is done.

I have only been here for 6 months, and was at the firm before this for 3 months.  The only other job I‚Äôve had since graduating, I spent 7 years at.  Any other job experience I‚Äôve had isnt on my resume anymore, as it isn‚Äôt relevant (retail, barista, etc).

How long do I have to stay here to avoid looking like a job hopper?

I really do like it here otherwise, but I don‚Äôt think I can handle this for that long.  Especially since I was really looking for a less toxic work environment when I moved.

1ehn48l,Looking for opinions ,"I will try to keep this short as I can....13 years ago I was in between jobs and a 'friend' asked if I would be interested to come work for him and I agreed. We both partied together and I figured it would be 'fun' and the pay was good. I never intended on staying but low self esteem and alcohol abuse (clean now) led to never getting out. I hated the job itself and still do but now I'm older with obligations. He and the company did well and makes lots of money. Since covid we all work from home which was welcomed and only thing I can think of as a plus working here.

So here is my issue, I have not received a raise in 10 years (which reflects how low my self worth was but thats another topic) I've seen my 'friend' buy a 5 million home and nice cars meanwhile no raise for me, and another co-worker quit due to the toxic environment, leaving me and my friend and his brother to run the company. But still no raise.

I recently brought this up 2 months ago (no raise, more work) and he said he would get back but still no reply. He was leaving for vacation 3 weeks ago to which I asked for a reply he said he would before his flight, and again no reply. Hes back from vacation and still nothing, I have been waiting to see if he will but now it doesnt look like it and I feel like telling him off now.

There is this annual golf tournament with clients coming up and flight tickets etc have been purchased, but I almost feel like saying I can not go since I don't feel the benefit for me since I clearly am not valued here.

My wife and I meet a year and a half ago. She (29f) graduated with her undergrade in Media and communication in 2019. She had good leads and was excited about her prospects, but when Covid hit it killed her chance to grab the kind of job she wanted. She had planned to get her masters, but due to COVID and her family moving she did not. Her family moved from Jersey to NC. Since then she has not has success finding work in her career.

She does photography on a side. She has shot many live shows, but that slowed down as we went into wedding planning mode. Before she meet me she did get a entry level job doing photography and edits for their magazine I think. It was not a good fit and she got fired after a couple of months. She doesnt like talking about it.

She has a history of ramping up applications, trying to get out there, and then getting rejection after rejection. It crushes her to the point she has very bad depression connected to her career. She blames people for not giving her the chance.

She has been working at a grocery store every since college. It is one of the nicer ones and she does a lot and gets paid well for the job. But it is not what she wants and forces her to work weekends.

I do not know every detail and I am not going to judge where my wife is at. but the truth is that while she can get interviews, she never gets the job. It is like having a dream crushed and she now struggles with motivation to try.

First, I feel for her. I wish it was easier. However, I am in IT which has much for work and my understanding is that media/communication is a much harder field to get a decent entry level paying job in.

If she has years of hardly any work in her field, and no continued education to stand on, I fear she is not going to get the job she wants. I dont know what she needs to do though. She believes she has the skills needed, but that no one will hire her over lack of experience working in the field and the long stretch since her degree

She is looking at media/marketing jobs. I dont know enough about this field to have much input, but I do know that probably needs something to help her. She is to the point where she feels is pointless try, but doesnt know what to do. If she does nothing and applies to jobs, nothing about her situation is going to change.

If she had been able to grab an internship after her undergrad she would have been in a better spot id think.

Imo her only options is to get the masters+internship or get a media cert or something and work extremely hard to work on a portfolio. Which she isn't the self learning type and I fear the no college route is going to be very demoralizing.",Suspicious-Data1589,39,0.8999999761581421,42,1722534624,2024-08-01 17:50:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ehn16a/any_advice_for_my_wife_who_is_unable_to_find_a/,8,2024
1ehm8iq,How to get ahead of incompetent coworkers?,"I'm having a time and a half right now.

Our timekeeping software shit the bed nationwide, and it was on me to create the Excel spreadsheet to track our employee's timekeeping for payroll for this week and beyond.

The problems arise when my coworker proceeded to prove that she was completely incompetent in Excel and payroll is damn near late because, while she can take directions fairly well, she distracts me from double checking the math every 5 seconds because Excel ""isn't calculating it automatically."" She uses the mouse exclusively to copy/paste, has no clue about keyboard shortcuts. She doesn't know how to use the SUM function (goes up to the top to do autosum but doesn't know how to select multiple cells), she doesn't understand how to do the math with functions outside of pen and paper and she keeps breaking it because ""Well when we do it in (X) program, we HAVE to do it like this!!!"" And I've tried explaining to her that Excel doesn't care, but my functions do, and my reference page is useless when she keeps breaking the punches off at 6am and creating a new row. 

I admit that I'm not an Excel wizard or an expert, but I have allowed our employees to have their time calculated and actually get paid (albeit at the very last minute this week) so a win is a win in my eyes. But I am completely exhausted by this experience and my inflexible coworker who so rigidly adheres to this archaic version of payroll processing.

She wants me to do it exactly the way she does it, has me printing out 90+ pages of paper per week to look for errors or find missing punches completely by hand. It seems to work for her, but all I can see is shortcuts. 

I'm just an ""accounting assistant"" (that's my title but I don't feel like that's what I really am). My supervisor is an ""experience only"" type of accounting department lead, she doesn't have a degree and we contract with a CPA to check our books. Everything she's learned, she's learned through experience, but it's hard for me to understand exactly what she knows aside from the different OT laws where our employees work. She seems highly unconcerned with the process because ""it works and what if the new way isn't as fast as you think it is?"" But it really doesn't work because we process on average like a batch of 6-7 retro pay requests from employees a week. On top of the 200 employees across 4-5 different states, entering in punches to the system directly, cross-checking (meaning typing in each individual employee number and checking to see if they have clock ins, clock outs, and meal breaks - yes, purely manually), sending up to 6-12 follow up emails per area asking why Person A went over their shift by 30min, asking why Person B's absence wasn't put in the system and why the schedule wasn't changed accordingly, it's too much.

That's why they hired me in the first place, to help the Payroll lead (who gets paid more than me and works from home, which is a kick in the face to my pride) but this??? I might as well be in the stone age.

I'm burnt out after this week and I've only been at this job for two months. I want to make everything about payroll more efficient so that it doesn't take us 3.5 days (I'm not joking) to process pay for 200 people and STILL end up having things calculated incorrectly.

I'm just not sure how I can get anyone to listen to me. :/ The job otherwise just consists of me doing bank reconciliations, A/P entry, and invoices in QBO and listening to audiobooks, so it's incredibly easy on my brain and I'm happy here. But the payroll thing is driving me crazy.

Sorry this is so long, but does anyone have any advice on how to navigate this?

ETA: She stops me every 5 seconds to say ""Can you total x person for their total hours?""

I work in a Proof of Concept (POC) team where there's no clear structure or process. Everyone just randomly conducts research or watches videos, and there's very little actual development work, resulting in a low number of stories. It‚Äôs an absolute shit show

About 3-4 months ago, I discussed the topic of immigration work with my manager. He suddenly claimed that he felt I was underperforming and needed to show more consistency. He mentioned that sometimes I'm good, and other times I'm not. I disagreed with his assessment, but he insisted that I needed to demonstrate that I had been working hard. He knew very well that everyone on our team had a similar number of user stories. He also criticized me for not being communicative or showing much leadership. I know damn well he isn‚Äôt going to do anything , so many 1 on 1 he keeps saying the same thing , we didn‚Äôt even have an architect for a long time.

This team, overall, has a poor tech culture, and several members have already quit. There's no structure, and my manager isn't technically proficient; he doesn't even do pull request reviews. I'm not sure how he got his position, as he's not a technical guy. 

Now, he's blocking my immigration process. He's very manipulative and toxic with his words. I want to change teams within the company, but I'm concerned that he'll give me a bad review. Some colleagues have suggested I go ahead and apply internally without informing him, while others recommend letting him know beforehand. The issue is that if I apply without telling him, he will be notified, which could look bad. One of my coworkers, who also didn't get along with him, warned me that he might twist my words and accuse me of trying to leave the company, potentially making a case to fire me.

I'm unsure what to do. The job market outside is tough right now, and it might take a while to find something new. I do want to stay in this company but in a different team.

1ehl940,but should I take this leap?,"Just to start off, I am currently employed. I recently got offered a position with a company that literally just launched 5 months ago. They plan to sell home goods with product hitting floors in spring 2025. They are being backed financial by a bigger foreign company that has been around for years. I am weighing the options and here are my doubts.

* they are offering to pay me a higher salary in order to cover insurance I have to get from the market place.  Right now they offer no benefits, no insurance, no 401k, no commuter benefits. The insurance market place is anything but affordable in the USA. Through work now I spend nearly $200 in insurance premium for medical, dental and vision. The lowest tiered plans with dental and vision in the market place easily start out at $640ish a month. That's nearly $6,000 more a year for less coverage, higher co pays, deductible and premiums. My current job also offers the option of 401k, commuter benefits and short term disability.
* Unfortunately in the USA, the smaller a company the higher the insurance cost and the lower the coverage. Right now, my current employer is midsize and the insurance isn't the the cheapest but its certainly not the highest. The new company now has 10 employees. Thought they plan to hire more, I doubt the insurance they get will be better then what I have given their size.
* they are making promises of growth and success but a promise is not a guarantee. Listen, any company can falter no matter how many years they've been running but a company with over 30 years is more secure then one with 5 months standing. They can't promise they will get into stores they want to get into and they can't guarantee their stuff will even sell well. I mean it could, but there is no history there. however, they are banking that having backing from a bigger company is a their security net. is this so? I've known business owners to offer employees and potential employees the moon and then some only to not come through when the time comes. 

So, should I stay or should I go.",Acceptable_Brick1080,0,0.5,1,1722530327,2024-08-01 16:38:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ehl940/but_should_i_take_this_leap/,8,2024

1ehiqzj,2 Months into first job looking at new opportunity,"Hi all! During the month of May, I graduated and accepted my first job as a marketing job at x company. Job pays well, but the environment is a little toxic as everyone is always gossiping about each other and what not. I‚Äôm someone who has never been involved with any type of gossiping throughout school and what not, and I‚Äôm sick of it already. Also, onboarding and getting my own systems running for me to actually start working was a drag because HR was a mess, so I was worried that the overall environment was going to be questionable.

Now, I received an email from company y who I did an internship with last summer about a potential marketing job. I have an interview with them on Monday. Pay would be a little more, closer commute, hybrid (vs my current job which is on-site everyday) the environment would not be toxic, I‚Äôd be doing a lot more fulfilling work, and it would just be an overall better environment. 

If I were to take this opportunity, not guaranteed yet though, how would I go about this? Should I include my first job out of college in my resume even thought I‚Äôve only been here for almost 3 months now?

1ehgzzs,I am bonded for 2 years. Can I still get out?,"
Hi,

I am currently in a situation wherein I want to get out from my current company because I received better opportunity. However, few months ago, we had a company training outside Philippines (all expenses were covered). Since it is my first job and got the chance to train abroad, I accepted the opportunity. Prior on our flight, it was NEVER mentioned that we will be bonded to the company for 2 years. No contract related to bond was signed. 

Now here's my dillema. Our manager informed us about the bond on one of the airports where we took layover for around 7 hours. I was shocked, because if I knew that bond will be issued prior to our flight, I will refuse to participate to the training.

After the training, we didn't signed any contract related to the bonding. Now, I received a better offer (40-50%) higher than what I am earning now. I really want to get the offer. But I am afraid that whenever I tell my boss that I will be leaving, he might use the BOND against me. Since I didnt sign a bond contract after our training, would it be legal if my boss will let me sign a bond contract when I tell him that I will be leaving the company? I am new to the industry, how should I handle this?

My long term goal, as of now, would be to have a career in software development, but I also value my free very much, as there are many things paraller to work that I enjoy cultivanting.

I think I would enjoy to work as sys admin for maybe 1 or 2 years, but again on the long term I feel like SWD is closer to my interests. I also think that working as a sys admin I could learn many IT concepts I couldn't formally learn during my past education.

However, I'm quite afraid that once out of SWD it would be harder to get back to it again. I know that many people transition through devOp or solution architect, but I'd like to avoid it if possible and go to plain development.

My past internships include:

* **Full Stack Developer Intern at E Connect Solutions Pvt. Ltd**: Managed the development lifecycle with CI/CD and implemented comprehensive unit testing.

I‚Äôm considering a Master‚Äôs in Finance (MFin) to move into consulting, but I‚Äôm also aware that an MBA might offer broader opportunities. Given my limited work experience, I‚Äôm unsure which path to take.

I‚Äôm particularly interested in top programs like:

* LSE MSc Finance

* LSE MSc Finance and Economics

* UCL MSc Finance

* Imperial MSc Finance

* Warwick MSc Finance

* Columbia MSc Financial Economics

* Princeton MSc in Finance

* MIT MS in Finance

* LBS MS in Financial Analysis

Here are my main questions:

* **MFin Fit**: Would an MFin align well with my career goals in consulting, and will it strengthen my resume for consulting roles, or could it make my position weaker as it is not a specialization?

* **MBA Comparison**: Is an MBA (only want to go to top unis) viable with my limited work experience, or should I wait until I have more experience?

* **Career Transition**: Can I transition into consulting with an MFin, and which program offers a smoother path?

1ehdx25,I'm confused. Need advice!,"

I'm 28F and I have worked in various fields (finance, data, management) and I find them okay but I never really worked on them passionately.

I had art as an hobby which I stopped doing as life got busy. But whenever I see something that have creativity in it, I feel so attracted towards it. Be it web designing, video editing, photography, art, pottery, anything that makes cute beautiful things. 

Which makes me think that my passion is to create something beautiful. I feel at peace whenever I'm drawing something beautiful or creating something but then I also look for validation from other people. 

And I also know that we shouldn't make our passion our career, as we'll be forced to do it for a living. But recently I started to have these sudden thoughts like how nice it would be to study in a art school. 

I'm at a point of life where I don't think I can take chances and it's more like it's important for me to have a stable career.

1ehbhnj,New job advice - partner works HR in same place ,"Hi all,

Just recently started a new role in my target career and company. 

My partner also works here in a HR function - not a senior / decision maker but would have eyes on their shared mail box daily.

I didn‚Äôt use my partner as a ‚Äúin‚Äù in anyway, I kept it to myself until I had an offer.

At no point has anyone asked if I know any current employees.

My issue is, I‚Äôm concerned in what implications this will have on me once my manager and co workers find out - after all it‚Äôs only a matter of time until casual personal questions come up, in which I can lie or tell the truth. 

When I say implications I refer to people watching what they say, being treated differently etc. a similar situation happened when I personally knew a director in a company I was working for and it was horrible, no one wanted to know me, they always asked questions about the senior and tip toed around me all the time.. 

The position I‚Äôm taking is a management position, and I‚Äôm thinking a few things that may happen if the information is outed:

1) I become invincible, people may think it‚Äôs pointless raising a potential complaint if I‚Äôm ‚Äúprotected‚Äù
2) people give me the cold shoulder because I could be a ‚Äúspy‚Äù
3) if promotions happen it‚Äôs a nepotism situation, allowing a easy disrespect of me


And prob loads of other situations 

As a side note, my partner has informed her team so if anything related to me can be dealt with by another team member. 

My area of concern is my immediate team and colleagues 

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? 

Thanks a lot!

1ehb47i,switching careers to marketing or radiology,"Hey there I‚Äôm deciding on two majors for my bachelor degree and am on the fence of choosing marketing or radiology

I graduated with a diploma in interior design and hated it partially because I live in a country where the industry is really bad which made me realise it isn‚Äôt for me so I decided to pursue something different

I have read through different Reddit posts about the pros and cons of marketing such as not having one tasks to focus on and being underpaid to do a lot of things rather than one I also worked under a company where I had to work alongside them and I realised how they always get off work late which is a downside for me they seem to have a lot of fun attending events and so but besides that I am into the creative side a bit but I realise the amount of work they get is bad and underpaid

Radiology is something I am keen in learning on I have heard a lot from my cousin as well because she‚Äôs also studying radiology and it seemed like such an interesting course to take . What I‚Äôm mostly scared of is falling behind in classes especially since I don‚Äôt have a background medical science . I‚Äôve been trying to convince myself that it will be okay since I do have an interest in the human anatomy but I‚Äôm scared that it wouldn‚Äôt take me far because I have friends who studied nursing in medical fields tell me how difficult it is and I‚Äôve been having mixed thoughts about it

Some questions I do have about radiology is the working hours and how did the process towards becoming a radiology seem like for you guys because I want the actual reality of it was it tough having to memorise a lot of things ? How is the work environment like ? Are the case studies during your clinical experience interesting difficult ? I would love to hear your thoughts¬†about¬†it",zhamoirs,1,1.0,1,1722499287,2024-08-01 08:01:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ehb47i/switching_careers_to_marketing_or_radiology/,8,2024
1ehabq9,Graphic design or English teacher?,"I'm stuck between doing these two things that I'm very passionate about but I'm honestly pretty pessimistic about both of them.

 On the one hand I'm already two years into a degree for graphic design and I spend a lot of time using the tools in my free time for more personal art. I chose graphic design because it seemed like the most financially stable art adjacent  job, but I have quickly found out over the years that it is anything but stable, and it is super competitive to the point where many people with degrees aren't finding jobs for years. Couple this with the rise  of ai, it seems like it will be near impossible to get my foot in the door. I just don't have the hustle or competitive nature in me to compete and my art is honestly nothing earth shattering for me to stand out.

On the other hand the thought of being an English teacher at a high school started to seem appealing when I found my passion for philosophy and literature. It's a very recent passion that started in high-school because I didn't read much as a kid, but I nerd out so much over it that I want to just explain to people why this stuff is cool and why they should care. Philosophy turns in my head more than art does anyways, but here's the thing. I kind  of suck at writing and reading. I always have great thoughts that I can articulate well but I am abhorrent at grammar, structure, and citing things. I'm also a big procrastinator at writing. It feels satisfying when I write essays but it also causes a lot of stress and i don't know if someone like that is qualified to teach it. I also have a learning disability. They never figured out what it was exactly, but basically I'm really slow at processing information which is why reading is hard. I get very distracted and it takes a lot of effort for me to take in what I'm reading, but I still love it, and given the time can form deep understandings of text that not even my teachers or peers could. 

Another issue is that I hear teaching is also a very bumpy road. Dealing with behavior issues, administration, other teachers, parents.  Always having work to take home, and teachers are paid pretty poorly where I live. My art teacher from high-school advised against teaching and my mother who teaches special Ed did too. I've heard it's rather soul crushing but i also dont feel nearly as replaceable tecaher than i do a graphic designer. 

To anyone taking either path, what are your experiences? Should I give up on these dreams and  find something else to do entirely? I don't feel like I need a lot in life, I just need to care about what I'm doing.

My managers chose a different captain instead of me. A (45M) bartender who started this year. No one likes him because he has an attitude and he‚Äôs sarcastic. If you ring in drinks and wait for them at the bar, he‚Äôll purposely go slower. This was all without the title. Imagine now that he has it?

Truthfully, I was quiet about it and went about my day. But now I‚Äôm in bed realizing:

He, who has only worked on one building, never served on the floor, only bartended in the main building, started this March- got the job and I- who has started 4 years ago, who knows how to train staff on both buildings, knows the set up for four parts of the club, weddings and events floor plans, a-la-carte service, both of the building‚Äôs lunch service, side works for both buildings, course set ups for outings and tournaments, beverage cart set up and more- didn‚Äôt get the job.

I make $30/hr and he made $25/hr, before promotion.

I‚Äôve reached the maximum pay and there‚Äôs really no more room for improvement for me. Nothing at all. I‚Äôve reached the final boss at the game. I‚Äôve beat every single level and finessed my craft to the point that both back and front of the house, even our members (people we work for) wholeheartedly believed I was going to be the one. 

I feel insulted, humiliated and honestly, abandoned. I didn‚Äôt even want the job in the first place. Yet, this hurt.

Does this come from my childhood? Feeling like I could be great at everything but I still wasn‚Äôt enough? 

I want to leave my job because there‚Äôs no more room for improvement. There are many old managers who have left that want me to work for them. The woman who hired me was fired because of new management. Her plan for me was to be captain that‚Äôs why she started me at $26/hr with a contract for a raise after 60 days. She gave me the raise after 31 days.

When she was fired; new management openly said during staff meetings that they were upset that I got paid so high, this was 2 years ago. 

 It really upset me. So much so that I can‚Äôt sleep. Do I just keep on going with this job or take a leap somewhere else where I can grow more?

I want to disclose this isn‚Äôt my career. I‚Äôve graduated and am going back to school again next year (took a year off) for another degree and then finally going to get a big girl job.

But I'm not allowed to get any of the food i get that's stored in the garage unless my friend goes into the garage and gets it for me. (nobody else has my food that's not the issue). But if i go in the house, my friend will most likely have to go with me everywhere, whether its in the house, or out. (I live in a trailer) Hell, even on my drive to work sometimes.

1eh7ag5,Am I about to be fired?,"I know this is long but I'm a young professional (25F) and really need help.

  
I have a BA & MBA in HR + DEI work. While in grad school I worked as an HR intern, then got hired as an HR Assistant (salaried). I graduated, left my HR Assistant job because the boss was horrible and the new job search lasted two years until I was recently hired at my current organization as an HR Assistant working part time (20hrs a week, just hit my 60 day mark on 7/20). My boss (HR Director) was really impressed with my interviewing and recognized that I am low in experience. I mentioned how eager I am to learn, grow, and contribute to the success of the organization. Also that I would appreciate feedback/criticisms because I don't believe you can improve your skills without them. 

What's concerning: 

- I've been working very closely alongside her during hiring processes for multiple open positions and was suddenly cut out midway through our recent position - wherein I didn't even know we had hired a candidate until I found out through a colleague. 

- She scheduled a 1hr meeting on our calendar 8/6 with no email regarding what the meeting is for/what I should come prepared to discuss. This is particularly odd as we have not ever formally scheduled time together, she has an open door policy and we just ping each other when either of us wants to chat in her office.

- My 60 day review was night and day from my 30 day review. I got no feedback other than ""make sure my calendar is up to date with my working hours for all staff to see"". Not a single constructive piece of feedback, it also felt rushed. Maybe 10mins long vs the hour long meeting we had for my 30 day review. 

- I've been leading the venue search for a staff party in late August & was instructed to go scout a place to confirm it meets our needs. This has been an email thread with both my boss and the Exec. Director since Day 1. When I followed up about doing venue scouting tomorrow (8/1), she replied and told me that our Executive Director had decided to postpone to September. Seems odd I wouldn't have been included in that update...

1eh6j00,I have an evaluation tomorrow and the anxiety is literally making me sick.,"I recently started a job about 5 months ago. Despite the employee handbook saying the introductory period is 6 months for some reason they want to do an evaluation tomorrow.

I‚Äôve made mistakes these past few months. This position is intense. There was no formal training. I was just handed work to do with little information and I‚Äôve fumbled because I was still trying to get my footing. 

For some context this is a nonprofit job where I am doing both marketing and grant writing under the supervision of both the marketing director and business development person. So I‚Äôm responsible for two very different things. It‚Äôs along. This nonprofit also has 8 different service programs that has taken me a few months to fully grasp all of them. 

Anyway my main mistakes have been attention detail related and now of course the day before my evaluation I made a spelling error in a marketing flyer that was caught by the Executive Director.

Awesome.

So now my brain is going to ‚Äúwell you‚Äôre done‚Äù.

I‚Äôm trying to rationalize things. Like maybe they‚Äôll just say they‚Äôd like to see a better performance, but naturally as someone with horrid and debilitating anxiety - my mind has prepared myself that I‚Äôll be terminated. They sent me a self evaluation form to fill out and told me we‚Äôd have a discussion.

It sucks to feel so small and like such a failure when it‚Äôs only been 5 months. ",ItsPrettyBizarre,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1722482231,2024-08-01 03:17:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eh6j00/i_have_an_evaluation_tomorrow_and_the_anxiety_is/,8,2024

1eh5xr5,Looking for Direction: Tech Career Paths and Study Abroad Options/ Global Tech Opportunities,"Hello everyone,

I need some help. I finished high school with pretty good grades, but they weren't enough to secure a full scholarship. I applied to many scholarships and did earn some money, but I ended up attending a community college for four years. I'm studying Information Technology and Informatics, and fortunately, financial aid and scholarships covers everything, so I don't have to pay for anything right now.

I don't mind going to community college, but I've always dreamed of going away for school. My plan is to go abroad for my master's after finishing my degree because this would be my first time living away from home. My mom is subtly trying to hold me back, and my brother doesn't believe I'll actually go, but I really want to. I aspire to get my master's in cybersecurity and am considering studying in China, the UK, or anywhere outside of the U.S.

I feel like I'm a thousand steps behind and want to start getting a plan together. I've heard that the tech industry is struggling right now, and I'm worried about my prospects after graduation. I need advice on what I can do to ensure I get a job and what key job titles I should be looking for. I'm particularly interested in medical tech or government positions, or any role that would offer relocation opportunities. I wouldn't even mind working outside the USA.

I haven't had a real tech internship because they fill up so fast, but I've worked in roles involving customer service and advising students. Additionally, I'm interested in the beauty industry, book industry, movie industry, and working for a popular company. I know with not having a lot of tech internships, I might have to start at a smaller company.

I feel like I've been in my small town since birth, and I don't want to be another person who stays here forever.

1eh5woh,"Pay confusion, I need help?","I started a new job on the 24th of July, I have worked 4 shifts so far and I work 35 hours a week. I got told by my manager that since I started after the 17th I wouldn't get paid in July. I thought that meant at the end of August I'd get the paid for the full 140 hours id do in August + the 28 hours I did last month. 

But then I was told by some family members that I would only be getting paid the 28 hours I've already done + only 2 weeks of work at the end of August. 

I thought it would be like this: let's say I get ¬£15ph, I have worked 168h so that means I get ¬£2520 at the end of August.

But I'm told it's like this: the 17th is a cut of date so only the hours I've worked until then are counted towards my pay in August. So I'll only be getting paid for the 28h I have done in July + the 70h up to the cut of date (aug 17). So I'm basically only getting 3 weeks pay and not 5 week.

I've been able to finish an associate of science in Pre-Engineering (100% paid off) but that has not really helped me in the labor market in any significant way.  
I am certain that finishing the  EE degree would boost my job opportunities, experience, and life quality. However, as a father my responsability to my family is something that I treasure above all.  
Why do I say all of this?, I am currently on a ""good"" job as it pays enough, allows me to finish my career, but it limits my growth, benefits are expensive, co-workers are not properly checked for the positions they hold (I am not describing what I do).

My work experience is all over the place, but it mainly revolves around mechanics (Cars, planes), IT, customer service, and environmental services (Think custodian).  
I am unsure of whether or not to continue as I am right now and finish my degree in 2 years (give or take 1 semester) and avoid the majority of student debt or go full into it and accrue higher loan amounts but finish quicker (about 1 year + 1 semester).

Regarding notice of resignation:

""We generally ask that you provide at least two weeks‚Äô written notice... If an employee provides less notice, he or she may be ineligible for rehire depending on the circumstances regarding the notice given""

So I have been debating a major career change for a while now. About a year ago I was considering leaving the government to create my own home daycare. It feels like a 180 but I am so sick of the work culture, the lack of freedom, lack of purpose, micromanagement, burocracy etc. my daughter is young too so this would allow me to be there after school, focus on my home more in term of cleaning and activities vs always struggling to juggle a corporate job and my home life. The idea of working for myself sound so good üò≠ my plan is to get my home daycare licensed so I make enough money to live well (I‚Äôm in Canada if that helps). I went to see my doctor this week and she kept talking about how the economy is bad out there and to watch that I‚Äôm not making an impulsive decision which made me spiral in self doubt.

1eh3e1q,How to prove myself to my boss?,"
 So sorry if this is long. 

Alright so it‚Äôs my first job out of college, and I‚Äôve been here for less than a year. It‚Äôs in marketing, very jack of all trades as I do a bunch of marketing communications / analytics / creative work. It‚Äôs in a pretty niche industry too, so it‚Äôs been a bit of a learning curve but I think I‚Äôve come along way!

A few weeks ago, a coworker made a comment that she gets the sense our boss doesn‚Äôt really like me. I asked her to elaborate and she gave some decent examples of how he interacts with me, but told me to keep my head up as it might just be an age difference thing since I‚Äôm the youngest in the office. 

Well now my boss came to me with some complaints about my performance and while I‚Äôve been working hard to improve upon these, it just doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting anywhere.

The first of his complaints was that I‚Äôm too chatty and I‚Äôm not very professional. Prime example given: interns wrote on my white board ‚Äúcertified yapper‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt erase it because it made my coworkers laugh and strike up conversation when they walked by. Regardless, this is something I CAN fix so not a big deal. 

But as for the other two, he said I don‚Äôt comprehend things as well as I should after nine months, and that things are taking longer than they should. If I don‚Äôt show improvement, I‚Äôll be considered for termination. 

I didn‚Äôt want to basically admit I was failing to my coworkers or start any drama, but I did ask for some general advice about things they‚Äôve noticed I do well or could improve upon, and here‚Äôs what they said:

A senior told me that I don‚Äôt stick up for myself enough when our boss gives unreasonable timelines, which makes me feel better about how long things are taking me but obviously I can‚Äôt tell my boss to cut me some slack right now. Then I told another coworker I felt like I was having trouble comprehending things enough, and she assured me that from what she‚Äôs seen, I‚Äôm doing fine. When she had my job, it took her around two years to finally feel like she was actually comprehending anything. 

Both of them made me feel better,  but I still have no idea how to go about proving myself to my boss and being better about these things. 

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if maybe this whole thing is just a giant comparison to my coworkers? He kept mentioning how driven and dedicated they were‚Ä¶ my coworkers seriously live and breathe this job. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times my boss has reiterated that this is a salary position and I should be coming in early, working late, and getting things done on weekends if I have too. (I‚Äôm typically here before my boss and I‚Äôm almost always the last to leave)

I haven‚Äôt made any huge mistakes, or been painfully late on anything. But it just feels like there‚Äôs a noose around my head that could be pulled at any moment for the tiniest blunder and I‚Äôve been so on edge. If I lose this job, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do, I will quite literally be screwed after moving out of state for this position and still not having enough savings to really keep me afloat. 


I could just use some advice, or guidance. How do I prove myself?? 

ALSO - There‚Äôs rumors this job I do might turn into 2-3 jobs in the near future, if that shows just how much I do üòÆ‚Äçüí® maybe if I can find a way to stick it out until then, it‚Äôll be easier to really do my best with less on my plate who knows",sadsporkyy,1,1.0,3,1722472982,2024-08-01 00:43:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eh3e1q/how_to_prove_myself_to_my_boss/,8,2024

I am a 21F new grad in a new grad development program working in a major Canadian city in a financial institution. I have been in my role for 2 months (rounding up). Before I started my first rotation (going to be in this team till Feb 2025), my rotation manager (my manager for the time I am going to be on this team), said that the team is very high functioning and expectations are very high. I know everyone says that but I feel like they were right. Recently I am getting the sense that my team is not super happy with my performance. They understand that I just started my role and I am new to working and very young. We also have a bit of a language barrier, the business of the this particular team mainly happens in a language that I would now  say I am intermediate at (before the role I thought I would be advanced). The team thinks I am working slower than expected. I also think that sometimes instructions are not very clear, but I get that it is more or less up to me to get all the info I need. I am worried this would affect my performance review. I would say I do have quite a bit of time to turn this around. Any advice on how I ca navigate this situation to protect myself? None of the seemingly negative feedback has gone into writing yet. I would not even say it is a verbal warning, but I feel that I need to knock it out of the park or a verbal warning is coming my way.
