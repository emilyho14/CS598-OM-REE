1eh16xq,Looking for advice on negotiating a promotion offer ,"Hello, 

I have recently been offered a promotion and feeling a little underwhelmed by the offer. 

For a bit of context:
I joined as an associate engineer and my salary was 57000, after working for a year got a 5% bump (which is pretty standard) - 59850. This is right in the midpoint of salary ranges for my level according to my manager.

Also, there were 2 new hires at this level recently who got 59850 as they joined.

Worked another 6 months and got the promotion offer with a 5% bump. 

Im in Europe, and the company doesn't have much presence where I am so there's not much I can find on the internet. But from what I gathered, there is at least 20% difference in salary in other regions. Plus, those salaries come with stock options which I do not get(I asked, but they cant offer right now) 

So I guess my question is, am I freaking out for no reason or how to approach this situation. Been really hoping I can get the promotion and rest easy, but now I can't shake the feeling that I'm being underpaid.

1eh0vu0,Moving companies reference question,"Hi, I have been working at my current company straight out of university for 5 years now. I have moved through 3 different positions however feel the development/compensation of my role does not fit with my future career goals.

So I want to start looking elsewhere, the trouble is who do I go to/how do I start the conversation RE references? I know a lot of people will pretty much look for and accept a job before their boss even knows, using a previous boss as their reference. 

My issue is that my current boss and previous boss are friends, and the same with the boss before that. In my eyes this means I would have to have the ""looking"" conversation before applying anywhere. 

I don't know how well this would go down, without saying the whole gameplan I would likely ask him to be a reference if he is comfortable, but likely go with his boss and my previous boss.

Has anyone gone through something similar? Am I overthinking things?",Monthral,1,1.0,0,1722466072,2024-07-31 22:47:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eh0vu0/moving_companies_reference_question/,7,2024

1eh0ko3,Feeling extremely underpaid and not given the right job title,"Hey all, I am in a rather peculiar situation and I'd like to know what you all think I should do.

I am a 22 year-old with a BA in Economics from a reputable university, I finished my Bachelor's in 2 years, took an investment bank internship and subsequently took a job in AML/Risk Management making 70k + bonus immediately. I live in a MCOL city.

I ended up hating the job and suffered from extreme anguish that got so bad that I was crying in the office. With the blessing of my therapist, I made the hard decision to quit my rather sought-after job at the investment bank and took a few months off to figure out what I wanted to do. I ended up trying a few things, including being a real estate agent.

  
I ended up taking an interview at a wealth manager and I fell in love with it, I unfortunately was beat out for the Investment Analyst role by some dude with a master's degree. Kept getting final interviews for high-paying finance jobs but couldn't push it through. I decided to start working on my CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) designation, which leads us to the present day:

I got desperate and ended up taking a job at a local metal product manufacturing and construction company. The job was supposed to be for a Project Coordinator that pays 42k a year, this is an hourly position.

The benefits are horrible as far as I could tell.

No 401(k) match, oppressively high health insurance rates, 10 PTO days, 0 sick days, no bonus and no paid holidays until 90 days of employment.

The CEO and COO quickly ended up taking an interest in me and my financial background and abilities. I have recently been helping them with operations and business strategy. I no longer do a single thing that my job description says, and my new direct report is the COO. He seems very satisfied with my performance and he continues to pull me in on new initiatives, such as helping decide on salary ranges and defining processes.

  
I still make my 21 an hour and I feel very underpaid, I have been doing market research and am expected to present my findings to upper management soon. Additionally, I helped implement a new ERP software for the company and I have also been writing procedures and best practice documents for the software, along with doing weekly team meetings. I've been there for just about 3 months now. I know it hasn't been long but I feel like I have been way worth more than 42k, as every job I applied for and almost got was paying upwards of 65k. I will never be able to move out on this salary and it's definitely not a living wage.

  
Do I have ground to stand on at this point for asking for a proper job title, and getting a wage that more accurately expresses my education and current values to the firm? How should I go about it?

  
Thank you all!",Odd-Phase-3686,1,1.0,0,1722465282,2024-07-31 22:34:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eh0ko3/feeling_extremely_underpaid_and_not_given_the/,7,2024

1egzwyv,Help! Should I Go Back to School or Keep Hustling?,"I'm 22 and kinda at a crossroads right now. Four years ago, I decided not to go to college and instead dove into trying to make money on my own. Fast forward to today, I’ve managed to stash away about 75k CAD from various gigs and side hustles, and I don't have major bills or anything.

Lately, though, I’ve been hit with this nagging feeling that maybe I should’ve gone to school and balanced that with my side projects. This thought got so strong that I ended up applying to business school and, surprise, I got in!

Now I’m super conflicted. If I go back to school, I’ll be 26 when I graduate and will have student loans. Plus, I don’t want a corporate job—I’m all about building my own company. I thought I’d have that figured out by now, but here we are.

On the flip side, I’m thinking maybe I should just keep grinding and focus on sales or other avenues where a degree isn’t crucial. I’m worried that going to school might just delay things even more.

So, Reddit, what’s your take? Should I hit the books and get that degree or stick to hustling and find another way to make my dreams happen? Appreciate any insights or stories you’ve got!

1egzofo,Coworker told me that they wanted the position I got.,"I recently started working as a scribe at my local cardiology office. Previous history of scribing/ medical assisting in orthopedics. 

I really appreciate being close to home and overall I am very pleased working there! 

Some animosity built up over the past couple of weeks between someone who has been there for about a year now. She came up to my desk and started asking me if I could tell that she was upset and I told her no not necessarily (because how am I supposed to know what is bothering her if she doesn’t tell me lol)

She goes on to say that she was scribing a little bit for the doctor and then when I started working that she has been pushed to the side, she continued to talk about how it’s bothered her given her tenure (1 year) and relationship with the doctor. I really didn’t know what to say, I was just listening to her go on about it.

I asked her if she had spoken up about wanting to do it, and she said she has told the doctor that she does appreciate being in the rooms with him as a scribe. I really didn’t know what to say at that point. 

I have only been there 3 weeks at this time and I really don’t understand fully why this is going on. I have been very friendly and neutral with everyone and I have caught on quickly.

I was also told (and have seen some charts) that she hasn’t been doing a very good job at documenting the encounter (just bare minimum putting orders in with no info).

Maybe I just don’t understand or something but I feel super ICKY that she would tell me all of this and I just feel strange now, especially with me being new and not knowing her very well.

I couldn’t see why someone would be jealous or intimidated by me either. Regardless I am just wanting some advice or maybe even validation that it’s a little weird? Was she trying to manipulate me?",FuzzyDepartment0,41,0.8799999952316284,20,1722463052,2024-07-31 21:57:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1egzofo/coworker_told_me_that_they_wanted_the_position_i/,7,2024

I am nervous this might cause drama of some sort. 

For more insight current job has me at $19, job offer I just received is $21. 401k match is a lot better, they pay for all holidays off and they offer flexible work days unlike current job. Bad side is current job is more laid back as for the other one is more fast-paced. Just need some advice on if it's worth leaving...

1egyzvq,Conflict in mind,"I am currently interning as an internal auditor at company A this summer and was given the opportunity to extend my internship. The reason why I got the extension was because I raised the question to ask for an opportunity, and they agreed to extend it until I graduate next year (when I obtained the masters program). However, I already have a full-time offer from a different company (company B -more prestigious) whom I will start right after my graduation. The manager at Company A said they would expect me to re-apply and change the status to full-time, after I complete the master program. In this case, I don’t know if I should take this opportunity?

P/s: company B allows me to intern before I join them, and I also signed my offer letter with company B. I am certain that I will want to start my career at company B. The reason I want to work with company A was because I need to accumulate years of experience for certifications (things similar to CPA etc).

1egxne7,22 and already feel stuck in my career any advice appreciated.,"22 From the north east of England and graduated from university just over 1 year ago, initially landed myself a grad scheme for a company in the construction industry on 27k, but 200 miles away from home, I relocated spent 11 months there and worked up to 31k but I wasn’t gaining any “engineering experience” I was offered a job at home on 40k as a Mechanical Project Engineer, which has turned out to be a mechanical equipment technician role with a slightly fancier title. 

I don’t know whether to start looking back to grad schemes to try and develop myself as an engineer before trying to branch into project management, to stick at the company I’m at and try to reach management level here, or to potentially go back to uni for a masters/teaching qualification?

1egxfvc,How do I keep my mouth shut about job interviews and keep my stakes low?,"I am only recently a believer that the more you tell people you've got a job interview, the more you're likely to jinx it and fail. And it was earlier today when it all caved in; an interview I had high stakes for (a friend referred me to the company) fell through, and I didn't make it through the cut.

Leading up to the interview, I felt optimistic about getting the job - I even looked at houses with optimal public transit access to its office! And I must admit, I think it's the fact that I'm only 21 years old and only had a handful of interviews that got the better of me in this case. 

But my thoughts don't necessarily always translate to action. I ended up telling everyone about it, and my trigger-happy attitude got the better of me somehow in ways I can't explain. 

So, how do people manage their expectations and keep one's mouths shut leading up to an interview, especially with a gob that yaps around and therefore jinxes itself? Thank you.

The schedule, work, and pay were all great. I spent 3 years at an agency and 5 years as a college recruiter before that. Interviews for recruiting are hard to come by.   
  
With the state of the recruiting market, I'm seeking a change. HR does not really interest me, but I'm not opposed. I've thought about IT or project management, but both would require certificates. I've thought sales due to potential income and my agency recruitment time. I need to take a leap in one direction, but I do not know how to go.

1egw600,Do I call and withdraw my name from consideration or just wait to see if I get the offer.,"There is an organization in my state that is really large in my industry, they have a lot of different programs and subcontract out a lot of work. 

I currently work for one of their subcontractors but recently applied to work for them directly on a different program. I was open with my boss about having applied and he was supportive and agreed to be a reference. 

It would be a lateral move. I went through two rounds of interviews and the position is competitive but it's looking good for me. 

My boss believes I'll get the position and used that to fast track a promotion he has been trying to get me for over a year. So now I have a promotion and will be making a hair more starting tomorrow than the high end of the pay scale for this other position. I am deciding to stay where I'm at. 

I want to have a good reputation with this organization and I don't want it to look like I wasted their time to twist my current employer's arm. Do I email them and ask them to withdraw me from consideration or just wait until I get the job offer? 

Side question: I don't think it would be very professional of me to wait until I get the job offer and then use my current promotion to ask for something higher than their posted pay scale plus it's competitive so they probably wouldn't go for it anyway.

1egvhrx,Should I Follow Up After Four Rounds of Interviews?,"I've gone through four rounds of interviews for a new position at a small but growing company. The process was initiated by a recruiter who reached out to me. Each interview went well, and I received positive feedback after every round. The Chief of Staff even mentioned that the feedback on me was amazing, and during one interview, the main boss explicitly said that they hope to work something out with me.

However, it's now been four weeks since my last interview. After waiting two weeks, I got an update last week saying that the boss has been busy, either out of town or difficult to pin down for a conversation about the role. This update came directly from the Chief of Staff, though most communication up to this point has been through the recruiter.

I'm feeling conflicted because I want to follow up for another update, but I'm also worried about coming across as too pushy and potentially harming my chances. To add to the situation, I have a vacation planned in three weeks, so I would need to put in my two weeks' notice by Monday if I get the role. This timing is important because I don't want to have to cancel or reschedule my vacation, and giving just one week's notice would negatively impact my current team, whom I care about.

What would you suggest I do in this situation?

**TL;DR:**  
I've completed four interviews for a new role at a growing company with positive feedback throughout, but it's been four weeks since the last one.

1egtsj5,Best Entry Level Opportunities For Upcoming Econ Major.,"Hello everyone,

I’ll be graduating in the near future with my Bachelors in Economics. I’m not a traditional college student. I went back to college at 27 and I’ll be graduating at 30. I have worked in the service industry for the past 10 years and I’ve been pretty successful with my career path to this point. I’m currently making about 70k a year but I’m more than happy to take a temporary pay cut to start my transition into a new career more aligned with my degree.

I’m wondering what recommendations you might have for a good entry level job to build relevant skills and contacts. I’m open to anything. I don’t necessarily have a dream job. I love economics, and after 10 years of the service industry I day dream about any job with PTO and a 401k match. I have started to apply for bank teller positions and customer service roles for brokerage firms (Fidelity specifically). Any other positions I should be keeping my eye out for? I know internships will be recommended but I cannot take on any unpaid internships. I have a son and a wife and I provide a majority of the financial needs for my household. Any advice is appreciated!

1egtm8u,45 and just lost. ,"I guess this post is just more to get it off my chest than anything, but any advice is appreciated. 

I worked my way up the ladder and took a risk with a startup a few years ago. It seemed a great opportunity, best money over ever made. Unfortunately it only lasted a year before shutting down. 

I was essentially an assistant project manager. The downside is that I have no degree, and none of what I did for that company can be verified. And most of the jobs I’m seeing within my skill set just don’t pay enough to keep up with the cost of living here. 

Out of desperation I went the CNA route and have been looking at nursing school. While I know I would enjoy that, it’s just looking more and more impossible from a financial perspective. I’m barely paying the bills now, I don’t know how the hell I’m going to keep the lights on while going to school full time. 

At this point I feel like I might be better off looking at some sort of trade apprenticeship.

1egt4yy,"Former journalist searching for a more creative, fulfilling career path","I am 31F in the Atlanta area with a B.A. in political science from a reputable but not elite university. I have spent much of my career in media (about 10 years in journalism counting freelancing, four years at a major newspaper in a top 10 market, covered a presidential primary and general election at a smaller market paper, two years as executive editor of a small magazine with statewide distribution) and spent about three years in the marketing/PR space. As a reporter, my main interests were politics, state government, arts and entertainment, food, and criminal justice.

I currently work as an editorial content strategist for a large media company. My main responsibilities include content enhancement, search engine optimization, hub and spoke modeling, heuristic evaluations, creating topic audience reports (researching a high priority topic and creating an audience profile re age, socioeconomic status, gender, race, location, habits, etc), and building new content designed to rank highly in search. I've been told by a friend in UX design there is some overlap between UX and content strategy, but I have no experience in UX or tech.

I have ADHD and have been diagnosed since I was 15. This affects my organizational capabilities, short-term memory, ability to self-motivate without pressure, and predisposition to procrastinate. I find I do the best in roles that have short-term or quick-turn assignments compared to long-term projects. I can succeed in long-term projects when tasks are broken up into individual pieces with their own deadlines, so I can check items off a list instead of feeling the entire project looming over me.

**What I love about my current and previous jobs:**

* Conducting research and learning new things
* Having a tangible outcome of my work
* Problem-solving (examples include figuring out how to structure an article once all the research/reporting is done or working to enhance an article's keyword density, SEO ranking, and comprehensiveness)

**What I don't love about my current and previous jobs:**

* Being bound to an office
* Being bound to a 9-5 schedule
* Corporate culture bullshit (mandatory fun, having to make facetime with VPs who don't remember my name, endless meetings)
* Interested in but not terribly enthused by the work
* I would simply rather be doing so many other things

**What I enjoy on my own time:**

* **Crochet** - I like to design my own clothing, blankets, accessories, pet toys, home goods, etc. I know I can sell these things in theory, but the administrative work involved in setting up an Etsy shop overwhelms me
* **Gardening** - I love growing my own food, starting plants from seed, figuring out the right placement and nutrition, seeing the progress in the plants, etc. I maintain both an outdoor edible garden and many indoor houseplants.
* **Crafts and Creating Things** - I regularly get into phases like wax sealing or covering objects with disco tiles. I have the same issue with the stuff I make that I do with my crochet work -- yes I could sell it, but the admin work is overwhelming for me. I make things like disco tile globes, disco tile coasters, self-adhesive wax seals, felt ball garlands and coasters, scented candles using thrifted glassware as vessels, etc
* **Non-fiction writing** - I like to journal and am interested in first-person non-fiction or opinion writing. However, there are not a ton of platforms that pay for that material anymore
* **Interior design** - I am very passionate about creating a space of my own, and interior design is one activity in which I can be very focused on the details
* **Thrift/antique shopping** - I am knowledgeable about high-value and high-quality brands and items that can often be bought secondhand. I have basically been a personal thrift shopper for two friends -- one for wedding decor and one for china and decor for a lunch party. I have tried advertising myself locally for this kind of work, but nobody has bitten.
* **Bartending** - I do this part time and it really works for the way my brain works -- it's all about quick-turn tasks to check off and being good with customers. I'd probably bartend full-time if I knew it would pay the bills.
* **Wine/beer/cocktails** - I worked in retail wine sales for six months and have been in my brewery bartending job (which also includes making cocktails) for nearly a year. I have a working knowledge of wine that makes my friends think I may as well be a sommelier, but that an actual sommelier would probably recognize as advanced beginner or intermediate knowledge. I am a Cicerone Certified Beer Server, which means I passed the first level test for the organization that is basically the sommeliers of beer. I would like to get a wine certification (probably WSET or CWS because I don't want to work a restaurant floor), and potentially a cocktail/spirits certification if I continue working in the beverage world. I would probably pursue a wine certification eventually even if I wasn't working with wine because I love learning about it.
* **Film** - I love watching film classics, indies, and foreign film; I've watched at least 120 new movies this year so far. I love thinking critically about film and the meaning behind it, as well as how it is made and the decisions directors and actors make. I was a very bad actor in middle and high school, but got two opportunities to student direct and one opportunity to direct a one-act play, and I loved it. I wanted to pursue directing for the stage in college as a minor when I was 18, but my mom said I had to have a ""real degree""
* **Music** - I have 10 years of classical voice (opera) training and singing has been my one true passion my entire life. I wanted to major in vocal performance in college, but parents nixed that as ""not a real major."" I would've been allowed to major in music education because my parents saw that as a better employment prospect, but I hate children and do not want to be a teacher. I have looked for choirs and other singing opportunities locally but haven't found anything that's a good fit.
* **Hosting parties** - I love creating a party, from an extravagant food and beverage spread to fun decor. This feeds both my creativity and my need to socialize.
* **Fashion -** I have always had a really strong interest in fashion, and I am known by my friends to have a loud, bold style. I am really aesthetically driven and love a combination of highbrow-lowbrow.
* **Comedy** - I have completed five levels of improv comedy classes (the full curriculum of one theater in town) and occasionally perform improv and stand-up locally, for free. I never really considered comedy as a career path because it is a grind and few people can actually make it full-time. But the skills I have as an improviser/comedian include humorous writing, working well with others, being open to new ideas, and being willing to put myself in uncomfortable situations.

**My Strengths**

* **Creativity** - crochet, crafts, interior design, fashion, comedy, etc
* **People skills** - The last time I was interviewing for jobs, I was told by multiple interviewers that I was great with people, have ""great energy,"" I was a ""great interview"" etc. In my bartending job and previous retail jobs, customers have repeatedly told me how kind and helpful I am, including one person saying ""You're the nicest person who works here."" I think I can capitalize on my inherent people skills -- journalism was a huge boon in building these because I spent a decade cold-calling strangers who didn't want to talk to me in hopes I could convince them otherwise.
* **Curiosity** - I love research and learning. I got my Cicerone Certified Beer Server not because my bartending job wanted me to, but because I saw my bartending job as an excuse to finally take the leap on the certification. I'd loved craft beer for years and already did a lot of learning, and always wanted to start the Cicerone process. I like challenging myself and expanding my knowledge and skill set. I also have so many ideas of things I'd study if I could afford to go to grad school (women's studies, media studies, sociology, urban planning/public policy, fiber arts, product design, etc)
* **Broad cultural knowledge** - Because of my wide range of interests, history in journalism, and a brain that seems to retain exclusively information useful at trivia night, I know a little about a lot, and sometimes a lot about a lot. This helps me with learning curves often, as I tend to have a little more information and context than the average bird.

**Limitations**

* **Money** - I am not in the financial position to quit my job without another lined up, start a degree or certification program, or invest in another kind of training program at the moment
* **Network** - I don't know a lot of people out of my field locally

**What I've Previously Considered**

* **Opening a store** - Biggest limitation is money. Unless I won a few days of Jeopardy, this is unrealistic
* **Floral design**
* **Interior design**
* **Production design (film and TV)** - Atlanta is a big film/TV production hub. Biggest limitation would be lacking professional experience, which would probably put me low on the ladder and thus in a low-paying job
* **Wine sales -** I love wine and learning about wine but I don't really like sales. But this is the best-paying option outside of being an on-the-floor sommelier, which I don't want to do.
* **Event planning -** I would excel at the creative side but I would not be good at the logistics
* **Film programming -** Probably unrealistic as there are very few of these jobs; this role is usually for festivals and art house movie theaters. While I know a lot about film, I have no academic or professional film background
* **Film/music/fashion/cultural criticism -** Similar problem as above. These jobs barely exist anymore, are mostly freelance and don't pay great unless you can get on salary at a big publication.

If you've read all of this, thank you so much. If you have any suggestions on what a potential future career change could be, I'd love to hear them. I'm stuck in a career of doing things I'm good at, but that I don't love and don't always find stimulating. I want to do something that I enjoy doing and feel a little more freedom in my day-to-day.

My only hang up is how new this place is. Everything sounds great, in theory but the growth they are hoping to have, they don’t have it yet. They have no sales, no contracts, only like 5 accounts and their product has not hit stores so they really don’t know if their product will sell or not.

1egsryd,Additional thoughts on “Choose the money” ,"It seems like the classic question of choosing a career you love vs. choosing a career that makes you money gets asked a lot here, and the vast majority of the answers and votes are for money. Answers often frame work and money as what enables happiness elsewhere. I want to offer some other perspectives to consider.

First, it's important to note that for some people, working a meaningless job is not an option. You might wonder, ""Then why are they asking the question in the first place?"" Well, there are people who haven't taken the time to think about what constitutes personal success for themselves. If they did, they might find that working a meaningful job is non-negotiable. So my first response to the original question is always, ""Have you listed the things that will make you feel like you’ve led a fulfilling life?"" rather than just suggesting that the job that pays the most money is always the right choice for them.

Second, work helps us meet many of our needs. These needs are different from the list of things that will make us feel like we’ve led a fulfilling life. While that list might include goals like ""I made the people I love feel loved"" or ""I made my kids feel like I was the best parent,"" the needs list includes things you might find near the top of your own Maslow hierarchy. For me, these needs include ""the need to feel respected"" or ""the need to use my brain."" We often talk about how a job taken solely for money enables happiness elsewhere, but even the highest-paying job may not satisfy these other needs. Telling people to take a job for the money when they have other needs they expect a job to fulfill can also lead to unhappiness. I always encourage people to come up with their list of needs, in addition to considering money.

Finally, just to share some more of my general philosophy: I think happiness in life should depend on something we all have an equal chance of achieving. It seems too unjust to me that each person’s happiness should depend on the amount of professional success they achieve because professional success isn’t entirely under our control. Luck, bias, privilege, family, etc., all play a role in how professionally successful someone is. So my thinking is that happiness should depend on personal success. Personal success is individual. It's defined by the person themselves, and only they know what constitutes personal success for them (e.g., for me, ""I made my kids feel loved"") and only they can judge whether they achieved it.

Just some additional perspectives to consider alongside the answer ""choose the money.""

1egsret,"2024 Grad, Can't Decide Career Path After Constant Joining Delays.","Long post but please read it and help me!


Hi! As the title suggests I am 2024 graduate, got campus placement at a modest service based company at 7.5 lpa. However, the joining has been delayed twice, with the latest date being pushed to October 2024.

Now, I am jobless, staying at home and got bored. I enjoy making projects but it's really not THAT intersting to me. I have started attending to my father's construction business (it's relatively new venture, just 4 years old so this is not a massive operation). I enjoy being the supervisor and learning about the craft of constructing homes and other projects. The real life problem solving l, such as dealing with buyer, seller, contractor, architect, and even area officials is very intriguing to me. 

However, the main problem with this venture is that it's fairly new, the newer tax implementations would also hamper the operation, and there is no consistent monthly payout. 

What should I do? I do enjoy developing stuff but I can't see myself doing that just because it's my job. However, and it may sound silly, but the corporate life does seems more attractive than being in the construction business where I'd have to deal with non-corporate personnel. 

I do enjoy the construction business, the money is way better than what I'll be making in corporate even after let's say 3 years of experience (not trying to downplay engineers, but with my skill level I can't see myself getting a 4X-5X bump in my salary).

1egs9dl,21M I’m heavily conflicted on what career path I should take so to engineer or airline pilot?,"Some background: my dad, who is also a pilot, took me on a flight, and I fell in love while sitting in the cockpit. I've completed my degree and have two years of internship experience in software engineering. However, the experience never felt as exhilarating as flying a plane.

The conflict arises because IT offers many opportunities to live outside my current country, which has a poor economy. One of my life goals is to secure strong citizenship for my kids' safe future. Personally, I think I'll do above average in IT but not reach the top, like getting into Microsoft, because I'm not that passionate about it, although I do have some interest.

Becoming an airline pilot would require me to stay in my current country and fly for the national carrier for about four years before possibly moving to carriers in the Middle East. This might mean sacrificing the citizenship opportunities that IT could provide. I feel it's a lose-lose situation: in IT, I might achieve the citizenship and freedom I want, but I'll always wonder, ""What if I became a pilot?"" Conversely, if I become a pilot, I'll wonder, ""What if I got a different citizenship?""

I'm conflicted and unsure what to prioritize.

It’s not too bad but i got another offer from that i decided to take. (i had the interviews at the same time and assumed the other moved forward) it’s been a really rough decision debating.

I feel really really bad as where i am working now they are super behind and so far i have been helping them play catch up. The organization is super short staffed all around and many people are leaving. The person who is training me (who use to be in my position) has put in her two weeks and last day will be next week. I feel so bad doing this to then. I have signed the new job offer but have to go through background check and what not and they told me they are aiming for start date of 8/12 or 8/19 if they can’t get everything done faster. 

I don’t want to put in my two weeks before everything is official and shoot myself in the foot but i don’t want to wait and screw my current job over and leave them even more blindsided. I rather tell them as soon as possible so they can get their affairs in order if need be.

How can i let my new job know? I am emailing them and was thinking of saying. “Thank you for letting me know the estimate timeline and process. Once everything is good and official i would like to put my two weeks in at my current company so if you can continue to update me that would be great.”

1egrkpw,Asking for a title change and raise,"Help preparing for raise/role reclassification conversation. 

I’ve been with my company for 2.5 years. We’re a small 12 employees, 3 million in revenue, software company owned by Private Equity. We recently saw our founders leave and a new leader step in. My role has changed DRASTICALLY. 

I asked for a call to discuss what my future here at the company might look like and to address my compensation. What is a realistic salary to ask for and how much “research/market comp” do I need to be prepared to share. 
Looking at others our size 140k seems reasonable but that’s a HUGE increase and seems unrealistic to expect. 

Additional context: 
I am the founding Customer Success Manager (CSM). I was originally told the salary for the role was 100-120k. I lost my job the day of my final interview. So when I was offered 70k I didn’t push back too much, but got it up to 80k. Two years later I’m at 95k, title still reflects individual contributor. 

I now run the department with 2 direct reports, take place in planning meetings, budget conversations, join senior leadership meetings, ect. This month alone I has 126 meetings…..That’s what I was previously averaging a quarter. I have also out sold our sales team the last 6 quarters with large expansion deals.

I’m just working for a failing small business that is arguably breaking some laws at worst and following poor practices at best. It is taking a huge toll on me. My last job burnt me out as well, though not nearly as badly. So cumulatively between the two, I’m starting to feel severely worn out. 

But with the market as it is, I’m afraid when I’m ready to work again, I won’t be able to find opportunities or I’ll be told some of my experience is now less useful because I’ve taken a break.

The work itself, although allying, is not the problem, the problem is that in this area, each micro task is controlled by my boss and subject to daily quotas.

I can't stand this anymore.

If it was just a company with similar conditions I would say no problem, just change, but it's my 7th employer and it's generally still the same and I end up leaving or getting fired.

I come to the conclusion that I need to find a job where I can accomplish my tasks in a few hours.

1egpm1j,Was just let go in what feels like a semi-unique situation and looking for advice. ,"I taught band for nine years at the MS and HS levels. I dealt with some burnout around COVID and found a job through a contact at a large financial institution servicing loans, which I did for three years. (Two fairly niche skill sets so far.) I was let go with cause (flimsy but irrelevant at this time) effective yesterday. 

Skills/Education/Relevant:

* Microsoft Excel (fairly well)
* Servicing of commercial loans
* Education/training/related
* Soft skills I think I'm good at: communication, problem solving, super high attention to detail (work was never once critiqued in a negative way), time management, prioritization. 
* Through my work they offered educational tools and I took several classes on excel, leadership, communication skills etc. 
* Masters Degree in Educational Leadership. 

Here's my issue, I have no idea what to do from here. Finding teaching jobs was one thing, and I really only left the profession because I ""knew a guy."" I feel way overqualified as a 35 yr old with a masters in leadership to be applying for things like Walgreens, but I don't know where to begin. I'm just out of touch with the labor market. I have great contacts at my former employer reaching out to their contacts and hope something in the same field pans out, but I don't want to leave anything to chance and need to take action on my own. 

Things I've done/know I need to do

* I will file for unemployment - long shot but need to try
* COBRA benefits are being mailed out and I will follow up
* Finishing resume this morning (this is my brain break from that mess)
   * Start applying for jobs

I'm trying to replace 60k with a great benefits package and healthcare for 1 dependent. WFH would be preferable as that's what I had, and while I've immediately stopped I am a few times a week marijuana user (buy legal) so that's an issue for the next month or so. Any advice would be super appreciated. Thank you in advance for your sympathy, but it's not needed. I just need to replace my income and healthcare for my little one!

1egpkrt,Time away from family/Overtime,"Wondering if I should sit down with management to discuss OT/compensation for our shift work. Currently we work two different shifts; Mon-Fri 10hr days with OT after 8hrs daily, and 10 on 4 off with OT after 8hrs daily. We work in remote areas so I travel and stay I'm hotels a lot.

Previously, we received OT on all weekend days, which gave incentive to be away from home on the weekends. Removing those OT hours reduced my gross pay by $1250.

I have a 6month old daughter at home, and I enjoy spending as much time as possible with her. I make a relatively good living for our family, and enjoy my job. But I do not enjoy being away for 10 days at a time. 

There are other companies which would offer a worse work environment (large, a lot of employees so you're just a number type thing), but they offer shifts of 8 on 6 off without OT, same base pay.

My 'wants' are to spend as much time with my family as possible OR be incentivized to work longer shifts by additional compensation. 

How would you approach this situation?
I have it pretty good, and don't want to push any buttons, but my daughter and wife are priority so it has to make sense. Currently I have a company truck/fuel, cell bill paid, good benefits, 4%rrsp match (Canada), $52/hr base pay.

1egp8rs,I need help deciding between job offers ,"I have been at my current company for about 6 months now. I took this job quickly because it was the first one offered to me after I got laid off and I was desperate. Now after being here 6 months, I realized I am not connected to the work, and it’s a toxic mean girl culture.

It’s also fully remote, which is a dream for some, but I’m getting kind bored and lazy being home all day, and want a more hybrid setup. The other important this is that I am in a leadership role, but along with doing work I love, I am also in need of some mentorship, which is what I’m looking for in my next role. 

So here are the offers I have: 

Job Offer 1- Hybrid schedule, small company, the owners work remotely in Morocco, so there would not be any opportunity for mentorship, but I’ll get a lot of autonomy over my work, could be an opportunity to learn on my own. There is only one other person that I would work with, and they have a team of consultants they contract for outside sales. No health insurance, 2weeks PTO able to accrue to 5 weeks, 95k a year plus commission 

Job Offer 2- Startup, Fully remote, offers me the chance to work for someone I admire in my industry, but the work seems like it will be uninteresting. I would work with three people directly and they all seem pretty nice. It’s a business development role and for now seems like it’ll be mostly CRM management and cold calling, $120,000 no commission, unlimited PTO, fully paid health insurance, 401k not matched. 

I feel stuck, and I really want to leave my current company, but I also don’t want to jump from one bad option to another so I am being extra cautious.

1egmcll,Advocating for myself? ,"I work in a tech job with a boss that doesn’t want to ever rock any boats or make hard decisions. For the most part that has served me, we have a nice and friendly relationship. My male co - worker and counterpart seems to (in my opinion) steam roll her and try to call the shots for our small team. For example - we work on events at our job and there is one particularly big one every year that I want to be considered to take on. Technically schedule wise - we are both in the same position workload wise to take this on. He has run point on these events the past 4 years - mostly because the rotation has gone that way - but I am pushing this year to work on it (or else my boss would never be proactive about it). She wants me to work it out directly with my co worker and I want her to make a decision either way. We had a small meeting yesterday where my male co worker immediately jumps in with why he has decided he is going to do this event because he wants to work with X, it’s better for his schedule and maybe we can think about me for the next year. Reminder - he is NOT my boss. Then I was put on the spot by being asked “do you agree?” Which made for a really uncomfortable meeting because I proceeded to say that I wasn’t comfortable with it. I felt like I deserved to work on this, I wanted to work with this team and schedule / capacity wise and stature wise we are equals. I don’t think he sees it that way because he’s older and on paper has more years but we have the exact same job. It was clear he wanted me to back down and my boss was sheepish. She placates him a lot. I was super respectful but did not back down for what I wanted and said that I prefer for it to just come down to my boss making the decision. I don’t want to be difficult but I am tired of feeling like I have to concede to make everyone happy and not rock the boat. Also he just assumes we are going to do what he says and wants. The conversation ended weirdly with the plan for my boss to make a decision but he still tried to take control of the situation by saying “he will look into his schedule”

1eglx5o,I received a good job offer outside my home country. Should I accept? Pros and cons.,"Hello. I am a senior chemical engineering student graduating in December 2024. I recently received a job offer for a 2-year rotational program to start on January 2025 at a company outside my home country. I have two days to accept or decline the offer but am not sure what to do.

I prepared a pros and cons list for accepting or declining the offer and I would greatly appreciate your advice to help me choose.

Accepting the offer
Pros:

The 2-year rotational program at this company offers opportunities in four different roles to develop a variety of skills and become a well-rounded professional.

This opportunity would open doors to work in other great companies in this country.

I would experience independent living in this country and be able to explore new landscapes.

The salary for the role is good, there is a hiring bonus and relocation benefits.

Cons:

I would be alone outside of my home country for 2 years, not knowing anyone nearby or having any support in case there is an emergency.

I would have to completely move my lifestyle to a new country where I don't know what areas are the safest to live in.

The job rotations can be located at different places within the country, far away from the original location, which means I have to relocate again for 6 months and then go back to the original location.

I am not able to take my car with me, therefore I would have to buy another one while still paying for the one I have back home.

Even though the pay is higher, the taxes are higher as well. Making the overall net take-home pay basically the same as in my home country.

If I decide to leave before finishing the 2-year program I have to pay back the hiring bonus and everything offered as part of the relocation benefits.

I won't be applying much or any chemical engineering on the job.

Rejecting the offer
Pros:

I would stay in my home country with the chance of entering the rotational program at or any other role at another company more related to my major.

I would not have to pay high taxes nor get a new place, new furniture, or a new car.

I would be at home with my loved ones.

If I don't get an offer to start working right after college I don't have to wait 2 years to get another opportunity.

Cons:

It is not guaranteed that I will get another offer to start working right after graduating. I have to wait until September/October to know if I will have another offer.

Taking all of this into consideration, what would be the best option?",Positive-Guava-2903,0,0.25,3,1722428932,2024-07-31 12:28:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eglx5o/i_received_a_good_job_offer_outside_my_home/,7,2024

After school, I was a trainee for three years at a big event company, working mainly for musicians, at music festivals, and some smaller trade fairs.

I continued doing this job full-time for another two years, and the amount of office work increased since my supervisor said I was doing well at these tasks.

After five years in this industry, I felt the urge to do something completely different and started studying biology, which has always been a passion of mine. Then money became a problem, and I realized that I was missing physical work more than I expected.

So there was another break in my life, and I was a trainee again. I really liked working as a carpenter during this time, and I won several prizes when I finished my vocational training. I manufactured mainly fine solid wood furniture, which is really rare these days.

They offered me a job after my vocational training, but the payment they offered was close to offensive. Unfortunately, there is not a single workshop in the area where I live that specializes in fine wooden furniture except the one I quit.

I found a part-time job at our local theatre. I ""translate"" the ideas from the set designers into 3D CAD models so I can provide production drawings to our carpenters, metalworkers, etc., who are building the sets for our stage plays. I order most of the materials and keep an eye on the budget.

In general, I like this work, but working in public service is something I wish I had never done. It's like working 20 years in the past; everyone is always complaining about the conditions at work, and people are so unmotivated.

I would describe myself as an interested and motivated person. I like working with clients, in bigger teams, and I love working in a varied environment. My biggest flaw might be that once I get a deeper understanding of a subject area, I quickly get bored and want to move on. So being constantly challenged with something new is a must for me.

I don't have the money to go to university again. I am really clueless about what to do with my life. I hope you guys have some suggestions for me.",Chance-Hotel323,1,1.0,0,1722428657,2024-07-31 12:24:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1egltwj/suggestions_for_a_event_technician_and_carpenter/,7,2024

i have my college preference filling date coming up. i was very sure that my first preference was psychology honours as i always had interest in the subject and wanted to practice being a psychologist and even studying more about child psychology. but today my dad and sister told me that psychology+ sociology ba programme, is a really really good course and it would help me to get jobs at very good, reputed and high paying institutions and also the fact that it was pretty much complimentary with psychology as a subject itself. i have never studied sociology neither do i know anything about it so I'm a bit reluctant on that aspect. so i have a couple of questions to ask from you guys. help and advice to me would really really be appreciated :)

1. from a job point of view, which has more scope and potential, psychology honours or ba programme with psychology+ sociology and why?
2. can i still become a psychologist if i take ba programme?
3. would i be able to get my masters in child psychology if I take ba programme?
4. would you recommend me taking psychology + sociology?

1egjevn,"I keep warning my (33f) boss lots of people are about to burn out, but nothing happens. ","I work as a manager managing around 15 people. We work generally around 45-50 hours a week all remotely. 

I’m not even hired to be managing some of these people I’m talking to him about but I keep warning him our team is being given too much with too small a deadline. He often then adds things that are out of our scope and the team feels like they have to do it because they don’t want to let everyone/him down. 

We’ve had people leave in the past due to burnout and our work is super sensitive to when people leave as it takes months to train them and then the rest of the team has to do their work too. Which is why I’m on edge. 

Whenever I broach it with him I think he thinks I’m being sensitive as he is very much of the grind mindset and hustle hustle hustle. He keeps telling me to rephrase it for them as a good thing? Like it’s a good thing to have work which it is but that’s usually only a thing an owner would feel. Everyone keeps saying they have no time to think or actually do their work to 100% 

I told him people are telling me they’re struggling and they need less and nothing gets done. I tell them to ask me for help whenever they need so I help them but in turn it’s burning ME out. I’m making as many boundaries for them as I can but he keeps giving them more and more work. 

I’m thinking I’m just going to stop managing it the way I am and if people leave then he realises why I’ve been warning him. 

Keep in mind my other post I made about work — we are expected to reply on teams a lot and I feel like people are really feeling it. Someone got really close to being fired because they said they would pause notifications after work hours. 

I can’t afford to quit or move jobs. I actually really like this job. But I hate this aspect and don’t know what to do.

Considering that they were pretty quick the last time, does still not hearing back mean they maybe moved on with an another candidate and waiting for their response to write me back?

My boyfriend is in his penultimate year of med school (5y) and will have his final exams next year before beginning his 1y unpaid approbation year that is required here (Germany) before officially graduating. The final exams will take 3-4 months of hardcore exam preparations and the approbation year is another soulless grind, from what I gather.

He's planning to take half a year Off after the final exams, a) to write his dissertation and b) because he didnt really have proper vacations in these 5 years due to exams, papers, internships etc.

Anyway, Id wanna propose to him to to use that time to make one or two more internships, an idea he's open to. The thing is that his program is very practical minded already, so he's had plenty of experience in hospitals, different units and doctor's practices already, including stays abroad. 

So I was looking for some creativity here - what would be good internship ideas that could help a future medical professional but wouldnt be something you'd otherwise get to chance to look into in the course of a medical degree?

1egg532,I New college grad. I don't think I am going to be able to survive the minimal PTO culture in the USA. ,"As a new grad, I am kind of in this innocent state of mind, where I don't yet fully grasp work culture. I am not yet indoctrinated into being a workaholic... and God forbid I ever do. But from what I understand, the USA is f\*cked when it comes to PTO and workers' rights compared to most ""developed"" countries in the Western world. And I am seriously concerned that, for that reason, I won't be able to make it here. I am currently going through my early 20s ""maybe I should move to Europe?"" crisis phase.

I did well in college; I majored in something I am passionate about and can make a good living from. But I also have pretty bad mental health issues, and that's mainly why I worry most about the limited PTO in the USA.  Sometimes In the worst cases the thoughts get really bad, (like maybe I shouldn't be on this earth kinda bad). I go in and out of these depressive episodes, and luckily, I've gotten better in general. But I know how fragile I can be, despite being a passionate and focused individual. And I worry that the USA's habit of cutting corners and giving employees just enough to not go insane, but not enough to keep them sane, will be my downfall. It just sucks that I know I can do good work, I am not a lazy person, and I can get shit done, but WHY do the USA and employers hand us crumbs when it comes to free time, PTO, and work hours? I'm not joking; I think I might not be able to function knowing I can only pick a couple of weeks out of 12 months to see friends and family. Having to nitpick and carefully decide how to spend my limited time off because these employers don't give us more than scraps to work with is just inhumane, and I fear that with my mental health struggles, my fuse will go fast.

  
Overall, It worries me to think that even though I have the ability to work and accomplish things, none of it will matter if I can't fit into the system I was born into. If I can't function in it, It won't even matter. I might as well throw my college education and skills away if I can't learn live with hardly any time for myself. I want to thrive, I want to be able to live, but I worry the USA's work culture might be the death of me. I worry that here in the US we are being squeezed just a bit to hard compared to other developed countries to ever be able to have peace of mind. New college grad. I don't think I am going to be able to survive the minimal PTO culture in the USA.

1egfcls,Transitional Phase of Career - Feeling Lost,"*I'm new to this sub, so please let me know if this is not the right place or style of post for here! Sorry if post is a bit long, I tried to provide enough detail so that people could provide general advice, but I can elaborate on specifics more if needed.*

**tl;dr form**: I am a 29-year old male living in Massachusetts. I've recently chosen to step away from working as a college professor and want to change career path to college/university student affairs. I am feeling extremely lost on how to find a new job to keep my finances stable while I get the prerequisite education to pursue that path.

**More detail:** I have Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science, and spent the past ~3 years working as a professor of Computer Science. I was unable to adapt to the workload/stress and experienced intense burnout, so I am stepping away for mental health's sake. Through that, I discovered I am passionate about and skilled at working with college students in general. For example, I was credited with reviving our student Computer Science club, and also spent large amounts of time volunteering in our LGBTQ+ Pride Center.

To explore that further, I plan to get a second Master's Degree in Higher Education, with Student Affairs as my long term goal. I'm not currently educated/skilled enough to apply to the vast majority of positions in that umbrella, so I've been feeling extremely lost on what to do for work so that I can afford that degree.

**My Question**: For people who have been in similar situations (changing career path in late 20s/early 30s after Plan A wasn't sustainable), what things did you do to deal with the transitional period?

","Hello looking for a bit of career advice or guidance I've worked in IT help desk and various rolls for the past 7+ years and have been sort of stagnant or staying in a Helpdesk type roll but I would like to move towards the systems side more on servers but would like to sort of figure out what the specialty would be. Now to my question or request of guidance currently I am employed by a university but my position is siloed to strictly Helpdesk type position I have applied for a systems Technician position at a government type entity (native American tribe) and seems like I am going to be accepted but my question is what steps or helpful tips would you suggest to get further into the systems side of things? I have worked at this tribe before previously and there is opportunity to expand knowledge and work on other types of projects and tasks but I am not sure I want to put in more than 5 years in this position due to its location. My plan would be to get the experience needed to apply and get a position at in another location/state. For this position i will more than likely be geting pay decrease but the state i will be moving to has more relaxed tsxes and lower cost of living.

1egf0j0,Option 1 or 2?,"I need some advice on a big decision I’m facing. I’m torn between two options and could use some outside perspective.

**Option 1: Living in New, Smaller City**

* **Job:** Career path job with a steady income of $3100/month after tax
* **Expenses:**
   * Rent: $1500/month (with roommate)
   * Internet: $60/month
   * Insurance: $230/month
   * Groceries and gas: $400/month
   * Entertainment: \~$200/month
* **Total Monthly Expenses:** $2390
* **Monthly Savings:** $710
* **Annual Savings:** $8,520

This job offers career advancement opportunities, skill development, and a professional network. However, the cost of living is higher, and my immediate savings are lower compared to the next option.

**Option 2: Staying Home in Hometown**

* **Job:** Commission-based work with an income range of $2800-$4500/month (average $3650)
* **Expenses:**
   * Insurance: $230/month
   * Gas: $200/month (estimated)
   * Groceries $250
* **Total Monthly Expenses:** $780
* **Monthly Savings:** $2900 (average)
* **Annual Savings:** $38,640 (average)
   * **Range of Annual Savings:** $28,440 to $48,840

This option offers higher immediate savings and flexibility but less career advancement potential and professional growth compared to the first option.

**My Goal:** Save money to visit/work in Japan for a year on the Working Holiday Visa.

1egevcu,Need advice on asking for higher salary? ,"I’m currently 29 years old and I’ve been working at a restaurant for almost 10 years. I got promoted to become a manager. I’ve heard through management that the starting pay will be 68k a year. It is not salary, but it will be hourly, which is good. I don’t want to sound ungrateful, but I would prefer to make 70k a year. They promised me that it would be 52 hours a week and obviously insurance comes with it. This will be my first management job, so I understand maybe asking for 2k more might be a problem.  Since  I don’t have any management experience or let alone a college degree in hospitality. My question is, how would I try to decline what they will offer me and how to ask for a higher salary? I’ve also heard that since I’ve been there from almost 10 years that doesn’t matter. I guess they don’t go by that. Also has anyone worked in hospitality management , if so I would appreciate your advice. I guess that would be my second question as well. I’ve  been thinking about how my life will constantly be  revolving around this company / restaurant and I won’t have an outside life anymore.  I’ve been shift leading for quite a while and I feel like I have good days and off days. I guess in the long run will it be worth it ? Thanks in advance.

1ege7bv,"Struggling to get back to work after a setback (28, F, India)","I'm a Chartered Accountant working in Finance. I landed a great job in Jan'23 with a VC fund which paid me well and had great perks but required me to move to another city. A lot of teething problems occured in the new city which ultimately snowballed into work issues and the stress triggered my anxiety disorder and subsequently a breakdown.

Quit my job, moved back to my home city - and decided to take a few months off to recover. Now it's been a year since I've been at home and I'm struggling to get back to work. Confidence is at an all time low - I've screwed up so many of my interviews because I just ramble so much and over explain stuff.  I used to have a high flying career, I was ambitious and had hobbies and I feel like a broken shell of a person I used to be. I'm trying my best to make a comeback, but everytime I try to think about work and job - I keep getting flashbacks of all the times I've failed, how I screwed up my work last year when I had my breakdown. 

The other day, I was listening to a YT Career Affirmations meditation and every time the affirmation said ""you're worthy of a job"", my mind would come up with 10 different reasons why it was untrue.

I really need to get back to work but I'm somehow finding it difficult to write off the last 1.5 years of my career (The job + the break). Any advice on how to get out of this rut?

1ege2ns,"I got laid off, and unsure of what to do next","I'm 23 and graduated college last year. Even though I had internships, I struggled to land a full time job in my field of study as it's super oversaturated now. I did end up accepting a job in a different type of role. I didn't love the work (I actually dreaded most days lol) but it paid well. Unfortunately, right after hitting my first year, I got laid off.

I'm looking at a wide range of jobs for my next role: design, customer success, product and project management, implementations. I've been getting interviews (3 lol) but they have gone nowhere. I think my lack of experience is my biggest barrier.

I'm mentally preparing myself for this job search to last months, and in the meantime I'll be looking for a ""bridge"" job to hold me over.  Experiencing this so soon after graduation definitely threw me into a quarter life crisis...and I've been thinking about different paths for my future:

a) Get a masters in HCI (part time), which might help with job prospects? I did UX for my undergrad. 

b) Get a masters in health informatics (part time), which is sort of related to my undergrad. I'm interested in exploring more healthcare adjacent tech roles.

c) A career change. I've been looking at accelerated second-degree nursing programs. Long story short: I thought I was going to be a nurse until I learned about UX/tech roles. l know nursing has its challenges but I feel like the work is a lot more meaningful than what I was doing, and I feel very ""disillusioned"" with tech right now. Besides nursing, I have no clue what else I would do besides other roles I already mentioned.

I have only been job searching for a month, and I'm probably getting ahead of myself and being super impatient. However, I still wanted to think over some options since I'm certain I would be unhappy doing another job in my previous role. I understand my job doesn't have to be my passion (and I definitely don't live to work) but I want to at least like the work I do, and not feel super anxious every day. Realistically, I wouldn't be able to do any sort of school till next year and hopefully by then I can find a job with tuition reimbursement :p",heavenhearted,2,1.0,4,1722399354,2024-07-31 04:15:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ege2ns/i_got_laid_off_and_unsure_of_what_to_do_next/,7,2024

I am set to graduate next year Spring (2025) with one more class to take in Fall 2025 and I have not found an internship yet, and much less a job in the field. I have been trying to bulk up my resume since 2022 with all the clubs and project club organizations that I have participated in since then up until now. I don’t know what else I can do to stand out but I need to find a way to obtain an internship or job position soon, before I graduate next year. 

Here’s a quick rundown of the academic experience I have:


AIAA (Vice Chair)—- 2022-2024

Design Build Fly Competition (Project manager) —- 2024

Rocket Club (LR-101)*designed impinging injector*

L’Space PDR and CDR—- 2023 

Volunteer experience outreach events —2022-2024

Tutoring experience K-12 students —2024 


I’ve been applying like crazy this year and all I have gotten were interviews that went ghost on me afterwards and rejection emails. As a self motivated engineer and first in the family, it has been a struggle for me to find a job/ internship in the field. 

If any of you can share your experience or advice on how you got a job in the field please let me know,

1egd4jj,Do I try to transfer to another dept? ,"Hi! I really need some career advice. Some background info- I’m 24 and this current job I got 2 months ago is my first real full time role and it’s in the corporate space. However, it very much aligns with my interests and my degree and I am very happy that I found a job that fits my liking and I’m good at the job, it being for a known company is a huge plus. 

However, I’ve bumped into many obstacles along the way - whether it was nasty co workers, unstable and last min deadlines, massive language barrier, weird toxic company culture, feeling like an outsider, being over worked with way too many tasks for one person (since people are quitting) just to name a few. I am in my intro period right now and it’s been rough not knowing if I’ll have a permanent spot in the job, my manager is pretty nasty and strict and not very undemanding. I also have to be really careful who I speak to a lot of the time since I can’t really say how I really feel about my job. 

Long story short, I want to be on a more American team, as I know I’d excel much further in my role if I’m in a more comfortable environment language wise and people wise first and for most. But I’m not really being offered that option to me even though it was known I’m more Americanized. 

I was given an opportunity through networking from someone within said company to possibly interview to see my current situation and see where I fit within their future job opening. It is more hush since my current office isn’t aware of my big desire to switch teams as I was worried about being fired if I discussed that more. I’m going to talk with the person this week and see how we align, but I do know if they don’t have a current spot for me I’m honestly planning to quit on the spot. I’m struggling way too much in my current role for dirt pay and there’s such a lack of empathy from my team which I find unfair. How should I navigate this meeting? And should I say the full truth of how I feel and that if I don’t switch depts I’m thinking to quit? The friend that helped us Network together said this person is trustworthy, but idk. Any and all advice is really appreciated. I’m so new to the corporate world, unsure of what to do.

1egbsn7,Got an internal promotion and now in need of advice regarding pay that I already signed an agreement for.,"Last year, I switched careers (my first career as a teacher did not really involve promotions, and salaries were paid by length of service and nothing else so I have never done this before) and have now been at this company for 14 months. After my first boss was investigated for being abusive, some team members and I were moved to a different department. Then, I was moved to another department a couple of months later, where I am now.

I was told last week I was recommended and approved for a promotion and on Friday, they sent me paperwork to virtually sign, in which I agreed to my new salary. They still have not given me my new job description or even specific title, just that I am now a manager and that I will receive all the description paperwork upon C-suite approval. I know this was beyond stupid so please don't lecture me. I won't be doing that again.

My co-worker showed me how much other people are making via screen share, and as a manager I make a little less than a senior associate who was hired a month after me. The compensation here is really all over the place and I knew I was slightly underpaid but now I'm livid at the situation and myself. I work so hard and have helped this company in a lot of ways. Never missed a deadline, underperformed, etc. plus I've been moved twice and had three bosses within my time here.

My boss told me he would give me the details tomorrow (although this deadline has changed multiple times because our company is dysfunctional as hell) and when we review the job description, I plan to explain that the duties do not align with the salary, but I do not know how to phrase this exactly. Someone in another sub suggested to frame it the way I spelled it out here but I need help feeling confident with my wording and honestly, raising this with my boss to begin with.  I am going in with the mindset that they will probably say no, say I already agreed, etc. and I know I will most likely be leaving because of this but if anyone could help me with the right language to use in the meantime, I would really appreciate it.",rockyroadnottaken,2,1.0,1,1722392283,2024-07-31 02:18:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1egbsn7/got_an_internal_promotion_and_now_in_need_of/,7,2024

1eganum,"Contract work, yay or nay?","Advice on contract work needed (as someone who has never done it).
For context, I’m at my wits end in my current role. I’m a manager in an office setting and salaried. I manage too big of a team and I regularly work over 40 hours with no OT. I’ve been stressed out and falling apart for months.
The individuals on my team are hourly employees with benefits. I learned that my company has contract positions that are essentially the same as the role of my team members, but they pick their hours based on needed coverage. My boss has said this would be an option for me to move into if I was looking to do something different.
This position does not get benefits (honestly our health insurance is shit anyway) but they are under less scrutiny (they don’t get audited or have to go into the office, so it is fully remote instead of hybrid), they get complete control over their hours (obv depending on what’s available which doesn’t seem to be a problem), and there is no minimum hours required for the role.
One drawback is my employer doesn’t take out taxes from the pay of these contract positions so that would have to be managed/accounted for on the employee’s end, and honestly the job isn’t amazing (it’s 100% on the phone with clients who call, luckily not sales or cold calls though), but honestly I’m craving the autonomy and flexibility and it’s something I did before getting promoted.
I’m looking to finish my degree after years of being in the workforce and work on certifications in data analytics, etc. My partner can take the brunt of the bills, but it would be really hard for me to quit outright since I am the main breadwinner as it stands. I feel like this is a great middle ground where I can still get paid, but control when and how much I work. This wouldn’t be forever anyway, just something to keep us going while I’m finishing my education which will be at least half a year.
I have never worked a contract position, so any insight from experience would be greatly appreciated! I tried to give as much detail about what I know regarding this specific position, but there may be something more to contract work that I hadn’t considered.

1egadnj,Stay at Apple retail or help family,"26m currently working at Apple retail as part time in the Bay Area making about $28/hour. I’ve only been here for about 8 months but feel lost in terms of what I really want to do. I can see myself moving up in retail but positions rarely open up and there is a lot of favoritism in terms of who gets those higher positions. Can’t complain cause as part time we do get benefits (medical, dental & vision), free perks (Apple TV & Apple Music), discount off stocks, RSUs etc. 

Now recently my dad (60m) decided to buy 3 franchises (Little Caesar’s) in Ohio. As of right now my cousin is currently running all 3 locations himself and has already decided to move there. Now my dad thinks it’s a good idea that I should move out there as well and help run those franchises for a salary and continue to buy more franchises over time.

I imagine moving from the Bay Area to Ohio would be a huge culture shock and not even sure if I would like it.

1ega46d,Need advice: New Job Worth Risk?,"
Advice Needed: Take New Job Offer?

Current Job:

	•	Few years in role; 4 layoffs/restructures.
	•	New responsibilities each time.
	•	Current team: Improved tech skills but not my preferred marketing branch.
	•	Pros: 401k, great work/life balance, started a side hustle and have one client. (Not sure how this will go yet so I still need a stable job that will pay mortgage.)
	•	Cons: Future layoffs likely (6-12 months), limited growth on my new team. Currently doing work that Is useful in the big picture of my career, but likely won’t be the focus of my next role. 

New Job Offer:

	•	Great mission/product, similar sector.
	•	More senior title, pay bump ($80k’s to $110k’s).
	•	Marketing Strategy/management work I enjoy.
	•	Pros: $25-30k salary increase.
	•	Cons: Smaller company, role tied to rev goals(imposter syndrome), more visibility/responsibility, unclear work/life balance, recent layoffs this year, no 401k.

Should I stay in current “stable” job or take the risky but higher-paying offer?

1eg9p4z,mid-quarter-life crisis ig bc im so unbelievably lost,"i already posted this on a life advice subreddit, but i'm desperate for advice so i'm posting it here, too.

to start, i'm 14 years old, starting 10th grade in september. i go to a good ass school which allows me some amazing opportunities, including one to graduate pretty early with over 30 credits. i never really use reddit - like ever - but i am right now because i am panicking and i don't go back to therapy for another 2 weeks. growing up in an indian immigrant family in canada meant the title of 'future doctor' was granted to me when I was 7 years old. I've been called 'little doctor' and stuff like that since I was a lil kid. I never really explored any other career options because it was as though my future was already decided before i could understand was a career was. Everyone right now thinks I want to be a pediatrician. Honestly, I fucking despise biology. Spending the next 10-or-so years studying the human body? I might die of pure hatred for the subject. I've had a passion for reading and writing since before I can remember. I write essays like its a sport and read textbooks just because its fun. an author is an unstable job and so i've never considered it. however, this past year, I took a mandatory TRC course. If you don't know what that is, it's to teach kids about the history of this country and how it wronged the people who this land really belonged to, telling the stories which have gone untold for so long and healing the wounds colonizers slashed into the people of this wonderful country - hence the name 'Truth And Reconciliation'. The entire course isn't the focus right now, but rather the cycle where we learned about the legal system. I wrote multi-page long essays, about 3 over the course of those 15 days. Law is the one of the most interesting things in the world to me. However, I always brushed it off because \*everyone\* knows that lawyers are soulless and justice is never served - right? And either way, I've already started going over MCAT prep and skimming through textbooks to help me get into med school. It's not really what I want, but it's stable and I'd help people. At the same time, though, I don't even know much about the kinds of lawyers and what court is like. I want so desperately to drop everything right now and spend the next 12 hours straight going through overviews of everything law - but I also doubt whether I'd be able to get there. I'm starting so late, will I have the ability to get into law school? I've been pushed into the med shit since I was a kid, I know loads about the MCAT and med school and whats expected of me. But law is so different. What if I get into my head too much and end up not being able to succeed in shit???? I'm doubting myself too much. I really wish I could just forget all the med shit, because I \*\*know\*\* that when I really try at something, I do not give up. If I could somehow get rid of the doubts, there's zero way I wouldn't make it. But at the same time, is it a mistake? Throwing away everything I was raised with to chase a passion? Man this is so confusing. Anyways, I've yapped off enough. Again, I'm not on reddit much so idk whether super long posts are considered annoying the same way they are on other socials. I don't expect anyone to read my long ass yap session, but if you do, any help at all regarding literally anything would be appreciated. I'm not even sure what kind of help exactly I want. I'm just so lost.

* excuse any spelling mistakes, im not reading this shit over, it's too damn stressful

1eg938c,My job is refusing to hire anyone who knows me and also uses other peoples work from last year to criticize me. What should i do?,"Ok so I (18M) have worked for a company for the past three ish years now. (This is my third year) In my first year working, three of my friends also started working with me. The first year wasnt anything notable, so there were no issues there. But last year, when we were all hired back, the issues began to arise. For context, I work at a seasonal job in retail. So last year, my friends and I were there in the beginning/ set up if the store. It was the first time we were actually there for set up, so we were a bit slow to learn. I can understand why that might make a bad impression on the managers we had. However, as the season progressed, two of my friends ended up being favored by the managers and beloved by everyone (which they rightfully deserved) and the rest were slowly being more disliked. Now 2 of the people that were my friends that I worked with either became my friend after we started working together, or got hired without me saying anything to the manager to help them be considered. They were not people i recruited. But this year, because those two people who were not my fault nor responsibility did not work well last year, management has assumed that it was all myself and my other friends fault. This year I was hired back, and was also asked to give a list of people to rehire or to consider for the job while we are hiring (my manager asked me). But then soon after I actually started working, I found out from my friend who is favored by the managers that they have no intention if hiring anyone that is my friend from last year, and are not wanting to hire anyone new who may be my friend or be associated with me. Also, because of their judgement towards the two people who werent good at their jobs, they grouped everyone who was me or associated with me as being bad at working. And now because of that, whenever I go to work, even though I’m not doing anything wrong, I am being constantly criticized, talked poorly about behind my back, and even ridiculed in front of other employees. For example, one of the managers came around while we all were working and was telling everyone else about how great they were doing and thanking them for being helpful to the team. I had gotten more work done than two people combined and started working on something else, but instead of a thank you, or any sort of credit, they saw what I was doing, said “no one told you to do that” and then barked at me to work on something else, completely disregarding all the work i had done before that and not saying anything else. I would be a lot more understanding of being against hiring my friends if they were a strictly no nepotism store, but one of my bosses hired his daughter as a different store store manager, and another district manager was able to hire her family to work with them. As well as some of my coworkers were able to recruit their friends and  there was no pushback to that, but then they refuse to hire people that they don’t even know almost entirely because they might know me/be my friend. And if I try to express whats happening and how its affecting me, the managers take it as a personal attack and will have more reason to not hire my friends and to be mean to me/ even want to fire me. I am at a loss right now about what I should do, and what I even can do. Any advice is appreciated.

1eg8nh1,Is Leaving a Job Within a Year a Bad Look for Future Employers?,"Hi all!

I wanted to make this post because I’m new to the workforce. I just recently graduated college back in May, and landed a job in a city about 2 hours away from my hometown. The job itself is all well and good (for the time being). I live alone and take care of all of my expenses on my own (rent, car payment, car insurance, groceries, etc.). However, I just got my first pay stub yesterday for my full month of salary work. It was much much less than what i calculated it out to be before I moved down. They’re taking over $1,200 out of my paycheck. With this massive cut into my monthly paycheck (I get paid once a month because I am a state employee), I don’t think I will be able to financially take care of myself for the long term. This was a shock to my system as it wasn’t what I had planned it out to be. I am very conscious of my finances and made sure everything was in order before I made the move down to take this job. 

But I suppose my question is, I am definitely going to have to leave this job in the next year and move back home where not only the pay is higher in general, but the expenses would be lower (I could live at home, live with my college roommates again, or my long-term girlfriend who is graduating next May and will land a job in engineering in the area I am moving back to), so is leaving a job within a year a bad idea and is it a bad look?

I want to make sure I am treating this job as a way to build a foundation for myself, but it’s not sustainable financially and I can’t do it long term. There also is no real upward growth and no raises based of performance because of it being a state job.

What should I do? What are some pieces of advice you might have? Looking for some helpful ideas because I am so new to this whole adulting thing. Thanks!

Afterwards I worked as a phone technician at day in parallel with Kids Games in festivals at night. So basically i am my own boss. I make money in summer more than I do in winter because of the festivals season. I reach 2,000$-3,000$ per month in Summer however, its not enough because of the high expanses/inflation/depreciation of the lebanese lira and parents support. Recently, I applied to a Canadian college to study plumbing, my uncles there supported me with everything especially financially, they paid my tuition fully. My visa got rejected because they believed that i wont leave canada after my study is over. I am stuck in Lebanon with the unstable economy and usnafe environment. I know the canadian dream and working as a plumber for the first few years wont make much more than of what am making in lebanon however for the long run its better in canada. 

The problem now is that I am struggling with what to do next? Am strong in trading/business and am very good as a technician. I like both and both can be successful if I carefully persue them. However, i have no money to start with a strong business. I was thinking about many business ideas and perhaps asking my uncle in canada to send me some money(he doesn’t mind) to start with it. But to be honest i am still sad about not going to Europe or Canada becuase I love the lifestyle and people there. Its very chill with people and safe most importantly!!! Its a good environment to build a business sines in such countries. I had my hopes high because my profile was very strong in every single perspective but it seems that the government now is being very very picky! I still want to persue the Europe/Canada dream but i think its almost impossible anymore. And i also want to start a business in lebanon after being rejected into canada!

1eg6nxb,Chess or Checkers? Advice Please.,"I am a Distribution Center Operations Supervisor for a subdivision of The TJX Companies. I have held this position for the last 2.5 years. I'm here to ask for advice regarding the path of my career.  As it stands the only career path ahead is Area Operations Manager, a role I don't want due to the stress of position. Furthermore, the upper management (Assistant General Managers and General Manager) in the Distribution Center I'm in are severely lacking in communication and common sense so it places more strain on the Area Managers and in turn the sups. 

  
As a supervisor I am expected to run my area or any given area whenever a coworker calls out. Since I am one of the more knowledgeable supervisors, I get called on quite often to run new areas or to provide coverage when others are out while the low performing supervisors get left in their area. You know as they say, ""good work begets more work"". I am tired of being accountable for the action/inaction of others. I long to have a position where I live or die by what I do/don't accomplish. 

I am considering downshifting into an entry level logistics position (Transportation Coordinator) in order to change my career path. My current salary is 65k. If I downshift the pay would be 44k. A fat 20k hit to my wallet annually. I busted my ass for this supervisor spot, but my heart isn't in it, and I can feel myself caring less and less as the days go on. 

The Transportation Coordinator role is 3 days a week (Fri, Sat, Sun) for 12 hours and it is not a salaried position. I can make up the lost money by picking up a part time job to work during my down time Monday - Thursday. I'm trying to play chess here lol and take the route which will give me more experience to enter a different field all together. Realigning would also open up more career opportunities in the logistics field and allow me to recoup that lost salary after a few years in the TC role. I have my eye on a Transportation Planning Analyst role which starts at a higher salary than my current, and all is needed is 2 years of experience.  

Also, I have no degree, felt that was important to add lol. (I had to take an extended leave due to familial circumstances in my last semester and haven't had the money to return). 

What would you do?

**TLDR: Tired of being a sup (accountability for others and all that jazz), should I take a lower paying job with more upward mobility in the long run.  Am I crazy or should I try it?**

1eg5wks,Should I ask for more severance pay ,"I got fired 2 weeks ago for underperformance but wasn’t given specifics. My last performance review was overall positive and my supervisor said they’ve seen a lot of good improvement, so the firing came as quite a shock. They’re giving me 2 weeks severance, and I’m considering asking for 4, even though they’re already being generous. 

They let me “resign” (so none of my coworkers know I got fired, but I’ll still be eligible for unemployment) and basically get 2 weeks to wrap things up, then 2 weeks of pay after I’m gone. I’m leaving on good terms, they like me a lot but don’t think I’m a good fit for the job. 

Should I ask for 2 additional weeks of pay and potentially sour the relationship, or should I take what they offered and be grateful? I don’t want to offend them with the request bc they are offering me recommendations and support finding a new job, when they don’t have to offer me anything at all.

1eg5owp,Can you have a meaningful career in corporate America?,"As I search through LinkedIn, I can't help but feel it's all a lie. Even the so called sustainability jobs feel dubious at best. Hardly any of the jobs seem like they do anything genuinely impactful for the world. It also seems hard for a profit-driven company to care. After all, the incentives don't line up.

On the other hand, when I look at university research from my Alma mater, it feels like it's genuinely impactful. They are researching how to improve windmill efficiency, grow food from algae, and other transformative tech. All the people I've looked up to have been scientists, not billionaire CEOs.

I have my BS and MS in Mechanical Engineering and have been working in Data and AI for the last 3 years. I keep wrestling between accepting a lack of meaning to gain financial independence early through a high paying job in AI vs giving up pay to do something I genuinely care about now. European universities offer PhD programs with good work-life balance for people with MS degrees. Maybe grass is greener on the other side. Maybe when I actually do the PhD, I might hate it. I'm a social person and maybe PhD requires some level of introversion. But I keep wondering.


Has anyone wrestled with this? What did you decide?

Hello I apologise for the rant, 

I am  31yo male  i worked many jobs in my life from retail to security guard on cruise ships and construction. 

And now I'm working for a cruise company since 2022 mostly doing customer service and booking cruises. It's a call center with potential for transferring to other departments....but I feel I am meant for more. 

I want to up skill and I am thinking at my age what would be the best options. I don't have a degree and I feel a void inside me for not having one let's say insecurity. 

I feel I was meant to do more during  my life and I feel lost not knowing what are the best next steps to do. I feel overwhelmed with so many options.

One option is the open university which is remote and without entry requirements except from taking a loan. I don't have much time I need to apply until October. 

Another option is an apprenticeship but with the salary is not a viable option for a 31yo to survive I today's cost of living. 

Another option is certifications in a specific industry. 
 

I feel totally lost in terms of what path should I  follow and I know I am not alone In this. And the worst part is that time is passing by and I have to make a choice....

She was in-experienced in management and I found myself dealing with a significant change in how the department was being run compared to my three previous supervisors. 

There was a distinct lack of communication, my opinion and expertise were no longer asked for and I was left feeling undervalued and excluded. 

I didn't handle it well, and my supervisor didn't handle my expressions of frustration at the situation I found myself in. It got to the point that my position as the trainer was taken away without a single word of correction, guidance, or even a warning in a meeting that left me feeling attacked and belittled. 

I would have left then, but the economy was not good and jobs were hard to come by. At about the time the economy started to pick up again, the company I worked for was bought by a larger corporation. I paused my search and took a wait and see approach to the buy out hoping for improvement. 

I took some of this time to work on my mental health, to learn & grow in the areas where I was knew I was lacking. I made huge strides and improvements with the areas I was lacking -- chiefly interpersonal and communications skills. I also was diagnosed with ADHD and have been referred to (and am currently waiting on) an official autism assessment.

Despite everyone from the team to upper management telling me how much I'd improved, my direct manager tore me apart in last performance review because she is insistent that all  my communications where I disagree with her are intentionally disrespectful and rude.

There have been times (more than once) when she is mad at me and a significant problem has occurred at work and she has just flat-out ignored me all day. Not one word said to me even when any other reasonable person would have acknowledged the situation.

I tried to find a way to make things work and having learned about my above mentioned diagnoses (suspected and current by doctors), I discussed with her way to help improve some of the issues with communication between us. I figured these agreements were a reasonable accommodation request. At the first test, she did the exact opposite of everything we discussed, dragged me over the coals with HR who didn't care that she had disregarded my accommodation request and the head of HR told me to ""manage my emotions better""... which for those who know, emotional dysregulation is a big struggle for many with ADHD and autism.

*Also important to note:* over the past year, we have lost several key employees who were done with the situation here but gave management other reasons for leaving. This lead to a few months of working a crazy amount of hours (think 12-14hrs/5 days a week)

**So, here is what I need advice on:**

Because of all of this, I am currently one of the lowest paid people at my KPI tier. This wouldn't be a problem if not for the fact that the majority of responsibility of this position, including critical decision-making and acting as the supervisor in-lieu of our manager's presence, falls on my shoulders.

On top of the positional responsibilities, I manage a lot of extra work such as the development and creation of the new training manual that has been pointed out a high point on both the internal and external audit for of our quality management systems.

I have knowledge and skills that no one else in this department has and these are things that heavily leaned on by those both and in and outside of my department. (This also includes tech skills that make me the go to person before they have to put in a ticket for help from the IT department). 

To top it off, we just got our annual bonuses. Mine was the second LOWEST bonus of those in the department. And, also the largest percentage discrepancy between my wage and bonus amounts. 

It feels like a slap in the face, but the last time I brought up compensation my manager said I was fairly compensated and if I didn't like it, they could demote me down a level. At which point, I feel like they'd probably fire me for refusing to do the level of tasks I am currently doing.

I don't know what to do anymore. It's hard giving up all the extra benefits that come with being in a job for so long. I do love the job I do and I love the team I work with. I know they are all horrified at how I am treated and compensated, but no one is comfortable speaking out on my behalf. 

Is there anyway I can respectfully stop any of the extra work I do without getting in trouble? Or at least stop having my boss continue to delegate to me?

I am really at such a loss and I am not sure I can find a job that even pays the same since what I do is a very niche occupation.

1eg375r,Finished my degree - suddenly went from overpaid to average pay. What steps should I take?,"Living in Canada. I worked in a clinical management role as an LPN making ~85k / year, which is well above what an LPN makes in my province (typical average is ~60k). I've recently finished my Bachelor's and am now registered as an RN. I'm doing the exact same role for the exact same pay and making about average for an RN, although it's not uncommon for new-grads to immediately make >100k if they pick up overtime in the hospital. 



I like my job and its perks (work from home, lots of flexibility, etc.) but I've been perusing jobs with similar duties that I would qualify for and I think I'm underpaid. If I worked in a hospital setting in a clinical management role my pay band would be ~120-145k. If I found a comfy government job doing similar stuff I'd still be closer to ~100k with one of the best pension plans in Canada. 



My employer has been incredible to me and really advocated for me to get into a role that LPNs aren't traditionally able to work, so I feel this weird sense of debt to them. They're also moving me into a higher role (with a slight ~5k? ish pay bump) which will look great on my resume.

I have 5 years of experience as a data scientist and left my job to do a master's in data science, hoping to switch to MLE. But most MLE positions require a software development background, which I lack. The DS positions available have super specific requirements and/or require PhDs, or they are focused on analytics, which I’m trying to avoid.

In my previous roles, I did a bit of everything—building dashboards, A/B testing, developing and deploying models, and even worked on backend systems—but nothing large-scale or impactful. This makes it tough to build a resume that justifies my experience for MLE roles.

Recruiters often reach out with DS positions that are primarily analytics-focused, which isn’t what I’m looking for, and it feels like accepting one would be a step backward and could possibly prevent any transition to engineering. And ngl, I’m also worried about having to settle for a less-known company with lower pay.

Any advice on making this transition smoother? Thanks!

1efz2fe,Where to start my career,"Hi everyone!

I’m going to be a new grad next spring, and the talks of what I’m going to do after college has been circulating. I’ve done an internship every summer for the past few summers, and I landed myself an internship in Internal Audit and Financial Advisory consulting. The firm I’m currently with is an incredibly small firm in comparison to B4 and MBB. I’m likely going to receive a return offer for the firm I’m interning at. 

Looks like the base comp would be anywhere between 75k-90k with a 2k bonus yearly. They have pretty decent benefits and the work-life balance is incredible. They give around 20 days worth of PTO. 

The only downsides of this firm is that they have very little exit opportunities. They don’t have very much prestige, and their connections to T1 MBA programs are little to nonexistent. I do have a few connections already in regard to where I could go for graduate school. 

Additionally, I have a connection with a manager at a T2 firm in consulting. I’ve read that their benefits would be slightly better, but work life balance is terrible. It also would not be a guarantee that I would be hired, just that I would have an in past the screening and get into the interview stage. They have much better prestige and exit opportunities into other firms. They are also a larger firm with a larger network of people. 

The problem is that I likely would not be able to go through the process with any other firms without having to renege this current firm. Any insight helps! Obviously this is ultimately my choice, but I’m mostly torn between whether or not a potentially better standing in the corporate world is worth sacrificing a perfectly okay offer. Especially in this economy.

1efyjnd,Need advice :-),"Hey everyone, would appreciate some career advice and on the roles that you think I am suitable for.

Some background:

* Studied bachelors of science in mech eng, finished 2021. Worked around 6 months as a production engineer/project manager before quitting. (Quit due to distance to work, around 3h per day wasted due to commute)
* Started working as a data analyst, as i enjoy working with tech - 18 months of contract work which ended - no opportunity/roles to go work for the company unfortunately.
* New job started in Jan 2024; data analyst - working ONLY with developing power bi reports for the company, role was removed due to organizational changes..

  
So, as you can see, i've worked 3 jobs in less than 3 years, which in my eyes, is really bad. Especially with two of these being around 6 months, i'm feeling rather hesistant regarding my career, now being unemployed.

If, i were to change to another role, say project manager, or whatever - would there be expectations for a lower salary? I am open to working with BI/data roles, but there's too much competition sadly!

Do you guys have any tips on any roles that I should look for, with my background as mech eng? I'm open to everything at this point, to be honest.

1efybne,I just do not enjoy socializing anymore with workmates,"For context, I started in the workforce in the late 80s. Going out for drinks and dinner with coworkers was quite common and normal. You went out for lunch together, you went to drinks after work, there were networking parties and events. It was the way to meet people and network in a large corporate environment. 

When I was younger I was ok with socializing after all I was young, most of my coworkers were young and it was a way to have some fun especially when the company was paying lol. 

But lately as I reach the end of my career (I am a few years away from retirement) I just don't enjoy it anymore. So many of the interactions appear forced and awkward. My after work hours are precious to me as I have interests and commitments outside of work.

I am currently an operations coordinator in the audio visual industry making 55k salary and 100% covered medical .  I have been in my position for 5 years , unfortunately similar positions in this industry don’t pay much more than I currently make already. 

I handle various different aspects of a corporate events and trade shows . Sometimes this position could be called a meeting planner as well . 

I handle - contractor insurances , process invoices , manage schedules including  flights , hotels , and rental cars. I manage director meetings to make sure all of our upcoming projects are on track for completion and on budget . Over all I would summarize my position as managing the life cycle of a project from when we win a bid to closing it out after invoicing .

Any advice how I could translate these skills into another job title or industry that has a higher pay scale ?

How many transferable skills from entry level data analysis to UX/ UI design? 

—
Are there any data analysts here? I went to an event last Sat and met a hiring manager from Centene health insurance. 

My friend works there and it seems to be a great team. But she isn’t looking for a UX but an entry level data analyst. 

They all strongly suggested me to quickly learn SQL and b1 and apply this position when it’s up. Telling me it’s a great way to break into tech and their company (they don’t have a separate track of UX and data analyst in their LA site. Somehow it’s their DA3s work in the UX team).

I am still in my UX/UI bootcamp, about to wrap my second case study. I have been using my first learning project-turned portfolio to apply for jobs for about a month or so but only got one unpaid internship interview in a startup. 

I am curious if there is anyone have some general suggestion for me how to evaluate this possible opportunity based on my background and history.

I am also curious how many transferable skills from data analysis to UX/UI. So far from my research, probably not a lot in entry level positions. It sounds like for entry level position it’s all about pulling data out based on requests less about analysis and data visualization.

1efy4kl,Lazy coworkers but boss is mutual friends with them,"So I will keep this short and sweet since I don't want to put my employer on blast. I work at a company where we are given very few raises and/incentives. We all make the same pay whether you have worked here for 5 minutes of 15 years. My coworkers are constantly doing other things (Social media, texting, youtube, homework, you name it) and this is affecting the way we are looked at as a whole team. It is also affecting the timely manner on which things get done that I ask them to do it, since they are ""too busy with other things"" 

  
I brought this to my manager and he sent out a very professional email on all of the things we need to start doing. Here lies the problem, he is friends with several of the people outside of work. He mentioned to them, that I am the one that brought these things up to him, and now people are pissed at me. If everyone did what they were supposed too, we wouldn't have this issue. I understand the occasional slacking off, but this is DAILY. If I could go into more detail I would.  I feel like in a typical scenario, it should have remained confidential. I am working twice as hard while there are several others slacking off, for the same pay. How do I move forward with these reoccurring issues without looking like a ""tattle tale or complainer""

1efxrob,Resigned from my job following investigation - what should I tell future employers?,"So, my previous job as an apprentice at a large defence firm was subject to random drug tests - I did very well quitting weed but in the last couple months of me working there I had fallen off the wagon. 

They announced a new policy stating that if you come forward and disclose a 'dependancy' on drugs/alcohol then they will not fire you and instead support you.  I disclosed that I had recently been smoking weed again and long story short - during the investigation I got a call from a trade union rep, advising that I resign as they had deemed that I didn't have a drug problem/dependency and instead decided that I acted knewing that what I was doing was wrong/illegal. 

I resigned so that I wouldn't be blacklisted from the work location/company, in case I choose to work there again. 

The trouble is that I'm now looking for a new job, and as I left the apprenticeship before completion I'm bound to be asked why I left. Of course what I've just described will make me look like sh\*t so I'm trying to think of a believable cover-up story. I know for certain that my reference from that job will only provide the dates I worked there. 

I'm taking the remainder of my exams seperately from the apprenticeship can anyone recommend how I approach this in interviews?

1efxfix,How do I have a salary/career growth conversation with my manager when there are no real job descriptions? ,"I am a graphic designer for a PR agency, and I came into my role in a very roundabout way. The agency didn't have a dedicated creative department for many years, so as I began to do more and more design work, I did it under my original title (office admin). A few years ago we hired a creative director and started to build out an actual team. I was given the title of Senior Content Designer. However, job descriptions still haven't been created—for my role or others within the team (Art Director, Sr. Art Director, Assoc. Creative Director, etc.). 

As I've researched my title on sites like Glassdoor and tried to compare it to other companies within the industry, I'm finding that the role focused more on website design and development—which I don't do.

I want to start having conversations with my creative director about career growth and compensation, but I'm not sure where to start. With a job description, it would be easy to illustrate that I'm meeting and exceeding the role responsibilities. And I could compare my current work to the next role I'd like. So, how do I do that without the job descriptions? Do I submit my own job description? Or is there a different way to start the conversation?

1efww02,Is it too late for me?,"I'm 22 years old and want to finally start college, in hopes that I can start on a path to become a scientist. I haven't figured out whether I want to be a planetary scientist or simply focus on geology, but I'm leaning more towards planetary sciences as I have always been passionate about planets and space too. 

The thing is, I'm still working on getting my GED. I dropped out of highschool when I was 18 because of an unstable and abusive home environment. In the past, I struggled with trauma and anxiety from it. Which made it hard for me to pay attention in classes. I felt a constant fog in my head, so eventually I stopped caring. I decided I would work multiple jobs and get out on my own as quickly as I could, it was better than being stuck in that house. Now I'm in a better environment, where I *would* have the support while I go to school if I wanted it. I feel like now I really have a chance to start the life I've wanted for a long time. 

I guess I'm also feeling a little intimidated though. My family often treated me like an idiot because I had a hard time focusing. I don't care if I'm slower than others. I want to learn, I want to make sure I have the tools to, and I want to work hard to have the life I *want*. Yet still there's the things they would say to me playing on repeat in my mind. 

Am I too old to be pursuing this though? Is it too late for me? I have to be able to take care of my siblings too, so that they can escape the same environment I was trapped in, and that's apart of my drive to doing this.

1efvl2u,(EU) Just graduated BA in International Relations and European Politics. Rejection after rejection when it comes to traineeships/jobs. What’s next? ,"Hi I’m F22 from the EU. I thought I did achieve something by graduating in my field of study, yet as soon as I got out in the job search/recruiting hell I got humbled real quick. Endless rejection emails on a daily, for “not having enough experience in the field” (wtf, that’s literally what traineeships are for lol). Not a single interview for a vacancy in my field, not even notified that I’m placed on the reserve list (and I’m talking traineeships in the EU on mostly basic secretary desk work, nothing insane that you need a PhD for, no rocket science, nothing that CANT BE taught). All I keep hearing back from is -what else- customer service jobs to pick up calls, and also pretty much anything else unrelated to my field. 

My dad is barking like a dog that I should return back to academia for master’s asap, otherwise I don’t stand a chance in ever getting a job. But I don’t think that’s really what it is. The experience with recruiting and applying and all was truly eye-opening. They value proven experience in the field  more than the paper. Like sure a master’s is a plus if you wanna go to some fancy institution as political intelligence/security analyst, but if in a regular job they had to choose between a bachelor’s graduate with 2 years of engagement in some civil society NGO for let’s say minorities plus some training at a visa/migration consulate, they’re more likely to hire them than someone who does have a master’s specialisation, is 24yo and never been in the job market/worked once in their life… My dad doesn’t get this though… My dad thinks a degree holder is welcomed by the corporate world with open arms being told “here comes the talent!!!” and being paid insane thousands per month simply sitting on a chair and being in politics..
I don’t think it’s worth it spending this much money for master’s for something that (from what I’m seeing so far) won’t even get you a job… I mean nothing is guaranteed ever in life, but I kiiiind of think it’s a scam… I don’t know what to believe in, where am I in the wrong here…. Tbh it’s a bit of everything  1) could my chances for acceptance be higher with a master’s? Probably. 2) Are these job ads hollow posts simply for having something posted with no real intention of hiring? Could be. 3) Perhaps my CV never even reaches the human eye. 4) Do I need more experience (of any kind) in my field? Absolutely. 

My dad says that I’m running out of time by not going for masters now in Fall and he’s ultra mad/forceful about it. He views gap years as an absolute waste of time and that if you finished in June next thing September you should be back in school already. But I honestly don’t view life as a race or a checklist at all. I can always go back to the amphitheater attending lectures and rot in the library writing endless policy papers… But I wanna genuinely live, gain experiences, work abroad, go out there in the world and see something new…. Even if I did get my master’s I’d reach the same stalemate I’m in now… paper with no experience, rejection upon rejection… For those of you that know about EU stuff, it took years upon years for people to build themselves with experience to be suitable for blue book trainees… 

Anyone with experience in this study domain - how was it in your case and what do you think I should do?

1efuw2x,Career Options? Need help!,"I started out doing data entry and worked my way up to office manager (between 2009 and 2022)

When that business closed, I became office manager at a flooring company. That was my favorite but was working 65+ hours a week for crap pay.

So after 10 months I found my current job.  The pay was more so I bring home the same paycheck without needing overtime.

I make $20/hr and we are struggling. My spouse is in HVAC making almost double what I do. I'm 33.

What can I get, either a certification or something, to make more? For our area, without a degree, I'm at the top of the pay scale. I looked into phlebotomy but that pays about what I make now.

1efuior,"Becoming an engineering apprentice soon, what sector/offer to choose?
","Currently had 2 offers from two companies for a L3 (A level/post-GCSE) apprenticeship. I'm really split on what one to choose though. I'll list the pros/cons and duties of each below and I'd like some insight on what others would pick.

**Job 1: Electrical/Mechanical fitting in Defense (Private company doing defense contracts) (would have a rotation around various departments, most of which deal with electrical stuff)**

* £**16k** starting annual salary which rises year on year until £23k (lasts **4y** so I'd be transitioning to adult minimum apprentice pay during it)  with options to progress into a higher level apprenticeship / full time work, but with **more flexibility** on where the apprenticeship training provider is.
* Better Paid Industry in general (I think)
* Higher pressure, military technology so very tight tolerances
* Better Social Culture
* Much larger company, so potentially less chance for seniority but also less nepotism.
* First year of apprentices (sorta) so training is kind-of unstructured as of now
* I like the people there more
* Opportunities for overseas work without needing seniority or a sales/marketing position
* Better reviews (in general) about the workplace

**Job 2: General Engineering (factory) with a choice of specialising in various positions like robotics, design, materials, mechanical or quality**

* £**13k** starting annual salary for **2 years** (this is a minimum, may be higher because of a less structured pay scheme) with options to progress into a higher lvl apprenticeship or straight into full-time work.
* Worse paid industry
* Lower pressure
* Better in house training (they have training buildings and have won awards)
* Fairly small company so a higher chance at seniority (Have also previously had apprentices who have gone through the same scheme go on to department director positions)
* Offer contract has limited information, containing the minimum pay, start date and holiday entitlements. Says ""other details will be confirmed in due course"" so likely would only be found out after signing it.
* Worse reviews.
* Nepotism does seem to be a problem there, but I don't think it'll be an issue for me.

Ultimately I would like to go into robotics/electrical engineering in more of a design/research/prototyping-focused role. However, I'm willing to give up specialization for a better salary. What are your recommendations on which I should choose?

1eft7xh,Should I switch universities or not?,"Hello everyone,

I was hoping some experienced people would point me in the right direction, as I am very confused about what to do.

Currently, I have finished the first year of my bachelor's in Computer Science with Management (3 years) at Queen Mary University of London. This is the course link for my current degree: [Computer Science with Management (ITMB) - Queen Mary University of London (qmul.ac.uk)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/coursefinder/courses/2024/computer-science-with-management-itmb/)

During my first year of undergrad, I applied to some other colleges to see if there was something better available, and I got into King's College London, University of London for Artificial Intelligence MSci (4 years) but this can be reduced down to 3 years and I would graduate with a bachelors. The degree at Kings is only 1 year old. The link to the course: [Artificial Intelligence | King's College London (kcl.ac.uk)](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/artificial-intelligence-msci)

Queen Mary is ranked 135th and Kings is ranked 40th.

I don't know if I should make the switch or not, given that Kings is higher ranked and from several older posts made in this sub, rankings seems to be valuable for the first job.

However, looking at the modules, the King's course is missing some fundamentals of CS such as DSA, Operating Systems, Database Systems and general software engineering and system design which is in Queen Marys. Furthermore, as much as I love AI, I am worried it might specialise me too early while missing the fundamentals. **I might be wrong with this train of thought, so I am happy to be corrected here.**

Please, could someone look at the modules for both and advise me whether I should make the switch or finish my bachelor's and aim for a masters at a better ranking university or finish my bachelor's and start job hunting.

I have listed the modules for both here for convenience, but you should be easily be able to find it with links provided above:

1eft03b,I want to be a leader but I know I'm not cut out for it,"I spent most of my career as an entry-level person. I finally got a job where I've been promoted often and am now a manager of a small department of less than 10 people. 

I want to be a leader, I have the desire to do it. But I just can't actually handle it. 

The workload - regular work duties on top of management duties - is too much for me. There is another person in my department who has had to take over for me and complete work because I can't keep up. 

I am humiliated and feel like a failure. 

I want to lead, I really do. But I feel like I'm not cut out for it. I also feel very 'threatened' by my coworker who always does a stellar job and is very well liked by upper management. I am becoming a problem because I cannot keep up. 

Not sure what to do other than try to give up on my desire to be an efficient leader. I feel like I'm not competent enough to handle all the work. I've been dealing with a lot of depression, resulting in forgetfulness, brain fog, etc. My coworker is running circles around me and while they're not wrong (they see their chance to jump in and get ahead) it is seriously bringing me down.

1efsx9a,Finished my degree - suddenly went from overpaid to average pay. What steps should I take?,"Living in Canada. I worked in a clinical management role as an LPN making ~85k / year, which is well above what an LPN makes in my province (typical average is 60-70k). I've recently finished my Bachelor's and am now registered as an RN. I'm doing the exact same role for the exact same pay and making about average for an RN, although it's not uncommon for new-grads to immediately make >100k if they pick up overtime in the hospital. 



I like my job and its perks (work from home, lots of flexibility, etc.) but I've been perusing jobs with similar duties that I would qualify for and I think I'm underpaid. If I worked in a hospital setting in a clinical management role my pay band would be ~120-145k. If I found a comfy government job doing similar stuff I'd still be closer to ~100k with one of the best pension plans in Canada. 



My employer has been incredible to me and really advocated for me to get into a role that LPNs aren't traditionally able to work, so I feel this weird sense of debt to them. They're also moving me into a higher role (with a slight ~5k? ish pay bump) which will look great on my resume.

1efsptt,Am I entitled? Or did I just fall for a corporate trap? ,"August 2023 we hired a junior role to mine and throughout the process I was told by my boss that they would report to me in the near future. This was shared with interviewees during the hiring process. 

I was tasked in May 2024 to develop a job description for an elevated role and was told it would include another yet to be hired role as a direct report. I was then asked if I still was on board with having the first new hire (August 2023 hire) report to me starting July 1. Thinking the promotion hinged on that, I agreed to the direct report without a title change or salary change. 

I was told this week that the additional hire was approved and in order to push it through approvals quickly it will report to my boss for now. They mentioned that they would look to having this new role report to me in the new year. I am frustrated that I fell for what seems a corporate bait and switch. Sure, the promotion might happen in the new year but I wouldn’t have started to take on the extra work early. 

I have 8 years of experience and graduate with my MBA in December. I thought I’d stay at this company for most of my career, but I feel different today. Worst case scenario, I put my head down and finish the year with a paid for MBA. I’ll have resume booster with a direct report and jump into management with another employer. 

Extra context: I have a counterpart with the same job as me and they are hiring two new people. He has no direct reports today and the scope of work he oversees is smaller. My team transitioned work in-house from an external vendor this summer whereas the counterpart’s team is waiting until January 2025.

1efsl0l,What option to go for?,"For reference, I am a 25yo male. 
I've fairly recently been employed at this job, been working here for just under 6 months now. Job is fine, it's a fairly large company and I'm concerned about the potential to ""move up the ranks"". The money is fine, work life balance is great, and the work isn't stressful at all (sometimes too relaxing and I get bored.)

An old colleague rang me today, he started his own business about a year ago (in the same field I'm in) and essentially expressed that his business has grown exponentially fast and wants me to come on board. He's offered me a better salary than currently earning + 30% ownership in the company.

Would you recommend I:

Option A: Stay at this job, which has uncertainty on whether I can move up far, or will stay complacent, but has easy work life, or,

Option B: take the offer and become part owner of this company. The work will definitely be Harder, and the company is new so there is also no telling how far it will go.

1efsk69,How do I deal with brash management?,"For context, I work in aerospace manufacturing. 

Recently got a new senior manager who is all attitude and has a “do it now because I said so” mentality. Not sure how this person has risen through the ranks to get to their position, because my job is not about rushing things… at all. In aerospace we have a quality and safety first mentality. Doing your job correctly the first time is the most important thing, because we build airplanes. We want to ensure the safety of people flying on them in the future. 

To make matters worse, they haven’t even introduced themselves to my team. They are only known by my teammates who have been at this job 10+ years, I personally do not know them and never met them but from what I hear and what is being communicated to us from them to our team lead, they come off as brash and disrespectful. Frankly, I have a problem with that type of leadership because it lowers morale and puts unnecessary pressure on people do get things done quicker than it should be. I’m really trying to tolerate it for now, but how do I deal with the attitude without getting fired? The last thing I want is for them to direct their unnecessary behavior at me because I won’t stand for it.

 data analysis interests me (powerbi , tableau, excel, SQL) I have trained in it as well and some volunteer experience in it, I do see those jobs also do have many applicants as well.

Question is which one is less competitive?

1efrrti,How Do I Move Forward With My Desired Career Paths?,"Hello!
 
I've posted this here in hopes of gaining some advice from some older, more experienced individuals.
 
I am currently seventeen years old and have a very clear idea of what direction I want to go in life. I know where I want to go to university, what I want to study, and I know what career choices I'm hoping to make. However, the lifestyle that I'm hoping for is vastly different from the lifestyles that my parents have chosen to lead. Thus, they can't really provide me with much advice. Currently, I'm looking for advice/guidance on how exactly to get to where I want to go--especially from people who have gone through something similar. Thank you!
 
So, for context, I live in a fairly tropical country in Asia but have an American citizenship, since my mother is American. I am seventeen years old and will start eleventh grade in exactly one week. The school that I am attending is a very highly-praised international school that offers the IB (International Baccalaureate) program/diploma, which I am taking. 
 
After graduating, I plan to go to the UK for university. This has been one of my dreams for as long as I can remember. I plan to pursue a creative writing major and (if possible) minor in drama/theater. This brings me to something I also need advice on: my future career path. 
 
It has always been a dream of mine to become a successful author, and (though this is more of a ""I dare not hope"" dream, seeing as how difficult the journey would be) actress. In terms of the author path, I have been religiously writing for over a decade. I was homeschooled until high school and used lots of that time to hone my creative writing skills. Since then, I've written several novels (and am currently working on a fantasy trilogy that I hope to traditionally publish) and recently had one of my short stories published in a literary magazine. I have also very recently won a short story competition rewarding me 2000 USD. I've decided to put the money away and save it for when I go to university. I plan to submit to as many competitions as I can and save up the prize money for later. 
 
I have considered the fact that a creative writing degree is not necessary for me to become a successfully published author. However, it will be useful in terms of further honing my skills. It will also be much easier for me to traditionally publish my book if I am in the UK. In the country I currently live in, publishing opportunities are very scarce. It's not an English-speaking country, so whatever media is produced here either never makes it out of the country, or doesn't become popular at all. Going to the US is an easier option, seeing as I have an American citizenship, but based on research and personal preference I would much rather be based in the UK during university. 
 
My current plan is to work on the fantasy trilogy I am writing now (and have been writing for the past two years) throughout my years of high school, polish it up as much as I can, bring it with me to the UK, hire an editor, and look for publishing opportunities while in university. I'm hoping this will get me some income so that I can live comfortably for a few months out of university while I consider what to do with my career. 
 
(Before I continue, here's a little disclaimer: yes, I know my dreams are ambitious. Yes, I know it's very possible to fail at what I'm trying to do. Yes, I know the odds are probably against me. But that's what dreams are. They’re unlikely. You have to work for them, and I'm absolutely willing to work my head off for this. There are a million reasons why I want to choose this path and why it's incredibly close to my heart, but that's not the point of this post. The point is to ask for advice on the best way to work for these particular dreams).
 
Now, in the best case scenario, I get some income from publishing my books/winning contests/doing freelance writing and am able to go unemployed for a little while. In that little while, I'd like to get some headshots taken and built up my acting resume.
 
In terms of acting, I've admittedly not done as much as I have to fuel my writing career. I've played a few big roles in some school productions (though not many, since I was homeschooled up until I was 14), take my school's theater program at an IB level, and practice acting as much as I possibly can on a daily basis. I'm hoping to minor in drama in university and take some acting workshops once I'm in the UK. I'd apply for some here, but again, there aren't many options considering what country I'm in. 
 
What I'm hoping to do is hire an agent after I graduate university and gradually work my way up both the acting and writing career ladders. Acting and writing are things that I absolutely adore doing, and I would be so happy if I could spend the rest of my life doing them. I think of doing other things--going into business, or working a desk job, or being a teacher--and I just feel so disappointed. Being an actor and an author--or even just one of them, if one doesn't work out--would literally be a dream come true. 
 
I would love some advice on how to manage all of this. What specifically should I focus on doing right now? I know that grades are extremely important if I want to get accepted into a UK university, but my GPA/subject grades have been steadily high, so that isn't an issue. If I want to pursue the careers of both an author and an actress, what EXACTLY (and I want details here) should I be focusing on in high school and in university? When exactly should I start contacting agents? Which agents? What about visas? If I want to be an actress, would it be possible for me to work as one in the UK? My accent is very  American, but with a few months of practice I could probably hone a good British accent. If, say, I were fresh out of university, already had some income from publishing my books, and wanted to start acting, how would I have permission to STAY in the UK if my student visa from university has already expired? I know you can get visas from acting, but I also know that the audition process takes a long time, so where would I be able to stay while waiting for that to be over with?
 
I have so many questions and lots of worries, but I really want to be educated on this so I can work as hard as I possibly can to make this life happen. I'm willing to work hard, and I'm willing to take rejection and failure as they come. But if there's even a slight chance that I can set things into motion and make this life happen, then I would absolutely appreciate your advice SO MUCH. Again--my parents are pretty clueless on the subject (my mom teaches first grade and my dad is an engineer/runs a food business), and Google can only tell me so much. I would appreciate your advice so, so much
 
I only have one life, right? I really, really want to make this one count and work for what I want :) and if it doesn't work out, then that's okay! At least I tried.
 
Thank you so much for reading. Have a great rest of your day!

1efr0jf,(Enterprise/Key) Sales Account Executive in Technology (ERP-Software),"Hi,

I started off as a BDR at a large ERP Vendor 2 years ago. 1 Year ago I was promoted to a Sales Account Executive working with Enterprise and Key Accounts (2b Revenue - 40b Revenue). Sales cycles are long and complex often lasting between 6-12 months.

Due to personal reasons I will unfortunately need to move closer to where I grew up (7 hours away from where I live currently), meaning I would need to find a new gig (Current employer does not do 100% Remote).

1efqcaq,Struggling to switch off as I WFH (33f) really struggling ,"I’ve been working from home for around 18 months and I’m really struggling. My husband said I basically work 10 hours, then talk about work, then complain about work then go to bed. A lot of it is because I’m frustrated because our boundaries are so weak at my work. 

I often have to reply to clients at 7pm and have to check in on sat and Sunday to respond to anyone who needs anything urgently done. My work has told me to take my lunch break and reply a bit slower but I have a deep fear of turning off my notifications at 6:30 and then not replying if something urgent happens or a client asks me something and I don’t reply until the next day. I know it’s probably fine but because my work does expect us to be pretty switched on I’m finding it very hard.

1efqalq,Is this a good or bad next step?,"I will be graduating in two months with a Bachelor of Science in Management Information Systems. My college curriculum required more computer classes than business courses. My degree should qualify me for roles in the following fields:



- Software Development

- Database Administration

- Network Administration

- End-User Support

- Systems Administration

- Business Analytics

- Project Management

- Systems Analysis



However, as an online student, I was unable to secure any internships during my studies, which has made the job search process challenging due to my lack of experience. I've highlighted my capstone project, where I worked with a group to create a website and database for a real-world client, but it hasn't been enough.



I am particularly interested in working remotely or becoming self-employed, taking on short-term contracts. I'm now considering pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science or Data Analysis and would like to find a program that focuses on both areas. In the meantime, I plan to continue seeking internships and clients to build my resume.

1efnx0t,I need to decide between a 1st level Master degree and a two year specialization ,"Hello everyone, I’m 26 and 2 years ago I got a bachelor’s degree in Design. I’m from Italy and I don’t know how it works elsewhere but bachelor here it’s  3 years course and then you could continue with other 2 years of specialization or a 1st level master. 
So I can’t decide between the two because

1) I feel like I’m already late bc of my age so a master (1 year) makes me feel less guilty

2) The specialization provides a more complete education, but it’s usually less practical and job oriented while master degrees are way more specific and practical

3) I want to work as soon as possible but also I don’t want to feel like I have a lacking education

4) I read that at least in Italy people with master and specialization both have pretty good chance to find jobs but with masters it’s a little lower (like 5%)

5) I would like to study abroad and of coursr a master would be easier for that.


Also the field I would like to go for would be Exhibit design/Retail Design or art direction/communication

1efnaie,Thinking about leaving engineering.,"I'm 24, have been in (building services) engineering for 6 years and I have no interest in this job or type of work anymore. 

I've just finished my bachelor's in the subject alongside full time work and I'm just so done with it.

I'm on my second company now in this industry and it's not the company that's the problem; it's me. In this new company people are great, the atmosphere is chill but you still have to do the work (absolutely no issue with that) and the money is fantastic.
However despite all of this I'm just not a fan of it anymore.

I don't see myself working in this type of engineering  for the next 20, 10, 5 years. It doesn't interest me at all. 
Some people will say ""what a waste of degree and time "" and sure that may be the case,  but I just don't want to do it anymore. 
On the other hand, some people will say that ""oh, since you don't want to do this  engineering you should go into another form of engineering"", and to that I'd say no. I have no interest. 

I'm not sure what I want to do with my life, truth be told. I just want to do something where I'm not at a desk all day thinking to myself how bored and not mentally simulated I am (love doing hands on stuff outside of work).  
I wouldn't mind getting ""let go"" as it would automatically mean that I gain 4 hours of my day back, because of not having to travel 2 hours one way.

I'm not 100% sure what I'm asking here. Probably just some perspective on this situation. Thanks!",Technical_Mountain,1,1.0,3,1722324467,2024-07-30 07:27:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1efnaie/thinking_about_leaving_engineering/,7,2024

1efmktk,I have two potential career paths... MMA Sales and Information Technology... which one should I take?,"There are two career paths that I can choose to go down at this point in time, one being MMA sales, and the other being Information Technology. I can see pros and cons to both. Allow me to explain:

MMA Sales: If I go down this path, my income would likely be more of a question mark. The owner of the gym is someone that I know and trust within the community. His gym is very well respected. He told me he is looking into the future and he wants someone that can be there for him full-time, saying this will not be his only location for the MMA gym. Additionally, he said this position does have the opportunity to make me a lot of money. 

My thing with this position is it is not about the money for me. Money is needed in this world for us to thrive and survive, but I do not want to be confined to a desk for 49-50 weeks out of the year, 8 hours a day, only to make someone else richer, the latter opportunity would be my concern with that.

IT: I wish I could say that I am making great money doing IT, but that would actually not be the case. I am working service desk, and I do not have a large income. That said, I know that IT has the ability to provide me a large one for my future. Another thing that I do have with this company is great benefits, something I will likely have to provide for myself at the MMA gym.

That said, I feel like this route could be more of a ""safer"" option.

I am at a crossroads here, and if anyone can provide a bit of perspective, I would appreciate it. ",Objective_Repair5365,1,1.0,0,1722321601,2024-07-30 06:40:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1efmktk/i_have_two_potential_career_paths_mma_sales_and/,7,2024

It's my 8th shift today and he said I'm not doing good enough and what have I been doing (she was berating me more during my 2nd week)

I admit I'm not good at portioning the food, and he knows that and I admitted it to him. I memorise the measurements, but being fast to be putting the exact right proportion isn't my strongest suit. I told him my coworkers who were training me taught me how to do it, but when I ask for tips and guidance all they tell me is that 'I'll get better soon enough’. Plus I didn't get to practice portioning due to how busy it is around the place and they'd tell me to do something else instead of practising since it's too busy around

My manager asked what's the point of having me there and I should've been fired and that I act like an airhead. He said this in front of everybody including my coworkers and customers.

Then he asked me what can he do to help me progress, and I told him just give me more time to practice and l'll do better, but he just made me go home earlier than I'm supposed to clock out

Now he changed my shift for this week. I had 2 more originally with 4 hours each but now he just cut it into 1 day and 3 hrs

1efkyao,Being ignored as a product designer,"Obvious throwaway. Hoping to get some advice in this strange pickle of a job I'm in. Sorry if this is a long one but there's a lot of context to get through...

I'm a product designer for a moderately large tech company which owns several software products. Our particular team is small and relatively independent, so we're used to doing things ""our own way"" compared to others in the company. When I was hired 3 years ago, it was as product designer, and at our company that means having a Product Owner (PO) responsibility for features. I am one of the leading experts in the specific subject matter of this software. It was supposed to be a great fit: they get some great expertise and I get to work in a field I know really well, and get to help guide the product to success.

My boss is the Product Manager (PM) and has overall control of the product. The engineers are under an engineering manager so there's a bit of a split management going on. The senior engineer had been there a few years and was the unofficial PO, but the team wasn't very large until the round of hires when I started, so the PO role kind of grew out of necessity. Not sure this matters but our team is mostly in one city, but PM and I are fully remote so we see the rest of the team in person maybe once a year.

The first year was quite good, I got to work on the backlog, elevated features that we needed, made lots of great plans to positions us better compared to our competitors, worked with customers, etc. We were all working well, or so I thought. About a year in, the senior engineer started to make a stink about there only being ""one PO"" for the team and convinced the management to split my role. I still, to this day, don't understand why this happened. Maybe he felt threatened? Insecurity? Personalities? Maybe they just didn't like me? I can only speculate. He was promoted officially to PO and given all priority/decision making power. I was relegated to ""just designer."" (No other team in the company operates this way, remember ""our own way."") At the time I was green and didn't see the implications of this division but I really regret not standing up for myself at the time.

Since I'm a leading expert in the field, I'm well-known among the customer base. A big part of a PO's job is to interface with customers and figure out their needs and translate that into actual features. I do a lot of listening to them and try to advocate for them. In a way I'm doing a lot of a PO's job already, just not deciding which things to build anymore. Since I'm ""just the designer"" my input on the direction of the product has been ignored more and more.

To add salt to the wound, the features they do want to work on have little to do with the expertise I bring to the team, nor are they what the customers really want. So I'm stuck doing lame design projects that no one but the managers/PO cares about. All the while the customers are crying out for different features, and mock the features we do ship. Since I'm the customer contact I have to take the shit while PM/PO sit pretty in their sheltered houses. It makes me wonder why I'm here; my expertise goes to waste.

The actual PO is a very thin-skinned person and gets super defensive when anyone pushes back on his designs. The designs are not usually very good, often lacking the deep understanding of the product from a customer perspective that you need. I'm not saying I'm some brilliant designer, I'm always learning how to improve, but I know duds when I see them and he pushes them out constantly. Also, since he's a senior engineer, he gets enormous latitude to do what he wants, design and build his own features that interest him, rather than what's best for the product. Remember, I'm supposed to be the designer, but he is designing anyway. It's enormously frustrating to see his inferior ideas get elevated and actually shipped while my good ideas get shelved, possibly forever. Not to mention our roles getting scrambled, always to my detriment.

PO and I no longer work well together; we are essentially not on speaking terms. He has been enormously disrespectful of my expertise multiple times, trying to cut me down for ""not being representative of the customer base"" which is nuts. When I try to push back on his disingenuous use of analytics to justify a feature he gets very defensive and rude. (Our analytics are quite poor so the few numbers we do have, they cling to like a life raft.) I learned long ago that you get more flies with honey than vinegar and I am overall very cordial with my colleagues. This is the only coworker where there's a problem, but the discord is affecting the rest of the team, so I've heard. I feel very badly about that but I don't see that there's anything I can do.

On the flip side, when I do get to ship a feature, it tends to go well, but it's happened maybe only twice in the three years, which is nuts for a product that releases very often. On the last big feature I shipped, the engineer I worked with was hugely complementary of my design since it was very thorough and clear. I have a good work ethic when I have something good to work on! It's like I'm not being allowed to shine!

I have brought all this up to management several times, especially a strong in-person heart-to-heart about it last year, but things have not improved. I have not gone to HR yet, hoping management can manage things, but if I get abused again I feel I'm going to have to.

My PM boss is pretty good overall, but very averse to conflict. I wonder if this is causing him to not confront this issue. Truth be told I'm also averse to conflict but I'll try to stand my ground when I'm correct. But I have a feeling he will never bring me into the fold at this point. When PO took an absence for a while, PM took on the PO duties himself rather than ask me for help, even though he is already overloaded. I know he probably didn't mean it, but it feels particularly cutting. The promise of being a PO when I was hired has been thoroughly broken.

There is a glimmer of hope in here: I'm doing occasional work with marketing. It tends to go quite well when I get to meet with customers at conventions, for example. It's not my favorite—I'm not a big schmoozer/salesman—but I enjoy talking shop with customers a lot. The company has also built up some customer research procedures and I've been doing a lot of that too since I'm the customer contact. My worry is the ideas that come through will fall into a black hole and be ignored. Here's to hoping data can work politically.

I don't want to leave as I really believe in this product's success, but I'm not seeing any future progression in a career here, and my mental health is taking a toll. My only recourse seems to be to jump to a competitor or shift roles to something else. That's tough to do in my specialist field. Any advice thoroughly appreciated!",Cryptographer2556,0,0.5,0,1722315422,2024-07-30 04:57:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1efkyao/being_ignored_as_a_product_designer/,7,2024
1efkvk5,How do I get a good job paying in dollars/pounds/etc?,"I'm 16(m) and I am living in a corrupt, third world country called Pakistan. Inflation is rising so much every year. The government is putting taxes on everything to fill their pockets. 

I took O Levels in Commerce. I have given 9 IGCSEs, Business Studies, Economics, Accounting along with  Math, Sociology and English and a few compulsory Pakistani ones. 3A*s, 4As and 2Bs

Even though I got good grades I've come to realize that commerce has no real value. My father who is working at a bank, makes 130k rupees or $466 dollars a month. I don't want a bleak future. I want to earn enough to support my parents, siblings and start a family of my own who I can take care of and provide for. For that money is the solution

So I have come to ask for advice. What should I do? Should I go for A Levels(College) in the Commerce field or take 1-2 years to study another Field like computer science or medicine? I regret taking Commerce, I can't blame my parents for putting me in this field since they had little knowledge about it.

Do you have any advice. I feel lost and stressed. Are there foreign job opportunities for people like me in the future in Pakistan? Are there organizations that are willing to employ? Our currency is so weak that I can literally fill my stomach for 2 dollars a day🫠

I want to be better, I don't want to live with stress and problems and I want to make my family proud.

1efizzy,I don't like being a manager and wish I didn't take the role,"Sorry, this is a bit of a rant post but I hate being a manager and I understand why managers are stressed all the time.

I was promoted to a manager role in early spring. Our company is quite small and I really liked doing what I was doing before as an individual contributor but I said I'd give the role a try and see how things go. I still do what I was doing but now also oversee a team of 6. I've taken a hands-off approach so far, but there were some performance issues lately with some of the team members that have been brought up which I now have to address.

I'm stressed because: Telling someone who you work with that they are doing a shit job sucks. The relationship management aspect of it is really tough.  I'm a pretty sensitive person, and I'm not assertive, so this is extra hard for me. Honestly, the pay bump was minimal for the amount of stress it's causing. I want my old job back lol.

However, my greatest fear right now is if people are doing badly, it's going to reflect badly on me. This frustrates me because I cannot control other people at the end of the day. I can only give guidance. To add insult to injury, we cannot afford to lose anyone right now, because we have all been overworked for the past several months. 

I hope I can figure out something soon to get the team back on track.

1efizhh,Whats a good field to get into if I like Math and Coding? ,"Hello, thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm a college student majoring in statistics, minoring in computer science, with some experiences making desktop apps, web app. Currently reading about TDD, clean code, grokking algo, and design patterns, for personal projects. Got about 2 years left till graduation .

I'm at a crossroads with what I want my future job to be. Things I'm considering are: is it over saturated? Is working remotely a possibility? What's the work culture like? What's the opportunities for vertical growth like? Is it too repetitive? Is the barrier of entry crazy high? 

Any insights and personal experiences would be much appreciated. Thank you! 

here's some options I'm thinking of: 

  
- Quant finance: I really like the prospect of integrating math with code in quant finance(?) it also helps that I've been getting more and more into stocks and economy now and find it fascinating. I just don't see a lot of examples of what this job entails online. 

- Game dev: I love games, and I hear there's a lot of math and physics involved in this so that's interesting. I just don't know if coding games is what I want to do long term 

- Software Engineer: Software engineering and webdev are the things I'm currently doing and exploring right now. I love the software design part of things I think it exercises my creativity, I also like solving algo problems (not that i'm any good at it, still learnin). I just fear that it might be too repetitive with the whole crud thing? 

- Webdev/ frontend engineer 

- Embedded Systems: It's just that there's a lot of things I haven't yet learned in this field like (C, electronics, controllers, etc). It's a whole new world that I'm not sure yet if it's worth getting into, but I absolutely love the idea of making tangible outputs of your own code.

1efio2u,Being told about job openings,"I work for a large company that has a really awful job posting website- none of the jobs you'd really know what they are unless someone told you what to look for as they have technical names often abbreviated. The alerts system is also really awful, if you put location in the location bar it only shows jobs where that's theonly that primary location, not including it, so i had been missing out on jobs for months even after asking my supervisor if i was doing it wrong and showing her how i was searching and she didn't seem to know either that you have to put the location in the search bar not the location field.

i just found out about some job openings that only lasted a week but were exactly the kind of work i'd been doing for four years when my company put me in a role without a job title and had to do work way beyond my pay grade with very little support or involvement since no division wanted to own the process anyway. about four months ago they transferred that to another department and i went back to the work i was originally hired for and our company really hadn't been hiring much so i worked hard and became top performer with the intention of moving out asap. but now i find out these jobs just came open due to a restructuring and the sups sup being fired and replaced who wanted to create a team to train and align processes which is exactly what is been doing for four years. 

is it unreasonable to expect my manager and supervisors could have told me these job openings was there considering i'm sure they knew about it because they have been meeting with the new person building the team regularly? i have told every manager since i started that's the work im interested in and id never have known what it was if a coworker hadn't told me after she got it (they were building a whole team so there were multiple roles- i just knew nothing about it until too late). in pissed that the job board system sucks so bad and people tend to find out about jobs through word of mouth and their managers proclivity to be helpful in that regard, despite having been constantly told by supervisors they're commited to my career growth and development it's very hit or miss, some managers share listings to job openings with their teams (i've had five managers in five years and several sent links to me personally and posted to slack to our whole team and others dont). i really needed to move out of this role and im curious what people's experience is - do other companies have cryptic job listings and ooor job search/alerts systems?is it reasonable to expect when they say dedicated to job growth they actually give terms to look for to navigate the enormous lists of abbreviated corporate terms? or if jobs are coming open that are directly related to our roles?",portiapalisades,1,1.0,1,1722307968,2024-07-30 02:52:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1efio2u/being_told_about_job_openings/,7,2024
1efiizd,"I don't have a degree, but I have an extensive niche skillset. Where can this take me next?","I'm 27 and I live in a large Canadian city. I have 9 years of experience working in community-based organizations. I have half of a BA in community development. I'm an ENFP, the three personality types I ranked highest with were traditional, artistic, and social. 

My most recent job was developing and facilitating an employment readiness program for young adults from the ground up. In the past, I have done programming for youth drop-ins and EAL tutoring. If I were to ask my current boss, they would say that planning (event and curriculum) is my strongest skill. 

I am self-taught in Adobe Creative Cloud and do photography as a side gig. I am able to use Wordpress and I created an online course using an LMS. I also have experience doing social media management and marketing. I am a gifted writer and I have written technical documents (contracts, regulations, mandates) along with a strong creative portfolio. I also did a significant amount of copyediting in my last role. I write and format resumes/CVs for friends. 

I have a knack for connecting with people that goes beyond my work life. I am able to relate to difficult clients and de-escalate social conflict easily. I take a person-first approach and have fought for clients to get what they need, even if it's above what we generally offer. My clients often leave feedback that mentions my demeanour as a positive of my program. I have a strong community presence due to networking with other organizations and I am trained in peer support from a DBT-informed lens. I have spoken at public events on short notice and I am able to get crowds engaged, regardless of their background or size. 

The main issue with my current job is balancing a public presence with case management, event planning, and facilitation. This is a lot to handle, and I would love to narrow down what I am doing a bit - I cannot be this broad forever and avoid burnout. I like all of these things equally, so I'm not sure where to head next. I'm not set on staying in not-for-profit work, but I do feel a bit trapped without education. Can I be useful anywhere else? 

Thanks in advance for any feedback, I'm so lost!

1efi5ml,Coaching plan or FMLA?,"**tl;dr** I work at a big tech company and for the past several months, my worsening mental health (severe depression, burnout) has made my job performance worsen. In the midst of figuring out FMLA for mental health, I was put on a coaching plan (precursor to PIP). I know I don't want to work here any longer, but don't know what to do and how to make the most out of the situation

**backstory** I knew something was off with me 9 or 10 months ago but couldn't tell if it was the beginning of burnout (layoffs left a gap in my org and i was put in a place to deal with the things falling through the cracks) or if I was starting to get depressed (have had one other episode of major depression). I tried many things like saying yes to more social activities, going outside more. On the work front started to raise my hand to my manager when i was getting asked to do things beyond the scope of my role to try and get help. My manager wasn't necessarily helpful but I kept on anyway

Things steadily worsened with my mental health however and for the past 2-3 months, i have been struggling. My house is a mess, i can barely stay awake outside of working hours, and i have all but isolated myself. I have to manage clients and stakeholders in my job and a large part of my day is spent in meetings, but as you can imagine the lack of energy and fatigue and brain fog made my performance drop. Along the way I did open up to my manager about the burnout I was experiencing (as other members on the team had) but did not mention depression and just said I was working on my mental health and stress levels

Despite starting medication and therapy I have not started to feel better. so I started to look into my options and learned about FMLA. I went to my PCP a week ago to discuss my antidepressants (were increased) and while there I inquired about FMLA but was told their office doesn't support that because 'if things are serious they should be handled by a specialist' and gave me a referral to one. I was in the process of figuring out the exact steps to take and contacting specialists but then my manager set up a meeting with me...

Today I was just put on a coaching plan (not an official PIP yet but not informal coaching either). Manager has started to lay out some targets to hit and has shared that if I am not on top of everything for the next couple of weeks I will be offered the choice of a PIP or to leave and take severance

**dilemma** What should I do? Is there one option that would avoid being marked as 'no' when asked about eligibility for rehire? If FMLA I know I should act fast but what is the order of the steps I need to do? I'm confused if I say I'll be going out on leave first and then get paperwork processed or if I make sure to have the paperwork in hand before stating the leave.",some-throwaway-813,0,0.5,0,1722306442,2024-07-30 02:27:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1efi5ml/coaching_plan_or_fmla/,7,2024

1efggu9,Can I ask for a raise in a lateral move?,"I started working at an environmental company about 9 months ago, hired as a lab analyst. I recently applied for an internal position for the company’s project management team and they have decided to bring me on (yay)! I do not have project management experience, but I have a lot of customer service in my background and I’ve proven myself to be a valuable employee. 

HR has been pretty firm that this is a lateral move- I personally feel like I’m taking on much more responsibility and making a step upwards. I have not received my official offer letter yet but, I’ve spoken with the project management lead and HR, both parties were explaining that it’s a lateral move because I’m new to the company. While I understand that I’m new, I’ve proven that I’m an asset. My supervisor raves about me and has mentioned she would like to counter offer for me, head of HR says I have outstanding reviews and that I will be the pm team’s “best decision they ever made”, I’m known to be a team player, and the head of my department has congratulated me on my progress as analyst with how much I’ve accomplished since I started. 

I was hoping for at least a dollar raise.  I won’t decline if I don’t get a pay increase, I want to build a career as a pm. I really feel that I deserve a bit of raise and I know I’m worth it! So even with HR insisting it’s a lateral move, can I ask for a pay increase? I don’t think it’s totally fair that I’m not allowed a raise because I’m new to the company, I think my work ethic and progress should be more important.

Calling past editor in chiefs of yearbooks, I'm currently in college and I recently got the position for editor in chief for my colleges yearbook team. This position was handed down to me by a graduating senior and I accepted, knowing it would be great for managing experience, learning to connect and work with others, etc etc. As the school year comes closer, I have the terrible feeling that I have no idea what I'm doing. With last years seniors graduating (who took up most of the team), the staff is down to two people (me included) with our boss/advisor helping. I've never had a position like this before (besides one position as photo editor of yearbook) and I've never really managed anything; in the next year I have to figure out a theme for the book, hire new staff, and learn how to manage a team on the go, while working with difficult software, photographing events, all the while being a college student. I know I have the potential to really do a good job on the yearbook and make something great with a team, I suppose I'm looking for advice while I'm stuck in this lost mindset.

I started my job about 4 months ago (Corporate Real Estate Management). Since starting I have had a couple health issues.

But my gut is telling me she’s just being professional and I have this paranoia she’s trying to find a way to coach me out or fire me.

I’ve always struggled with anxiety but it’s been manageable and has never held me back much. I just found out today that a lot of my symptoms are due to Severe Sleep Apnea. They diagnosed me but I still need a formal sleep study to confirm. This will happen in a couple weeks. 

Is this something I need to report to HR? Would it be in my best interest to talk with them about this health condition? I don’t want to build a case for any kind of special treatment.

1efeczf,"Outsiders who keep crashing school alumni events: why, and how to stop them?","I graduated from graduate school decades ago and am on its alumni board.  We plan events for alumni, often with speeches on niche topics and often designed to help alumni meet each other.  It's all to help them do business with each other, although the school certainly hopes that it will encourage them to donate to the school.

Anyone who attends an alumni event gets added to the email list, so when we publicize an event, some ""outsiders"" who didn't go to that university or even work in the profession of most alumni find out and show up.

Alumni events are typically sponsored by alumni businesses and held at alumni offices, and alumni who sponsor and host obviously do so for business development.

It's really annoying when people who have no tie to the school or the alumni line of work show up.  Maybe it helps their careers, but when we have limited space and each attendee costs money to the sponsor, I get irked, particularly when the crashes stay after the event ends, making the alumni host stay late (as you can't really leave your office if there are strangers still in it).

Is my irritation valid and how far can you go to tell the crashers not to come? Would the best approach be to have the alumni association ban non-alumni (as policy) and then non-alumni could be told, ""sorry, it's for alumni only""?

The latest event is specifically advertised as ""alumni only"", and I'm paying out pocket to host it at my office, and I don't want a bunch of crashers who do nothing for my business to show up, but a few have already responded ""yes"" to the event invitation email.",Big_Celery2725,1,1.0,3,1722295791,2024-07-29 23:29:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1efeczf/outsiders_who_keep_crashing_school_alumni_events/,7,2024

I had studied and worked for this for almost 15 years. Highly competitive and highly sought after role. Finally got my dream position, but after 3 years there I found myself on the receiving end of some pretty toxic and horrendous behaviour that culminated in being forcibly moved to a different position - the ""shut your mouth, you're going there and that's it"" kind of move (pre-empting your comments: it is the kind of company that can and will do that). This happened literally overnight. Effectively, everything I studied and worked for in my entire adult life was taken away from me, forever, on the whim of someone who can exert influence if they so wish, with no accountability, or transparency, or possibility of appeal or redress. I was left nearly suicidal, could barely keep food down, didn't shower for a week... you get the picture. For the first time in my life I went off sick. I pulled myself together and returned after 3 weeks to start in the new role. It was a very different position - seriously underwhelming, it was like going from fighter jet pilot to baggage handler in a budget airline. I gave it a shot for a few months but then realized I could not stand it. Not only was the job extremely boring, I was hurt with the company that did this to me and could not trust them anymore. I felt I'd had enough and went and got a job somewhere else.

Now... My ""dream role"" was pretty unique to that company - it simply does not exist (in the same format or dealing with the same themes) anywhere else. The new job (i.e. my current role) seemed to have a few overlaps and certainly drew on loads of skills I had developed earlier in my career. I was fine for the first few months - although I found it a bit boring and certainly not the stuff I was doing before (more airline pilot than fighter jet pilot...).

Then, gradually, the role started changing. I realized that the few applicable skills I had were no longer being put to use - instead the work that required my skills was being given to other colleagues who had no training or experience in it, despite my bosses knowing I was extremely skilled in that field. Instead, I was gradually given more and more work that was very much outside my area of expertise, or even general knowledge. Again, very specific field so will draw a parallel, but think airline pilot being told to do weather analysis for crop yield predictions... I was given very basic training (literally, links to some YouTube videos...). Of course, my performance started decreasing. My morale also plummeted - I find myself getting distracted, reaching for my phone, or endlessly reading and re-reading what I'm looking at in the hopes of miraculously understanding it.

It finally caught up with me and I was called in for a meeting where I was told my performance was dropping and I had to get my ass in gear. I was told clearly that if I don't know something I should seek management guidance and not try and figure it out by myself. Management, however, is not great. I certainly increased the frequency at which I ask for advice, but 90% of the time they are either too busy to respond or just give me some vague answer. After pushing for clarity, on several occasions different managers have confessed they don't know the answer either. I came to the realization that most of my managers are very skilled at looking skilled, but don't have significant experience behind them to back it up. Very fast paced too. Everyone has way too much on their plate. Working overtime (unpaid) almost every day, some late nights or weekends here and there, and an expectation (written into the contract) that I will pick up the phone and respond to emails out of hours. When I signed it I assumed this would be occasionally, in peak times, or in response to an emergency situation. But turns out that it means messages through the evenings, weekends and holidays, including at 2am on a Sunday requesting ""urgent work"". It's not urgent - it's a commercial enterprise, not a life-saving service. If I was in investment banking making half a million a year, I would put up with the long days. But I'm not, and I'm earning a mid-5-figure yearly salary...

I find myself in a job I don't know much about, not using my skills when there is the opportunity to do so, doing work I find extremely boring, and carrying a load of stress that - as you can imagine - I really don't need. Having only ever worked in one other place, however, I find myself to be quite inexperience in how to deal with all of this.

Any advice would be deeply appreciated - and apologies for the long post.",ZealousidealGrade398,2,1.0,0,1722294671,2024-07-29 23:11:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1efdxj3/lost_motivation_after_role_scope_changed/,7,2024

1efd7da,Dealing with Nit-Picky/Control Freak Co-Worker,"Hi everyone,

I could really use some unbiased advice. I've been in my role for about 8 months now. I'm an attorney who graduated law school in May 2023. I work in a position where my law degree is valued, but not required. There's only one other person in my role - she's also an attorney who practiced law for 4 years before coming into this position. We are similar in age.

She drives me absolutely insane. She's constantly making remarks or comments about things that don't actually matter just because it's not done or said in the exact same way she would do it. This ranges from nit-picking emails to giving direction in a way that would more appropriately come from a boss, not a same-level coworker. Rather than being helpful it comes accross as total control freak behavior.

She takes ""pride"" in the fact that she's very direct and doesn't mind confrontation. My boss (not a lawyer) is no help because she is a total pushover who doesn't feel confident in her own role/abilities so she allows this co-worker to act this way towards everyone. My boss even allows this coworker to push her around and patronize her.

I am trying so hard to make it to the 1 year mark before quitting, but I am at the point where I am seriously considering applying for admin assistant type roles just to get away from dealing with lawyer personalities. I am so depressed every day. Yes, I am a lawyer, and I regret that decision every day. That's why I entered a non-lawyer role, but I feel like with my degree, I have no choice but to work in spaces where lawyer personalities will inevitably be present. 

Any advice for how to deal with these type of personalities at work would be much appreciated. I've gotten better at not letting her remarks slide off my shoulders, but working with her is definitely my least favorite part of the job. Our roles require that we work with eachother every single day, so limiting our interactions isn't an option.",ThrowRA-SharpSet65,2,1.0,0,1722292796,2024-07-29 22:39:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1efd7da/dealing_with_nitpickycontrol_freak_coworker/,7,2024
1efd0ql,Do I follow my dream or money?,"In my last year of high school currently with a part-time job. I grew up middle class, but in the last few years things have quickly spiraled. My dream ever since I was little was to become an artist. Obviously, not possible, so I looked for more realistic options. Art teacher? Considered it, but still I am afraid I will not be able to survive on just that income.

My dreams are just dreams, and unfortunately I am not good at academics. I study, do all my homework, stay after class for help and still I end up being mediocre. Now, I am diagnosed with some mental health issues (ADHD, depression, anxiety) which affects my performance in school. Most of the time, all the words on books seem like gibberish and no matter how much I study I forget all of it the next day. 

My plan is to go to community college for 2 years, and then head off to a university both my parents graduated from. I figure this will be easy considering I will be an alumni attending the uni & it's already at at 88% acceptance rate. My question is, what would your advice be when I choose my major?
Do I follow my passion and choose art as my major or play it safe?

1efcofc,Got an offer from a small startup while still applying to larger companies,"Long story short.. Ive gotten an offer after a single screening round from a smaller startup with great pay and benefits(except 401k). While Im currently waiting for interviews to be scheduled for 3 other much larger companies(household names). 
Im fairly certain the pay would not be very different, though the benefits may be better if i were to get these other offers.
My two concerns are that i do have a blemish on my record and would almost 100% have a background check for the larger companies while the current offer has not mentioned one. And the interviews for these larger companies are known to be much more competitive and difficult.
For context I’m a recent grad with one year of internship experience.
My options are to either send my info in to HR and receive/sign a formal offer letter asap. Wait and finish the other interviews and hopefully this offer stands as i complete those then choose. Or accept this position and complete the other interviews then potentially quit the first company within weeks of starting.

1efcc4u,Background check nightmare — anyone had to deal with HireRight?,"I’ve been dealing with a nightmare involving a HireRight background check for the last three weeks, and curious if anyone has any advice/commiseration about dealing with them.

Short summary: I accepted a new position almost a month ago. My first day is supposed to be next week. However, everything seems to be on hold while I deal with the third week of a background check with HireRight. The problem: they say they can’t verify my employment with the company where I spent nearly all of my career, from right after college up until two years ago. Or rather, they claim that they can only verify my start date with that company as July of 2022…which would be two months before I left the job. In actuality, I worked for that company for 14 years straight.

I tried to clear this up, and sent them the last 10 years of my W2s, as well as an employment summary from my old company’s payroll which clearly lists my hire date, job title, and termination date. Now they want me to send them a long series of W2s and pay stubs dating all the way back to two years before I started with the company. (This would have been when I was still in college. I have no idea why they need this.) I simply do not have any pay stubs or tax info from nearly two decades ago (the oldest tax info I still have in my possession is from 2014), nor do I know how to get it. 

I feel like I’m going crazy. I was totally honest on my resume, and my new job does not even deal with particularly sensitive information. I have no idea where HireRight even got this wildly wrong information about my job history, and it’s so frustrating that I can’t actually speak to anyone at HireRight directly. In a normal situation, it would be very easy for me to prove my employment history: my former supervisor still works there and says he can clear it up if they call him; I have 10 years of W2s; and what’s more, I actually had a *very public-facing* job: I regularly appeared at conferences and panels on behalf of the company several times a year, and many of these appearances were written about in newspapers and trade papers. I’ve appeared on TV news a dozen or so times as a representative of the company. I was literally profiled once in a magazine toward the end of my tenure at the company. But apparently none of this will do — they need pay stubs from 19 years ago.

I’m really starting to freak out. My new company’s HR has not been helpful. I’ve already left my previous job, and if this new job gets taken away from me because of this I’ll be pretty fucked. (Just last week I turned down an interview with a different company where I’d applied, since I’d already been hired elsewhere.) Is there really no other recourse? HireRight are the ones who screwed up here! (Hilariously, the last time I took a new job, two years ago, I had to do a background check with HireRight, and I sailed right through it.)",Nerazzurro9,1,1.0,3,1722290613,2024-07-29 22:03:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1efcc4u/background_check_nightmare_anyone_had_to_deal/,7,2024
1efc0um,Should I use my legal name when applying to internships?,"I’m an mtf transsexual [TF 21] who is about to start on the next cycle of summer internship applications. I’m a rising Junior, and I just completed an engineering internship for a fortune 100 company in a town in a red state. I’m absolutely sure I could get a return offer for next summer (hopefully in an office in a more friendly place), but I’m going to wait and try applying in other companies first.

Due to issues with my family, I can’t currently change my legal name or gender. So, I’m stuck with a male name on my documentation (transcripts and proof of citizenship). Otherwise, everything else (linkedin, resume, most documentation with my current internship) has a female name.

I’m starting to wonder what my strategy will be in the next cycle of applications. Most of the companies just ask for a name, so I could either enter my legal name with a note somewhere explaining the discrepancy (which is kinda humiliating), or I could put the name on my resume and linkedin (which is kinda dishonest, and must eventually be corrected with HR).

Some companies have applications with two questions: “legal name” and “preferred name (optional).” Obv I know what to do there. Honestly, my #1 plan is to go to as many career fairs as possible so the recruiters can see my smiling face before the legal name issue.

1efbe3p,"Job hiring process dragging on forever, should I wait or move on? ","

About a month and a half ago I interviewed with a company looking for a mid level computer vision engineer. I passed the technical and behavioral interviews with flying colors, according to my recruiter. There was one other candidate interviewing, and apparently the company liked us so much that they wanted to hire both of us on, but they had to wait for the CTO to return from vacation before proceeding.

Then I got the news that the CTO decided they needed to hire on a senior CVE “to build initial infrastructure” before bringing on a mid level CVE. It’s been a month since I’ve gotten this news and no developments. The senior started a few weeks ago. I try not to bug my recruiter too much so I’ll occasionally ask her if she knows anything, but she keeps saying she doesn’t know what’s going with the company. According to our latest correspondence, she doesn’t know when I could be brought on because they don’t even know when they’ll be done with this “initial infrastructure”. Additionally, I don’t even know if I’m going to get the job because there’s this mysterious other candidate that I might be up against. 

I would really like to advance my career in computer vision, as I spent my last job working in CV and did my masters in CV. My last job was a startup and went bust btw, so I wasn’t there long enough to get a ton of professional experience as a CVE, so I’m getting rejected left and right in this shitty job market. I’ve been upskilling on my own time but my wallet (and pride) is starting to hurt.

I would love to work for this company, but I’m starting to have my doubts and believe that this might be a massive waste of time. I have an old job from a few years ago that I could potentially go back to as a data scientist. When my old supervisor saw my LinkedIn change to Open to Work 8 months ago, he messaged me and asked if I wanted to come back. I said no I was looking for CV work. But now after unsuccessfully job hunting for almost 8 months I’m considering going back. I really hated that job but the pay would be really nice right now. (Hindsight is 20/20 lol, I had no idea how fucked the tech market is)

Should I hang tight and see if this CVE role accepts me or should I take off the clown suit and go back to my old job that I hate?

I'm an inherently curious individual, so i always thought many things were ""Cool."" science was interesting, math was interesting, history was interesting, the human body was interesting, but nothing stood out and told me that my life's mission is medicine, or engineering like my peers. I chose finance because i figured it would be best to bolster my financial acumen as I have always wanted to start a business. Nonetheless, i hate my job and its sad because i have no right to complain, I am blessed beyond belief with an amazing team and a great company with my only problem being that i cant stand the mundane work that i do, it gets really boring and i take no gratification from it.

I come from a family of entrepreneurs, where the majority of my cousins and uncles own small businesses, I've always wanted to take this route, but i don't know where to begin. There are many paths that i could take that would allow me to make money, but that's not what I'm interested in, I want to feel a sense of fulfillment where I want to get up and go to work because i love what i do. I cant seem to figure this out. The only part of myself that I have conviction in is this: I love being around others and serving others. I love hosting, having people over, I love experiences and being able to share those experiences with others.

Growing up, I belonged to a small Christian community of Egyptians. My entire adolescence was comprised of spending time at church, this may sound odd, but our church wasn't traditional - we hung out there daily as there was always an event or something to do. Growing up there was a family of doctors that wanted to ensure the youth would consistently come to church on the weekends, so they would take us out to NBA championship games, pay for a world renowned soccer coach to come teach us, pay for retreats, dinner, tuitions, you name it. The question of ""If money wasn't an issue, what would you do with your time?"" Genuinely speaking I would want to give back to others, I would love to give back to my community and provide people with the blessings i grew up with. However, this life long goal cannot be attained without first having a steady cash flow stream where ill be able to afford to do this.

About a month ago, it occurred to me that working towards having a managerial position at my place of work wouldn't be a terrible goal to work towards. My main concern is that I feel like I'd be letting the ones I love down by committing myself to this line of work. My father's always wanted me to have the best life possible, and growing up that meant good grades, good working habits, etc. I don't want to let anyone down, especially myself, but I feel as though I'm not really meant for much else in life anymore, so why not try my hand at something like this? At the very least, I think I'd make a decent amount of money. I'm open to any advice you might have on the matter, and thank you for taking the time to read this. Hope you're having a good day!",eldritch_cookie77,3,1.0,4,1722285285,2024-07-29 20:34:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1efa3e9/is_aspiring_to_be_a_restaurant_manager_shooting/,7,2024
1ef9r7k,Need advice on where to go next ,"I'm in a bit of a rock and a hard place with my career. I'm a minor executive at a large financial corporation and I deal with federal government audits often. I do love my coworkers and I'm on an amazing team. 

The issue is, I found out I'm making significantly less than everyone else in my department and field. I mean the next lowest paid person makes 45K more than me. 

The other people who deal with these auditors and compliance issues also make about 80K more than I do. My teammates and coworkers brought this up when we were all joking around and I mentioned being hourly. Then everyone openly discussed their pay and I won't lie - I had a panic attack. 

I'm the youngest person on our team, but I also have the most direct work experience. I've also been an executive at 2 different start ups and built them out before they were sold off in mergers. 

I have a vast portfolio and 2 masters degrees directly related to my field. 

I guess I'm just not sure what my next step should be. I'm paid well on average, but not well for my area's cost of living. (Denver, Co)

1ef9adk,Feeling trapped and dont know what to do,"I studied accounting in school and I think near the end of my degree I realized I made a huge mistake. I decided to finish up anyway because I didn't know what else to do and I ended up with a pretty decent entry level job in a rotation program. At first this job was going pretty well, but then after I rotated it started going downhill. I just completely lost interest, got depressed and then eventually I nearly got fired. I figured this must have been because I didn't like the corporate environment so I switched to a non profit. With this switch I decided to take things more seriously and tried to really apply myself. I even enrolled in the CPA program.
Fast forward a year to now, I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I absolutely hate my job and trying to get myself to study CPA is a momentous task, I hate it so much. 

I feel so trapped and I feel like it's too late. I don't want to be like this anymore but I don't know what else to try or what else to do. Does anyone have any advice?

1ef8zyi,Embarrassed ,"I lost my keys to the school I work at, meaning the school has to be rekeyed and new keys made for everyone who works there.

 I’m a new employee - just started in June. I’ve made a few small mistakes as expected when starting, and one dumb bigger mistake where I just misread something, but it all got fixed and is fine. I’m generally very smart and detail oriented, but also value being a fun presence and friendly person in the office, which I’m never sure if my boss appreciates or hates as he is very corporate in the way he talks and acts at work. Super fair, I think he just has a great work life balance and is in “work mode” at work. 

I looked harder than I’ve ever looked for my lost keys - called every business I’d been in, posted on multiple neighborhood apps, put up signs, texted all of my friends, and retraced all of steps, tearing apart my car and apartment. I sent one of my bosses (the one who does more ops stuff) an email super late Thursday night admitting that I had lost them and how embarrassed I was. He responded nicely, but with no reassurance or acknowledgment of how hard I was taking the situation. (I know that’s not his job necessarily, but it is what I was hoping for!)

I told my other boss this morning and he said that he was sending me a written warning. He’s acting normally otherwise. 

I know I have an unhealthy desire for reassurance and to know that no one is mad at me and that’s separate from this problem, but the guilt and embarrassment is eating me alive. It’s taking everything in my body to stay professional and not ask my bosses if they’re mad at me. 

What can I do to make this situation better? What can I do to relieve my embarrassment? ",IcyChampionship2961,2,1.0,1,1722282726,2024-07-29 19:52:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ef8zyi/embarrassed/,7,2024
1ef8atm,Part-time jobs for someone with Masters in math?,"My husband is the primary breadwinner in our family. We've been moving around a lot, and I've been working on a Masters degree in math with the intention of eventually getting my teacher licensure once we settled down and knew what state I would be teaching in. I'm now almost done with the Masters, but I'm not sure if teaching is the best option for me.

The problem is that my husband works a pretty intensive job (academia) and I am realizing that I think I only want something part-time so that I can be more present for my son as he grows up. (He's 1 year old now.) I thought about tutoring, and I think I might do that while he's young, but my concern is that if the hours are all after-school hours then it would be terrible timing for a mom and I won't be able to be very present for him.

I'm wondering if there are any good career options for me at this point. I would definitely look into part-time teaching if that's a possibility; I'm just not optimistic about finding something. Apparently there are also very few jobs available at community colleges for math instructors in California. I'm also open to learning more practical skills, especially CS, which I find very interesting. Does anyone know of what kind of careers might be practical for me to look into?

BUT, I'm on the verge of being promoted and it's pretty guaranteed in September. With an expected salary of £60k-65k (depending if I take a company car)

Me and my partner, are really looking to move to London, and I've just been given an informal offer of £74,500 as a software developer (not senior)

We're also looking to buy in London. Slightly more outside and seen potential 3beds at about £425,000.

Just looking for more opinions from anyone that can help, or has had similar changes.

1ef67my,How do you all lessen career stress? ,"Hey everyone!

  
I (M27) have had a slightly chaotic career path in education; I have worked as a Special Education Teaching Assistant, Substitute Teacher, Co-Teacher, Behavior Interventionist, and recently as a Summer Camp Educator.

  
My biggest stress is that I've never had a full-time job with health insurance benefits and retirement. Even though I am in a new position as a Behavior Interventionist in school settings again full time (around 30 hours due to the nature of the position) but I will also try working as an Enrichment Class Teacher after school.

  
It seems like everything is beginning to fall into place in terms of what I want in the future, such as upward mobility and even discounted health insurance. But I find myself more and more stressed about what's going to happen. Has anyone gone through something like this, and if so how do you deal with it?

1ef66aw,I got fired.,"

I just got fired for sleeping at work, ok.yes i did few times but i didnt have any task that time!!! but the real issue was the toxic environment and shitty management. My manager played favorites based on looks, and as a brown, skinny girl, I didn’t stand a chance. One coworker even said I wasn’t ""pretty enough"" for the manager to keep me. I was the only girl in the office. Most of them r teen men who just saying slurs or talk about girls. 

I tried to set up a meeting with the CEO to discuss these issues ( ofc will talk about how unfair it was . No warning. And everyone on their phones watching tiktok or sleeping or whatever , no tasks given by the manager ), but HR shut me down. Now, I’m planning to pivot to web development, but I’m pissed and want to make sure the higher-ups know what’s really going on.
I will also be going to the other building where the ceo works in and tell the hr that she cant just shut me down because the ceo is too busy for his employees.


Any advice on how to handle HR and maybe get the CEO’s attention? Also, anyone else dealt with similar BS?

Thanks!

1ef5ww0,EdD or PhD: Which offers better employment outlook?,"Hi All,

I've been an adjunct professor of English and developmental reading at several community colleges for three years (I have an English M.A.), and while I finally have some semblance of financial stability thanks to years of networking and steady contract gigs for between semesters, I'm still poor, and I've been feeling the urge to go back to school. I miss the intellectual challenge of being in grad school, and I have several research questions I am interested in pursuing. I'm having a really hard time deciding between an EdD and a PhD because each seems to have significant pluses and minuses.

In the short run, I want to be in grad school to pursue my research interests and broaden my skillset, and it looks like either program would help me accomplish that, but what I really want in the long run is a path to a stable job. The higher ed administration positions interest me less than the curriculum developer and faculty positions, but they seem to pay more and be less competitive, so it would be nice to have them as an option in case it proves impossible to get a teaching position. In my perfect world, I'd teach English or education at a two-year or four-year college (I don't much care either way), but I'm intimidated by how competitive those positions seem. Nevertheless, I still would \*like\* to have the option to do that and not be pigeonholed exclusively into admin positions. So would I still theoretically be able to get a teaching or research position with an EdD? Similarly, would I still theoretically be able to get an admin position with a PhD if I wanted to? I really don't care about prestige or any of that; I wouldn't mind being at a 2-year college with a meh reputation and might even feel more excited at the potential to make a difference. My instincts tell me that a PhD would offer me more options, but I have also read that colleges don't like to hire PhD's for admin positions because they have a reputation for not knowing how to play politics or manage people--is that true?

**TLDR: My worst fear is going through a doctoral program, accumulating more debt, and STILL not having any path to long-term job stability. Which degree is most likely to lead to a stable job of any sort? At this point, I don't even much care what I do. I like teaching best, but I think I would like admin jobs (or even corporate jobs) enough. I just want a stable job that doesn't leave me completely penniless. I would also like to be able to stay in NY or in the neighboring states (most importantly, I don't want to live somewhere that has a lot of legislation that is misogynistic, anti-lgbt, racist, etc.).**",Automatic_Chip_5688,2,1.0,0,1722275327,2024-07-29 17:48:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ef5ww0/edd_or_phd_which_offers_better_employment_outlook/,7,2024

I guess to me that's not a big difference. That's above the middleclass average where I live for both.

If you like at the number of people who apply for a Software Engineering jobs its like 10x more people though. So, if 100 people apply for a Software Engineering job about 10 will apply to the Software Quality Engineering job.

I just don't really understand that. Since Software Quality jobs could have good career growth options. Like, you could develop into other careers that are a high level it seems.

On top of that I have been studying for this exam I am supposed to take so I have to go into the back office away from work and I recently had a 30 day review and apparently my performance is slow and I need to up my numbers so I try and get applications processed and approved but then I’m told that I need to step away and study for my exam. 
She hates being scolded but then doesn’t do her job correctly and makes it seem like it’s our fault so then we have to take the heat for it while she “has a meeting for better understanding”. I enjoy what I am doing and I don’t want to make it seem like a negative experience because I don’t want the universal karma to bite me in the ass but I honestly just can’t understand how my manager is in the position that she is in right now as it seems that she’s not fit for the role? Is this life and is this what I will be experiencing for the next 5 years of my life?

1ef2424,"Should I quit my job for a higher salary, better compensations and more vacation?","Hi,

I currently have two jobs: one job as a lecturer-researcher at the University, and one job as a healthcare practioner. The first job pays significantly better (4.900 euros per month) and has the potential to grow towards a salary of 7.000 euros per month. Moreover, it has better compensations (significantly more vacation, retirement benefit, etc.). The second job pays significantly worse (3.600 euros per month) and has zero potential in salary growth because the insurance companies are not willing to pay more money.

  
I love my work as a healthcare practioner, but I also enjoy my work as a lecturer-researcher. I am uncertain about quitting my job as a healthcare practioner because I'm afreaid I'm gonna miss the job and/or the variation.

1ef1q9v,Ultra-Luxury Hotel Chain CEO Shares Homophobic Views—What Should I Do?,"Hi everyone,

I have a dilemma and would really appreciate your advice.

I recently quit my job (I’m currently unemployed) and applied to another company; everything is going great in the process. It’s for an important position in the corporate office as Director of PR and Marketing.

The company is a chain of ultra-luxury hotels, with only 2 or 3 complexes in the world, and the nightly rates are between $7K and $20K (yes, it’s that luxurious).

So far, it’s my only job option. I started following the owner of the chain on Instagram out of curiosity, and although his profile is private, he accepted my request because we have many mutual friends. (I’ve worked for some of the wealthiest families in the country, which has opened many doors for me in their social circles). Although his profile is private, he has tens of thousands of followers.

I don’t want to drag this out, but while researching the marketing strategy for these complexes and preparing thoroughly for the interview to impress them, I discovered that the majority of the consumers of this chain are gay and women.

The problem is that the owner has been sharing homophobic propaganda in his stories regarding what was seen at the Olympic Games opening ceremony, with images like “not with my faith” and “those perversions they are trying to normalize.”

I quit my previous job because my boss, although he didn’t treat me badly, made homophobic and racist comments. He went so far as to ask that our advertisements not feature men or Black people because the company’s VP didn’t like it, he only wanted attractive women, even though the campaign was supposed to be about inclusion. 😭

I want to clarify that I am not yet employed by them and they have not given me any privileged information. All my research was done through my own means and resources.

Now, I don’t know if I should communicate this to the person who would be my superior and make it clear that this would obviously affect the company if it comes to light. This would also affect me since I would be in charge of PR and also handle the company’s Crisis Management. Basically, I’m seeing a problem even before I start. Another option is to withdraw from the process and express my disgust at the comments made by the CEO and founder, which go against my ideology. Or finally, just ignore it and continue as if nothing happened because I wouldn’t see him often. But I don’t know if you understand, it makes my blood boil knowing that the main consumers filling his pockets are us, the gays. 😭 What would you do in my place?

I’m mainly looking for advice.",Temporary-Sun-1297,0,0.15000000596046448,5,1722265264,2024-07-29 15:01:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ef1q9v/ultraluxury_hotel_chain_ceo_shares_homophobic/,7,2024
1ef1lny,Sahm transitioning to work place,"Hello,

I (34f) was a sahm for over 13 years. I married young and regretfully didn’t go back to school. 

1 year ago, I got a cashier job at a truckstop that’s actually a very nice place to work in my opinion. I fit in nicely there, and after a few months got moved to shift lead for night shift. Me and the other shift lead (started around the same time) made a lot of positive changes that improved the shift and productivity. I enjoyed turning things around and running the shift. 

I was just offered a position as store assistant manager at a brand new gas station opening up with a different company. 
It’s the same money hourly but I’ll get commission. It’s not a lot of commission and I’ll have A LOT more responsibility. I’ll basically act as general store manager when the manager is not there. 

The job listing advertised that this is an entry level management position that they will train me for but I’m still worried about being a little over my head? 

I’m hoping this position beefs up my resume more for the future. I know I have a lot of time to make up for. 
There’s some room for growth where I’m currently, but it won’t be as big of a jump in responsibility as this new offer. 
I’m just feeling anxious about leaving somewhere I’m comfortable that has a decently healthy work environment. 

Part of me feels like I will regret leaving my current job but I also feel like this will be a good step forward for my overall development. Do you think I made the right decision? 
I’m not sure what I want to do permanently, but obviously management makes the most sense at the moment. ",Sammimad32,1,1.0,0,1722264947,2024-07-29 14:55:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ef1lny/sahm_transitioning_to_work_place/,7,2024

1ef1i6b,Can I get fired for calling in sick for a day?,"Usually the answer would be no but given my circumstances I’m really worried they will.
I work as a cashier in a grocery store. This grocery store gets a lot of really entitled and rude boomers. I have a genuine RBF and no matter how much I smile or what I do or say I always get complaints about poor customer service despite doing the “hello, did you find every you were looking for today? Do you need bags? Have a nice day” script every cashier does. These complains are always brought up to me when it happens and it frustrates me because I and literally everyone else on the front end vouch that I do my job and I do it well.
The real concern is last week on Wednesday my store manager called me into his office and brought up a complaint that someone name dropped me and said I looked grumpy. So in return this manager threatened to fire me if it happened again. He then tried to send me home for going outside and crying after being threatened to lose my job and not being able to compose myself. I finished up my week at work and that Friday I noticed they cut my hours down to 2 days and the manager in charge of scheduling said it was in part because of hour cuts and in part because of the complaints.
Over the weekend I got really sick and I was scheduled today 9-3 but I’m still really sick so I called out doing our correct callout procedure 2hrs ahead. The manager didn’t say anything over the phone but I’m scared they are gonna think I’m trying to ditch work and try to use this as a further reason to fire me?

Each of us is responsible for an area of the business.

I do a good job, but I KNOW I could be doing more. 

I'm really good at it. My minimum effort is appreciated. People have no idea I'm at just 40% of my potential.

Thing is I'm not interested in doing more.

I don't care about this job -- at all.

Love the money -- biggest salary of my life. But... I don't have fun doing the job, don't resonate with the people there, and I'm already looking into doing something else in the near future.

But I feel guilty. 

Especially because the business isn't doing so well right now, by fault of mostly the sales people and the CEO. Yet, I know that if I gave 70-80% of my potential, we'd have a pretty good advantage that we currently don't have, which might make the sales people's lives easier.

Sometimes I consider quitting, because I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Receiving all this money and doing less than I know I can, than I know they need.

I feel like I'm a bad person for ""taking advantage"" of them in this way.

I am headed back to school in September and gave notice on July 10th that I won’t be continuing with the role, and my last day will be August 16th (a total of over 4 weeks notice). 

Since giving my notice my direct supervisor has been unbearable to work around. Passive aggressive, irritable, snappy (not just with me, but since I work so closely with her I take the brunt of it). Everyone else in the office has been lovely and “sad to see me go” but my patience is wearing very thin. I don’t really need this job/the money, and because I have much more extensive work experience in a different industry I won’t need to use them as a reference. 

I have decided that I’d prefer to leave as of August 9th instead, and give myself an extra week of downtime before headed back to school. However, my direct supervisor is on vacation from the 4th- 10th. I worry that if I tell her now that I’m moving my last day up she will be genuinely angry and rude towards me over the next week, which I’m simply unwilling to deal with and would just walk-out.

1eez5ux,What should I do for the next year while I wait for possible acceptance letter?,"TLDR: I’m applying to two different very competitive programs that will start next year. What should I do for the next year so that I don’t wast my time? 
A) retake a class to prepare for another application round in case I don’t get in
B) get another job that allows extra hours to help save money for school in case I do get in
C) maybe take a class on another subject that interest me like computer science or something else

Bear with me here. I know this might sound odd and all over the place. I’ve applied to the same lab program twice. I plan to apply again this application cycle. The last time I didn’t get in the program, the instructors said it was because my current classes did not count towards the application cycle. So I’m thinking I have a pretty good chance of getting in this time, but I don’t know because it’s super competitive. 

I found a grad school program that I’m really interested in so I’ve decided to apply to grad school in case I don’t get into the other program a third time, but all the grad school programs are very competitive too. One of the schools does not accept online classes which means if I want to apply to it (not this time) the next application cycle then I will have to retake classes. 

I currently work 46 hours a week, my part time job is slow so sometimes I will go home early if I don’t have anything. I am also studying for the GRE and shadowing places to build shadowing hours for applications. If I get into a program, it will start the next year so either way I have a year of waiting around. I need advice on what I should do for a year. I was thinking I could 
A) retake a class to prepare for another application round
B) get another job that allows extra hours to help save money for school (that I don’t even know if I will be in because I need to apply first and see if I get in)
C) maybe take a class on another subject that interest me like computer science or something else

Let me explain the computer science thing. I don’t like my job now and it doesn’t pay well which is why I want to go back to school and do something different. If I do a class in computer science it will give me a chance to explore that area and build classes for an associates. I realize that the field is oversaturated, but I was thinking if I wanted a BS by the time I graduate it won’t be as saturated. Or not even CS, maybe I can take a class in another area that I’m interested in that isn’t oversaturated. Basically I don’t want to sit around for a year and waste my time.

Now that we all know, even Europe has been started seeing huge immigrants and the Job Market especially Computer Field has been oversaturated.

I have completed my [B.Tech](http://b.tech/) in CSE, will receive my certificate in a month or two, and I had applied to German UNIs , as i was planning for it since last 3 years, but unfortunately as CANADA has closed the gates this year, now all Indians are running to Europe causing huge increase in applicants, and as a fresher with no work exp. it is difficult to get an admit.

As hilarious it sounds, NOW WE NEED WORK EXP. EVEN TO STUDY AHEAD.

What if I stop studying and instead invest my 2 years in my family business which currently is micro scaled? Is it logical enough to question myself, do I want to study further for 2 years and get a basic job and then climb which usually takes 3 to 4 years in total and with the competition might be even pushed to 5 6 years, or do I just get involved in my family business and I have a gut feeling I can do good in it with at least 5 years in hands.

I started growing eagerness for business probably since 5 years, but then as my Field (CSE) didn't match with the Bsuiness, i put the thought aside and started thinking along the orthodox route for masters after undergrad. I like to study as well in my field, but I just have more liking towards a business, but I am really scared to have invested my 5 years in a business and then idk what the market will be, if i then wish to study masters.

Gist - I liked business a bit more than CS, but as the immediate family business was not of the same field I was pursuing, I tried getting an admit for Masters in CS, but now seeing the situation in Germany as well, I am having second thoughts regarding Masters.

 I'm 21 years old, with a [B.TEch](http://b.tech/) in CSE, I dont think GPA is a necessity to answer my confusion but if still helps than I have 1,7 GPA (German Scale).",ROKIN_,1,1.0,0,1722255580,2024-07-29 12:19:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eey30a/how_is_the_business_market_in_india_especially/,7,2024

1eew76n,Manager and Maker schedule (tiktok video),"This video highlights what it’s like from a manager's/boss’ POV, showing that their schedule may usually last one or two hours (small chunks of works due to different meetings). For those employees doing the hands-on work, their tasks often require long, uninterrupted blocks of 4-5 hours, for example. So, if a meeting is scheduled during these blocks, it can really disrupt their focus. If you can share updates or announcements through email instead, that would be really helpful. Labsyu mwah 🥰

1eevmb0,I might have chosen the wrong career path and I regret it after 4 years.,"I got done with my last semester in university and have summers. My major is Bachelors in Electrical Engineering. I have a good CGPA enough to land me an internship in a private company and my concepts are clear. Now is when I realize that I dont like any jobs that are related to my feild. I dont want to design circuits and I dont care about optimizing tech. I got alot of appreciation for my project but I always disliked it and tried to supress that. It was an IOT project and I remember telling myself, ""How do people find connecting a screen and a camera to a microcontroller to create a monitor system so fascinating, its just putting a bunch of things together"". The reason I keep saying ""I dont care"" is because it is my dream to get a job which I actually love. I just dont understand what I like. 
I like something for a month and get good at it then the next month I am done with it, I dont enjoy it anymore. 
Through out my 4 years of university I have tried video editing, video game designing, 3d modelling, microcontroller coding and the same thing happened, I got better then grew tired of it in a few months.
My parents expect me to apply for a job but I am scared to persue a career which will get me stuck in a position or at a job that I dont like. Please help.
There has been however, one consistency throughout all these years, I really like coding, but I hate when I have to integrate that code to a piece of hardware and make it work. So I dont like coding microcontrollers for IOT projects.

1eevh2i,"Same workload, $35k difference","So I'm in a job where pays are based on a tiered system, where your salary increases by a set amount based on extra education and the extra workload you are expected to take on with said education and salary increase. So  essentially, there's no room for negotiating a salary increase. 

I'm in a strange workplace where coworkers are obtaining additional education and getting promoted up the tiered pay scale to the level of middle managment however, are not recontracted into a middle management role and are still doing the same exact role and workload as me, except they are getting $35k more. 

The reason this is so is because the actual people in middle management have not been enforcing exrta work, simply because these actual managers are just shit and lazy managers. As such, a  swathe of coworkers have taken advantage of this situation over the last few years. When this practice started, I initially didn't get extra education because I didn't want extra responsibility and now I especially don't want to get it because without a doubt there will be a massive financial audit down the track that will show that there are more middle management salaries being paid than there are actual middle management positions available and that's going to be problematic.

Recently, someone who is actually in middle management set out to give us some extra work. It's not a substational amount of work and easy enough to do, however, it's something extra that those being  paid more can actually do without those of us on lower pay needing to do and there will finally be something to differentiate our large pay differences. The manager however, is adament that everyone does it because this is the easiest and laziest solution for them.

People have already started doing it but i havent. The manager hasn't put their foot down yet, but is very close to enforcing it and I can tell that it's going to be a point of contention. I'm sick of people doing the same work as me but not actually doing anything extra to justify the extreme pay difference (no hate to my coworkers, power to them for taking advantage of the situtation, just furious at shit leadership from the powers that be). 

When it's eventially brought up that I'm not doing the extra work, I'm stuck between offering ways that I can still be involved (since it's very team based) but those getting paid more actually doing the extra work or just flat out refusing to do the work. I'm thinking of acutally offering both possibilites at the same time and see what happens? 

It just sucks that I'm a good worker and have always gotten along with everyone very well and have been for a long time, but my reputation might be severley damaged over refusing to do this work. I feel like i really need to stick up for myself but never been in a situation where i had to before and its quite intimidating. It's just hard to decide how to approach it because its both such a small but such a big issue at the exact same time. 

  
Anyone been through a similar situation or have any advice to offer?

**tl;dr** - being asked to do more work even though there are coworkers doing the exact same job as me but on $35k more

1eesnop,"Getting rehired 3 times at the same company, Good idea?","Hey guys I’m in a bit of a sticky situation. So I was previously working with this company for 3 years when I decided to leave for the first time and when I told them they accepted it but were sad to see me go and tried everything to make me stay. The reason for me leaving was the work was repetitive, toxic environment and I wanted to see what else is out there thinking the grass is greener on the other side. However, after 1 month they asked if I wanted to come back and I did as the new job I left for wasn’t very good. Then after about 8 months of me coming back I quit again, this time I just left my work uniform and a note saying I quit and I will be uncontactable. Pretty slack I know, I regret doing this but I just felt like I made the wrong decision coming back and couldn’t bare giving the 3 weeks notice as it would have been hell. 

It’s now been about 5 months and with working for new companies in the same field and trying different jobs, I just feel like the first company is where I’m supposed to be working at. It’s what I enjoy and can’t picture myself working anywhere else and getting the same pay. The workplace was just toxic and lots of gossiping/shit talking that I hated so much. I feel like I have grown and if I go back a third time I will be able to ignore all the bullshit and just get the job done, but that’s if they want me back and I haven’t burnt my bridges by leaving a second time. I know that one of the supervisors was telling me that he has left twice and gone back so that’s why I think of this as a possibility especially seeing my old role being advertised at the moment. I think they will hire me back because I’m a good worker and they know that I know how they want the job done.

I just want to know if you guys think it’s silly to go back a third time? Quitting again won’t be an option I know, at least for a very long time. I was just curious if anyone has left a company twice and gone back? If so how were you treated

1eer3sh,Filmmaker in L.A. ... I Need Some Advice ,"hello all! 

i'm a unemployed filmmaker in L.A. and haven't really worked outside of this context in a few years. I don't have many deep skills, like video editing, graphic design etc. I am pretty much a leader in guiding that creative but not really a hands on technical person. 

i'm going through a crisis at the moment and basically i feel like i need to start over with a new career/job and i'm scared labor is all i will be able to get, if that. i'm in my mid 30's and scared that my body wont even be able to handle that kind of work. 

My resume is a reflection of artist accolades and writing that most jobs would find useless. I don't have a degree in art, film and have almost no teaching experience. (i've only taught workshops for a week or so) 

i have ideas of what would be an ideal situation (remote, pays well) but i want to just be realistic and start getting some money to come in and maybe a strategy for a career that could allow me to make a good amount of money while also being able to sustain my creative practice from time to time. I'm open to relocating to NY, London, Paris. (don't hate me)

1eer1cc,Let me know your thoughts!:),"Hi,
I've been learning coding on my own. I am starting school in the fall to get a 2 year associate in comp. Science.
However, I don't reeallllyyy want to be a software engineer at some huge tech company. I just really really enjoy coding, that's what pushed me to go to school.

Right now, I want to get a part time job in a field/industry I've never been around. Just to open my eyes!
This could also contribute to finding opportunities to start my own businesses.

I also think it'd be cool to have a job and somehow make use of my programming skills. I shouldn't get a job with those intentions of course.

I was an electrician for a few summers. I was an assistant project manager at a contractor for the electrical utilities (power lines).

So, what seems like an industry I've never been around that I could take something away from besides just a paycheck? 
Would it be crazy if I walked into the John Deere store and asked for a job? I think tractors are badass and I know nothing about them!

Which country is best now?

Or should I continue to work in India?

I'm at 18LPA now. 
That's better than most. But still can do better.

Should I prepare for IELTS GRE GMAT or should I study coding more? Work on side projects and upskill?

I like corporate. I don't like finance and marketing around MBA. So MBA might be a mistake?

1eeqxwk,Idk what to do with my life any advice?,"

Hey I’ve never actually posted on Reddit so idk how to do this but here it goes…
I’m 18 years old graduated high school in 2023 and I just feel like I got pointed into no direction after I graduated. I was serving at this local bar but my anxiety got so bad I was throwing up before every shift, not eating, and just feeling super anxious before every shift. I ended up quitting the job because I thought the serving was the problem but it wasn’t. I got put on meds to reduce my anxiety but I feel like they don’t help me at all. I made a huge mistake these past couple months and gambled all my savings away that I made from the restaurant. My credit card is near max and my parents pay for my phone, car insurance, and don’t charge rent. I’ve been unemployed since the new year and I’ve been passively applying to jobs that I think I could deal with but I just can’t stand the thought of working the same job everyday for the rest of my life. I just feel stuck right now I don’t really have any real friends from high school that actually care and reach out so I feel like it’s just me. I’m closest with my mom and that’s about it. I have 2 sisters that I barely have a relationship with and I have never been able to see eye to eye with my father. I’m really passionate about gaming and music but I just don’t think I can make those passions into careers. Being in the restaurant made me dislike people more and more, I did want to pursue something like a bricklayer but I quickly shut that down when talking to regulars at the bar. I just don’t see myself fitting that position, I like being clean,inside,just doing my own thing yk. I feel like I just have nowhere to go, I feel like I just need some sort of push in the right direction. I can see myself being someone’s like assistant or like be taken under somebody’s wing to learn a new skill of some sort. Idk I’m kinda just tryna let yk where I’m at and any sorta of advice would be appreciated thanks!",snipalol,3,1.0,3,1722228127,2024-07-29 04:42:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eeqxwk/idk_what_to_do_with_my_life_any_advice/,7,2024
1eequq6,Train driving?,"After career advice please! QLD, Australia

I have been super lucky to been offered a freight/coal train driving traineeship and I’m scared to decide what to do.

I currently work in payroll for a local agricultural company, currently on $71,000. I have been super open with my manager about having been offered this position and she believes she can talk to the FC to increase my salary at least 10k, with an opportunity in the near future for a more “senior” payroll position which will also come with an increase. The company and my manager is super accommodating. We get free lunches/snacks/barista coffee, and heaps of holiday, WFH and hour flexibility. I get along great with my team and everyone within the business, etc.

Now I know I’ve hit the lottery being accepted in the train driving role, but I think it’s more of the “unknown” that terrifies me. Going from a super secure position, to one with a 24/7 roster. 
Base rates for the driving position is very similar to what I am currently on, but eventually once you move through the training, the base increases to 90k, then 100k once fully qualified. Penalties is where most of the $ will come in.

I’ve always felt most career wise and although I can do my job in payroll, I don’t see myself wanting to settle and doing it forever. So I’d love to accept the challenge of learning to drive trains! Plus the $ would be super helpful!
I’m also 28, with a mortgage, partner, getting close to that “stage” of my life where I’ll want to have children in the next few years, marriage, etc. My manager has also expressed she’d have me back in a heartbeat if it doesn’t workout!

1eeq480,Am I in a toxic environment?,"I recently moved to a new department at work. I was given the new position back in Feb. I was told by my new manager to sit in the finance side of the office which I did. I worked with the finance team to understand the tasks the team is responsible for and learning what the job entails. Then a week later I’m told I need to go back to accounting to do my old role but also my new role in finance. 

I sat back in my accounting desk from Feb to May. During this time I worked both the accounting and finance job. I felt overworked and I felt that nobody had a plan about my transition. 

I realized I wasn’t on any team when one day the accounting lead sent an email allowing the whole team to work from home. I was excluded from that email. The same day the finance lead let his team know that they could work from home. I was not informed. I literally was the only one in the office that day.

May I moved to back to my finance desk and was told that I need to do finance full time but accounting may need 30% of my time. I did as I was told. I asked my finance manager if I could have the correct system access since finance and accounting have different access. He had a meeting with the accounting lead and HR and they agreed amongst each other that I could change system access. No communication to me nor to the IT team to change my access.

 I spoke with HR myself to understand when my system access would change and when my title would change from accounting to finance. HR response was I just need to be patient with the process. Keep in mind that this process started in Feb and I approached HR in May. 

My title and system access finally changed mid June however they only adjusted my pay to the new finance role from mid-May despite that I was doing the job since Feb.

Since I’ve been sitting in Finance the team hardly speak to me. Don’t include me on lunch. My finance manager doesn’t even talk to me. The few times I went to him for help he has brushed me off. And when he does want me to do something he asks something else on the team to communicate the task to me. 

An example is the past few months I was working on planning the budget. I approached my manager and asked him if he could give me any insight on how the budget went last year. He brushed me off and told me to text the guy that used to work at the company about the budget. He didn’t seem to care. So I  met with the different teams involved in the budget process to get their feedback on last years process and how we can improve. I improved the calendar and the teams agreed to the new calendar. The calendar has been out for two weeks now and one of the teams complains and texted my manager. I found out from my old accounting manager that this team complained, so I went to my new manager to try contain the situation. My new manager reprimanded me and said that I cause too much drama and asked me to leave his office. Then my new manager called one of the other guys into his office to complain about me. The next day he called the whole team into his office and then reprimanded me in front of the team and told me that I didn’t involve him in the budget process and now he has to clean up my mess. The thing is I don’t even know what mess he is talking about because nobody will tell me. 

I don’t think this is the company for me. It feels like a toxic work environment. Wanted to get everyone’s thoughts?",Ill_Hyena_388,0,0.33000001311302185,2,1722225276,2024-07-29 03:54:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eeq480/am_i_in_a_toxic_environment/,7,2024

1eep3m0,Should I (16) stay in school or get a job,"Ok so from the title I know it seems like a no brainer that I should stay in school since I have the option to. But my dad recently gave me an ultimatum telling me I need to pick one soon.

So what happened is in late 2019, right before Covid started getting bad, I had a big complicated surgery that took me out of school for almost a year. The recovery process was so bad, I could barely remember my own name bc of the pain. And just as I was getting back up on my feet Covid hit and everyone was put online for school. I was good student prior to my surgery, but after being out of school so long at 11-13, I lost focus and found it hard to do my schoolwork especially from home. It didnt help that my parents are professional worriers about most things and kept me at home for way longer than other kids because of ""unseen symptoms"" or ""the after effects of having Covid."" So I was out of school for nearly 2 years, and only started going in person again at the beginning of 8th grade. My grades were awful. My parents were afraid of pushing me too hard and let me slack off on everything. Realistically I probably shouldve been held back from 8th grade but since my school was private I think they just wanted me off their hands and let me graduate. I took a High School Entrance Exam Prep class at that school but my teacher often forgot about it for some reason and taught me for only 30 minutes during recess. So I took the entrance exams extremely underprepared and didn't do well. And there was really only one high school option that my parents approved of, because again they're kinda worried about everything and have something against public schools.

So here I was w/o a school after graduating with bad grades. My parents then said I was gonna be home schooled. My step brother's kids are homeschooled so I was enrolled into that online school. I can't even lie, it was a good school. The material wasn't hard and I liked being able to spend time at home. Even though I had scarce friends, theyre I've known since I was a kid so I never really felt lonely. But as I spent more time at home, at some point I started to hate going out, and slept for more hours. At the beginning I did fine at that online school, but by the end of my freshman year they said I had failed all my classes. Still, they gave me one more chance to raise my GPA enough to let me stay. Again I failed. It's not that the work was hard, I was just lazy and only turned work in when I felt like it. I recognize that this is a problem, THE problem actually.

I got kicked out of that school despite my best efforts to raise my GPA towards the end of the year. Even though I pulled all nighters and such, my GPA now is like 2.3 as a sophomore. And still, I want to go to school. I never imagined a life where I don't go to college. School is all I know. I wanted to be a writer at one point and I suppose I still do but that's a hard career unless you're very talented or go viral.

My dad asked me recently what I want to do. He told me that even though college is all I know, college isn't everything. My mom never went to college but now she makes more money than most as a clothes designer. He said a college diploma doesn't ensure my future, experience with people does. That kinda changed my perspective I guess. I'm just tired of being a disappointment. My parents say theyre proud of me for overcoming so much with the cards dealt to me but really what have I done for the past years other than getting an A+ in wasting my time.

Even though he said that, he found me a new online school and sat me down to talk. He said that even though he found the school, he doesn't think I should go. Every academic year as of late, I've blown. Even when I had nothing but time, I failed to do my work. He said I should take this year off and get a job at a fast food place near us, to straighten myself out and bear a real responsibility for once. And after a year of that I can choose whether to go back to school or not. Becuase if I want to go to college I need a scholarship, my parents cant pay it completely out of pocket. So I'd need to lock in and work REALLY hard this year in order to get above average, and he doesn't think I can do it. I think I can, but I also thought that last year, and the year before that. I can't trust myself anymore. But after so many failures I really think and hope I can push myself to be better this year.

I also really don't wanna work at a fast food place bro😭!!!!!! It's extra embarassing because I always go there to eat since it's so close, the staff are def gonna recognize me idk why thats so mortifying. Anyway I know thats a childish worry but I'm just scared to step out into a world of people after being secluded on my own for so long. I live in the US if anyone has any job knowledge to share please do. Or studying knowledge. Also tell me what you think I should do. I don't know if I'll be good at a cashier job like that. AAAH I really want to stay in school but I know it'll be hard and I might slack off i can practically see it in my future. I wish I was smart easily and didn't take forever to learn things.

1eeovf1,Do I quit my internship?,"For context, I’m a rising sophomore doing my undergrad who’s still trying to settle on a major. I’ve somehow managed to score a paid internship (around $8/hr, as I’m in Korea) in an office (from 10 - 7)

It’s a startup company so I wasn’t given any training and have spent the past month and a half doing nothing. I was assigned one task to help with recruiting and that’s it. I’ve spoken with my recruitment manager and my “supervisor” and they either see no problems with it or have asked me what I can add to the company. I barely know what I want to do with my academic life and I do not have passion for what the company is trying to do. I took any internship opportunity I could due to parental pressure and the need for work experience. I struggle to connect with co-workers as I am not confident enough in Korean. The pay is measly as I am going to America to study for the next 3 years so transferring the money I earn right now to dollars- its a little disheartening. Additionally, it takes me an hour to commute back and forth each way.

While some people may be happy to be paid for doing nothing, I can’t help but feel guilty as the people around me work hard while I struggle to find something to occupy myself with. Furthermore, it feels like a waste of my own time as it seems I will not be able to visit my parents or friends for the next few years due to school and money.

But at the same time, I’ve only been here for a month and a half (originally I’m supposed to be here for the 2 and a half months of my summer break). I see no point in continuing my internship but it feels like a waste- some money is better than no money and a job is better than nothing. But I’m actually doing nothing every day and it just makes me feel useless, I’ve spoken with my higherups but they have nothing else for me to do and I see nothing I can contribute either.I just don’t know what to do.

I worked as a research technician in an academic lab and hated it. It was an extremely toxic work environment with a terrible boss. I feel extremely unmotivated to pursue anything in biology and have always been curious about engineering. Classes at my university for engineering were extremely difficult to get into and the whole program was gatekept. Nothing too crazy about that, but I haven't been exposed to the field becasue of it. I really enjoy learning how a system operates at a deep level which is originally what drew me to pursue medicine or a PhD for biology rather than a different option with a shorter journey. I'm not sure if I'd pursue bio engineering just because I hear that field isn't as transferrable as others and a lot of the time an engineer can do the same job without needing the bio engineering background. 

I have taken physics and math but it's nothing compared to the prerequisites needed for a masters in engineering. I'm just wondering how possible this idea is and what I should do in the meantime.

Help Finding my Next Career Step

I’m struggling to find a new job (complete career change) but I feel that I am qualified, idk what I’m doing wrong, or what I can do differently.  Here’s a rundown of me…

I’m 29 years old and have a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry.  I graduated Dec 2021 with my Biochem degree and I have extensive Biochemistry and Organic Chemistry research experience.  While attending undergrad, I worked as a part time teller at a bank.  When I graduated, I was offered a promotion at the bank and decided to stay there for the time being.  I have been promoted a total of 5 times over the past 3 years to my current position, Branch Manager & Licensed Investment Banker.  I am phenomenal in sales, management, and developing client relations.  But I have found my earnings potential in the bank is rather limited, and it will take me a while to be promoted again.  Also, the bank has started making some changes that I don’t agree with.

So, I decided about 4-6 months ago to start looking for other careers.  Looking to take advantage of my degree and research background as well as my management/sales experience from the bank to go into medical sales, pharmaceutical sales, chemical sales, industrial sales, equipment sales, etc…. I’m pretty open to about anything lol.  But I do not want to go into insurance sales, financial advisor, financial planner, or another banking job… but I have thought about Private Equity (I just don’t have an accounting degree or a CPA License that appear to be required).

My resume is very impressive and strong and I have been submitting applications like crazy.  But I’m not hearing back from potential employers, or if I do, it’s “although very impressive, we regret to inform you…”

Currently at the bank, my base is $65,000/yr, with the POSSIBILITY of another $10k-$15k of bonus (which is VERY hard to attain).

I want to get into a position with a base of at least $85k-$100k+ plus additional commission/bonuses.

Does anyone have any recommendations as to why I’m not hearing back, getting interviews, or ideas on what industry/position I should try to go into?

TLDR; have a BS and research experience in Biochemsitry and Organic Chemistry, currently work at a bank that I have been promoted several times within (now a branch manager), great at sales and management, looking for a career change that is high paying… can’t get interviews. Please help!

1eek2ut,Should I change careers after all?,"I'm a 30 year old.  Bachelors in social work, masters in educational leadership.  I've worked for 6 years in higher education admin, doing academic planning and counseling with students.  I started the job at $37K USD.  I'm now at $47K USD.  I recently asked for a raise (I feel I made a good case) and they're raising me to $51K USD.  I live in a medium-COL area and I'm really pretty comfortable at this salary, though more would be amazing.  Upper admin at the institution want me to go for an assistant director position that is opening, where I would do more admin work and supervise staff, with less student contact.  This also comes with a raise to $60K USD, which would be amazing.  I cannot stress how nice this job is - amazing benefits, a gym below my office, comfortable office - it's pretty great.

Up until about 1.5 years ago, I hated this job.  I was miserable.  I was not a very good employee.  Several ""life"" things going on, along with just hating the fucking job.  I decided I wanted to pursue accounting, the classes were interesting and I want a job that suits my personality better.  I am using my employee tuition benefit to earn my bachelors in accounting for free, plus a couple extra classes to qualify for CPA in my state.

I realized about 1.5 years ago that I actually really like my job, and where I work.  My least favorite people left, and all of a sudden, things were great.  I'm sorry I let people get to me, but now everything is different at work and I'm in such a good place.  

This all makes me wonder - should I just stay in higher ed?  I have put years of work in and got the masters degree.  I'm now on a really good career path.  My next step is AD/director.  I would then look for a job at a university that has a PhD/EdD and will pay for it with my benefits.  Then I'm looking at upper admin roles and potentially more teaching or research.  I have a very good resume for this field.

I really like accounting.  But my mom is really encouraging me to just stay in my current field since things have improved.  I'm not sure what to do, here.  

I still want to get my bachelors in accounting using my benefit, even being an accountant at a higher ed institution would make me happy.

Should I just stay in my current field and make it work?  I have a solid path for growth.

Or should I proceed with a change to accounting in my early thirties?",SkillfulMajority,2,1.0,3,1722207020,2024-07-28 22:50:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eek2ut/should_i_change_careers_after_all/,7,2024

1eehw61,Leaving my toxic job (2 months in) - advice ,"Hey guys,

I recently joined a startup company within the tech space that has a division within it that I joined back in May. The division has my manager and another two coworkers. Both coworkers are afraid of this manager (who reports into the CEO who is mainly working with the other divisions). The CEO is great and has a healthy relationship with everyone who reports into him (I.E the other divisions). 

Coming into this job I’ve learnt that my manager has real trust issues with the other coworkers, often complaining to me about the amount of sick days they use (once telling me the national average of sick days versus the amount they have both taken - it appears they are calling in sick due to anxiety). Anyway, im two months in and have seen quite a few red flags, keen to know everyone’s thoughts:

 1) he monitors emails and how many emails are sent to potential clients - I understand this as a ‘last resort’ if employers aren’t performing etc but unsure why this is appropriate as a standard procedure 

2) Shouts at / intimidates coworkers, often bringing coworkers down in front of other employees 

3) Will put holds in my diary for meetings (which is absolutely fine) but will then change and move them as he wishes in accordance with his schedule with no regard for my work schedule or time. I find this very disrespectful. (Note: there is never a slack message or heads up of any sort).

Keen to know thoughts on the above. Two weeks ago my manager was away on holiday and would consistently call and text me until I replied to his message, often it would be micromanaging small changes in tone on responding to clients that he’d like one of the other coworkers to change, asking me to manage the team in his absence . On the Friday he called me as he was disappointed at the lack of outreach happening, despite him being on holiday and team members being off sick. He begins to condescend and shout at me over the phone - despite the fact I’ve only been at the company for under two months.

HR is aware of his poor management and have received complaints from other members of staff including myself. I’m now handing in my notice tomorrow, as I feel like I’ve seen enough of how he likes to work and can’t see it being a good match. 

I’m worried that I’ll receive a negative reaction to handing my notice in and will suffer retaliation tactics from my boss. Keen to know what people think of the situation and how to best handle tomorrow / what to say or do to hand in my notice. My notice is 1 week long as I’m in probation but Ideally tomorrow will be my last day as there isn’t anything to hand over, is this likely to happen?

1eeh9rb,Need advice dealing with resentful coworker ,"I started working at a new job less than a year. When I arrived I was warned about one coworker in particular. I was told numerous times they would stab me in the back if they felt threatened by me. I kept it in mind but didn't take it as fact since I didn't know anyone yet. I prefer to form my own opinions of people. Still, I realized right away there was going to be a little bit if work drama if this was happening on week one. 

Within two months I had similar warnings about the same coworker several more times. They'd warn something along the lines of, ""watch your back with that one"". 

Several people told me stories about the hires before me getting fired due to this coworker spreading rumors behind their backs or bullying them directly. During this time, I also heard that this coworker would miss a lot of work. 

After a month, I noticed that the coworker did miss a lot of work. This didn't bother me because it wasn't my problem, it was up to our boss to handle employees. It didn't affect my job if Coworker was there or not at the time. 

At this point we got along well despite warnings from coworkers. Since I don't share my personal life at work, I wasn't too worried about being stabbed in the back by anyone. I go to work to work and that's it. 

By a couple of months into the job, my coworker had been out for almost a month due to being sick. During their absence, I was asked to learn and cover several of their tasks since I was hired to help where needed. 

After just a few tasks, my boss realized I was capable of more and continued to ask me to learn more tasks. It was the type of request that went like, please do what you can handle and whatever you can't is understandable. However, I like working hard and staying busy so I just continued to learn more of the job and do more tasks. 

As I learned more tasks, I came to learn something else about my coworker by reviewing their work. They made a lot of mistakes, did many of the procedures incorrectly, and filled some documents out by penciling it in after they were already past due to make it look like they had been done on time. I fixed a lot of errors while I was learning the new tasks. And I received many compliments from outsiders that noticed the improvement in procedure (being more organized, etc) 

When third month came around and my coworker returned, I was handling most of their tasks. They were not grateful (which I hadn't expected them to be). Instead they were threatened and started to take it out on me. 

Since there was some confusion, our boss had a meeting and explained I would be in charge of the tasks I had learned going forward. The coworker was very upset with this and felt betrayed. 

There was a lot of tension. As time has gone on, it's been three months and the situation hasn't improved much. This coworker pretends to like me at this point, which I don't mind because I prefer staying cordial at work. We aren't friends, we are coworkers. I can act professional without liking someone. 

But the problem is that this person tries to interfere with my job by talking directly to coworkers, other employees and customers and says things like, ""I'll handle that for you! Yes, I am happy to fix this. (New hire) is new and hasn't been doing it as long as me so they didn't know not to do it that way. But I will fix it right away!"" 

That is an example of something I've heard resentful coworker  say almost verbatim. It's important to note that in these situations, I have rarely ever made an actual mistake. They simply didn't know all the details. But the problem is that they shouldn't be talking to other people about my work. If I do something wrong they should come to me directly. 

Coworker also tries to eavesdrop while I'm helping people and interjects when they need help. For example:
Person: hey I am dealing with this problem. Can you help me?
Me: sure, what's going on (noticed coworker quietly stepping closer to my desk)
Person: my problem is my cat's won't stop doing backflips* 
Me: mm okay, let me help you with your--
Coworker: (interrupts excitedly) oh New Hire is new, I will tell explain later how to help you, but don't worry I will take care of you for now. 

*We don't help with cats doing backflips or any other mammals or acrobatics, but that was a fun example that keep my actual job more private. 

Obviously, this is annoying as it undermines me and makes me look incompetent. But this is also an issue since our boss explained that these tasks were no longer in coworkers care but were now in my care. 

While I try not to let any of this get to me, since it was what I expected anyway, it is starting to really wear me down. I never tried to take anyone's job. I simply worked hard and did as I was told. I was given more tasks Coworker used to take care of because of their attendance issues and general lack of organization. 

A few other points: 
At work, I refuse to talk bad about anyone. I do not like work gossip. 
I have told our boss about a couple issues when I worried they would affect my job security. Such as Coworker telling people I do things wrong. 

To show both sides of this, I did think of Coworker's perspective. They have been there much longer than I have. And the new hire is now doing many of the jobs Coworker has done for years without help. This has left Coworker feeling betrayed by the company, the boss, and by myself. (Coworker directly told me they feel this way)

Please offer suggestions on how to deal with this. It is causing me to feel stressed about going to work. I can add more details if needed, but this is a good summary of the dilemma.  I have to work closely with Coworker and can't do anything that would make work more tense than it is. But being passive hasn't helped yet. So I'm open to suggestions.

However, I’ve been reading stories about people who put in their two weeks and got fired a day after. I’ve been saving my money for living expenses while in grad school which is why I’m waiting until the end and don’t want to get dropped before that. 

FWIW, we had two senior level employees quit this year and they gave one week notice. My firm did not replace them so we’ve been even busier the last few months. My leaving will put them in a bigger crunch, which I imagine they won’t be happy about. I’m also using a day or two of PTO during the notice period.

1eef5zv,"Burnt out RN, go back to school for electrical engineering?","Long story short: my career was dictated by my mother who wanted me to stay in a career I would never have trouble getting a job in or she would not co-sign my loans if I didn’t. I was freshly 18, didn’t know any better and thought  I was screwed if I didn’t listen to her. Thought maybe helping people would be a good and fulfilling job. 6 years later I’m burnt out and hate bedside and resent her for it. I’ve been trying to find something nonbedside but it’s competitive. I’ve branched to different specialties and have concluded I hate healthcare in general.
My sister and brother are electrical engineers, make more than I do (with less experience than me) and have told me they genuinely love their job.
My sister (twin) and I are very alike and perhaps it is something I would like too. I don’t have anything else in mind other than I want out of nursing.
Just now I have two kids (2 and 5) with a supportive fiancé but I would definitely have to keep working (atleast part time) and finding childcare may be tough.
I’m 29, so I’m still relatively young in career age.
If I have a BSN, do I have to start all over? Like repeat classes I’ve already done? (Writing, general credits) I don’t have a crazy amount in students loans right now (22,000) but adding to it just hurts my soul too.
Is it stupid to go back? Idk if I could do it full time along side my personal life and working part time. 😔
Before I jump the gun I asked my sister to show me a little of what she does. And I’ve decided to give myself a few more months of searching for a nonbedside and if I can’t find something I’ll see if I can start in the spring with some general classes (Haven’t taken a math class in forever so) I just have no other career I want to pursue and I’m lost 😞 ",lavendercovenco,7,0.8899999856948853,12,1722193996,2024-07-28 19:13:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eef5zv/burnt_out_rn_go_back_to_school_for_electrical/,7,2024

1eebp2s,Advice for changing careers at 40+,"Seeking some thoughts/wisdom/advice on potentially changing career in my mid-40s. Self employed/freelance in my field for almost 10 yrs. Based in Canada (Greater Toronto Area). 

I’ve been working in a technical-based position in the arts for almost 18 years now, achieving admittedly only mediocre success in terms of income ($50K CAD/$36K USD). I feel like I may have gone too far down this path and put all my eggs in one basket/not diversified enough in my field, and without some kind of breakthrough I’m not sure that this is sustainable into the future. I’m getting to the point where I feel I may have to give myself a timeline to keep trying and then look to something else. This is particularly stressful as I’m approaching my mid-40s.

My short term plan is to use marketing strategies to promote myself, as well as actively seek out opportunities adjacent to my specialty (that tend to pay better), and see if I can grow my career potential over the period of a calendar year, let’s say. The part I’m unclear on is what to do should I determine it’s not sustainable and I need to move on. (As I’m typing this I’m thinking that seeking out career counciling might be a good step to take.)

All that said, I’m looking for any thoughts or advice as to which careers/jobs would have decent potential for someone my age looking to start anew. 

Some additional info: My education is private college training specifically in my field. Before this (20+ years ago) I was training as an electrician apprentice. Potentially of advantage to me is that I’m in great shape physically and look 10+ years younger than my actual age.

1eeanet,Ask for raise or accept other company's job offer that pays better?,"Ask for raise or accept other company's job offer that pays better?

Ask for raise or accept another offer from another company that pays better 

Long post ahead.

 I just need to get some advice. For context,I work in a call center. I work as Quality Analyst, I was assigned to work on compliance for over 3 months now without increase or extra pay. I technically report to assistant operations manager, but I have a supervisor I also report to. I am the only person working on Compliance for the whole team for the big company. For transparency, I had low performance when I was working on regular QA works, basically low audit count due to being the tenured in the company, I also act as SME at times and nothing else. I have been working with the client and managers for 7 years that is why I was chosen to be the one for the Compliance work. Now, I work and basically report to all the operations managers regarding Compliance where they always ask me to review calls that are raised by clients aside from the task I was initially asked to do and other ad hoc tasks. Now, my Quality supervisor and managers are asking me to work on some QA works again. 

So, I spoke to my supervisor quite recently and see if I can get a raise or additional compensation for all the work I do for the team, but he refused to escalate it to our Quality managers because he was still pertaining to my previous performance that he said I need to improve even though I had been exemplary with the task that, not to brag, I was praised by the Operations and assistant managers themselves in my performance in compliance tasks because I am speaking directly to clients. He also added that my salary is ceiling for the position and recommends me to apply as operations supervisor, which I was offered multiple times, but did not materialize due to we work on different sites/locations that it was not coordinated accordingly. 

So, going back to my concern, I still have hopes in asking for the raise because the assistant operations manager was actually my former supervisor/trainer back in the years. Btw, I currently work from home and my bosses work on site. They are not located in the same site. Should I give it a shot in asking the assistant operations manager, which was my former supervisor, for an increase/role change/additional compensation? Or apply to another company that pays better? I love my current job it is just that I feel like there is too much on my plate that I deserve a raise?",ParsleyConsistent871,0,0.5,0,1722182138,2024-07-28 15:55:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eeanet/ask_for_raise_or_accept_other_companys_job_offer/,7,2024

1ee9r68,Have some questions about looking for opportunities at other companies while already working for a company.,"I'll try to keep this short and to the point. I am a media producer at a large corporate company, where I work with various stakeholders to produce, write, shoot, edit, and create motion graphics for a variety of internal video content. I've been in this role for 5 years and have generally enjoyed it.

However, in the last couple of years, there have been recent leadership changes, and I am increasingly noticing some concerning behaviors and changes that have negatively affected my team. It makes me concerned about the future, fearing potential layoffs in the coming years and significant cuts to our team. We've experienced layoffs before, and I understand that good work performance doesn't guarantee immunity. Additionally, I am the highest-paid person on the team and worried that I might be seen as a cost-saving cut. I've seen some really talented individuals let go in recent years.

Considering this, I think it might be prudent to start exploring other opportunities and perhaps find a company that offers more stability. My role might be challenging to search for, as not every company has a dedicated media department, and those that do not always value these positions or compensate them well.

So, here are my questions:

* What are different ways I can search for opportunities at big companies for my role, besides the obvious online job posting sites?

1ee9hby,I think my boss might be insecure of me,"So I joined a company in March. And since then I have not been given any work. Mainly just making pointers and making presentations etc. Sometimes weeks go by and I dont do anything.
I am not involved in meetings even if internal team ones and left out of any conferences or events. 
My boss is an MBA heading a team and has 10+ years of experience. 
I have 3+ years of experience with a double Master’s. One from abroad. So I feel he feels insecure. 
I am on a temporary position so maybe he thinks I will leave so there is no need to teach me or waste time on me?

Is he insecure? Or not communicating? Or am I reading this wrong? ",haveno_idea,0,0.5,10,1722179056,2024-07-28 15:04:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ee9hby/i_think_my_boss_might_be_insecure_of_me/,7,2024

1ee91yy,I really don’t know what to do… ,"Hi everyone,
I’m studying Communication Sciences with a focus on Digital Marketing at an online university (Unimarconi Italy). In the meantime, I work in a food company as a plant operator and line leader to pay for my studies, but I’m unsure about what to do after finishing my bachelor’s degree. I’d like to study abroad once I complete my degree here. Do you have any advice? Which universities should I consider? Also, I’m not interested in roles like Social Media Manager or SEO Specialist; instead, I’d prefer something like a Web Analyst or leading a team as a Brand Manager. I’m really confused about which path to take and I’m already 25. I have zero practical experience in this field, only theoretical knowledge from my exams.

1ee8n5k,Career Crossroads in Finance: Work Experience or MSc for Better International Opportunities?,"Hello r/careeradvice,



I'm at a crossroads in my career path and could really use some insights from those experienced in the finance sector. I recently graduated with a B.A. in Economics from a well-regarded American university's international campus. My academic performance was strong (high GPA) and I've completed several finance-related internships.



My ultimate ambition is to work in wealth management or asset management. Although I'm a Mexican national, I aspire to work in the UK. Thanks to my university's ranking, I qualify for the HPI visa. I'm also open to opportunities in Europe or the US, although I recognize the challenges with visa sponsorships there.



Currently, I'm considering a scholarship-offered MSc in Economics at the same university, which would be financially feasible as it requires no out-of-pocket expenses. Concurrently, I'm exploring roles in corporate banking or credit risk with international banks in Mexico.



I'm torn between gaining practical experience in Mexico and pursuing further studies. While the work experience could be valuable, I worry it might limit my mobility internationally. On the other hand, completing my master's could enhance my qualifications and potentially open doors to reapply for graduate roles in the UK.



For those with experience in the financial sector, especially in international contexts, what would you advise? Is it better to gain more work experience now or pursue further education to aim for opportunities abroad?



Thank you in advance for your help!

1ee5o97,30-40K Salary - Fresh Graduate,"Hi! I’m a fresh graduate who was earning 30-40K right after graduation. Unfortunately, I resigned after a year due to these reasons: 

1. Career Path - my personal values and dreams doesn’t align with the industry I worked at. I know this is pretty common when starting out, but trust me, I tried my best to even last a year on that job.  

2. Shift & proximity - I worked 6x a week (sometimes entire week), night shift, 2-4 daily commute. OT all the time. I was sick every other week, and that’s not even an exaggeration

3. Mental Health - Although I’m aware that every company is toxic in their own ways, this one I worked for really took a toll on me. My relationships were compromised cause I didn’t have the time. 
Fast paced environment but always understaff, no system and professionalism, every employee’s exploited. I’d be the one to cover all tasks.

When I resigned, I took on a completely different industry but it didn’t work out. Now I’m just applying for all the job openings but I’m having a hard time to find a job that ticks the box. Even if I do find it, heck, most companies wouldn’t even view my application. The gap in my resume is continuously increasing.

1ee54uk,Prospects for a wide guy?,"Hi and thanks for your considerations

In a nutshell my resume looks like this:

A.A. Communication, local community college
B.F.A. Music from reputable music college

Comptia A+ certification (from a recent IT bootcamp)

4 years teaching private guitar lessons
6 years pizza delivery
15 years at a farm equipment store doing deliveries, customer service and stock (business sold and became a gas station)

In this day and age where it appears that specialization is king, is there hope for someone like me?

My story is one of grabbing opportunities (like going back to community college and finishing an associates in communication) and salvaging value (enrolled in an IT bootcamp because it was available and I had the time, which I learned was an uphill battle to pass the A+).

I have also had a ton of other part time jobs in the service and retail industry but that doesn't look so good).

I am patient and tolerant and I believe I have good writing and communication skills and folks just seem to open up to me easily and tell me their life story. I am also creative.

And finally  it's embarrassing to say this but I'm somewhat of a late bloomer having taken a much longer time to mature than your average person. But now the reality of my 40's is staring me straight in the face.

I liked the combination of part time jobs but they just barely paid the bills together.

What job prospects/positions might you recommend for a mutt like me?

1ee1wst,Fresh-ish Engineer Grad with Multiple Passions,"If I could be assured that in two years I could search for an engineering job and land it, I would not be looking for an engineering role right now. 

Don’t get me wrong, I truly love engineering. Being an “inventor” is my “what do you want to be when you grow up?” answer. I love the way it flexes my brain muscles and keeps me learning new things about the way stuff works, but I so badly want to do other jobs for a while that align with some of my other passions. 

I’m worried I will regret not taking this time in my life to do the oddball things that would also make me happy — like seasonal work in outdoor education or trip guiding — and am also worried I would regret not starting my career sooner because I haven’t been using the skills my degree taught me, which (it sounds like) would make it incredibly hard for me to find a job.

Did any of you struggle with this out of college? I graduated back in March and have already done 2 months of traveling through Europe and have worked summer camps for about 1.5 months. I’m waiting on a technical interview result and have been in contact with a recruiter who has submitted me for one position so far, but have also been encouraged to apply for an “Outdoor School Instructor” position by the program supervisor that is through my local museum of science and industry that would run through November (and would love to do more traveling after).

Have any of you saved your money for college before applying/attending? That is what I want so that I am not in debt and don’t need to take out any loans.

I have not always been the best student.

1ee0u9r,"Employment verification came back as ""Consider"". How worried should I be?","*tl;dr - I have major gaps during covid after a failed business and short-term work in and out of my field. I covered it on my resume with ""self-employed"" which, of course couldn't be verified during a background check for new job offer. It threw a bunch of red flags on the results and I am afraid they're not going to offer it to me after I already gave notice at present employer. My two questions are should I be worried and how should I handle this on my resume and in future interviews?* 

So, a little background. I live in a smaller town, <100k and am about an hour outside a major metro area. I really don't want to commute, but there just aren't many accounting jobs here. The ones that are here pay too low for what is required compared to Metro. To wit, the job offer I accepted has the same title, very similar responsibilities and pays 30% more. Most jobs are around 25%-40% higher just for the trouble of commuting (or living there, which is not a possibility right now). 

In 2020, my business failed, partially due to Covid, but mostly because my business partner went to prison and stuck me with some serious business debt. I was embarrassed and clinically depressed and ended up voluntarily hospitalized for a week. I'm glad I got help and have worked very hard to turn my life around. I got out of a bad relationship, started seeing a therapist regularly, and for a while, I was on meds, but have tapered them off after discussing with my doctor, of course. 

In 2021, I had two jobs that each lasted less than two months, both of which I had a f\*\*king meltdown and probably can't use as references. In 2022, I did better and had a 3-month assignment, but they did not elect to hire me, which was fine with me. However, the Controller there did vouch for me when I started my current job last November. The accounting department is a s\*\*tshow and I need out. It stresses me out too much and I am behind in my bills because pay remarkably low. 

I have only been there 9 months, so already starting at a disadvantage, but the pay thing is sympathetic and true, plus I have numerous coworkers offering to give me positive references. I found several jobs, secured 3 first interviews, two went to finals, and landed one offer which I accepted Monday. I also turned in my two weeks' notice that day. All of the background stuff was done online, which was kind of nice. The two recent jobs were easy to verify and my references came through right away. I submitted my info Tuesday and just checked the online portal to see where things were. The background check came back ""clear"" for the education portion but ""consider"" in bright red for the employment part. That's fair, I guess. I don't have very good documentation for either the business or the ""self-employment"" period, and if I listed the breaks all out, it would not get me in the door. I wish I hadn't turned in my notice, but I refuse to discuss extending it for a variety of reasons. 

I've been reconnecting with recruiters I have worked with previously and am sending out resumes. My hand sucks and, while it's my fault, I don't know how to address it. I guess I can just wait for that one employer that doesn't go back more than one or two previous employers. I have also done a ton of soul searching to figure out what I need to do differently so my resume will stop looking like Swiss cheese. 

Two questions: 

1) Should I do anything to try and salvage the current offer or let the dust settle? I added a note in the background portion that I do not have documentation to support the self-employment period and to let me know if they had questions, as I would be happy to answer them. Do I need to be more proactive than that? 

2) If they indeed retract the offer, how do I avoid this in the future? I don't want to list ""Basket Case"" as a job title. I just want to move on and work for a decent company that pays market wages.

1ee01zg,I auto applied to 500 jobs and landed 3 offers.,"I was pretty frustrated with the state of the job market when applying for jobs these last few months. I spent a ton of time reading job descriptions and applying to jobs, and didn’t hear back from most of them.

1. It took me 5-10 hours to apply to 100 jobs a week.
2. I constantly had to review the same job postings over and over again. They were either reposted or I didn’t realize I had already read it. 
3. Filtering on LinkedIn did not lead to a majority of the jobs being relevant

I ended up writing a script that analyzes 300k+ job listings directly from source companies and pushes me listings that are actually a good fit. I then set it to auto apply to the listings for me.

The business that has come my way does not meet this criterion as I can probably scale it to 500/600k per year (net business income before taxes) since it is limited by the nature of the business. 

With a bit of effort I can probably switch jobs and get a TC of $200k per year. The biggest pro of being an employee is that your time is yours after 5pm. Business does offer a bigger base which gets me closer to my financial goal but the business will cost me all my savings and will have to finance a bunch and be in debt for atleast 3 years.

Im currently in my low 30s, single and live in Toronto, Canada. 

I would love to get more direction in trying to understand which option is better and maybe point out things to consider for the business. 

Thank you.

1edy74n,"Should I abandon my ""prospective"" retail management career, all its benefits, vacation time, etc. to pursue something else?","I absolutely despise my job. I'm on the cusp of gaining a salaried management position at a big-box store that would probably make me around $70,000 a year, but it is not something I can envision doing for my whole life. The only things keeping me here are that I get three weeks of vacation right now, and in three more years I get four, and PTO time capping out at 120 hours that I get paid out for at the end of the year beyond everything I don't use past 80. 

But as I said, I hate it. No overtime allowed except from November through January. Obscene amounts of responsibility without the incentive to actually try or want to excel. I'm sickened by the customers and their vicious attitudes, the never ending amount of freight constantly rolling in. Corporate, district, and regional meddling in store operations thinking they know better than we do on how to run a store when all they do is sit in a cushy office all day making arbitrary, silly decisions that are not applicable to the real world, but expect us to implement them anyway. Refusal to hire any more help when we are far under the minimum roster for our store profile, so we have to pick up the slack and do the jobs of janitors, heavy-lifting, and everything in between.

My dream is to find some sort of work that will be considered ""skilled"" by the standards of European immigration. Retail management is not it. I have the money and the time off to go and visit once or twice a year to see my friends, but it's seemingly not enough for me. I miss my friends so much. I miss Norway. I aspire to be there and work there, but I feel stuck at this job. I can't just get up and quit because it's my only source of income. I have a bachelor's degree in history, and I've thought about getting my MA by studying abroad in Norway OR doing so here, but I don't know how I'm going to do this and still work full-time to have a place to live, be able to fuel my car, be able to feed myself, etc. I've thought about getting into what Norway would consider ""skilled work"" (IT, welding, carpentry, electrician, etc.) and studying to get licensed in those here, but I feel like I'm going to run into the same problem, unless there's something that exists in the world where you can get paid to study and become certified.

I tried my darndest to spin my years of frame shop management as ""skilled"" to UDI, and applied to jobs there, and nothing, so I've basically given up hope of that or retail providing a means to move there. My friend back there works for a tower crane operator, and said that I could do this here and take the skills with me as they hire immigrants all the time, but that the certifications in the USA wouldn't carry over.

Basically I'm just open to trying anything at this point that gets me from point A to B. I applied for a coding boot-camp to see if I can get my foot in the door with that, but once again I don't know if I would still be able to work full-time and support myself WHILE going to this program. It does not seem possible.

Are any of the careers I listed even feasible for somebody like me? I'm interviewing with a coding bootcamp on Thursday to kind of test the waters, and maybe even look at welding school or something of the like, but some people have said ""I wouldn't last there"" in the seemingly rough and tough environment.",ZetaMarlfox,1,1.0,2,1722137402,2024-07-28 03:30:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1edy74n/should_i_abandon_my_prospective_retail_management/,7,2024
1edxxh8,Should I leave this job off my resume?,"Hi everyone I was wondering if yall would have advice for me about my resume as I’ve thought about seeking employment again. I own a business, but this economy has made it such that I’ll probably also need a second job for awhile. 

My last corporate job was last year, and my manager offered me the job with a remote schedule. I accepted and exceeded my sales goals by an ENORMOUS margin. However, about 4 months in, he told me he wanted me in office full time and when I said I’d have to keep the schedule we originally agreed to, he let me go. 

I’m wondering should I include this job on my resume? It was such a short time but it did show really solid performance, and I did have a coworker who could be a reference. The downside is the boss who let me go is a control freak who was very angry when I told him I couldn’t do the changed schedule, so he maybe would trash me if ever contacted. I feel like it might turn up on a background check so I wonder if it’s best to disclose or leave it off.

1edxm39,Had a long interview process and was laid off during; I got the job offer contingent on a background check. How should I proceed?,"I applied for a job through an old coworker (who is also the hiring manager). During the interview process I was laid off and I told the hiring manager. He said to keep it between us. 

Well, after a long fourth month process, I got the offer. And they are using HireRight for a background check, which includes an Employer Background check. I haven’t received the link yet, but I believe there’s a section where it says “Check here if this is your current employer”. You can choose to not allow them to contact them, but must provide alternative documentation.

It’s been almost three months since I lost my job. My former coworker seems to think this isn’t a big deal (he is the hiring manager), but I’m freaking out a bit.  

I could say not to contact them. But by saying they are my “current employer” I’d be lying. And I’m assuming they’d ask for a recent paycheck. 

If I say they aren’t my current employer and that my position ended in May, there could be issues there as well. 

In hindsight I wish I was just up front with them even if it gave me less negotiation power. But I’m here now, so curious if anyone has any ideas?

1edwpkr,Concerned I may have been lied to by my company.,"Hi everyone! I’ve been working as a therapist for almost three years. In the beginning of my career I was doing everything solo. However, I’m from a small town so I wasn’t having a lot of luck with that. I was hoping that I could join a company who could, at the very least, take the marketing aspect off of my shoulders. I searched around and found a private practice that seemed to align with my personal views of therapy. I reached out to the business director and scored a virtual interview. I then had an interview with the CEO. Afterwards, they both wanted to meet me in person.

The interview went great and both seemed thrilled to have me join the team. The CEO said they only had one other telehealth therapist and wanted to take some weight off of her. I was told things would run like this: The director would do an initial intake with a potential client. She would then accept payment if all went well. After they paid, they’d then be forward to me where I can do my own intake, decide if we’re a match, then schedule our first session. If I exceeded a certain amount of sessions per month, I’d be given a bonus. I also was asked to help the CEO teach his virtual class, which I was fine with because I have teaching experience. I was told the business was moving locations in two weeks, so there may be a slight delay in my work, which I was fine with. The pay wasn’t exactly what I wanted, but having the stress of marketing and sales off of my back was worth it to me. 

I’ve been an independent contractor employee now for almost five months and none of those agreements have played out. The amount of work they made it seem like I’d be getting has not happened. I’ve had them try to drop clients on me at the last minute. I’ve had them book my sessions without checking with me on my availability. My boss (the CEO) wanted to start a new branch of the company and tried to ask me to invest. I was told one of the specific types of therapy I do my boss wanted to highlight and make me the lead of in the practice (which I’d get paid more for), and that never happened. At one point I’ve even been asked to do the director’s job and take a couple potential client calls myself over her. None of these things are what I was promised, nor agreed to do. Some of these are things I was told I wouldn’t have to do at all. 

I’m so confused what’s happening. I’m not sure if my boss is just a dreamer who doesn’t follow through on his ideas. If they tried to make the company seem bigger and more successful than it actually is. Or if I’m being conned in some way. All I know is I was promised a nice workload where I only had to focus on doing therapy. I’d have freedom to make my own schedule, and would be given opportunities for professional growth and more money. That has not been the case. What would you all do because I’m lost and truly frustrated.

1edunjc,Got fired a week before my wedding. Asking for advice.,"Hi all,

Yesterday, I got fired from my job at a law firm. I knew this was coming - they fired 2 other marketing team members in the months prior, and changed social media vendors three times within 6 months, each time citing their incompetence to do the task. In reality - they never provided feedback or direction, so we all were always lost. My ideas were always taken as a threat to CMO's (nonexistent) strategy. I was not allowed communication with other vendors. I got a passive aggressive email to stay in my lane when I asked to see the overall marketing strategy to make sure my social media strategy aligned with it. I got chewed out for typos in drafts. My ideas were always shut down, and when I backed it up with data - my emails were ignored. It was an extremely toxic environment, and I was already actively looking for a different job. The only thing that was good was the pay. I was getting 75k a year.

On Thursday, I shared with my manager that I'm struggling mentally to keep up with everything due to my wedding being next week, and I'd like to request two additional days off. I prepared the calendar and walked her through Sprout to make sure everything is set up for success. The next day, they called me and told me they're letting me go.

I am scrambling to pick up the pieces and apply for jobs, but I know how tough the market is right now. I would really appreciate some help in reviewing my resume and letting me know what I could improve.

My interests all fall under office jobs but I am the type to like working when I’m moving around more/my tasks are all different from one another (much like a nurse’s). Im not really interested in anything regarding healthcare or any form of sciences and Im only really considering nursing because I prefer the work dynamics of it more (moving around, different physical tasks, possibly going into work only 3-4 days a week, a little more fulfilling bc u get to know clients on a more personal level as oppose to just meeting with them a few times or possibly never again like in a desk job Im interested in, plus the pay is good, it is in demand and is stable, not to mention it only takes 2 years to finish as an LPN here.)

Yet I do know nursing jobs are mostly known to be more stressful and one of the types to easily burn you out due to the long hours and the many demands, I dont know if nursing is worth pursuing just bc of those facts I just mentioned or if I should just pursue an office job with concepts that I’m more interested in, a little more laid back, can be remote (which I’d love as well) and just suck up the boredom of an office job sitting behind a desk for 8 hrs everyday, possibly getiing sh-tty bosses and having to climb the corporate ladder in order to get a more decent pay (which usually takes a few years). Although I know that the state of your job depends on your work environment as well like your manager, co-workers and overall work-life balance, most iffice jobs are known to be repetitive & life sucking. I can imagine myself burning out if I were to go through that. Im not very passionate about the office job im interested in but I do like the concepts more than anything healthcare related. 

Both have their goods and bads and Im not sure which is worth it.

Those are the only career paths Im interested in going into unless any of you have any suggestions. Im looking for something lucrative that can also also possibly be creative in a way, work with people on a personal level, can use some analyzing, has differentiating tasks.

1edsgdk,Hi feeling so lost after graduation. Any advice would be very appreciated!,"I (23F) just graduated with a BS in biology and psychology minor. I am so conflicted as to what jobs to look for and my career trajectory. 

My most obvious choice/path of least resistance right now is studying for the mcat and getting any random patient facing job. I already have a job as a patient care tech lined up. I don't not want to do medicine/clinical research but I fear this would be a waste of my time right now and I'd get rusty on skills I might need in the future.

I did a machine learning thesis on some transcriptomic data in undergrad and really enjoyed it. I had to learn some basic R but have no formal CS training. I'm talking to my former PI and its possible I could get a paper out of the research which could help with the job search.

I am doing a free python course rn and have been brushing up on my calc so I can teach myself/take cc classes in multivariable then linear algebra. 

I think at this point I just want to be on a good enough path with enough growth. I like neuro/cognitive stuff, but I have no industry internships and only academia research. I have an interview with a govt internship in this space but I'm scared that I don't have enough formal math/engineering/CS education/experience to land it.
 
End goal I think is to get enough skills/experience to go into business if I want to, or stay researching if I want. I think I could learn the software/math/coding necessary for an analyst role quite easily, but obviously have no education in this and dont even know where to start.
I'm definitely playing catch up with a useless degree. I just need to know how to leverage it.

I guess, if you were in my shoes, would you do the PCT job to get clinical hours, apply to more internships in neuro/business where I could get mentorship/experience but they might be a long shot, or would you study for a year to get into a good Masters for Math/Stats/Engineering with possible business focus, which could all be applied to what I want to do?  If I did study I think I can easily get some tech role at a lab. I've definitely avoided committing to some offers that were out of scope of what I want to do (I have a ton of microbiology exp) but would be willing to work for a bit just to make money while I take more classes/study. Would it all be worth it?

1eds3qv,Asking for a raise few months after getting promoted?,"I (F29) have been with the company for 1 year and got promoted this spring, 8 months in. The promotion came with a raise of 7% which I was given no chance to negotiate. After tax it added an insignifiant amount to my netto. I'm very good at my job and basically do the work of my manager as well, who has absolute no knowledge of any of key issues for our clients. I am sick and tired of this and want to ask for a raise. I'm having my mid term review this week and I want to take the opportunity to do this. Do you think it is too early given the recent promotion and increase?

1edruc7,Should I stay or should I go?,"Hi yall, im 20f and right now I work at a major fast food restaurant and make $17/hour. I have a job offer for a sit down restaurant that is $6.50+1.5% tip share. My current job is my first job so I don’t have a ton of experience with restaurants. Would the pay be worth leaving? I don’t know how tips fair and the new restaurant isn’t even open yet. 

These jobs are not my end goal. I’m currently taking courses online to try and get into software development. 

Reason for wanting to leaving: 
I currently work nights and they aren’t willing to let me move up to mornings because they need night leadership. However that means that I work late into the night and can’t see my family much because when they work in off and when I work they are off. 

Current job:
35-70 hours a week at $17 but night

Job offer:
35-50 hours  at 6.50 + 1.5% tip share but 6:30am-3:30pm latest

1edrd8g,Work in tech in the finance industry or continue as an engineer?,"Away to start my 4th year of EEE (out of 5) in September, however I currently have a graduate offer to work as a ""Technology Graduate"" in a large asset management / financial services business.

The offer is around 10/15% higher than typical EEE grad jobs in my area, however I am not sure I want to go into this field + I would have to swap from 5 year Masters to 4 year bachelors to join them summer 2025.

The benefit I see from the job is the higher salary, plus additional year of earning potential however it would probably be in a more layoff prone industry (technology) when compared with actual engineering.

I received the offer as I have been interning at the company for the past 2 months, but I have seen a lot of layoffs and outsourcing to 3rd world countries, also for reference the masters degree is typical in the UK for those wanting to work as engineers, so would be less qualified if I wanted to become a Ceng

1edrag9,Professional development recommendations for an entry-level CRM Analyst?,"i’ve spent the last two years working as the manager of my company’s CRM, which is a lesser-known one specific to my company’s industry. while i’m knowledgable on most aspects of the CRM (building reports, pages, automations, calculations, etc.), i have no experience from the backend. this is because the CRM i use has its own internal support team that handles those issues themselves.

i would like to move forward in this field, but from the technical side rather than the operations side. i have NO formal training/certification in any coding language - just certification for the specific CRM i use. i know that as businesses move towards purpose-built CRMs vs. customizable ones, they tend to not expect their CRM applicants to have experience with their niche CRMs they use (at least that’s what i’ve seen in my area). however, it seems like they all look for similar experience with different business apps and coding languages.

with all of that said, does anyone have any recommendations of how i can build out my skillset to help me move forward in this field? are there any specific certifications that many CRM managers have?

1edqwu0,Worried about my girlfriend,"hello everyone, I’m a 17 year old male and i’m really worried about my girlfriend of 1 years. you see, she’s a year older than me and she’s just finished school, ready to go to university, and i’m really proud and supportive of her. 

the thing is, it’s not that i don’t trust her, and it’s not that i feel the need to dictate what she can and can’t do, it’s just that she’s going to an entirely different country on her own. i’m not worried about any long distance relationship issues right now, i’m just worried about her in general.

to be straightforward, she is 4’11, and she is pretty small and in all honesty she is really attractive. and i am really terrified for her sake, i am not worried about people trying to flirt or talk to her, i am worried about the sick people out there who have disgusting intentions - i am really scared of my girlfriend getting kidnapped, r4ped or even killed. 

i really don’t know what to do, and what really scares me the most is that i can’t do anything at all, i’ve expressed my concerns to her but i have also expressed how much i want her to follow her dreams as well as my pride and support, but i just can’t seem to shake this terrible scared feeling.

i don’t know what to do.

TL;DR - my girlfriend is going to university in a different country, since she is a small person (4’11) i am really worried about her safety in terms of deranged people trying to kidnap her or even SA her.",crevust,2,1.0,8,1722115099,2024-07-27 21:18:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1edqwu0/worried_about_my_girlfriend/,7,2024

I received a job offer and told my current employer about it, they pulled me into the office at the end of the day with my branch manager and he.

I say that they have better insurance and it is a better position but I would think about it. They said that they can't do anything about the insurance but they will do a market analysis and see what they can do and get back to me. The next day I have the final interview for the other job and get offered it,  but it is not as great as the recruiter has made out(nights, long hours).

This is where they look at each in other and say ""what raise? We didn't offer you a raise we just asked if you would stay for an additional $5"". So long story short, I quit. Really not looking forward to working nights 60+ hours a week.

1edphuq,what careers to get into with a pacemaker.,"at 21 I just had my second pacemaker surgery. For the last few years I've gone job to job, for the last year I've washed dishes and cooked with a fine cuisine restaurant group where I live. before this I used to wash semi-trucks with another company before this. I spent the last few years saving for my future working these labor intensive jobs. Now that I'm making more lucrative wages, I'm considering on furthering my education. However, with my pacemaker, I'm not sure which route/direction to take.

during my time on medical leave, I've learned that life is all about timing, what you do with it, how you hold yourself together through it, the opportunities, experiences missed saying ""no."" the knowledge gained in saying ""yes.""

I would absolutely LOVE to say that in high school I was one of those kids that were already making advances in pursuing their future however I feel I'm a little late to the game. I simply wasn't one of those kids then. I had a lot of fun and I would never any of those experiences back if I could, I graduated high school with a 3.7 GPA and 8 long years in the school's band as well as orchestra programs playing the Tuba(LOL) 

 Growing up, I wasn't very tech savvy. My dad works in tech, so I recently decided to invest in a laptop to become more familiar with technology. which was a huge score in helping my organizational skills, which were subpar before this investment.

Being an IT head, my father had told me to "" learn the web!"" which is a broad ass horizon. so, for days I spent reading about the interior of computers, how they work together, the jargon, reading about just about everything I could find. yet my father says that I'm looking at the wrong material, I tried asking for a better sense of direction, a link, or a path that would at least help me better navigate the right information. he said there was not really a way to learn besides reading. 

I've considered a lot of career paths in the last year however I'm always met with not being able to, due to my pacemaker.  I'm in good health, I stay in shape ( little proud but I'm the only person I know that has abs with a pacemaker lmao), I keep a strict diet. It's been a month and a half now since my surgery, and it hasn't handicapped me in anyway than I already am. I got the ambition baby. Like I had asked my father, hopefully you can provide me with a better sense of direction!

1edp50l,Does the amount of money you spend on clothes affect your career success?,"**Does the amount of money you spend on clothes affect your career success?**

A question usually answered with: *“No, you can dress the same as XYZ guy with XYZ dollars as long as you just dress for the occasion and make sure the clothes fits you well”* or the other more ignorant answer being: *“Have you seen how billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs dress, of course it doesn’t matter!!”*

Well, I’m thrilled to say that thanks to Neil Patel we actually know the answer to this question. In 2015 this guy decided that it would be a fantastic idea to drop the average net worth of a young American on designer clothes (lol)

He did this to finally figure out if the price of your clothes matters for business success or if the whole high end luxury clothes thing is really only good for showing off.

Neil would go on to spend exactly $162,301.42 on decked out *Tom Ford* suits, high end luxury fragrances, *Zegna* clothes for his everyday wear, *Gucci* shoes, and the list goes on…

Patel is known to be frugal and not particularly flashy in his personal life. He doesn't own a car, doesn't drive due to fear, and often works from the floor in his condo. This contrast between his personal frugality and his professional image highlights the strategic nature of this experiment

**These were his official findings:**

Patel off the bat noticed that when he dressed in expensive clothing, he received numerous compliments and appeared more successful in the eyes of others. This perception aligned with the idea that people are more likely to trust and do business with someone who looks successful.

**Increased Meeting Success Rate:** By dressing in high-end clothing, Patel increased his business meeting success rate from 25% to 40%. This means that his perceived success translated into a higher closing ratio for deals

**Social Proof and Influence:** Patel's experiment also highlighted the power of social proof and influence. When potential clients saw him dressed in high-end clothes, they were more likely to associate him with success, which in turn made them more comfortable and confident in doing business with him

**Consumer Psychology**: The experiment underscored the importance of consumer psychology. People tend to believe what they see, and when they perceive someone as successful, they are more likely to trust and engage in business with that person. This is especially true for high-value contracts where clients expect a certain level of professionalism and success from their business partners

Due to the increased business meeting success rate, the ""investment"" on the clothes more than paid itself off.

So to answer the question: “**Does the amount of money you spend on clothes affect your career success?”** the answer is HECK YES.

Curious to get this sub reddit's opinion on this, it seems like the US has been going towards a more informal look the past decade or two so not sure how this would apply

I am working in an indian mnc and it is a shithole.

I was trained in salesforce in 2020 then got placed in a support project which was L1.5 which I didn't know was support but manager convinced me that there will be coding also and naive me believed that...

This was the worst experience of my life. 

MicroManagement, disrespect, harassment, senior team member provoking my manager by continously pointing out my mistake, I did 7 months of continous night shift and didn't get paid, other team members scolding me for an hour in stand up meeting just because I didn't understand the problem. 

Developed serious eczema, ulcers, chest pain, indigestion, severe anxiety, depression, loss of sleep.

Didn't learn jack shit in salesforce just some admin part. 

Now they moved me to PIP and don't know what todo. 

The manager didn't even said a thanks for all the work or for anything just scolding or seem just dissatisfied all the time.

Not getting any interviews and if anything is set, they quickly figure it out that I don't have any working experience just basic knowledge which they don't want at my level.

Wise peoples of this community. Please guide me. I don't know what todo.

Please help.

They showed resistance but eventually they were fine. Everything went fine and finally came salary discussion. What they were offering I just asked very little increment on that. That too they were saying that they can give as variable and I was ok with it.

I am currently working in a Founder's Office role and I am looking to connect with people who have successfully navigated in this role as I plan my next step in the career. With this exercise, I would like to know about the skills that one should have or develop in order to make a meaningful career in this role or adjacent roles, if applicable. 

Having worked in a startup, I target to join an MNC in the next 12-18 months. I personally believe that this role is applicable mostly in the startups and my skills may be redundant in an MNC. Hence, the question. It would be really helpful if anyone can help me understand.

1edi0v9,resigning if remote work not given ,"hi, I need some solid advice/experiences 

I joined a startup fairly recent <1 year. very small team.

It was an in-office role. Over time I've realised that I want to do things of my own (I'm building my own business as-well). I'm literally spending 10+ hours including commute at this job. I feel stressed, depressed because of it makes me feel. I can't do anything else at this job other than pretend I am working. Which is another point, nothing there excites me at all. And I hardly work for 2 hours. Rest is all day pretending to work. Neither do I enjoy the work there, and I feel terrible sitting in a cubicle for 10 hours when I could be using that time to do something of my own.

I am thinking of asking the company for a remote role. None of them work remotely so I'd be the first person to work remotely. And if they dont allow me, I am going to resign. (my role can be performed 100% remotely).  
  
Getting a new remote job isn't an issue for me since I have references I can use.

Part I am concerned about:

It's a fairly new job I joined and in the interview I had mentioned that I would love to work from the office because I was desperate to get this job. But things have changed and in a negative way. I'm starting to suffocate to go to the office now.

It's a small company so I am kinda of close to the founder. I am having really tough time on how to ask for this and what reasons to give. And if I would burn bridges.

I might be overthinking but at this point its taking a toll on my health.

Has anyone ever faced an issue like this or had a similar experience.

Thanks",CaptainPBee,0,0.5,9,1722091549,2024-07-27 14:45:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1edi0v9/resigning_if_remote_work_not_given/,7,2024
1edhn1t,How to choose a career,"Hi

Okay - so I'm 23 years old and feel very lost in life. I live in Denmark where Education is free and am currently studying medicine. However, I feel like I don't fit in and that the enviroment doesn't suit my drive/ambition; also, I'm highly debating wheater I really want to work as a doctor. 

Henveforth, I've applied to (and been accepted at) business school thinking that might suit me better. But yeah, I don't know. 

I've done all sorts of career and personality tests. I'm kind of a lone wolf, enjoy the shadows but at the same time I'm very ambitious and spend the most of my time Reading and getting better. I'm very good a communicating, analyzing, organizing, reading rooms and people, gathering information - and ultimately I'm driven by the Big quiestions and problems - Why I Why I feel like I'm ""wasted"" at medical school, since I'm more driven toward larger scale problems than ""patient-problems"". 

I feel now that law or maybe political science would be a better Pick for me. 
However, I can't figure out if it's worth it for me to go ""all in"" on career. My Ultimate goal is to have kids someday and be the best husband and father, so maybe I wouldn't mind a more calm career ad perhaps a teacher or in the trades. I have a ton of interests and always find new things to learn, so maybe a good work life balance would be good. 

As you maybe can see, I really don't know where I'm going - or what I should do. I either continue medical school, go to business school, take a gap year trying to figure out what to do, or take a more profession/skill-based education like a Trade or studying to become a teacher.

1edg1e7,My client is trying to get me fired,"This could be a very long story however I'll try to make it short. I work as a mental health support worker and have worked with 1 client within the community for over a year. I am the last standing staff member within the package and we have had extremely high turnover of staff. This client has intense behaviours around SH and more. We work 12h a shift - no break. This client pushes staff away and see's the level of care they receive to be dependant on how unwell they are. The aim is to ensure they are safe from harm and try to redirect instead of feeding into 'unhealthy thinking'. 

Due to the high turnover of staff we are always using agency or staff from other packages which doesn't provide consistency for the client which you would think you would try to keep or have if possible, well - they have only gone and gotten me suspended - on the grounds 'I don't engage in activities or communication with them' - which is untrue. This client is very manipulative and when having their mind set on something, will do nothing to stop. My company didn't even tell me I was suspended - I had to message them the day before I was due on shift. That was over 1.5 weeks ago and I have yet to receive a letter or email to say why I have actually been suspended... and also can I even be fired on those grounds? I haven't actually gone against my job role and had a supervision less than a month ago to say everything was fine, amazing actually, and both client and family were extremely happy and grateful for my continued hard work.

I have had poor attendance around stress from work to personal matters - but have not had an official meeting to discuss this or be offered any support or intel into what is going on. 

My question is can they fire me? I don't want to work in other packages they have either as they are behaviours towards staff which I cannot manage.

This is the sample cover letter I use for various job applications (mostly academic/research assistant).

I have an year experience in the field and another total of 4 years experience in different fields (before my Bioinformatics degree). I am currently working, but looking for a change of jobs in the same field because of some right to work limitations in the UK. If you got some time, please go through my Cover letter once and give me advice on the major flaws you noticed. 

  
(On a side note, I know that the hiring managers usually prefer a shorter version, but my project guide said that for academic positions, I should write in detail about my education and experiences, hence this length.)

1eddnds,Just started a new job and already overwhelmed,"Background- Started working 3 months ago. I was a very hard working kid in college, pretty focused and came from a T2 college. For 5 years, I kept working hard, did not slack at all, but during placements, calssmates who didn't do anything for the entirety of the 5 year degree ended up getting higher paying jobs than me. Like literally, it felt like people woke up 1 day before placements and got better paying jobs

My job is great in the longer run, but doesn't have a decent pay. Somehow I feel very overwhelmed about the fact that I have constantly been working hard, but none of it seems to be paying off in a certain way. As in, it feels like everyone is now suddenly more successful than I am. I've only been working hard and focusing on how to get better.. but somehow it feels like I'm losing?

At this stage, I also don't know how to get better yk? Like, when you start a job, all you can do is be good at it, just like everyone else is, but how do you then do something that makes that bit of a difference for you to make you earn at least a little better?

I don't know what sort of answers I'm looking for, I just don't want to be this affected all the time. Because when I look at my classmates they all are doing better, and when I think of what did I do wrong to not be 'there', I don't really have an answer.

1edbra4,Help me find a career path,"**I (25F) just graduated from my master's and I don't know what kind of (somewhat lucrative) job to look for.**   
I have two degrees, a BA and an MA - both in languages and literature. I come from Jordan, but I've lived in Italy and France as part of my studies. In addition to my mother-tongue (Arabic), I speak English (C2), Italian (C2) and French (B2-C1, needs improving). I have scattered knowledge in a few things, thanks to my degree: translation, linguistics, literature. Yet unfortunately, my knowledge is only surface-level as my degrees were designed in a... questionable way that led to me being proficient in nothing but my 3 languages, and in my VERY niche thesis topic.   
My skills include: very surface-level knowledge of CAT tools, teaching (have done loads of tutoring over the years, all informal), literary translation (I was good at the courses), and that's it. I have no work experience, except for volunteering experience in cultural event organization (total of one and a half years). The jobs I am equipped to do right now (and frankly would like to do) are teaching, translating or working at a library, but these are low-paying and I have elderly parents who need expensive healthcare, and other relatively big financial responsibilities. An overview of my personality might help: I'm very cordial, nice, helpful etc. I'm outgoing and social, I can speak to anyone and everyone. I'm very adaptable, I can learn things quickly.

I guess I am asking for suggestions on what potential job market should I begin to insert myself into. I need a market where I can use my languages, my academic experience and my social skill to eventually have a salary that's not that of a teacher/librarian. If you have a good suggestion (job title, industry etc), please write it down in the comments for me.

Then as the company grew, they hired new grads (some of whom i helped hire) and they have overtaken me in terms of pay and position. They are offered better perks than me such as work from home, flexible hours and more holiday. 

On the upside, my job is relaxed and earn a liveable wage without doing a huge amount. Its very secure with no risk of losing my job that i know of.

I dont feel listened to or supported in my current role but get on very well with my colleagues and its a genuinely good environment to be in.

That being said, I'm almost 30 and not getting younger, so earning a wage thats a bit more than liveable would be great, id love my own place, a newer car, maybe even a holiday, none of which i can afford right now while my colleagues have had so many pay rises they are getting engaged, getting bigger houses etc, new cars, regular holidays...

Offered a new job, local, is for a competitor though and I have a 3 month non-compete clause in my current job to stop me from leaving. £8-12k more than my current role but im not sure im actually qualified for it!

I'm a fresh graduate from Senior Highschool and I'm really looking to get an online job (I've got a good PC, can speak English well, lots of free time and no urgent bills to pay) but I want to start being productive. I want to start working on starting my career (I don't really have any expensive goals, I really just want to get a job that will help me pay basic bills like electric or water bills and I don't plan to build a family either). I'm skipping college because I feel like its just not worth it, I want to work early.

As I've mentioned, I am a fresh graduate and I have zero experience on working but I did recently enter a short 2 week course about virtual assistance, it covered a broad amount of niches like data entry, customer service, CSR admin etc etc,

So far taking that course I feel more confident into studying customer service and maybe graphics design as a sub-service. I've taken an interest in data entry but seems like the market is very saturated and the pay is low based on what i've researched. As for graphics design, I've done some small projects on photoshop before and I am a growing artist too. The course also included an apprenticeship program to let me experience the basic tasks done by executive virtual assistants. While the course did give me resources and material to study on, I think I want to be more resourceful and study more outside of that, just to give more of an edge against others since I really have zero experience.

**Some other stuff** 

does anyone know any effective resources/videos that can help me study Customer Service because I really wanna arm myself with the necessary skills to get at least a low paying job just gather some experience, which I severely lack on. Either way. If this fails I'm thinking of just applying on an actual call center job to get trained and immediately gain solid experience.

As iam working in a govt owned bank in India, the career growth may not be steady and fast paced. Although I have 100% job security, promotion/career development may take time. They are obviously power dynamics and politics involved and favourites of the management will be rewarded better. Needless to say, iam not satisfied with the current scheme of things and wish to explore all possibilities.

I would like to ask you all:

1. Is there a scope for Forex banking internationally, if I were to migrate outside to UAE/EU.

2. Is it a solid career within one's own country, especially in private sector?

I really enjoy coding. I enjoy the puzzle aspect of it. The logic. The figuring out a way to employ a solution. Seeing and feeling the results of my code working as intended. 

I even enjoy when it *doesn’t* work, and the subsequent “digging in” to find out what’s “wrong”. 

But all the signs point to me just being one of many new people to this field. And that the market is saturated (especially for entry level etc)

Friends I have in the industry tell me it’s all about your skills. If you can show your work, that’s how you get hired etc… is that true?

Anyway, whether it is or isn’t, what I’m wondering is, are there *any* other jobs where I can utilize similar skills and activate similar parts of my brain etc… that are in markets that are *not* saturated?

1ed60w7,Feeling Stuck in a Dead-End Analyst Role,"Hey everyone,

I need some serious career advice. I've been an analyst at this massive company (we're talking 20k+ employees and $25 billion in revenue last year) for almost two years. I've been killing it, getting great performance reviews, and even took on a huge chunk of another person's workload when they left.

But here's the kicker: I've only gotten tiny raises the past two years (2% and 1.5%). I know it's a slap in the face.  I had a meeting with my manager today to tell them that I'm ready for the next level, and he said they've completely frozen promotions for the rest of the year. I was so upset because they told me that they would give me a promotion this year, but they halted it.

I have a master's degree, and I've found out I'm making less than people with similar roles at other companies (I'm talking about 20-30%). Some of my friends just graduated and already had 6 grant jobs with similar roles (0 experience). Even they paid new hires 10-15% more than my role.

The only silver lining is the work-life balance. I can usually wrap up my work in no time and work from home. But is that enough to stay in a job where I'm undervalued?

I'm at a crossroads. Do I stay for the chill work-life balance, or do I risk it all for better pay and career growth?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",rively90,2,1.0,5,1722048261,2024-07-27 02:44:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ed60w7/feeling_stuck_in_a_deadend_analyst_role/,7,2024

1ed4ong,Happiness or success? Can you choose both?,"I am about to end my undergraduate studies and I can’t choose a career path. But I’m not one of the students who has no idea, rather, I’m stuck at a fork in the path. 

I go to a “tier 1,” high-ranking university, the type where sometimes if I say “I go to [university name]” people are shocked or automatically assume I’m smart or hardworking. At school, I’m on the board for many clubs and I have a 4.0 GPA. I’ve had countless internships and jobs (even in FAANG companies) leading up to a full-fledged professional career that will most likely end up very well for me post-graduation until retirement. I really enjoy my corporate career, but I definitely enjoy my alternative career more.

Throughout my college years, I’ve also picked up another career path: ceramic arts. I invested in a home studio (a wheel and kiln) and I sell my products under the title of my small business. Obviously, it has always been a side-gig and a hobby because I’ve always prioritized school and internships. Thus, I’ve never gotten to see it at its full potential. At its peak, I was growing my Instagram by pumping out content, getting invited to markets, and selling out online within 5 minutes of releasing my products. The demand for my art is higher than what I can release. I also just love making art. If you want a better gist of my artistic career goals, I like to cite [@grumpykidstudio](https://youtu.be/XuFz14U4lX8?si=hdqOgXnlsGXKvKPg) and [@uncomfy.co](https://youtu.be/GCV5YQqSVgY?si=ETvWsjgPLsXoT86t) as my inspirations.

Sorry. I know it sounds like I’m bragging your ears off, but I promise I’m usually a modest person :(. I just wanted to make it clear how much I would giving up if I were to choose a career path.

I’d also like to note that I am a 2nd generation Asian American. Success has always been a touchy subject for me. My parents do not pressure me towards a career path but I definitely have internal/cultural pressures. Both my parents and I only wish for my happiness and success, no matter where. However, the dilemma lies in which career will bring me that, sustainably and easily.

As graduation is creeping closer and I’ve been given time to think anxiously about post-grad, I find myself daydreaming about “what could have been” or even “what will have been” with my small business. I’ve tried sustaining both as much as I could and burn out is hitting me like a truck. One moment I need to call into work or study for a midterm. The next, I’m getting countless requests asking me to restock soon. I love and hate both my careers for various reasons (salary, creativity, comfort, long-term health, etc.). 

What do I do? What do I want? Where do I go? Has anyone ever felt this way to this extent? I know I’m going to get a drastically different response in corporate vs. artistic reddit communities.

TLDR: I go to a great school and have a ton of internships under my belt to get me ready for an amazing career in my field. Simultaneously, I’ve been running a successful small business selling art. I can’t do both; I’ve tried and I got so burnt out. I love and hate both my careers for various reasons (salary, creativity, etc.). I need to choose a path because graduation is soon.

1ed4gof,How to get a new job in a different state,"Trying to move from Charlotte to NYC. It feels impossible to find a job in a different state and then move. I dont need relocation assistance so that’s not an issue, just can’t quit my job without a new one lined up. I could be in the new city within a week of the offer letter. 

Instead of putting Charlotte on my resume, should I put “Relocating to NYC” or not put a city at all? How do I not lose points for being out of the state for the interview process? I would even pay my own way for an interview if needed, but how do I even get the recruiter to take my resume seriously if my current job is in Charlotte?

1ed3rzu,Not finding direction to achieve something great ,"So I will begin with this that I am a (30M) UI UX Designer with experience of more than 10 years+ working with international clients as a freelancer. I have done BS Cs(H) and I started working at the age of 16 to start my professional career earlier. During all these I have worked with some of the prestigious clients and I have all in depth knowledge of modern technologies and user interface designs. 
So now coming to main point, as you know now my background, I have a family of 5 people to support and have been doing that since long time. Too much responsibilities caught me with severe depression and anxiety and I am on anti depressants from 4 years. Now I am under such circumstances that I want to move to some european country or Usa or Uk. 
But here is the twist I have not enough resources plus my country is worst in terms of reputation and economy. I don’t have any foreign friends plus I don’t know any way to get out of here. I am surrounded by all mentally sick religious people which makes me even more sad, I believe my purpose of life is much more than that. I am a super intellectual being with an over sensitive mind. 
I believe once I am in a developed country I can easily land the best opportunity to work in a big company like Apple and Google plus I want to do my own startup. But again I always sent my resume to those companies but none of them provides sponsor. 
I am not worried about myself that much because i am still earning well but I know that I cannot give my kids a good future here plus it doesn’t matter how hard I try to contribute to this society, there will be no one to ask once I am gone. 
So I am really looking for suggestions and honest opinions that what I should do? Keep living this ordinary life or I should dream to achieve something bigger ( seriously it hurts when you know that you have so much potential but no way to use it)

1ed3nlx,I left a company and now I want to return. How can I do this properly?,"I was employed by a major company's franchisee to work at their location as an assistant. Things were ok in the beginning, but on the first day, it became clear that it was not what I signed up for. I found out that I would be required to work the restaurant with their team members, along with the duties I was hired for. I had zero issues with that and enjoyed this part of the job, because my regular duties were monotonous and I usually completed my work within a couple of hours each day.  After a week or so, I also discovered that I had been enrolled in a corporate program. I was not aware that this was part of my employment agreement. Working in the restaurant and being a part of a corporate program was not made known to me. Nothing was mentioned in any of the three interviews, nor in any of the employment documents I signed. All of this was a surprise.  The staff and leadership were not very welcoming. I spoke to a couple of management concerning this and wondered if I had done something wrong. I was informed that I was well liked and my concerns were common complaints, especially amongst staff that quit (and many with no notice). I had also learned that the location I worked had an incredibly high turnover rate compared to other locations and other than the team being unfriendly, they were tired of the franchisee being disrespectful, rude, and occasionally making racist remarks. 

Ultimately, I decided to leave after a few months. I felt decieved and very mistreated. When asked why I was leaving, I told my manager that I had found a job that better suited my needs. I submitted a two week notice, but ended up leaving a week early because my direct manager became hostile after receiving my resignation letter. I had zero problems with working in the restaurant and being a part of the program. I just didn't like that I hadn't been made aware that this is what I'd be doing. 

I have been searching for jobs and found that another location for the same company has an opening in the corporate program. I liked the company and its values and would have loved to stay in the program. I just had a bad experience at this location. I was not able to transfer because at the time, this new location did not offer the program. I would like to apply, but I have a feeling that my previous employment will be discovered at some point if my application is selected and my resignation would come into play. 

Should I try again or keep searching? How would I explain this if selected to be interviewed?",LifeMathematician571,0,0.4000000059604645,3,1722040824,2024-07-27 00:40:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ed3nlx/i_left_a_company_and_now_i_want_to_return_how_can/,7,2024

1ed2rs1,Getting burned at a startup. Advice? ,"Hi all, I'm seeking advice at a crossroads in my journey at a startup.

A little backstory, I was a full-time solo entrepreneur for a few years. I joined a tech startup a couple years ago because I believed in the vision and product, and was under the impression there was room for growth and opportunity.

Fast-forward, I had to beg for a raise that still puts me under market rate for someone of my experience. I'm 2+ years in and there's still no benefits or HR. Part of the management team is incompetent. I only trust one manager who's building the product coming to market in Fall.

Shares of the startup have been vested to me on the anniversaries of my start date. But I'm not convinced that the product is going to take off like gangbusters and that we're going to be flooded with capital. I think it will continue to be a slow journey. I especially don't trust the leadership team to navigate new hires due to their inexperience and overall incompetency to date. They have a track record of poor decisions, and I don't think I'll be promoted anytime soon.

Also, I'm part-owner of a successful and profitable business, making nearly half my salary currently, with the potential for growth. Meanwhile, I'm not taken seriously by the managers of my day job, they cast me aside and have routinely ignored points of advice.

Am I stuck for the foreseeable future? To me (and to others) this isn't a real company. It's a group of people getting paid from an investor slush fund to build a product.

I feel lied to and now trapped in this company. I never would have joined if I knew that they would be 1980s-style managers. Oh yeah, that's another thing. There's no diversity in the top echelon.

If you've read this far, thank you. And if you care to weigh in on any of these questions, I appreciate you. Giving context of your own experience also helps me.

A.) The product launches this fall. I don't want to leave prematurely. Do I stay through another work anniversary and collect more vested shares?

B.) Do I have any leverage in this scenario? I have a strong reputation and I've been a big cheerleader. Only recently have I become disillusioned.

C.) It may sound crazy, but do I invest because of the product so I don't lose out on the potential? I have the means. Part of me thinks the management won't accept a check from me, based on their own ego. I've also heard the conventional wisdom that you invest in the company and culture. Again, that doesn't exist here.

Thanks again. I look forward to your insights.

Signed,

1ed2q80,How soon after starting a role is acceptable to request a salary increase?,"I’m certain this question will get asked a lot (I can’t be the only one?!).

I started a role 4 months ago in a great company, it’s a remote global saas company and I report directly to a member of the executive board.

1 month ago a colleague started and he is earning 20% more than I am.

Some points that are on my mind:
- despite starting after me, his contract was already signed when I attended my first interview meaning his salary was already known


- when I interviewed, the internal talent manager squeezed me on salary and tried to offer me less than what we finally agreed on (weird, bc that’s not been the culture I’ve experienced since working there)


- my colleague and I work at the same level, are equally qualified, except I lead a team of 10 (the whole department) and he works alone, sometimes drawing support from my team


- I’m not a man, and he is. Unsure if that’s related but who knows.


Also worth noting, he’s clearly a smooth talker because his actual ability is lacking in multiple areas, he’s rude, defensive, and patronising. So it could just be that he was bold enough to push and push for that extra salary as that seems to be his personality…

If his salary was known when I interviewed, why wasn’t the budget set closer to his rate as a benchmark? 20% is surely too big of a scale gap when we are on par with everything skills based.

I’d love to hear your thoughts and advice as I wonder whether to ask for a rise (and if so, how).",confessionsofamama,1,0.6700000166893005,13,1722038134,2024-07-26 23:55:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ed2q80/how_soon_after_starting_a_role_is_acceptable_to/,7,2024

1ed1yuv,How do you get a truly creative job?,"I have long known it was my dream to create video games, write stories, and in general make entertainment that inspires other people for a living.

I got laid off from my job and have been unemployed since April. It's been such a tough market, but I was lucky enough to still earn some money doing a side gig. I've been working for them for 2 years alongside my permanent jobs. 

Since I got laid off, I approached them about coming onboard full time, since the job market is so bad. They took a really long time and then came back with an offer that is 50k lower than what I previously earned. To be honest,  I was gutted. I can barely cover my bills with that. I countered and they offered like 5k more. 

A few weeks went by and I got more desperate,  so decided to suck it up and take the job. I signed the offer letter a few days ago.

In the meantime, I never stopped looking.  Which brings me to now. I'm on the verge of getting an offer from a F100 company, with a salary that's in line with what I had before. But here's the catch. It's a 6 month contract role with possible extension.

If I take the contract role,  I'll most certainly burn bridges with the first company. And the job with the first company is safe, secure, easy to do. But no room for advancement or increase in salary. 

The contract role is of course not as secure since it's a contract, but wayyyy more money and possible extensions and or could be made permanent down the road.

Please help me! Not sure what to do here. 

For context, I'm 46 years old female. Please excuse typos as I'm on mobile.

1ed05b6,Looking for Advice On My New Compensation Package ,"Hi guys,

I am a GM for a home service based business based in a HCOL city in BC Canada. 

This business was purchased by my bosses last year in August and I was brought in to run the business, I had no experience with this industry (neither do the owners) and needed to turn around the business as it had been neglected by the previous owners and GM. 

YTD we are up 73% in revenue growth. My initial comp package was 70k base, 3% RRSP matching, benefits, company car, and 7.5% commission on revenue growth. This business is a franchise business and requires the franchisees to grow 10% month over month compared to last year. So my bonus is based on 7.5% growth after the 10% growth is accounted for. 

In addition, our royalties fees are 15% of gross revenue per month. 

Profitability has been an issue - my key metrics were driving revenue, stabilizing the team and growing our technicians, growing the business, and driving sales. 

By these metrics, I have exceeded. Reviewing the P/L sheets with the owners though, Q1 of this year has been very profitable, >20% gross margin profit, while Q2 has been negative. Q4 2023 was also negative due to the amount of money needed to turn around the business and  the learning curve placed infront of me. I had no on-boarding or training at all and was drinking from a fire hose the entire first 6 months. 

I haven’t been shown our P/L sheets and have requested this information be more available to me so I can actually understand where we are losing money and where we make money. It has been frustrating but the owners had just wanted me to drive revenue and grow the business at a cost of being more profitable. 

Now that we’ve hit their milestone for revenue growth, my annual revenue and comp package has been proposed as follows:

- 80k base
- 3% RRSP match
- Company car 
- 2% Commission on Revenue growth (above the 10% as required by the franchise)
- 5% profit share on profits. 

The owners are hands off for the most part and that is their goal. 

My question to you all is: do you feel this package is worth taking? I’m on track right now to make around 94-96k at the moment with my current comp plan, and the projected compensation for the new plan was forecasted to be $104k next year, assuming we hit 20% gross margin profit each month. 

I know where the owners are coming from, but I can’t help but feel with the royalties we pay each month and the various issues we have paying for equipment repair/service (using the mandated equipment from the franchise org) that there will always be very little profit to be made. I would feel happier with 15-20% profit share if this is the case. 

Please ask any questions you have and I’ll try my best to answer.

If that's the case i'll be really annoyed, as i feel like i'm currently slightly underpaid and had intended to bring this up in a few months during budget season so it could be planned into next years numbers.

The issue is this person is below me hierarchly, but also in terms of skill, experience and value to the business.

1ecwjev,I’m torn and need help. ,"I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice. Here’s my situation (sorry this is long):

I have a bachelor’s degree in digital marketing with a focus on marketing and 9 years of experience in the social media field.

I’ve been laid off three times and my most recent role was as a senior social media manager with decent pay. I've been working remotely for the past 8 years.

Needless to say, I’m pretty burnt out on social media and have been saying for years that I should probably pivot out of it. But I don’t know what I would pivot to. 

Currently, I’m freelancing in digital marketing/social media, making about $2000 a month. I’ve been doing this for a year now.

I’m also working on side projects to generate passive income. I’m getting married in 3 months and I need to increase my income.

Today, I was offered a job as a Social Media Coordinator. The role is in-office/hybrid, requires a 40-minute commute, and comes with benefits. 

However, I’m significantly overqualified for it—something even the employer acknowledged. It’s an entry-level job that would be very easy for me, given my skillset and experience. It also comes with a $28k pay cut compared to my last role.

Given these details, I’m torn between:

- Accepting the Social Media Coordinator role for stability and benefits but taking a significant pay cut.
- Continuing with freelancing and trying to secure more contracts, while also focusing on side projects for passive income.

What would you do in my situation? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.

1ecwfi7,"Offered second round of interviews, but changed to “fill out extensive paperwork and then we’ll see about meeting other people”: acceptable?","I had a job interview with a company, for a management role.  I met the CEO and another person in the division where I'd be working (same seniority as him).  They repeatedly said that our discussion was ""great"" and they said that they wanted me to come back, at 1pm on August 1, to meet other people.

Two days later, the headhunter sent me some forms to fill out (taking hours of time: background checks, financial/investment information, outside activities, etc.).  The company sent those forms to the headhunter, saying that once I completed and submitted those forms, then we could look at a second round of interviews.

The headhunter said that these forms are a standard part of the interview process for potential senior management members and that they could help the company decide who else I should meet.

I'm really turned off, though.  They specifically gave me a date and time for the second round of interviews and even told me specific topics that they wanted to cover in the second round. But they yank that offer back and give me a pile of paper to fill out before I'd be considered for a second round?

1ecvbbl,Not another career guidance post ,"


Jk I lied lol

30 year old looking for some insight and guidance. 

Going back to school to get a degree. 

Stuck between two paths and would like some thoughts or guidance. 

I’ve been working in technical support for just about over 5 years. Never moved up or had the opportunity to do so. 

Currently work as a senior customer service rep doing tech support and payments. 

Worked about 10 years call center on and off. I love it and hate it at the same time. It’s draining but has some perks. 

I’ve been going to college on and off the last 10 years and never got a degree. Some life stuff happened along the way that prevented me from finishing. 

Thinking of going to school for computer information system with a certificate in health information systems. Tech field is so volatile but tech in medical seems more stable. I also don’t want to study for a ton of certifications, they are costly. 

I believe CIS gives a good avenue for a wide range of roles. Anyone have a CIS degree can attest that you don’t need certifications or is it a must?

Other pathway is Radiologic Technology. This was my original career path before getting more into Tech. 

End goal would be Radiation Therapy. 


TLDR;

Computer Information Systems

Or 

Radiologic Technology ",EssentialDuude,1,0.6600000262260437,2,1722018579,2024-07-26 18:29:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ecvbbl/not_another_career_guidance_post/,7,2024

1ecuqnk,Is it impossible to find a job 5 years after finishing PhD?,"I’m lost.

I finished a PhD in economics from a European university in 2019 and have been unemployed for 5 years. I live in a European country (with my parents as I have nowhere else to go) and look for jobs every week. Over all these years I have sent hundreds and hundreds of applications, mostly to the financial industry. Over the last year I have only been to 4 interviews. It feels as if it could as well have been 0 interviews.

Before I finished the PhD I did a master in engineering and then worked a few years in the financial industry. So I already had some work experience before doing the PhD. Back then I was pretty much called to every job I applied to.

I can’t say I have learned anything from the PhD that I could use in a job. I sometimes remove the PhD from my CV - with various results. The problem if I remove the PhD it seems that I have not been working for the last 10 years, which is not true. I had professional people go over my CV to improve it but I don’t feel it has made any difference.

I have broaden my job search a lot the last year and now I look for basically any kind of job remotely related to finance, analysis, programming, administration, etc. Still, it is impossible for me to even be called to an interview. Occasionally I have tried to get in contact with the hiring manager to find out why I got rejected. I’m usually told there were many applicants and they had a better candidate (duh). In general I would say the whole job search from the corporate side is very unprofessional as I have had some very bad experiences. Companies seem to not know what they are looking for and HR people seem to be a ”special” kind of people. One time I had to travel for a couple of hours (one-way) to have an interview for another couple of hours. It took me the whole day and in the end all I got was an email saying they will have to check whether there will be an open position when their new CEO starts.

I feel that my biggest mistake in life was to go to university, to do a master and to do a PhD. I have obtained a lot of knowledge (including practical knowledge), but it is of no use when knowledge has no value in today’s society.

What was supposed to be my opportunity in life has turned out to be a big burden that makes me feel worse and worse every day.

I can’t stop thinking about my situation as there seems to be no way out of it. I feel like I have no future anymore. Frankly, I’m not sure if it makes sense to even get a qualified job anymore as I have missed out so many years.

I’m lost and would really appreciate any advice on what to do to find a job with a reasonable salary that matches my background.",Imposibel,0,0.5,5,1722017118,2024-07-26 18:05:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ecuqnk/is_it_impossible_to_find_a_job_5_years_after/,7,2024

1ectrze,Help!! Deciding between two very different job offers ,"I have been applying/interviewing for full time engineering positions as I will be graduating with my MS degree soon. The positions I have applied for are “water resources engineering”. I have narrowed my interest down to two companies (both have extended offers via email or phone). The positions themselves seem very similar but the companies couldn’t be more different. Company A is a reputable “mom and pop” (but still relatively large) style company. There is one office location, the schedule is 8-5 in person no hybrid work. They have offered me slightly more than company B. They also pay hourly which is nice for working overtime while company B is salary. Company B is a national firm that has offices everywhere but not my current place of residence. After trying to convince me to relocate, they said they’d let me work fully remote while the company works on opening the office in my area. Company B is also employee owned. Both are private engineering firms. 

I’m very confused on what to prioritize with this decision. Both salaries offered are within my expectations. Both companies and the people I interviewed with are awesome. I love the idea of flexibility and a hybrid schedule but am worried that it isn’t ideal to start off (overwhelmed with being alone I guess?). I don’t like the rigid schedule of the other company but would make more. I also don’t know if company B being employee owned makes a huge difference. Opinions and advice would be much appreciated.

1ecs64a,I got tired of LinkedIn and created my own job recommender that can also auto apply to listings.,"My classmate and I are two CS undergrad students, and we’ve recently gotten pretty frustrated with the state of the job market. For our internships and going into full-time apps this year, we’ve been spending so much time applying to hundreds of job apps each cycle, to only hear back from a couple of companies for interviews. It’s been very difficult to land an offer. 

We ended up building our own program to auto apply to job applications as a project. It is pretty neat, it learns what your preferences are, and shows you hundreds of new relevant job listings each time (and they actually match your preferences/experience level). It can also automatically apply to all of the relevant listings for you (if you ask it to). We’ve found that it saves 90% of the time we usually spend job hunting.

1ecs41q,Construction Management Certifications,"Certifications for Construction 

Hello all,

I am looking for construction certifications that I can earn online to become more knowledgeable and qualified for a career in construction management. 

I’m finishing up a BS in business admin this year with a minor in construction management. 

Im currently doing a construction management internship and feel like I am in over my head and lacking in terms of expertise. I’ve always been a quick learner but a lot of what I’m experiencing right now is harder for me to catch on to due to the lack of knowledge I have with the different trades and methods. I know a lot of construction is learning through experience but I want to know if there are any courses online where I can earn a certification for each of the different trades. I think this will help me get to where I want to be faster. Any advice is appreciated.

1ecrnc1,Temp Relocation Incentives/Per Diem for Wife and I,"My wife and I work for the same company and have four young children. Our company has wanted me to manage national projects for awhile now, offering a significant relocation incentive of about $7k per month, promotion, raise, and then 13% travel raise on top of that. I joked with one of our VPs that if they could offer the same for both of us, we would consider it. Surprisingly, they did.

We would be on separate projects with different customers but for the same end user, a large tech company. The concern is that the end user might notice the same last name for the per diem charges and question or revoke them since we would be living together.

We are still negotiating terms, and if dual per diem is not approved, we aim to find other compensation options to make up the difference. I believe my company might be overthinking this and should move forward with the dual incentive.

I realize being a boomerang employee is quite common. I recently left my employer a couple weeks ago to join a new company. The only reason I left was due to financial difficulties on my end, otherwise everything else was great. They even tried to fast track promote me before I left but the salary just wasn't enough to support us.

About a week or so later I was informed by my old manager they got the salary bumped up and pretty close to what I'm making at the new company. My old manager encouraged me to reapply.

I was informed I will need to interview again but I can't imagine they will ask the same behavioral questions they did back when they knew nothing about me. Also the people interviewing me are people I worked with daily so they know my caliber of work.

He’ll make judgy comments to me, question my life choices outside of the job, get too involved with weird things involving me. Yeah he gives me the creeps. My dad who has been at the company for 15 plus years just shrugs it off because he’s used to it but I’m starting to have extremely conflicting weird vibes . He has lost his temper with me, and told me I’m slow and all sorts of things. My dad likes working with me so I would feel bad leaving my dad here in this dump by himself but I found a job at a grocery store for higher pay and people my age , and not so dark and cold of an environment. Nobody ever comes here. It’s just three people myself included. It always feels cramped. My uncle lives UPSTAIRS of the building so I can never get a day where I don’t feel uncomfortable to some extent. I told my dad that my uncles comments make me feel weird but my dad shrugged it off. The job I’m doing is extremely stressful, I’m the only one here who can do the assembly. It’s a small business so any wrong doing leads back to me. I feel such a pain in my back most days and the worst part is I still don’t have the guts to leave. I’m terrified of the boss I’m scared of letting my dad be alone I just hate the fact I ever started working here.

We have some grad students/post-baccs but they get to focus solely on their own projects. When I joined, I joined with the job description of being a wet lab researcher, which is what I love doing. For the first year, I got to do that. Then I became admin, animal tech, grad student trainer, etc. I haven’t had the time to focus on a project of my own in over a year.

Hi. I’m 34F, married with three kids. I have a degree in Civil Engineering in PH.

I’m eyeing to pursue accounting here in Canada rather than CE because the latter would take me
more years to go back into workforce, and I find it more difficult to balance family and career here in CA. The study options too for Accounting is more flexible.

I just want to get a decent 9-5 job with potential career growth and I am aware as an immigrant,
I need to invest here on education.

Are my thoughts correct or valid? 
If I’m gonna pursue Accounting,
is there like a shortened program
that I could take where my CE program could be credited? Any recommendations please?

I worked 45hr weeks full time in office, and now I will be doing 25hr weeks part time **full remote**.

I also have a side gig (also full remote) that takes about 3-4 hours a week that brings in 15k a year.

I've worked non-stop since I was 16 and am now wondering... should I just ride this out for a bit and enjoy the full remote work, should I look for another part-time job to add on, or should I look to quit the 25 hour part time and look for a full time? (I'm going to keep the 3-4 hours/week part time regardless as I love it and it's such easy money for the time invested).

They went through an excruciatingly detailed list of every mistake I’ve made over the past three and a half months. They even brought up a time I misspoke, using it to say I don’t understand the company’s project process.

Those meeting I basically sit there and have to defend myself 😭 It feels like I'm constantly under a microscope, and everything I do is wrong. I don’t feel encouraged or supported to meet these goals; it feels like they've already decided to let me go. I'm feeling hurt and demoralized, like nothing I do is ever going to be good enough.

As of now its set up as an internship and after graduation of my last year in uni, it would be a fulltime offer. It would go from hourly to salary and would equate to the intern hourly pay. So from $104k-$124,800. Plus possible bonuses. And expected annual raises.

The job would be for working in a global trade finance department for a big bank. 

It sounds like a good offer but I dont know exactly how much that salary can get me in NY.

I know for a fact I can comfotably afford a house here in Dallas with that salary, a nice 4 bed, 3.5 bath, 3,075 sq ft, which is exactly 1 mile away from a lake.

1ecnsov,Bachelor degree or nah?,"Hi all;

East coaster (Canada) here

I have a 2 year diploma from a community college in civil engineering, in my neck of the woods that makes me an engineering tech. I have 15 years experience, mid 30’s.
Earlier this year I earned my PMP certification.

When I earned my PMP, I almost immediately had movement in my career to a higher paying federal job (salary band is 90-100k, currently at $92k and will go up every year).

I am starting to eye a middle-senior management position at my current organization, and I think it will become available in the next 2-3 years and I also think I am the most promising internal candidate as it stands right now. The current person in that position is a professional engineer.

Should I focus on trying to get a bachelor’s degree of some sort to solidify my chances? Or should I focus on gaining other management experience? I currently serve as a committee member for a volunteer provincial commission and I could probably become a commissioner (aka board member) within 12 months if I put my name forward, which definitely helps in the experience department.

I had a mentor outside my organization recommend I try to get a bachelor of business administration- but I am unsure if the cost and time commitment is possible in my current circumstances, and I’m unsure if it would realistically increase my opportunity.

Are there fast-tracks that would give me credit for my community college courses and career experience, while still remaining ethical (no degree mills).

1eclbla,"At a crossroads early in my career, need advice on which path to take.","I’m torn between two options: a traditional/technical engineering path or a project/construction management path. Which path would you take?

I (32M) studied Electrical Engineering in University and for the past two years I have been in a temporary entry level training position as an engineer at a major metropolitan transit agency (train control to be specific).

My current department does not currently have any openings for a permanent engineer position, but my manager was able to pull some strings and was kind enough to offer me a promotion with a significant raise. The catch is it is only a temporary position and will be re-evaluated year-to-year.

He will be retiring soon and is likely my only advocate with significant influence in the department so my future here seems tenuous to say the least.

That being said I’ve been applying any and everywhere I can for engineering positions both within the agency and with private consulting firms as well. So far the only opportunity that has presented itself is an “engineering assistant” position within the agency at a different department. I recently interviewed for it and the panel indicated that the position is more of a project management type role for engineering/construction projects and not so much (if any) technical engineering will be done. On top of that, the PM role will be a step down in position from the promotion my manager has offered (the interview panel’s words not mine).

My heart wants to stay on the engineering path, but I am afraid of the uncertainty of not knowing whether I will have a job at year’s end. For context, I only have the two years of engineering experience, and while I am gaining decent experience as time goes on, I am still not too confident that I will land on my feet at the end of the year if my contract is not renewed.

On the other hand, the panel for the PM job did say that engineering could still be an option for me down the line. And while I am anticipating the PM pay to be significantly less than the temporary engineering position (I expect anywhere from $10k-$20k/yr less), it is a more secure position while I look for more options.

I guess the bigger question is whether I should take a riskier path or a more safe path. I’m not entirely sold on PM as a career path for me, but this PM role is engineering adjacent in that I will literally be working closely with engineers and I do see the value of having PM skills as an engineer. Also I am not exactly in a position to be turning any permanent job down at this point in my life.

Either path I choose I will still be looking for and applying to different engineering jobs.

If anyone has gone through a similar situation early on in their careers and chose either path and would like to share their experiences and thoughts I would be very grateful.

EDIT: I should mention that although the field I entered (train control) is very interesting to me, my current supervising engineer (whom I report to directly and from whom I receive my day to day tasks) is becoming increasingly difficult to work for. He seems unorganized, and when he gives me a task he does not clearly explain what it is he wants (the deliverable). Sometimes doesn’t even explain the purpose of the task (why are we doing this)? On top of that, on numerous occasions he has asked me to do things that are supposed to be done by union workers (more technician work than engineering work). So if I stick with my temporary promotion, I will still be working under him for at least another year.

1eckgrb,what would you do?,"
So, I've done my bachelors in Civil Eng from a top university of a third world country. And currently employed as a site engineer (less than 1 yoe). Long story short, i want to do masters aboad, for multiple reasons, one of them, is economy. Now, finding a job abroad with my level of experience, just after bachelors, is hard. So i've come to conclusion to do a masters. 

The thing is, there are so many programs. Now, in bachelors, i was almost equally interested in all the technical domains, although, the marketing and sales side (i volunteered for some events) also interested me. Moreover, haha, I had my final year project in AI, (basically automated pavement condition rating), so its not exactly my interest that will define my program, so I need your opinions, on what would be the ideal masters, and what would be the pathway after that?

1ecj0xr,my boss(es) have been obsessed with perfection ,"Hi everyone,

Seeking advice. I’ve had 2 bosses that were particularly hard on me, my first boss and my current one.

In my first job, I worked in finance, and I made an email typo on a deliverable to a stakeholder, which resulted in me getting a talking to and getting less work which I had to fight to get back because I thought the situation was taken out of proportion.

My second boss was great, they gave me so much autonomy and I did great work. Not without mistakes here and there but I wasn’t worried about every error I would make the same was I was initially or today.

Fast forward to today - I love my job but my boss is such an intense perfectionist. Any typo is called out, if I small miscalculation he days I’ll lose all my credibility and I found when that began to happen in my first job I started to get very anxious. Mind you, I started dealing with depression after the time I started this role. I made a mistake last winter that I know set our relationship back - but the thing is this mistake was not in front of others, they were just checking my work. It basically started with them saying “I should use my brain more” which I took offense to but I honestly tried my hardest to stay respectful and take it on the chin and correct my error before sending. That being said since then I have been experiencing what feels like anxiety/near panick attacks when I feel like I might make an error or sometimes randomly at work. It’s frustrating because I don’t know how or if I should talk to my boss or just figure things out in my own to get better. Last night forgot to omit a debunked insight from my note in an email to an svp. I’m up late worried and dreading tomorrow. The rest of the work of very thorough and phenomenal, mind you.

Are typos or small mistakes really that big of a deal? I see executives make typos on the daily…

Would appreciate some advice either way. Thanks ",Time_Substance_7829,1,1.0,3,1721982671,2024-07-26 08:31:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ecj0xr/my_bosses_have_been_obsessed_with_perfection/,7,2024

1echhj0,Feeling under appreciated ,"Has anybody experienced feeling under appreciated at your job? If so, how do you handle it? 

I’ve been at my job for a little over a year. I work 4 10-hour shifts a week. For the past month (a little longer actually) I’ve also been covering 2 8-hour shifts a week. I average about 56-58 hours a week, but I know it’s temporary. I’m exhausted and it’s stressful but I enjoy the benefits of the company. 

Recently, I haven’t received what feels like any sort of appreciation for helping cover while they find a new hire. I know it’s normal to not constantly get praised, but considering the fact I have been here every single day (I work overnight so I have literally been clocking in or out everyday for 38 days straight) you would think a “thank you” or “we appreciate you” would be said. I am regularly hearing about how great and helpful other employees are, but because I work overnight, many things I do get overlooked. 

For context, I work night audit at a hotel. This is when the most crazy stuff happens and I have to handle it alone for the most part because  it’s only me and a security guard. During the day, the front desk staff have a full on team and therefore all the help they need. This is why most of my efforts go unnoticed, and I knew this when I applied for the job. 

Its also very difficult to get time off due to the fact that most people will not work overnight, but every single one of my managers consistently get to travel and take weeks off at a time, meanwhile my last requested day off was January of this year. 

I am considering moving to a different department, where I won’t be working almost 60 hours a week, and where I’m not directly guest facing at the front desk, but still for the same company. 

Is it normal to feel almost jealous of the recognition my colleagues get? I don’t like feeling this way but I quite literally am starting to grow a hatred for my upper management.

1ech4xi,Should I change jobs?,"I 22(F) live in Michigan where dispensaries and saw mills are our biggest jobs, right now I work at a sawmill. I’ve worked here 3 years, have a great reputation here, I have a cute little position (nothing special but an extra $1 is an extra $1), I live about 30 minutes away,  I met my boyfriend here and we’ve been together the whole three years we’ve both worked here  (he started a month before I did but I had worked here previously for about 6 months, moved and then came back). I work 10 hour shifts but my boyfriend has a higher position so it’s more like 12 but no big deal, we work night shift which sucks but get an extra .70 for that so we both come out to around $21/hour (he is in a higher position but we get paid the same don’t ask me ik he should as for a raise he’s in the process lol). My issue with this job is we’ve had some serious safety concerns/accidents since we’ve had a remodel and put in new machinery which is half expected but still makes me anxious, a few “accidents” have left me with some sort of PTSD/very high anxiety in there, any slight yell and I think someone has lost a limb :/. Overall it is a good job, I enjoy my coworkers for the most part (there’s always one), we have a 401k and medical, they give us lunches if we work overtime which is almost every Friday coming to 50 hours a week, and I’m very good at it considering my stature (I am 5 ft and 100 lbs) I am trained in everything in there except my boyfriends job so I am in a different position everyday very rarely doing my actual cute lil job but i dont mind  (I stand there and press a button but my backup is a little old lady so they obviously would rather work the younger kid like a dog). I enjoy the work but my body is suffering. My dogs who I see for a mere 2 hours a day before we have to shower eat and go to bed (Australian shepherds btw 4yr F and 2 yr F) are suffering. I feel terrible everyday to the point where I hate this job. The time off is very limited and my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer last year so I was only able to be there so much for here with surgeries and chemo. Which she just got her last surgery and I wasn’t able to be there which I really hate because my mom and I are very close. Anywho, I got a job offer in town at a local dispensary literally 3-5 minutes from my house, $15/hr and 13 hour shifts but only 3 days a week. Do you think I should take the pay cut for happiness?? I’ve always been told to chase the money so it seems so stupid to me to take such a large cut in pay. I will be able to afford it as I save and spend quite a bit extra with my job right now, and I feel like with all my extra time I will be able to focus on a side business like I’ve always wanted and eventually become my own boss and not have to go in 3 days at all. This job will also include tips, my BIL (we’re not married but we call each other in-laws) works there and he says you come home with around $100 a day if not more, which would somewhat make up in pay.  Am I stupid?? My checks right now are around $1k-1,500 and my apartment my boyfriend and I split is only $450/month but I can’t help but feel dumb. I’m also worried bc my boyfriend will be staying so he will continue on nights (3:30-2am) and I will be working 7:45 am-9-10pm) and we’ve never worked different jobs, he is very supportive and understanding, told me he thinks I should do it as I haven’t been happy at this job in months but I kinda feel like being an adult isn’t always about being happy it’s about what needs to be done and I don’t like that I won’t be making as much as I am nervous when we do go places I might not be able to pitch in as much or something of the sort. I have anxiety and so my brain is just running wild on the possibilities, a big one too is what if I hate it and I just threw away 3 years and extra money at this job just to have it not work out. I will be putting in my two weeks so if I do have to come back I don’t think it will be an issue. Long story thank you if you stayed and for any advice given!! :) ",Elegant_Might_9899,1,1.0,0,1721975007,2024-07-26 06:23:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ech4xi/should_i_change_jobs/,7,2024
1ech06w,Got an email from HR for documents,"


So, I gave my final interview for a job in the early part of the month, later that week I received an email asking for my documents for the offer process. The word offer process was written in the email. I shared the same the next day. However, this week the HR I have been speaking to called for the docs, apparently I just shared it to the one email id the email came from and it didn’t reach him. Anyway, I took the opportunity to ask him if he could give me an update and he said that they’ll use all my documents and speak to the required people and then his senior will call me to negotiate the final offer. He first said by the end of the week which in the timeline meant last week, then when I called him of Friday he said Tuesday. When I did not receive a call on Tuesday I called him on Wednesday and he said he’ll call back is in a meeting but didn’t call back. 

My natural inclination is to stress in such a situation but the HR kind of has been inefficient from the beginning, so I’m just considering this his incompetence. At the same time I see that they’re no longer taking any applications for that job either so that’s giving me confidence as well. 

I am confused should I send a nice follow up email today on their last email as it has the other guy tagged in it as well or will that weaken my negotiating power considering I’m on my notice period which is about to end next week.

1ecf6h1,Advice on how to systematically hunt for a new better paying job,"
I graduated almost 25 years ago and have been working professionally ever since then. In the first 10-11 years of my career, I worked for 4 different employers as an individual contributor - basically I job-hopped but not very strategically. It was more reactively to avoid job losses. Hence, my salary went from $77k (starting) to $110k in the 4th job.

Then I got an opportunity to join a small company as a first level manager at $130k. Some people advised me against it saying it is not a great company, and I could do better. But I took it thinking I can gain some experience and jump elsewhere in 2-3 years at a higher level. 

I failed as a manager within 3 years. There were lot of politics and expectations. I could not navigate the politics and live up to upper management’s expectations. So, they effectively demoted me back to individual contributor by having no one report to me. At that stage, I should have left, but I did not due to some personal circumstances.

I am still at that company a decade later (in my 14th year there now). I have survived as an individual contributor, switched roles laterally, but never been promoted. My salary has slowly climbed to just over $200k, with 15% bonus. They don’t give me any RSUs or stock. I know that I am underpaid relative to where I could be given my experience. I have sort of left my career on auto-pilot, not having even interviewed since 2015.

My spouse and some friends think I can do better. They say I should look aggressively for a better job with stock benefits - so that I can earn $350k or more per year.

Part of my complacency comes from the fact that we have made steady financial progress - our household net worth has increased from $300k when I started this job to now about $4.5M ($2.7M portfolio and $1.8M home equity in VHCOL area). Hence, in the back of my mind is a feeling of why should I disrupt the status quo - just continuing for 8-10 more years is likely to see our NW grow to over $10M and then it’s time to retire. But another part of me says that is not a good approach - I should be proactive and take risks to grow at least now, better late than never.

What are some concrete steps I can take to get started on a strategic deliberate job hunt to significantly increase my compensation after being for so long with the same employer without promotions? Will that be seen as a negative by other companies, and how to overcome that? I want to proceed step by step in a measured way. I don’t think I am in any danger of imminent lay off, and I can see the present role continuing for at least 3 more years.

I was back at work near the end of April and have been working 2 days a week. I just looked at a recent pay stub and see that they reduced my pay to $18.50/hr. There was no notice to me about it and it was never apart of any conversation I’d had with my bosses.

Am I wrong in thinking this is illegal? Does it have anything to do with benefits that I had and now don’t? I plan on sending an email to my boss, but I want to word this properly. Maybe it was a mistake. But if it wasn’t and they argue with me that this will remain my pay, how do I respond? I’m a bit of an anxious ball of shit right now and would love some advice. I’m in Montana if that helps at all.

1eccwkd,Leaving a new job for the same one in the same company ,"I just started a new job this week after leaving my last job of 4 years. This job was really to get my foot in the door at this company, but not where I want to stay, and actually there are things I did not like going into it. Mainly the nature of this department.

This week I saw an opening for the same position but in a different department. This department doesn’t have those negatives which would make this the perfect situation. 

How would I navigate interviewing for a new position, the same position I have, after such a short time. Wouldn’t that look bad to the hiring manager? Should I be forward about what I dislike about the job I have, it’s reasonable for most people. Would it be best to just stay where I’m at?

1ecckto,Finding a career,"For the past while I've planned on being a construction electrician, but recently I found out that the construction trades aren't for me. I can do the work and I have a great boss, but being out in the full sun and doing sketchy work on ladders isn't great. 

I've been pretty bright in school and I would enjoy a job with a mix of desk work and (light-medium) physical work. Also, I've considered doing work in the armed forces, most likely in the navy or air force (idk what MOS though). I also don't want to go to college/university for 3+ years. In September I'm entering my last year of high school and I'm 17.

As for my personal interests, I like tinkering with stuff, doing creative work like reading and writing, talking with people, and military news/history.

My ideas right now are machining, automotive mechanical work, and some ideas for the military would be mechanical work, communications, and radar/sonar.

1ecc0g2,Do I tell my boss that my HR Manager told me that they will not pay me overtime to stay late?,"Hello, I just started a new job on Monday. Mt boss works remotely from home and the lady who is training me is in Spain (it's a Spanish company). As of Tuesday, my HR Manager has been harassing me every day at 5:00 pm, because I am still online with training, telling me that I need to leave, becausehe needs to set the alarm at the end of the day. My boss witnessed this harassment yesterday, so today he sent an email to HR, advising that ON OCCASION, I would have to stay past 5:00, therefore I needed authorization to set the alarm at the end of the day. The HR Manager immediately responded, telling my boss that he had to discuss this with him. My boss is in constant meetings, so the HR Manager couldn't get in touch with him. At around 4:30, he came to my desk, advising that he was unable to reach my boss to discuss the situation, and abruptly told me that the company will not pay me overtime, and if I needed to work late, I would need to change my shift and come in later so I could leave at 6:00. This is something that I DO NOT wish to do. I like my current shift, and I like to leave at 5:00. Do I tell my boss what was said to me, ver batim?

1ecbn4m,What to do,"We have had some turbulent layoffs within the past few days. Today, I was asked to train someone on my responsibilities immediately. So, I decided to call that individual via Teams and ask about my role and if it’s being dissolved. Without saying it directly, it was hinted that the answer is yes.

I hold a lot of company knowledge and access.

So, I’m trying to think about how to work this to my advantage, especially in today’s job market.

I’m contemplating going back and telling them, ""Hey, I am noticing trends that are leading to the dissolution of my role. Prior to training, I want a separation agreement and ask for compensation plus benefits and in return, fully comply with training someone in my role. Otherwise, I will quit immediately."" And leave them high and dry. 

Thoughts?

I have absolutely no experience in fruit and veg and they know that, yet expect me to get 5 sections done in the first hour (didn’t even tell me that’s what they wanted me to do either) 

I was taught how to cut and package these things for the first time ever yesterday morning and it took me about 3 hours, and today they expect me to get it done in 1? what? my manager is so incredibly unfriendly as well, just shakes his head at me and tells me he thought i’d be doing better by now (2ND SHIFT) 
 
he told me to think of him as a friend and colleague and that he wants me to work for him but the boss will be upset if he sees he’s paying someone to do a job so slowly when he could just have another worker do it faster.. then maybe don’t f#cking hire someone you know has no experience..? everyone left and there’s only 2 workers in the department now, when talking to one of them she told me they have so many people that leave after their second trial shift because he’s so rude.. i can see why, im so tempted to join them. 

the hours would be really good and id be able to save up a lot of money but its such a stressful and rude environment with no one i can even befriend or talk to during the day, and its 8.5 hour shifts. I’m going to ask about working in a different department and if that fails I’ll just stick to my current job because i am not up for this.. if they expect this much and are treating me like this on my 2nd day, what will they do once i’ve been there for 6 months?

My husband and I have no family nearby, and dislike the area we live currently. Our (informal, texted about) lease renewal is technically up in May, but our LL now wants to sell the house, and we’d be willing to compromise $. I now have multiple job offers to relocate to a major US metro ~4hrs away. 

This was obviously unplanned, and now that it’s potentially being realized - I’m wigging. We have enough saved currently for a down payment/first months rent, but that’s basically it. The rest would be ramen & (currently paid off) credit cards. Or, I can tuck-my-tail and wait it out until May; and literally save money in every other aspect. I’d be relocating from a LCOL area with a LCOL salary, to a HCOL area with a (better) salary. The salary to rent ratio/percentage is staying the same between both locations; we just live in bum-fuck currently. 

NOVA (northern VA) 
+ large company with room for growth 
+ 75k base + bonus (average 1st yr ~$5k) 
+ 3 weeks PTO start of year
+ 401k match 
+ healthcare offered, but I’m fairly sure it’s paid by myself. 
+ tuition reimbursement, other cushy benefits 
- locations of the company are not ideal (not walkable, need a car, most expensive rent, no trees).
- suburban sprawl of highways = hella potential commute
- STRICT. You drink the company koolaid or you gtfo. 

Downtown D.C.
+ smaller, less established company (but locations across the country) 
+ 75k base, no bonus. This was negotiated, and not their first offer. 
+ 2 weeks PTO, accrued. 
+ cover my healthcare, out of pocket for husband. 
+ in a central location, can use subway/metro. 
- no 401k
- both managers just quit, and it seems like a shit show. They’re desperate & it’s terrifying. 
- this location opened 3!! Months ago. But has “sister” locations nearby. 
- this is a more specialized role with more responsibilities than the others, but is the same as my current role. 

Maryland job final interview:  
+ already asked them to salary match or beat offers, which is well within their range. 
+ 2 weeks PTO 
+ better locations (more greenery, cheaper rent, somewhat better with public transpo than job A). 
+ better benefits overall (higher 401k match, $1-1.5k yearly clothing allowance, etc.)
- a medium-sized company, mentioned they were opening new locations simply to promote people (little promotional movement it seems). 
- Have 1 more interview at an unknown date in the near future, if I hold out on this maybe - I could lose out on the others.",simp4snacks,247,0.9399999976158142,66,1721952917,2024-07-26 00:15:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ecacav/impulsively_applied_to_jobs_in_a_rage_now_ive/,7,2024

1ec951m,Toxic work environment or is burn out making me overreact?,"Sorry for the rambling style, but I'm trying to get some objective opinions on this because I'm thoroughly burnt out. I have been in the same role for two years and have taken on a mentoring role for some new starts. 

One of our new starts (L) is basically fresh out of the box and needs a fair bit of guidance. L is in their first office job and has little self-confidence in their abilities. I've taken on working with L to bring them on the projects that I'm working on, trying to upskill them as best as I can. Our manager takes no interest in developing L or anyone on the team. 

I work with R, who is neurodivergent. R and I became friends pretty quickly after I started. From getting to know her and being more comfortable in my role, we started to vent around work, which to me is a normal part of work! These commutes mainly involved her complaining about how bad the job was, how much of a joke our employer was, issues with our colleagues, and repeated complaints about our manager. 

She had been working on a long-term, important piece of work with a newbie (H) in their first office role. H had a torrid time settling in (which was before I joined), being in tears a lot over our manager, refusing to come in, aiming to quit for lower-grade jobs at our employer to get out, and some other aspects that I won't mention. She assisted R on a long-term project alongside our manager, during which she would be in tears, not feeling supported, etc. R would frequently phone me up to deride her ability and efforts on this project. My manager would also deride her when she wasn't in the office about her poor efforts. 

At the time, having just joined after H, I was probably not the most supportive of her, which I regret so much now looking back and something that I've worked hard to rectify. Now we have a great relationship where I am as supportive as possible with her, have a laugh, and can healthily vent with her. It was probably insecurity, not really knowing what to do myself at that time, that maybe influenced this, which isn't an excuse, but I can't change it. I think I had validated R's complaining at the time by not speaking up, which I regret again. 

Anyway, R and I would commute together twice a week. For whatever reason, she stopped speaking to me and I found myself blocked on social media channels. This happened around the time L started. I can't figure out what had happened for these lines of communication to be severed, but I haven't aimed to reach out to understand because I was second-guessing what happened/what I'd done but thought this also might be some upheaval in her personal life or even some form of childish behavior? I honestly don't know. I had aimed to be more solution-focused than problem-driven with her, so maybe that? 

Her complaining has not ceased. Our team's chat is never-ending complaints about taskings, failings of other teams, ""I told you so"" when something goes wrong, articles of bad press for the company, you get the idea. I also still hear her in the office phoning other departments to complain about our manager and what they have her doing now. The criticism of work produced and our coworkers hasn't stopped. She randomly phoned me fairly recently to complain about L and how clueless they were and how bad they were, how she thought that L would be better but that she is shit. I nipped this in the bud and offered solutions like assisting L in upskilling her and recommending training to our boss for L. I find that recurring behavior of belittling these new starts to their coworkers disgusting. 

To segue again, my work friend in my team had said that our manager has been mentioning outside of work that given mine and L's friendship and good relationship at work where we joke and have a laugh and I try and keep her at least positive even though she hates the job and our boss, there is something happening between us. I've never had this with a manager? I don't know how to deal with this if it's outside of work? 

The other issue with the manager is that their communication is awful. They singled me out in a Teams work chat as if I had been slacking on a piece of work that was tasked when it hadn't been. When I had replied to say I hadn't been aware of this or conversations around it, I was met with ""you were told a while ago."" I couldn't find any correspondence or tasking anywhere in emails or PM trackers. The mood of the day can be dictated by what mood they arrive in. 

Don't get me wrong, they have given me concessions around leave and flexibility in my working day, which I've appreciated. However, I don't like their demeanor and tone with my coworkers. In meetings, they have dragged on my coworkers' abilities, singling out failures, and things they didn't like about their characters when they've not been there to defend themselves. It's caused a huge morale issue, which is no surprise! They again derided L's abilities and character in a meeting with another senior member of staff and a coworker of mine and L's. 

So, my manager's boss pulled me for a chat a few months ago to chat about our team, and I raised my concerns and grievances about our boss. My manager and I chatted later that day after their boss had spoken to them, and they tried to frame our conversation around me being stressed due to an upcoming house move, which was not true. They smirked and laughed when I was going through what I was unhappy about in terms of being singled out for perceived slacking. 

The relevance of the R stuff is that I mentioned in that chat with my manager how distracting and how much this is impacting my own well-being with the consistently negative attitude. He put this solely down to a personality clash. I was going to mention the badmouthing of our newer starts being unacceptable but seemed pointless at the time. 

I try hard to fight for people at my level and can be combative (although I strive to keep it as professional as possible) with management but feel it's necessary to fight some people's corner when the manager is assigning blame unfairly, R is criticizing them so harshly and we've had extremely negative situations in the past. 

I want to gather some purely non-partisan opinions, what do I do now? The most sensible thing is to find a new job, which I am trying to do, but it is slim pickings currently in my field. Do I move line management? How do I deal with my manager generally now? I've lost all trust in them to do the right thing. Do I start a formal grievance process? 

If I'm at fault I'm happy to hear it too, I may be blinded here!




TLDR via ChatGPT lol: I've been in my role for two years, mentoring new hires. I'm burnt out due to a toxic work environment. My colleague R constantly complains about the job and criticizes others. I regret not standing up against her negativity earlier. R has stopped communicating with me, and our manager spreads false rumors about me and another colleague, L. The manager's poor communication and negative behavior have severely affected team morale. Despite some flexibility granted, the manager's behavior remains problematic. I've lost trust in the manager and am unsure if I should move line management, or start a formal grievance process, or something else.",Illustrious_Lead_385,1,1.0,0,1721949623,2024-07-25 23:20:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ec951m/toxic_work_environment_or_is_burn_out_making_me/,7,2024

1ec7v7s,Advice on how to prepare for promotion,"Hello all,

I spoke with my manager a couple of weeks ago and they mentioned how, since I expressed my interest to progress into a more senior role and take more responsibilities would be opening a new senior position, and, would like me to start acting like the senior the coming months so the team is prepared and my promotion does not come as a surprise.

The issue is, there is a person on the team that although we started at the same time together, they are much less professional, their communication skills are really bad, so our working relationship is not really good. The team consists of two other members who are way more junior.

Problem is, this non-junior member makes it extremely hard for me to step up. When I advise our junior members on how to do certain things, they always try to argue with what I am saying even though most of the time it is correct. It's just extremely hard to act like a senior and take leadership with this person on the team.

On the other hand, I really want this promotion as it's a step towards future career progression and advancing to Lead / Line manager in the future.

I want your advice here ; how to deal with this team member and also start ""preparing""the other team members so that when the changes are announced the next months it is not as a surprise to anyone?

Appreciate the advice!

TDLR: Manager asked me to start being the lead in more things so that the team is prepared for my future step up to senior, but one colleague is making that extremely hard.

Were 8 candidates competing against each other for Account Manager positions.

It's going to be 3 hours, with the 1st hour consisting of a company presentation, followed by what is called ""Account Manager/Sales Experience"" I can't tell if that's the candidates speaking about their experience or whether that's going to be led by the company attendees, which in this section are going to be the HR Director, the Senior Account Manager, and the Upper Account Manager.

The next hour is titled ""Group Exercise"", I was told were going to be given a sales case study to work through, and that some might work as part of a group and others might work individually. I have no idea what to expect here and/or how to prepare, your insights would be invaluable. The company attendees in this section are going to be the HR Director, the After Market Services Manager, and the Head of Logistics.

The final hour is going to be a personal interview with Head of Segment Facade and Area Sales Manager - CPM.

With all the above in mind, what can I expect throughout, and how do I prepare myself for each section to give myself the best chance at standing out? I have 0 construction experience, my sales experience is rudimentary, and Ive just few days to prepare, hence this post.

1ec674b,My health condition has affected my career…,"So I had a spinal surgery for cauda equina syndrome (a serious rare condition) when I was 18. I had the surgery again at the beginning of this year. I’m now 23 and I have some nerve damage in my right foot and leg. I am lucky I am still able to walk pain free and have bowel/bladder function. I have a degree in optometry and was training to be an optometrist. The nature of my job and high stress made my condition worse. I had to leave two jobs because of this. My back was fine after my first operation until I graduated and started working. That’s what led me to my second operation. I felt the staff at both jobs did not take my health seriously which has put me off as well. I made a difficult decision to no longer work in this profession as I don’t want further damage. I was gutted because this profession pays well and I worked so hard for it. However, when looking for jobs it is difficult for me. I get uncomfortable standing for too long and sitting for too long is bad for the back as well. My work coach advised work from home is best for me although these are competitive. I’ve had a few customer service interviews and one at an opticians but for a different role (admin). They ask me for my reasoning of why I don’t do optometry and I have no choice but to mention health issues. This is because when I get hired I will have to disclose this and I will need a health assessment for wherever I work. So there is no chance of me hiding this. I have really good skills and experience but I feel disadvantaged due to my health. Having to explain it to the people that interview me makes me feel like crap. Is there a different way I can go about this so I can secure a job? Do you think I made the right decision leaving my career? What career options would be best for me as Optometry isn’t a very broad degree?

1ec5rhb,Lost and looking for any wisdom,"Hello everyone! I have been blessed enough to have two great opportunities ahead of me, but I have been too indecisive and confused to fully stick with and invest in one. I am currently an aerospace engineering student, but I am considering switching to medicine. I have been unsure of which path to pursue for around 2 years now, and almost everyone around me is getting sick and tired of my indecisiveness (including myself). 

I would like to become a dermatologist, as the skin care world is a huge interest and hobby for me. I enjoy taking care of myself and my skin and would love to do the same for others. I also really enjoy the subjects of biology, chemistry, and general studies of the human body. However, I would have to study medicine in a town that is very closed off and that has an education that is very expensive (my parents aren’t complaining about the cost; they want me to become a doctor, but I would feel guilty). Dermatology is a very competitive field, so I am afraid I would go through the very challenging journey of becoming a doctor only to not reach what I would like to do. I am also a gay man, and so I am fearful that I will never truly make my parents proud and will also miss out on so many years where I can be living my life authentically. 

On the other hand, I am studying engineering abroad and on a full scholarship. I am so far doing really well in my course and am not hating the curriculum. The experience living abroad has been really freeing, and I feel as though I am becoming my true self. I only have a couple years until I graduate, and I believe and hope I will be met with great job prospects as I would in medicine. 
The thought of medicine being my true calling still floats in my mind, but I am not sure if it is worth the hassle considering my circumstances. 

If you’ve made it this far, I thank you very much. I hope this all makes sense and would love to hear some thoughts! ",No-Economics-7607,1,1.0,0,1721940934,2024-07-25 20:55:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ec5rhb/lost_and_looking_for_any_wisdom/,7,2024

I no call no showed because I felt like I could not make it into work. My supervisor went on vacation, and the other management could not get ahold of me because they were calling my old number. So the other management fired me while my supervisor was on vacation.

On the other hand my supervisor at this job said he would be a reference for me, saying that I put in a lot of work for the company, and I did a good job.

So how would I go about wording my reason for leaving?

1ec4u8p,How to get started as a grant writer,"I recently posted about my grant-writing job ([this post](https://redd.it/1eb4w57)) and got several questions about how to get started in that career. I couldn't respond to everyone, so I'm putting some thoughts here. Let me know if you have additional questions.

Key point:

In grant writing, maybe like everything in life, relationships are everything! The better/easier you are to work with, the more people will want to work with you. Being a good colleague is much, much more important even than competency. Ideally, you develop both!

Starting with the limits of my experience:

I'm in the US and typically write grants to private philanthropic foundations (and rarely to government agencies) on behalf of nonprofit organizations working on criminal legal reform, including direct service organizations that provide safe housing and wraparound supports to women exiting incarceration. (That means I write grants for both advocacy groups and direct services orgs, which are pretty different.)

How I got started:

After 15 years in advocacy/lobbying for criminal legal reform, I needed to make a career change. So, I was lucky in that I had lots of job experience and relationships in the field (as well as enough savings to be able to eat as I made the transition). Since in my case I needed to work from home, my only idea was grant writing through which I could leverage my existing relationships and expertise.

The first thing I did was ask friends/contacts to introduce me to the grant writers and fundraisers they knew. I spoke with one person, in particular, who had worked in fundraising/philanthropy for decades to get some advice. Even though he advised against grant writing as a consultant, I didn't know how else to get started. So, I started by contacting nonprofits and asking if I could write a few grants for them for free - just for the experience and, hopefully, their future recommendation to other organizations. I was once again very lucky when a group offered me a full-time job not too long after I started freelancing. I decided that I preferred a steady paycheck to the constant hustling of consulting so I jumped at the chance. That was in 2020.

Other ideas for getting into grant-writing:

* Get a job doing literally anything with a nonprofit and, once you've got a handle on what they do and how they talk about their mission, offer to help with their grant writing. Bonus points if they already have an experienced grant writer on staff who can mentor you. (Just beware: experience doesn't always equal competence.)
* Check LinkedIn for nonprofits and grant writing jobs. You wouldn't believe how many groups are looking for volunteer grant writers. Reach out to those organizations to get some experience. I would recommend choosing one area to focus on, rather than trying to be a generalist. But maybe just take what you can get in the beginning. You can specialize later, if you want to.
* As with anything, be sure to check with friends, family, and work/school colleagues to see what contacts you might be able to tap into find an opportunity. There are _so_ many nonprofits out there, it isn't unreasonable to think someone in your life has a connection to one.
* Volunteer to do fundraising calls for political campaigns. This may seem unrelated, but they will teach you a lot about how to ask for money that is also useful in grant writing.
* If you're in school, ask around to see if the school/university has any grant writers or other fundraisers. (Spoiler: they will.) See if you can get an internship working with any of them.

My education:

I have a bachelor's degree from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, but it's not related to the field in any way (my major was Linguistics & Languages). I considered grad school, but opted against it because I didn't want to go into more school debt and figured I was making enough money already anyway. I'm not primarily driven by making the most that I can, so the trade-off was right for me.

The position would only be for 9 months, but I do have some confusion with how salary would work as it is not a 12 month position. I question if they condense the salary pay they offered me to fit within the 9 months (receive 12 months pay in 9) that I would be there or would I just lose out on pay for 3 months and receive technically less than what they offered me?

1ec3qiy,Here is How I Turned Unproductive Meetings into My Most Powerful Management Tool,"I would like to share this with everyone because it has always been a problem in all the companies I've worked for.

If I had to highlight one thing I learned during the lockdown periods from 2020 onwards, it is that I hate work meetings. Numerous aimless, unfocused meetings started popping up, where nothing was decided, and when something was, no one remembered it right after the meeting ended. This was killing my productivity and that of my entire team.

When I became a team manager, I realized that the vast majority of people didn’t take notes during meetings, and consequently, if I didn't personally remind each person of their tasks agreed upon in meetings, they were completely forgotten, leading to delays, rework, or losses. They would also forget important discussions and decisions, causing significant misalignment.

That was when I had the brilliant idea to start taking meeting minutes and sending the file to everyone via email after meetings (the company didn’t do meeting minutes because they thought it “slowed down the process of an agile company”). And what was the result? The same. No one read the meeting minutes, and it was as if I hadn't done anything.

I kept looking for solutions, and nothing worked until I started using a tool I found in a forum called EZ-Meet, and these were the results I obtained using the tool:

1. Since the application has a guided template, meetings became faster and more to the point, which, besides saving time and avoiding team exhaustion, made people participate more actively in meetings.
2. Now we can assign tasks or actions with deadlines and responsible persons, and it is very easy to track these tasks on the dashboard, so people stopped forgetting what they had to do and even complete them in advance, avoiding delays.
3. In this same dashboard, recent decisions agreed upon in meetings are objectively listed. In addition to easy documentation and the ability to later consult what was decided, when, and why, giving us management traceability, it also keeps everyone aligned and made people develop the habit of reviewing it before carrying out tasks, providing more security and avoiding rework and its consequences.

In short, the meetings that were my biggest headache everywhere I worked are now what most prevent headaches. I believe all managers should at least test this tool. If I'm not mistaken, there is a free trial of 7 or 14 days at the time of registration.",RevolutionaryTie8265,0,0.3100000023841858,1,1721935945,2024-07-25 19:32:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ec3qiy/here_is_how_i_turned_unproductive_meetings_into/,7,2024

1ec20nr,Considering leaving a job I'm miserable at to focus on grad school full time,"I’m 29m, with a degree in Music/Audio Engineering. I’ve been working for a medical device manufacturer since 2019. I started as a production/assembly tech, but worked my way up to Production Lead, then Quality Inspection Lead. Earlier in the year, I decided to return to school to pursue an MS in Electrical Engineering, and I’m set to start class in the Fall. My employer agreed to move me into the engineering department, and to provide tuition assistance, as long as I remain with the company for two years after receiving the degree.

It sounds good on paper, but here’s the issue: I’m absolutely miserable working at this company. It’s extremely disorganized and there’s very little guidance/direction/mentorship/training. I’ve encountered this at every level in the company, and engineering is no different. Not to mention that the company doesn’t seem to pay particularly well (Two of the engineers do landscaping on the side to make ends meet).

I don’t feel that this is a place I can really grow or learn. I dread the thought of trying to balance classes on top of working full time, especially if I’m miserable. And there’s basically no way in hell I plan on sticking around long enough to fulfill my tuition assistance obligation.

Overall, it’s been a tremendous source of anxiety/depression, and everyone close to me whose opinion I trust has advised me to quit, as it’s clearly affecting my wellbeing.

I’m considering resigning in order to focus completely on the MSEE program. I’m not really sure if it’s something I even want to pursue, so I want to be able to give it my full attention during the first semester, after which I’ll decide to either stick with it or try to pursue something else (I’m thinking accounting, or possibly stats/data analysis).

I’ve been living with my parents the past few years, and so I have very low expenses, no debt, and a good chunk of savings ($50,000 not including retirement). Plus, my parents have indicated that they would help me pay for it as well, if money were an issue.

1ec1av5,HR just published my name with a new job title.,"I have been asking for a new title since we took on another employee in my department and I've been 3+ years in the same position, same title. Last year I was awarded the highest raise in the company (14%) and I was told it was on the table months ago (literally last year when annual reviews came up), but nothing was discussed or mentioned prior and with the state of our HR, we have minimal expectations for them following up on anything we send them. My efforts have clearly been acknowledged and I pull weight where I'm at, but ultimately I'm considering moving jobs so I can hopefully gain more income.

Recently I was featured in a company wide publication with a new title, which wasn't discussed with me at all prior to the publishing. My colleague who has ins with HR replied with ""they can't seem to get anything right,"" which makes me think this could be an honest mistake on the HR guy. If it is legit, however, I am on the lowest possible end of that job title for my state. I'm taking it with a grain of salt that the job listings in my state for the same title start offering their lower salaries at $20k higher than what I currently make.

Should I address this with management/HR for legitimacy and a salary increase? How would I do that tactfully?

This mostly stems from me seeing others my age not tied down to a specific option and finding something that they are truly passionate about, while I’m here doing something that I’m honestly not all that enthusiastic about most days. 

I’m interested in switching to a career that could be drastically different in a lot of ways, but I’m unsure about the specifics at this point and mostly wanted to hear peoples opinions on this kind of change with my current situation. 

The way that I see it, I have a very safe position that I could work in basically until I retire or die. Most people take years before they find that spot in their careers, but I just happened to get here early. I feel a little envious of the people my age trying different things and going to different places for work. But I know that people would kill to be in the position that I am in now.

- You're on a team of 2 people that used to be 5 people. The amount of work given to your team is the same as it was when there were 5 people.

- Every day pretty much your manager sends you a message asking for a quick turnaround on something. The timing seems unreasonable.

- You're maxed out on PTO hours and it feels like you don't really have time to use them without the risk of work not being completed on time

- It almost seems like you're doing extra work for free

1ebymja,How reasonable should I expect for pushing out a start date or availability date until months out?,"I'm in a bit of a pickle. My lease doesn't run out until Oct. but I have to give a 60 day move out notice and I have some prearranged travel at the end of August. I am wanting to change to a new city and get a job elsewhere, but I'm also not sure how to approach such a push in availability when interviewing and applying?

I physically can't be on the ground there and start until at least the second week in September. But even then that would require me to have two months of double rent which may be pretty impossible. I could probably squeeze one, but realistically should I just hold out and not start applying until closer to the time I want to start? It's frustrating because I have to give move out notice at my current place and the month to month here is wildly expensive. 

I'd love to get something lined up in advance but I think my industry doesn't really work like that. My sister is a PA and got a job offer and accepted in march with a July start date for the very same reason but some of the places I have already spoken with have not been keen on that idea. Nor do they pay any sort of moving fees. 

What should I do?

1ebx1p6,Promotion or leave the company?,"I (35M) worked early in my career for one of the big retailers in the US, received quick promotions before being laid off in a restructuring. I approached one of the vendors I worked with and they hired me immediately for \~90k/yr remote on the sales team selling back to the retailer. Job has always been about 15-25 hours a week, and leadership is pleased with my work. “Promotion” 3 years ago to 130k but the same job, still remote, still part time hours. Inflation adjusted, salary has decreased 5% over the last 3 years, and likely a bonus is going away this year which will drop me another 15%. Responsibilities and hours have slowly increased.

In the meantime, I built a seasonal business with my spouse in a low cost of living area. It has grown to about 400k revenue, \~300k profit. We work about 6 months of the year 3-4 days a week on it. Doing both my job and running the business is stressful and challenging, and we think that if I could dedicate more time to the business we could grow revenue by another 200k. We would still have 6 months off in the winter.

My boss is retiring within a couple months, and I’m currently pushing to get his job, meeting with the CEO soon. Promotion would mean being full-time, not having half the year off, more stress etc. I have a number in the 400k-500k range that I’d be willing to do the job for, but less than that I’m not really interested in continuing working for them in any capacity. As it is, my current job isn’t really worth it to me anymore. Company would likely be in very hot water on their 8-9 figure account if they lose both me and my boss in such a short period. It could potentially cost them millions or tens of millions, depending how quickly they rushed to find replacements with specialized knowledge.

My question is, should I just come out and tell them that I have better/more appealing opportunities in my own business, and their options are to promote me with the salary I want or we can part ways? Does this ever work, or does leadership see red when they hear this from an employee?

Should I pretend like it’s business as usual, and if they deny me the promotion or try to offer some watered-down version of the job, then just leave if the offer isn’t what I want?

I’m 100% okay with leaving my current job, have $1.5M net worth and years worth of living expenses in after-tax accounts that we can access at any time.",chaser30,2,1.0,0,1721919626,2024-07-25 15:00:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ebx1p6/promotion_or_leave_the_company/,7,2024

As I reached higher grades, naturally I became more confused regarding career. I stuck to engineering so I chose science stream in high school. But soon I found out that I don't have interest in studying advanced maths, chemistry or physics. The best I did was in English so I chose my degree thinking that I'll just become a professor or teacher. I do have a strong passion for teaching. However that alone isn't enough to choose and sustain in a career. I've worked as a content writer, Communication Trainer and now as a school teacher. Out of these three I do prefer teaching. But I'm confused if I should be a school teacher or try to become a professor. I have weighed cons and pros for both but I'm unable to choose for all these years!

1ebuk0w,Walk away from toxic job without a replacement?,"Hello, I apologize if I ramble on but I have not slept much after ruminating over this situation, and I'm trying to get some advice from other folks. I really hope I don't sound whiny as that's not really my intention. I'm 44, male, and have worked in tech quite successfully for \~25 years. I've always been career-oriented and generally love to ""earn and learn."" However, now that I am rather financial secure (no kids or college debt; \~850k in investments) and have only a very small mortgage left, I find myself at a bit of an impasse. I am just not happy at all. And I know this is a ""me"" problem, but there's certainly contributing factors. 

I work for a financial company that definitely pays well, but the hours have become brutal -- especially as I've gotten older and value my time a lot more. It's a production environment, so there's frequently Saturday work, on-call, and relatively little time off. Also, they recently instituted a 4x RTO mandate, which is painful as that's nearly 3 hours round-trip each day. However, I do know that I am fortunate to have a job in this climate and this certainly isn't lost on me. It's also why it makes things so hard to decide what direction to take. Quite frankly, I am burnt out from years of 6-day work weeks, last minute changes, on-call, extremely aggressive timeline.... and now there's the aforementioned commute. I was initially hired fully remote, which of course they can take away, but it's really not even close to the same job I accepted. 

My parents had me on the older side, and they both have health problems - my dad in particular. As I'm the only family member in the area, I feel I need be around more. The icing on the cake is that I now have a new boss who is absolutely insufferable. I have never had a problem getting along with my bosses, until this guy showed up. He clearly plays favorites and I feel his presence (virtually, not literally) everywhere I go. Several people complained about his management style, and they've been working to improve things, telling him to treat all his reports equally, etc. However, he has basically setup his favorite people for success (working on the newer technologies), and let the rest of us to manage the other 98% of the job. Oh, but we're also expected to be more like these other guys, learning these newer things in our limited spare time. He is constantly holding them as a shining example, but they're basically allowed to do as they please. And, I am feeling double the pressure to deliver, to self-teach myself these things in my spare time so I can continue to thrive. Oh, and those other guys don't ever seem to be asked to work weekends. That is for people like me: the grunts. Of course I can ""catch up"" and learn all these new techs, as I have always adapted. I just find all these things overwhelming and this style of learning to not be terribly fun. 

So, what do I want to do? I think I'm going to quit before RTO takes effect. Sell a chunk of my company stock and pay off my house. Work out as I've put on weight from stress eating / drinking. Self-study stuff that will put me in the best position to find another job. Travel. Pursue hobbies. Reconnect with old friends. I want to become healthy in the body and mind because my situation has me very depressed. Work used to be a bit of a sanctuary for me, where I could tune out the outside world. Now, everyone is miserable at work, and I need to remove myself from the environment. Am I insane to cut the chord in this job market? I do still get a lot of job offers on linkedin, in fact, I got 3 yesterday after a quiet period. I think working in tech in the financial sector just isn't the right fit for me anymore, and finding something closer to home, with more traditional 9x5 hours would be best. I do expect a well paying salaried job to have some weekends, sometimes. I just want more of a life and I have the financial health to make it reality. Hell, maybe I'll even consult or work contracts, travel, contract, etc, etc.  Thank you so much for reading. I apologies for any whining or rambling. I have NOT been myself recently.

1ebu5zt,Nursing vs Accounting,"I need some help on making a decision and I figured I’d ask reddit for their opinion and experience. I currently have a CS degree from WGU but the market is awful right now. I can’t wait 1-2 years for a job, it just feels like I’m stagnating and there’s no guarantee it’ll come. I don’t hate programming but the market doesn’t seem to be getting better, and there’s thousands of laid off engineers with a lot more experience than me not getting work. 

Anyway, while I still have a CS degree and a portfolio, I’ll continue to apply for tech jobs and see if anything bites. That being said, the lack of job security for the future concerns me. Not sure if AI concerns because I use Chatgpt and Claude regularly, and they’re fancy auto complete. I can see how maybe in a few years they’ll take over junior dev work if a senior can work faster but I digress. 

I’m debating between nursing or accounting. Both seem to have job security, nursing more so, and both come with their own pros and cons. 

Accounting 

Pros:
- WFH possible
- Desk job so not manual labor
- Possible yearly raises
- Many different ways for career path
- Possibly enjoy the corporate ladder?
stable and somewhat above average income
- possible government job with pension and benefits
- will likely only take 6 months to a year if I accelerate

Cons:
- Desk job might not be what I want for 8+ hours
- 60-80 hour weeks during tax season sound aggressive 
- AI might take my job but probably not but who knows the future
- outsourcing might take my job as entry level and i’ll never get off the ground running
- Numbers and excel might be boring
- chance of not getting off the ground and not finding a job

Nursing

Pros:
- above average starting pay
- on your feet so active and getting in some steps for the day
- possibly enjoy helping people? 
- many different career paths
- very stable it seem, always will find a job regardless of the market. 
- WFH seems possible with telehealth but I’m unsure of how that would work
- other paths that come after nursing pay really well
- 3 day work weeks

Cons: 
- unsure of how I’d do with bodily fluids. ie: blood, poop, vomit. The smell of a bad bathroom can get to me tbh
- experience lots of mental and physical toll
- possible abuse by management and patients
- possible violence by patients 
- schooling costs a lot more and will take longer
- possibly have to recover for a full day after 3 days on 12 hours each day

I’m just looking for some perspective. This will be posted ideally in both the nursing and accounting subs so I can get a better look at opinions. 

If I had to summarize, I just want to make decent money to support myself and the people I love. I know everyone does. I’ve read to not go into nursing unless you love it, and I don’t know if that matters to me. I feel like a lot of nurses probably do it for the money. Same with accounting. I have hobbies and enjoy my time outside of work. I don’t need work to give me meaning. 

That being said, what’s this subs take on accounting vs nursing. What are the chances an accounting degree doesn’t get me off the ground running? I don’t want to pay for another degree and it would be useless because of the job market. I’ve put Expected Graduation on my resume with an accounting degree to test out the market and it seems like I’m still just getting rejections from linkedin.

I just want a broader perspective. Maybe some alternatives. I know radiology is a thing too but I’m unsure about that job market. ",dUltraInstinct,1,1.0,9,1721912088,2024-07-25 12:54:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ebu5zt/nursing_vs_accounting/,7,2024
1ebtq4r,How honest should I be about a past scandal?,"I work in the writing field and about a decade ago I was very rightly shamed for plagiarism I undertook during a very stressful period of my life, which led to a mental health crisis I took a good few years to recover from.

Since then I've worked in the industry under a pen name and forged some very solid relationships with great companies.

One of these companies recently told me they're considering me for a producer position which would be a huge pay bump.

Before I put my hat in the ring I'm going to explain to them that I've been using a pen name all this time. I think this is easy enough to explain as a lot of people use pen names in the writing industry for a variety of reasons, and our work relationship has always been fairly informal, but should I be upfront about my past troubles?

I've been doing good work for the last 10 years and the scandal disappeared from public discourse quite quickly - if you Google my name there's only one entry on one of the last pages of Google.

At the same time I'd hate to get the job without disclosing and then they find out 3 months later or get an anonymous tip from someone and fire me for not being honest.

It's a very painful part of my life to discuss but if I should bring it up before the interview then I will be brave and do that. 

If they do ask about it unprompted I'll just be honest and say it's an extremely regrettable part of my past but I've focused on being a better person over the last decade. I do have a number of references who work with this company and will vouch for my good work.

1ebtmmc,"What is the best engineering program among the three: Industrial Engineering, Electronics Engineering, or Electrical Engineering?
","For context, I'm an 18 year senior high school graduate from the STEM strand this year and my interest lies on knowing the ""why""s behind the things, being creative (designing and performing), and productive. Noong una, my choice of program is Multi-media Arts sana or   AB Comm kaso hindi siya practical employement-wise and either sa private schools lang sya ino-offer (thus, malaki ng tuition and miscellanous kahit may scholarship) or masyadong malayo samin yung schools available dun (d namin afford yung malaki gastos sa dorm). Ngayon, nitong grade 12, I become slightly fascinated sa subject naming Physics kasi nacha-challenge ako mag-isip and nadedevelop problem-solving skills ko, kaya I tried looking at engineering programs, and figured electrical engineering is quite good for me. Kaso lang nitong mga araw na malapit na ang enrollment, I'm starting to doubt this program kasi andami kong nababasa rito sa reddit na hindi raw maganda ang electrical engineering here in ph, and I started realizing na maybe hindi ko gustong nandito ako sa field na to for a long time.

Now, I passed the entrance exam in a state u na na nag-ooffer ng IE, ECE, and EE and the more I looked at the ECE and IE programs, the more I became interested in these fields. I asked for my seniors' curriculum in these fields and possible career paths na puntahan ko in the future and below are the things I consider in choosing my program in college(pros and cons):

**THINGS I CONSIDER IN CHOOSING MY PROGRAM:**

* It must be in my field of interest (creative, productive, challenging, and encourage me to think critically)
* Allows me to improve my efficiency, productivity, time management, communication skills (oral and written), problem solving skills, and financial literacy
* Has good job opportunities and decent salary rate
* Good satisfaction rate and work-life balance I guess
* Allows me to have the fastest route in migrating and becoming an Engineer abroad, preferably Canada kasi nandun tita ko. 
* Board Exam/ Certification (not sure here kasi I heard hindi raw nire-recognize ang PRC license sa ibang bansa)
* Allows be to be in a stable field

**PROS:** 

* Medj interested ako here because of its versatility and flexibility, I can peak in different engineering programs
* I can seriously be a jack of all trades and gain valuable skills to become a manager
* I’ll learn a lot on management and can use my creativity to handle projects 
* Can help me improve my critical thinking skills and financial literacy 
* I can improve my communication skills here 
* If eto yung program na ite-take ko, I think my choice of field would lean towards finance, sales and marketing management or data science/anayst

**CONS:**

* Baka masyado shang broad
* Sabi ng tita ko, mahirap daw kapag walang board yung program, so I guess it’s a con. 

1. **ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING:**

**PROS:**

* Kind of interested ako here gawa ng robotics and programming where I can utilize and improve my problem-solving skills and designing skills
* Malapit din siya sa tech industry so makakapag-shift ako sa field na yun if ever na di ko gusto ung unang mapupuntahan kong field 
* Can train me to become a critical thinker and problem solver 
* Has board exam 

**CONS:**

* Difficult board exam (30-40% national passing rate)
* If I'm considering to moving to Canada after passing the board and hindi ako nakapasa sa board in the 1st take, it would take me atleast 1 more year to get my license and hindi naman sha nare-recognize sa ibang bansa, tapos I still have to take programs and exams for certification there as well as atleast 3-5 years of experience. 

1. **ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING:**

**PROS:**

* Kind of interested in programming and designing so I think I this is kind of a choice din
* Can train me to become a critical thinker and problem solver 
* Mas mataas passing rate niya sa board exam kesa run sa electronics 

**CONS:**

* Medj unsure ako sa magiging trajectory ko if ever na dito ako mapuntant field. My tita said that I should try to gain experience on working where I’ll work in the future then try to aim for a managerial role, but idunno how that’ll work out here in ph. 

Huhu pls help me po. Gulong-gulo na po ako sa pipiliin.  I would appreciate it po if mga engineers din po yung sumagot sa query kong ito. Thank you po!

1ebswux,if you work hard 90% there's always 10% luck,"I was the kind of person who used to compare many things with others but mostly career. I recently graduated and due to recession and our college i couldn't get placed although i tried and i'm still trying but when 2 of major companies came for hiring i cracked everything but for absolutely no reason they revoked my offer letter and on the other hand the people who never knew anything about coding nor about companies have got offer letter i was furious at that time like i was literally spending my 12 hrs a day on practicing still i didn't get the offer and these people who used to time pass, bunk college throughout their degree got it. So ofc i then started blaming myself, doubting my abilities, blaming persons that didn't have anything to do with this and it kept spiraling around my head for weeks and it started affecting my studies, concentration, mental health, physical health so one day I was walking on the terrace to get some air and i thought about everything again thoroughly that where i went wrong and then I remembered what my sister said "" During placement you need hard work and most importantly luck "" because she went through the exact same thing during her placements and i literally used to see her everyday working hard but somehow the opportunity used to slip away but at the end of her semester she was the only candidate in college with highest package. Then I asked myself one question "" are those people gonna get you placed ? "" my answer was obviously ""No"" since my competition was never with them nor my hard work for them, everything I used to do is for myself, i used to prepare so that i could give MY best so basically my competition was with myself only, I just needed a little luck that i didn't have at time so maybe there is something much more better for me and some company that is worth my talent. You never know!! so my advice for you guys if you're struggling with these kind of situation then 

1. Never compare yourself with others

2. Don't be demotivated because you are exactly where you need to be right now 

3. Keep working on yourself for yourself  ",freakyconfusedsoul,9,0.8500000238418579,0,1721908248,2024-07-25 11:50:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ebswux/if_you_work_hard_90_theres_always_10_luck/,7,2024

So we have a very big conference we are attending in Amsterdam in September so it is a very busy time for us as we prepare. The company I work for is a very small team, about 8 people in total, so I would feel bad leaving right before the conference, leaving them with a tonne more work. On the other hand, if I see it through and quit after the conference, it just kinda looks like I have taken the free trip to Amsterdam and left which idk might come across as a bit shitty.

All I know is that I want out - does it matter when? Would love a second opinion! 

Note: My resignation has to have a minimum of 3-weeks notice.

How do i continue into H.R. and also my preference is IT based companies with the crazy Resume Gaps.

1ebnqok,is double majoring worth it?,"hihi reddit! lately i’ve been considering the option to double major, however i’m having a hard time deciding whether it’s something i should actually do. 

to clarify a bit, i’m wanting to major in finance and am still going back and forth between what my second major would actually be. but, i’m not asking for suggestions about that in this post. instead, i want to know if double majoring is a good option.

i’ve tried doing my own research but have found that people tend to have some very strong opinions about double majoring. with some saying it’s a great idea, others saying you should only do it if you love to learn and love the challenge, and others saying to absolutely not do it- that employers don’t care/pay attention to that and you should instead focus on your single degree and use what time you have left over to make connections, get an internship, etc. 

so, i guess my main question is- does double majoring actually come with any benefits? especially right now in this current job market? 

is it something that employers will actually even consider or care about? would it make you a more appealing candidate? would it open the door for higher paying jobs/positions? or will it really just end up being something else i can mention in my resume with no real benefit/advantage?

i hope what i’m saying makes sense but please let me know what you think! especially if you’ve double majored and can say first hand how things have been for you!

1ebm2y7,The Working Capital in Financial Analysis,"Hello all! Let’s dive into working capital in financial analysis. Whether you’re new to finance or need a refresher, this guide will make it easy and fun. Plus, I’ll tell you where to find more details in my book, ""Financial Analysis Fundamentals.""

# What is Working Capital?

Working capital represents the difference between a company's current assets and current liabilities. It reflects a company’s ability to meet short-term financial obligations.

Working Capital = *Current Assets − Current Liabilities*

# Why is Working Capital Important?

1. **Liquidity and Operational Efficiency:** Ensures the company can cover day-to-day expenses, pay suppliers, employees, and other short-term obligations on time.
2. **Financial Health:** Positive working capital indicates financial stability. Negative working capital may signal liquidity problems.
3. **Business Growth:** Adequate working capital supports growth initiatives like expanding operations and investing in new projects.
4. **Risk Management:** Effective management helps mitigate financial risks, such as cash flow disruptions and inventory shortages.

# The Working Capital Cycle

1. **Cash Conversion Cycle:** Begins with purchasing raw materials and ends with collecting cash from sales. It includes:
   * **Inventory Cycle:** Time taken to convert raw materials into finished goods.
   * **Accounts Receivable Cycle:** Time taken to collect payments from customers.
   * **Accounts Payable Cycle:** Time taken to pay suppliers.
2. **Funding Gap:** The shortfall between short-term assets (e.g., accounts receivable, inventory) and short-term liabilities (e.g., accounts payable, short-term debt). A negative funding gap indicates a shortage of working capital, while a positive gap suggests excess.

# How to Improve Working Capital Management

1. **Optimize Inventory:** Reduce excess inventory and improve turnover ratios.
2. **Accelerate Receivables:** Expedite the collection of accounts receivable through discounts for early payments or tighter credit terms.
3. **Manage Payables:** Negotiate favorable payment terms with suppliers and optimize payment schedules.
4. **Access Financing:** Secure additional financing through bank loans or lines of credit to bridge temporary funding gaps.

# Real-World Example

Imagine you run a small bakery. You need to ensure you have enough ingredients (inventory) to bake daily while keeping enough cash on hand to pay your suppliers (liabilities) when invoices are due. Managing your working capital effectively ensures your bakery runs smoothly without financial hiccups.

# Dive Deeper with My Handbook

If this piqued your interest, check out my handbook, ""**Financial Analysis Fundamentals**."" It’s filled with easy-to-follow explanations, practical examples, and exercises to help you master working capital management and other financial analysis techniques.

In ""**Financial Analysis Fundamentals**,"" you’ll learn about:

* Different aspects of working capital management.
* Detailed steps for improving working capital.
* Real-world case studies and practical tips.

# Final Thoughts

Working capital is crucial for the smooth operation of any business. By managing it effectively, you ensure your business stays liquid, efficient, and financially healthy.

Happy analyzing! And if you want to deepen your financial analysis skills, don’t forget to grab a copy of ""[Financial Analysis Fundamentals](https://www.lulu.com/account/projects/kv942er).""

1ebkt0v,6 Years of Burnout and Lessons Learned on Finding a Job with Better Work-Life Balance,"**I spent six years battling burnout from a job with a terrible work-life balance.**

During that time, I started to hate my job, lost my passion for programming, and stopped building side projects. It was a difficult period where the joy I once found in my work evaporated.

This year, I started to feel like I'm starting to really recover from burnout and found my interest in programming and side projects is getting back.

**Here are some tips that have helped me, and I hope they can help you too:**

***1. Research Company Culture***

Dive deep into company reviews on sites like Glassdoor and LinkedIn. Check social media for employee testimonials.

***2. Look for Remote or Hybrid Roles***

Remote or hybrid positions offer flexibility that can greatly improve your work-life balance. No commute means more time for personal activities.

***3. Prioritize Companies with Balance Initiatives***

Search for companies that actively promote work-life balance. Look for perks like flexible hours, mental health support, wellness programs, and generous PTO.

***4. Ask During Interviews***

During interviews, don’t shy away from asking about work-life balance. Questions like:

""What does a typical workweek look like for this role?""

""How does the company support work-life balance?""

""Are there expectations for after-hours or weekend work?""

***5. Network with Employees***

Connect with current employees through LinkedIn or other platforms to get the inside scoop on what it's like to work there.

***6. Set Boundaries Early***

From the get-go, be upfront about your boundaries. Let potential employers know if you don’t answer emails after a certain time or work on weekends.

***7. Spot Red Flags***

Be cautious of vague answers about work hours, excessive praise of “hustle culture,” or high turnover rates. Also watch out for things like:

""looking for candidates who thrive in a fast-paced environment""

""expected to wear multiple hats""

They aren't necessarily negative, but they do suggest a greater level of involvement.

***8. Use Specialized Job Boards***

Job boards focused on work-life balance, like Calm Jobs, list positions from companies that value employee well-being.

***9. Consider Freelance or Contract Work***

1ebkeyn,Let go due to budget cuts ,"I need some advice. 

So I have multiple disabilities but I’m considered high functioning. However for various reasons in part related to my disabilities I haven’t finished college. I ended up dropping out. 

Anyhow I’ve been working with vocational rehab but I haven’t been placed in many jobs
Through them. I’ve actually had a bit of luck finding opportunities on my own. I like it that way tbh. It makes me feel like I earned it as opposed to it being handed to me. 

Anyhow I’ve been with one company since mid February. I’ve been working part time for them. They aren’t necessarily a start up, but it’s almost a one man show (so to speak). Anyhow, today he tells me that he is putting me and an unknown amount of other people on a “break”. He doesn’t know when he will be able to hire us back. He didn’t initially say that he was letting multiple people go (but I don’t know the exact number), and I thought it was just me but then he clarified it was anyone doing this project, (we work completely independently so I don’t know anything about the other people). 
With that being said, I recently found out (and applied) to a remote position but it is supposedly not starting until September (that is if I even get the job). Anyhow I’m wondering what should I do between now and September. I would like to apply for other positions but I don’t want to get a position and then get the position I applied for and have to leave the position for the new position after just a month. (I have been told by multiple people that this is a perfect job for me, because I had several people I trust look at the job description, resume and my cover letter). I am considering some sort of freelance position in the meantime or possibly working for one of the political organizations since it’s an election year and I’m very interested in social justice. (Will not specify my party in here so there is no division on either end). 
Anyhow, I was hoping that someone hear might have some advice. My plan was to work for my current job until at least September but now that’s not possible. And it just sucks that I’m without a job without another one lined up. And it’s my birthday of all days too. How soon do you think it’s possible to find a job (especially if you have no degree and multiple disabilities)? I really don’t want to be sitting around all of August in the event I do get picked for that September position. I would prefer remote work and part time if possible.

1ebjweq,Advice needed— Company BYOD policy for hybrid work and use of private devices,"I have recently accepted a job offer with a new company and have been told that they utilize a “BYOD” policy. I thought this was a little odd since with every other job I have had in the past I’d been given a company laptop and for other remote/hybrid roles I was sent monitors, keyboard, mouse, docking station etc by the company.

Naturally I was a little confused since this was the first time I had ever heard of such a thing, so I emailed my recruiter inquiring if I could be issued a company device if I was unable to use a personal device. Her response:

“We don’t issue computers/home office devices for days you are working remote. We log into a company network from our personal devices on wfh days that mirror our in office desktop set up. You can do this on any device you currently have at home. You don’t need anything fancy to get into the remote network.”

Uh, okay. So then I asked if I would be provided equipment such as monitors, keyboard, docking station etc for our WFH days. Her response:

“When you work in office we have computers, phones, head sets, key boards etc.. you will have your own desk with everything set up in office. But on days you work from home, you will need to use your own personal equipment.”

So at this point I think this is really bizarre. What if I don’t even have a personal device? My unease has been further reinforced by various other Reddit threads on similar scenarios suggesting that using personal devices for work as it means the company is a massive security risk, is cheap, invasive, that it’s overall a really bad look for the company etc. I am just really not sure what to do at this point. I have thankfully not given my resignation at my current job so I can still back out if I choose. This is so strange— they’re a legit company in my city and I have heard really good things about them, but I am honestly considering rescinding my acceptance over this which sucks because I was really excited about this 24 hours ago. Should I trust my gut and back out, or are there other things I need to consider more closely?",ReadInBothTenses2,2,1.0,5,1721874966,2024-07-25 02:36:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ebjweq/advice_needed_company_byod_policy_for_hybrid_work/,7,2024
1ebjn56,any suggestions for a major?,"Hello Reddit,

I'm 16M, soon to be 17, and I'm about to enter my senior year of high school this August. As I approach this crossroads in my life, l'm feeling increasingly overwhelmed and directionless regarding my future career and college plans. I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights from those who have gone through similar uncertainties.

To provide some context, I have no specific interests or passions when it comes to a career. I'm generally content with most things, with exception to my severe hatred for math, but the one thing that consistently motivates me is the prospect of earning a good income. I frequently look up ""highest paying jobs"" online and see results like anesthesiologist, which offers an attractive salary of around $400k a year. However, the thought of spending 12-14 years studying for such a profession is a major deal breaker for me. I know that I want a well-paying career, but beyond that, I have no idea what field I should pursue or what major I should consider for college.

Financially, my family isn't in the best position. I have an older sister currently in college, and my family is helping her with her expenses, which means I'll likely be attending community college for the first two years. Honestly, I don't mind this; it seems like a practical and affordable path.

Academically, I would classify myself as an average student.

	•	Weighted GPA: 3.5344 (cumulative for all three years)
	•	Unweighted GPA: 3.86
	•	SAT Score: 1010
	•	AP Classes: Took three AP classes, but only passed one
	•	Extracurriculars: Played soccer for three years (soon to be four)
	•	Class Rank: 24 out of 183

I realize that my GPA isn't terrible, but my SAT score is quite low, and my performance in AP classes hasn't been stellar. These factors have been a source of significant stress for me this summer, as I feel time slipping away without a clear plan.

In summary, l'm feeling a lot of pressure because I don't know which college I'll end up at, whether l'm good enough for a ”good"" college, and most importantly, what I want to major in or pursue as a career. I understand that no one can make thes decisions for me, but any guidance or advice would be incredibly helpful as I try to figure out my path.

TL;DR: I'm a rising high school senior with no clear career interests or college plans. My family is financially constrained, and I'll likely attend community college initially. I have an average GPA, a low SAT score, and mediocre AP performance.
I'm stressed about my future and seeking any advice or guidance.

Thank you in advance for your help!",mxath,1,0.5699999928474426,8,1721874209,2024-07-25 02:23:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ebjn56/any_suggestions_for_a_major/,7,2024
1ebj719,Why do I keep getting reported for this?,"Im at my wits end right now with my job. This is going to sound so stupid. And it’s long. Cross posted. This is my first corporate 9-5 job. I am twenty two and I work front desk for a hospital, in their primary/specialty clinics that they own. I am a part time float, so I work in multiple clinics whenever someone calls in or is on vacation or if they need the extra help. 

When I first started my job in July 2023, I never received a dress code violation until February. They never went over the dress code during orientation. I would wear high waist mom jeans with a shirt that would hit my belt where my waist was, and a long cardigan. Higher management informed me by email that there were complaints from multiple clinics about my shirts not being below my waist. Okay, that’s fair won’t do it again. All of my shirts from that point on have been worn below my waist tucked into a belt. 

Today I received another email informing me that my shirts are inappropriate because they’re above my waist. I am being so honest when I say this, my shirts have not been at or above my waist since the first time they informed me, my attire has always been below my waist, even when I bend down or am reaching high! I always tuck my shirts into my pants. I’m not the only one that does this either. 

I responded politely, asking them if they could provide me with dates of when these violations occurred, because I haven’t worn shorter shirts since the first time they informed me. Management said that they don’t have any dates and that it was brought up during a meeting. 

In November, I was written up for shit I don’t  even do. Apparently, multiple clinics claim that I leave during my shift and go sit in my car for 30 minutes multiple times a day. Apparently I don’t answer phone calls. Apparently I’m on my phone scrolling through social media.  Apparently I have an attitude. I guess I do not route faxes. I guess I just sit there twiddle my fucking thumbs all day. 
I don’t do this!!! I don’t know where they’re getting this from. I show up on time every day that I’m scheduled. I’ve only called in once because I had a fever. 

I don’t know why this keeps on happening, I work my ass off for them and I do a great job. I am always kind to patients, I go above and beyond for the patients and my coworkers, I take phone calls efficiently, I’m efficient in fax queues, I’m cross trained on two check-in platforms. People tell me that they couldn’t imagine doing my job since I work at over a dozen different clinics. I’ve been told I take initiative and am proficient at my job. So many people I work alongside have told me this, because sometimes I feel like I’m not doing enough, lol.
 I receive compliments from patients as well as coworkers;  telling me that I’m sweet, that I brighten their day, that I’m a beautiful person,  have a beautiful aura, etc. I clock into work with a positive outlook and I carry it through the day. I’m not trying to toot my own horn but I am just really tired of getting reported. 
I don’t know what their problem is and I don’t know what to do, because other than this I really love my job. I will say that some of the clinical staff are rude to me/floats in general, as we will have to ask questions periodically.

1ebhxzx,Okay posting this everywhere because I think this might help some folks,"Initially posted this on recruitinghell because it's kinda funny to gloat over everyone there and to help out a little bit, but then seeing how bad it is on a lot of subreddits like financialcareers and others posting this here too hope it helps! Long post, might be worth the read... if you're hopeless about life or stuck or unemployed this is for you. 

Hey y'all! I love lurking on this sub. I have a LinkedIn profile and the amount of scammy ass-kissing fake bullshit corporate speak recruiting I come across on there I absolutely relish. This sub really roasts and exposes a lot of the ridiculousness out there and for that, I get to get some free laughs and reflect on how silly the corporate world is and how made-up careers and jobs are as a thing... WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY. Ha ha ha

So... I have the unicorn of unicorns of all jobs. I work from home, in finance (gonna be really vague here because I don't want people flooding in and stealing what I have, or my company to realize I have it too good and then it kills the unicorn, or golden goose, or cash cow, or whatever...). It pays six figures after taxes. Big fat whopping 401k match and benefits that are too good to be true. Quarterly bonuses. Year end bonuses. Equity compensation... it's truly incredible.

I wake up most days and log in to my work computer so it shows I'm online on microsoft teams, make my way to the kitchen, make some coffee, study some languages (really getting into language learning these days), then after a couple of hours do a couple of things for firm clients, check and see if my boss in online that day or not, then take an hour for lunch. The afternoon I question why I even bother working since my boss hasn't even checked in with me for over a month and is rarely online (I think his job is kinda like mine but even better and by job I mean I don't think he really ever works and gets paid insane money). I restart my computer at 5 PM and go work out at a local gym just to get out of being in the same place for 24 hours at a time.

So... life is pretty fucking incredible and I doubt this will last long because the next time some consultant comes in to see who is doing what for the company pretty sure my whole team is gonna get canned. We just don't do anything and cost too much money.

So yeah... just wanna gloat and tell you all there are positions where you do get paid good money, are not stressed, barely do any work, and can live anywhere you want in the US ""working"" from home. Sucks to suck! I have no idea how I ended up here. Just luck and being in the right place at the right time. I used to work in shitty server jobs and hotels. Somehow got hired as customer service at a financial firm, got my series 7 and 66, got my degree, and worked my way up into different more interest roles FAST. Like not even four years and bam, here I am. Stunned to say the least.

So here also to try and help a little bit... I was treated really badly when the pandemic hit by my previous employer who furloughed and then permanently let me go in the worst way possible. Because of that I promised myself I will always have a backup plan in the case my employer ever does something like that again no matter who I work for... did a lot of research and settled on joining the US Army reserve as this weird little backup plan. For those that don't know, the Army reserve will pay a sign on bonus (I got $20k), forgive up to $50k worth of student debt, pay a monthly stipend for going to college to pursue a bachelors or masters or higher degree, and pay a good chunk of tuition, and while you **initially train** full time (only initially), you get a really nice housing allowance (mine was over $4000 per month tax free) on top of a military salary that is chump change, but, if one is unemployed like it seems a lot of you all are, is probably better than nothing. SCRA that limits all credit card debt and mortgage and car loans to 6% can be a big deal too when entering in to the service... I feel like I am rambling here but let me try to get to the point... I joined the Army reserve and now have really good health benefits through them, like even better than my employer, an okay retirement, sense of self-worth and some newly-made friends... all that it cost was I disappeared for 6 months to finish up the initial active training while my job is federally protected, and now I'm back where I drill one weekend a month, get paid a little bit for that (chump change I put most of it in the TSP retirement), and work at my civilian job. Oh also before I forget a lot of the reserve jobs like intel will get you a TS security clearance so afterwards the FBI and CIA really want you to go work for them and those jobs don't pay a lot but are interesting and super stable...

To the point then geez I'm rambling... a lot of you seem miserable and out of options and I've been there, it sucks. My probably stupid advice but I'm gonna throw it out there anyway: Join the military. Coast guard reserve, army reserve, navy reserve, air force reserve whatever, doesn't matter, do it. It will get you out of the slump you are in. I'm partial to the Army reserve since it is the quickest but it doesn't really matter which. Get an MOS (military job specialty thing) that isn't infantry or on the front lines. Go intel or cyber or something. You'll probably lose some weight, learn how to overcome things with a newfound self-confidence that comes from a drill instructor yelling in your face and making you run everywhere, and when it's all over (the months of initial training), most companies have service member and veteran hiring preferences that will really genuinely help you get that job you're convinced you'll never get because the job market absolutely sucks right now.

Being in the Army sucks. The military industrial complex, the never-ending wars that may or may not be justifiable, big bad america, whatever you wanna say I don't care. I know what it's like to be unemployed for a year, and holy hell did I come close to killing myself... join the military and they might just let someone else kill you instead... (hahaha joking joking... or am I?) Anyway... Join the military in a reserve function and for christ's sake if you're still trying to develop a civilian career don't go active. Recruiters will lie and try and push you into some bullshit job in the military or try and make you go active. Know what you want to do, something like logistics or intel or something that isn't gonna put you on the front lines (avoid being a truck driver, your ass doesn't wanna get smoked while waiting in some convoy to delivery MREs--military equivalent of lunchables for soldiers--to the front lines). It might be shit, but you know what? It sure is a whole lot fucking better than being unemployed and giving up hope and on life. You can make a real difference and feel a sense of purpose again.

OH! Before I forget... they are super desperate right now because no one wants to join the military due to a cultural shift in the US (other reasons too like, oh I dunno, 20 years of people going to Afghanistan and social media telling it how it was), but to all those older folks... during basic training for me there was a 40 year old there joining as a private haha. They will take most anyone, even if you're really stupid like me! :) I can make good arguments about the US military too, because I see them as a force for good, but this is reddit and I'm biased so grain of salt etc.

Sorry for the long rambling post! On the one hand, I love this sub and wanna gloat and get some recognition for having it made in my current situation, and on the other hand, I feel deeply, deeply sorry for all the hopelessness and despair I see. All you out there wanting to end your life because you don't know how to provide for yourself and your family, your pets etc... all those unemployed and bitter about life, I hear ya. It absolutely sucks. This might reach someone and they join, get out of that mental rut, get fit, get back to life with just a little bit more of support from the most powerful gang on earth that is the US military, and then end up landing that dream job where they can live and earn a happy life and retirement.

Eh.... or the mods ban me here and no one else is the wiser. Career and jobs and professionalism is all made up anyway. We are primitive apes on a floating rock in space and the sun's gonna explode. Take a deep breath. None of this matters. If you feel like ending it all, don't act on it. Join the military. Maybe your worst fears come realized and you die. Maybe you become a badass and go active duty after a while because you've found a newfound sense of purpose. Maybe you come back from initial training ready to take on the world because that's what they train to feel like, and you go land that job like and absolute boss. Get out there and take back control of your life (by giving up control of your life to the government LOL). Hahaha.

Cheers!

1ebhxqf,I cannot do this any longer,"I just six years of retail work. Three of them were as a general sales associate, two were in a shop management position, and one (is currently) in assistant store management.

I thought it was just post-vacation depression but I am absolutely miserable. The signs have already been there for a good year, but ever since my friends from Norway left from visiting me, speaking wonders about the work culture there and how good things are, my motivation in my job has been completely crushed. I don't want to do this the rest of my life. I'm thirty in a few months and I feel like I have utterly wasted six years of life fruitlessly spinning the tires in a vain hope that I'll get somewhere in retail.

This assistant store management role is laughable. It's hourly. $21.50/hr. No overtime allowed except from November through January. Obscene amounts of responsibility without the incentive to actually try or want to excel. I'm sickened by the customers and their vicious attitudes, the never ending amount of freight constantly rolling in. Corporate, district, and regional meddling in store operations thinking they know better than we do on how to run a store when all they do is sit in a cushy office all day making arbitrary, silly decisions that are not applicable to the real world, but expect us to implement them anyway. Refusal to hire any more help when we are far under the minimum roster for our store profile, so we have to pick up the slack and do the jobs of janitors, heavy-lifting, and everything in between.

Our old district manager got promoted up in the company, and I really did like the guy. The new district manager is a complete corporate puppet and a soulless husk; completely cold and unfeeling towards anybody. It trickles down into every store in the district and I'm feeling it. I don't want to do this anymore.

I miss my friends so much. I miss Norway. I aspire to be there and work there, but I feel stuck at this job. I can't just get up and quit because it's my only source of income. I have a bachelor's degree in history, and I've thought about getting my MA by studying abroad in Norway OR doing so here, but I don't know how I'm going to do this and still work full-time to have a place to live, be able to fuel my car, be able to feed myself, etc. I've thought about getting into what Norway would consider ""skilled work"" (IT, welding, carpentry, electrician, etc.) and studying to get licensed in those here, but I feel like I'm going to run into the same problem, unless there's something that exists in the world where you can get paid to study and become certified.

I tried my darndest to spin my years of frame shop management as ""skilled"" to UDI, and applied to jobs there, and nothing, so I've basically given up hope of that or retail providing a means to move there. My friend back there works for a tower crane operator, and said that I could do this here and take the skills with me as they hire immigrants all the time, but that the certifications in the USA wouldn't carry over.

Basically I'm just open to trying anything at this point that gets me from point A to B. I applied for a coding boot-camp to see if I can get my foot in the door with that, but once again I don't know if I would still be able to work full-time and support myself WHILE going to this program. It does not seem possible. 

The only reason I am hesitant to give up this job is because of the vacation time I've accrued (it took five years to get three weeks of vacation, and after ten I get four). I have around $11,000 in my 401k from work and 120 hours of PTO. I cannot think of any job on the face of the planet that would accomodate this for me right out of the gate, but correct me if I'm wrong.

I do not want to do retail any more. I didn't go to school to be in retail, but I SURE didn't go to school to sell my soul to the corporate state.",ZetaMarlfox,1,1.0,0,1721869190,2024-07-25 00:59:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ebhxqf/i_cannot_do_this_any_longer/,7,2024
1ebhx6g,Did I overreact with I asked my director for a chat about what was bothering me?,"I talked about two things bothering me. I’m a media manager at an agency and I passed my 1 year a few weeks ago.

NOTE: Director and Manager are different people.

Issue #1: My manager ‘asked me’ to reschedule my therapy appointment.

I told my manager that I was planning to use my one remote day a week on Thursday because I had scheduled an appointment. I live 45 minutes from the office. She said she needed me in office because others are taking vacation days. I wasn’t aware of that.

I told her that I could reschedule but I knew that there was going to be a fee. She told me to let her know what the fee was. I guess this might be where I was in the wrong but I went ahead and rescheduled. I told her the fee and the new date. She said okay. This was all over Teams.

I talk to my director about it this afternoon. She was very nice but asked me why I didn’t just tell them what the fee was before I rescheduled - she was like we could have tried to work something out. But I just… didn’t realize that. So I have this $150 fee and now I’m worried it’s just my fault now. But I was so not under the impression that this request was flexible.

Issue #2: I was told my yearly review would be delayed to sometime next month and when I asked about back pay, I was told they had to let HR decide.

I was talking to a work friend who actually started with the company on the same day as me. I found how his raise took effect immediately and his review is tomorrow.

So I asked my director what the reasoning for his quick review and salary clarity compared to me. I’m being told because my original manager quit 6 months ago, that they are still behind on reviews within my department. 

Okay.. that makes sense but why can’t I get clear answers on back pay standards?

Overall - I was stressed that I was asked to change the appointment, because I was really looking forward to it but felt like I was inconveniencing my team unless I rescheduled. I didn’t know it was flexible.

I feel like I made an idiot of myself. But I was upset, confused, and wanted to understand.",canna-hannah-writer,0,0.5,2,1721869141,2024-07-25 00:59:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ebhx6g/did_i_overreact_with_i_asked_my_director_for_a/,7,2024

They asked me if I've worked at all since leaving, and out of my own stupidty and desparation to get my job back I lied about having an internship for 3 months. 

They wrote down everything I said on a notepad. Will they verify this? Did I just screw myself over for no reason? Will I be arrested for lying??

1ebh6dv,How do I get an employee to improve?,"I work in a sales and events. We recently hired a sales assistant. The role is part time, about 5 hours a day. She handles small group reservations for the most part. And does other admin work like closing accounts checking BEOs. 

The problem is that my director is super busy with large accounts and our corporate team so I pick up everything else she leaves. That’s it. The whole event team. 3 people for a very large multi room venue. 

The problem lies in that both of us are so busy it’s hard to give direction some time. So we noticed this had a meeting with “sales assistant” to provide a daily task list which she forgets to do the smaller tasks on and gets stuck focusing on the larger ones. 

She really lacks professionalism. 
Whispers on the phone she’s incredibly soft spoken with a valley girl accent. Someone left a review saying they spoke to a “brain dead teenager”. She gets people the information they need. It’s just the delivery that needs a ton of work. 

It’s been two months and she’s still asking how to close the accounts even though it’s the same process everytime. 
Shows up to work in crop tops and small shorts and while we are very relaxed on dress code we do still ask it’s tasteful. But its borderline disheveled at this point. 

My director wants someone who can grow into the role and take on more but doesn’t trust her to be able to do so. 

I really like her because she really wants the role and she’s very kind. 
But I’m scared her personality just isn’t for the industry. So I asked my director to let me work with her more one on one and see if I can teach her some more because I feel like we are just giving up on her. 

I don’t know where to start though. How do you get someone to change their personality?",Mission_Switch_3305,0,0.5,1,1721866989,2024-07-25 00:23:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ebh6dv/how_do_i_get_an_employee_to_improve/,7,2024

1ebg8tu,betting on verbal offer or guaranteed good offer,"have company 1 and 2. company 1 has given me an amazing offer letter, with a deadline in 3 days. not faang, but MUCH higher pay than company 2, better wlb and benefits overall. location is less attractive to me than company 2 tho. team is pretty critical to company, decent job security and org contributes highly to parent company revenue. but I think there is less job security here.

company 2, is faang, been 1.5 weeks since verbal offer call and they still have not given the offer letter in writing, and are notorious for taking a long time in doing so. I’ve made the recruiter at company 2 aware of the competing offer and tricky timeline. the org within the company does not have the greatest online reputation, but I think there’s high job security. will certainly boost resume.

i know a verbal offer != offer, so it’s in my best interest to accept company 1 right? there have been horror stories of verbal offers being rescinded at company 2 due to not getting manager approval etc, even tho the risk is low, there is still risk. but company 2 might offer better career mobility, location and resume boost, but given that they are taking forever to get me the written letter— I don’t really see a way I can wait to accept company 2, seeing as I can’t let company 1 pass by and have already asked for an extension (which will end probably before I get company 2 at this rate). I also have personal connections/relationships at company 1, people that have vouched for me and referred me to roles and that might continue to vouch for me at company 1 or at future references, so I don’t want to hurt these relationships by reneging. but I also don’t want to regret my choice of company or limit my future choices, but I’m not sure going with company 2 is worht the cost of hurting relationships/sponsors/people supportive of my growth?

1ebfvvr,Experience mean girls during my internship ,"I started an internship in June. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming but this one girl who is the same age as me has been iffy since I started. For example, my first day when I walked in (I was dressed professionally, work pants and blouse) she looked me up and down. She proceeded to ask me why I would wear that, I responded I was told the dress code was business casual. Since then I’ve been coming into the office earlier than her and my office and on opposite sides of her office so I don’t walk by it but she walks by my office constantly, I’ll be working on the company and she’ll stop in, and say “oh so you’re not gonna talk to me?” This is usually at 8:30-9 in the MORNING. 

Recently she asked me if I was interested in any of the positions available (I already graduated) and I said yes I’m interested in the supervisor position which is an entry level position. Well come to find out her BFF that works there is also interested in that position. Before I told her anything her friend, would talk to me and vent I would try to help where I could and not she is avoiding me. I’m working with her manager everyday and she’ll come into the office and not even say anything or look at me. She also rudely interrupts our conversations. I really liked the company but the original girl I was talked about has ruined my experience. I started avoiding her because within the first three weeks I noticed she stirs up drama and gossip way too much so yeah I don’t go out of my way to talk to her but am I in the wrong for avoiding a toxic person in the work environment when I don’t need to work with them? 

I’m sad because this is just so much drama for an internship and I would have really liked to stay here. They had already talked to me about coming on permanently.

1ebfung,"If I’m absolutely burnt out, stuck and depressed, what should I do?","Ok, I (24yo single male) need advice. Sorry the lengthy tome but could really use advice…

In 2023, I got laid off from my job that hired me out of college (2022 grad). I was quickly able to find work and have been at my new marketing job for 15 months. 

I took a 12k/year pay cut and moved back in with my folks to save money and pay off loans. This job has also been much more basic. My previous job was in a small city whereas my current one is in a blue collar town. While these were sacrifices, I was just grateful to have a job and figured this would be a quick stop over. I’ve made some tremendous accomplishments in my short time at my current company. I’ve driven up sales in all areas, restored the company’s involvement in many civic areas like the Chamber of Commerce and United Way, forged dozens of new partnerships, built tremendous revenue generating events, reduced stagnant costs and driven up CEMs. Everyone at work seems to recognize my talent and drive. 

However, I’ve gotten extremely burnt out. So much so that I feel depressed, am gaining weight and dread going to work. I think this is due to a variety of factors. For one, I’m an overqualified individual in a basic role. Two, I’m in a small town and lack/miss the amenities of a more populated area that I had in college. Three, i used to be a very confident person but have realized that much of I’d has gone. Four, I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs in larger, more appealing markets in the last few months (as most jobs here would be lateral moves) and have had little traction. Five, since moving back home, I haven’t had a strong community around me. Six, the fellow leadership at work can be very toxic at times. And seven which I think is the biggest one… my boss (company’s owner) has recognized my immense talent, drive and capacity and has used it to his advantage by piling on more and more projects and goals that I can barely keep up with without any perks, benefits, or opportunities while still keeping me at a basic hourly employee. My complaints have been deflected or dismissed. As an ESFJ, it probably doesn’t help, especially when I serve a narrow minded individual.

With that being said, these factors have pretty much answered my question: I NEED TO QUIT. Like immediately!

However, I am getting more and more frustrated with my lack of traction getting a new job in a desired market, even getting interviews. My peers, colleagues and community partners all comment how skilled, gifted, mature I am for my young age, well spoken and extroverted I am but I feel like I’m having a hard time showing prospective employers outside of the county I serve my true gifts. Idk if it is the terrible job market, uncertain economy, “hopper” resume or what. I really don’t want to be seen as a job hopper as I want to find something that will give me a stable 5-10 year run at a good company where I can really launch at.

The only reason I don’t quit is I need the money and am a Dave Ramsey disciple. I haven’t saved a ton because I’m aggressively paying off my student loans and made substantial progress. Aside from the student loan and my $350/month car payment, I have no other debt. But I don’t have a ton of money to live off of if I quit. I really need to do something to find a much better role that will leave me comfortable and most importantly healthy. It’s frustrating when I’ve had many people tell me that I am “easily hirable” but that just hasn’t been the case so far.

For context, I have a marketing and religion degree. I would prefer to find a community facing project management/advocacy/economic development/sales/marketing/community relations role. I’ve also been very open to and applied to a myriad of other roles.

I’m a connoisseur of advice so any will be greatly appreciated. Leads are greatly welcomed too! Also, if you possess great wisdom and have a little time, I would welcome a longer conversation in the DMs. In fact, I’d prefer it!

1ebfbhs,"I need advice on changing my career from a call center representative at a breast facility to something that will pay me enough to leave my abusive home, I’ve been entering only dead ends. What careers can I do to move? ","
Hello y’all 

I’m 22 years old, turning 23 in September. In the early years of my adult life, this is a moment where I don’t know how to advance or proceed with career advancement or earning enough money to move out. 

For context, I’ve been increasingly becoming more depressed over the months due to the hardship of moving out. 

I have a physical history with my parents where I’ve been abused by them, my mom would tell me to kill myself and my dad punched me in the face in college. The hardest moments of my life were 17-21 years old. I felt like I couldn’t get out of certain situations, but luckily I did. 

The last time my mom hit me was in December 2023. 

I’ve looked into housing plans but I only found homeless shelters and waitlisted vouchers. 

I tried thinking of university but I wouldn’t know what to pursue and I wouldn’t want to spend 40-60 k a year on something I don’t know and not fully passionate about. I don’t think that’s financially smart. I do want to return to school, just don’t know for what. 

I rarely eat and I just work, go home, work and go home. 

I don’t desire to party. I don’t desire those things. I desire education, my peace, and my happiness. 

I looked into government jobs but since i work full time it’s very hard to try to find something that will suit my schedule(I signed a contract with my current employer that will expire in April for my bilingual services.)

Now I’m not sure what to do. I’m saving at home. Not eating. Not traveling(my dad doesn’t let me)

But I want some advice, training? On how to advance my career so I can earn at least 40k net to move out. I earn 26k net a year. 

Thank you all for any upcoming advice and for listening to my vulnerability 🫶🏻

1ebdtrh,Manager vs Assistant expectations ,"I currently work in an assistant role which frankly isn’t as collaborative as I expected. I have a manager above me however they are so busy that they almost appear to not have the capacity or time to “manage” me or work in a collaborative way. 

When I initially started the role, it was an entry level role which in my understanding means I’d be supported in the role. So my pay is pretty low for the job. 

Initially it was said that I was a great “self starter” but that’s because I had to be because I was getting no direction and just thrown in the deep end. I don’t mind, I’m pretty good at figuring stuff out and showed initiative. The manager left because the workload was too much and a new one came on board - same thing is happening but now I feel like they’re passing the blame onto me. Saying that they are busy and I need to take initiative. 

I’m happy to work through tasks myself, which I do and I am already spread thin. No stretegies have been put in place for me to implement and it’s as though there is an expectation for me to “take initiative” and lead myself. I’m fine with that but at what point am I just managing myself and my manager actually not doing their part and managing me or it being collaborative? 

You are only as good as the direction you’re given - I was once told. 

My point is if I’m managing myself and taking all this initiative and essentially doing the entire role myself but getting paid an assistant “entry level” wage. 

I’m I right in being a little bit annoyed about this comment of me “not taking initiative” because my manager “doesn’t have time” ?

I cannot post this whole story at once… it is too much. I have a very demanding career and family. I *hope* to come back each day to post another chunk of it… but I’m not perfect.
I am seeking advice about some serious workplace harassment that followed me even after I left my job.

Yes- my family knows.
Yes-my current employer knows.
Yes- my previous employer knows (where the incidents occurred).
Yes- there have been discussions regarding police/lawyer involvement.

You - Reddit - are almost the last to know. 

This is my opportunity to hear some opinions while still being anonymous. Though there is a chance I may be recognized in this process, at least I am getting the chance to write my story down… because I have been silent, except to the essential people, up until this point.

As I tell my story, I will exclude certain details to protect my identity, though every day, I feel the reveal nearing closer….
Which I why I am here… trying to prepare myself for how to deal with this situation as it is seemingly inevitably going to unfold. 

I am a female in a male-dominated professional industry. I am highly motivated, competitive, ambitious, and entering the very desirable “years of experience” period of my career. My career is very important to me and I am motivated by appreciation, affirmation and recognition. My supervisor recognized this. Great! That’s how you keep employees. Recognize and engage with their strengths and motivators to keep them satisfied. Unfortunately for me, my supervisor had ulterior motives. 

One day, he started to text me outside of work hours about things not related to work, but not often and nothing inappropriate. I didn’t see this as a red flag at the time, but now I know…. 

He told me that he needed to start promoting me to upper management because he wanted to groom me to take his position in a few years. It was very exciting for me. I started feeling valued, important and like I really had a great opportunity within arm’s reach. In hindsight, I feel like he knew just the right things to say.

1ebcwcm,Interviewing and torn on whether I want the new job,"I have been at my current company for 3.5 years and it is my first post-grad job. I like what I do for the most part and the things I don't like are pretty standard corporate America. For reference, I am a data analyst within a comms agency. Over the past year or two my company has had some restructuring and there have been some layoffs (based almost entirely on performance), including a close colleague of mine, so I have been feeling a bit down about my future here. There isn't any room for a raise and the next promotion cycle isn't for another 9 months. 

I was approached on LinkedIn by a recruiter about a role that sounded relevant to my work and would come with \~30% raise. So despite me not actively looking for a new job, I decided to take the call. I have now done 2 interviews for the position and I am very torn on whether I would want the new job, should they offer it.

My biggest concern is that this would be a promotion and come with more responsibilities that I am not necessarily sure I am ready for. It would require more presenting and client relations which I don't really like. With that said, my next promotion at my current company would also come with a bit of this, but not to the same extent. My coworkers would also already know my lack of experience in this area and will likely ease me into it.

I really like my coworkers and I like my work/life balance. I work fully remote with the option of going into the office and the new role would require at least 2 days in the office. So far the coworkers at the new company seem lovely, and I have a former classmate at the company that seems to like it and has been there for 4 years, so it sounds like it may have a good company culture.

I have only gotten a 3% raise in 2023 and in 2024 (6% total) so a raise like this would be really game-changing for me and I don't know if the pay bump makes up for the concerns that I have about taking the role. 

In my head, I feel like I can't turn down a $25K raise at 26 years old, especially living in NYC. I could really use that extra money, but I had no intent on changing jobs and I don't want to regret passing it up, but at the same time, I also worry that this may not be the right time for me.

Have any of you passed up on a job that came with a large salary jump? 

I also don't want to burn this bridge if I reject the offer because when I am ready to change jobs I do think that this would be a good fit for me. 

Sorry this was a bit long, and there is absolutely nuance in this situation that I can't quite explain so any supportive advice or similar experiences will be helpful to wrap my mind around the prospect of rejecting this new job or leaving my current job.

Jk I lied lol

30 year old looking for some insight and guidance. 

Going back to school to get a degree. 

Stuck between two paths and would like some thoughts or guidance. 

I’ve been working in technical support for just about over 5 years. Never moved up or had the opportunity to do so. 

Currently work as a senior customer service rep doing tech support and payments. 

Worked about 10 years call center on and off. I love it and hate it at the same time. It’s draining but has some perks. 

I’ve been going to college on and off the last 10 years and never got a degree. Some life stuff happened along the way that prevented me from finishing. 

Thinking of going to school for computer information system with a certificate in health information systems. Tech field is so volatile but tech in medical seems more stable. I also don’t want to study for a ton of certifications, they are costly. 

I believe CIS gives a good avenue for a wide range of roles. Anyone have a CIS degree can attest that you don’t need certifications or is it a must?

Other pathway is Radiologic Technology. This was my original career path before getting more into Tech. 

End goal would be Radiation Therapy. 


TLDR;

Computer Information Systems

Some lore:

I recently just left my job due to my manager (let’s call him Alex) being an asshole. He would interrupt me in meetings, ask for my opinion and then tell me “he doesn’t care.” The nail in the coffin was when I asked for a raise. My previous manager (the one before Alex was promoted) said that I would be getting a raise, but after the transition when I asked again, Alex said no because he is “too new.” I have been there for a year and Alex only joined 2 months prior.

The situation:

Alex reached out to me today, 3 weeks after I quit on a my personal email. 

He asked for information regarding my job, which nobody else on the company could do. It was only me and him. He doesn’t have enough technical skills to be able to do it.

He asked for information regarding account access and paying for an account.

Do i ignore? Do i tell him i require a consulting fee?

1ebbfru,How to improve Employability?,"Hello,

I have 6 years of experience in AWS Cloud (Solutions Architect) and some experience in Azure. I am AWS Associate certified and Terraform certified. \*\*I am not interested in coding. \*\*  
  
What can I learn to boost my skills and employability? Would Salesforce Cloud be a good fit for my background? If so, which Salesforce Cloud should I focus on? 

Other options I'm considering are:

- Cloud FinOps

- AWS SysOps

- AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty (though it might be code-heavy but could improve employability)

- AWS Certified Security - Specialty

- AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional (though I still don't feel very confident about the Professional certification)

- Some management courses or further Azure certifications.



Any suggestions?",SonuJacob05,1,0.6600000262260437,0,1721852246,2024-07-24 20:17:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ebbfru/how_to_improve_employability/,7,2024
1ebbccj,Did I mess up by negotiating on a job offer?,"I got laid off last month and finally got another job offer, but the salary is $15,000 less than my previous position. Considering my circumstances and the fact that my industry is pretty saturated (marketing), I feel like I should have just accepted the offer but $15,000 is just too significant of a difference. 

I knew the range was lower to begin with, but my initial offer was $1k less than the minimum listed in the job posting. I felt like that needed to be politely called out. I only asked for a $3k annual increase, which is what I would need to live comfortably with my expenses (personal reasons were not mentioned in my negotiation email), but now I’m worried I ruined the opportunity over a mere $3k. 

I sent the email yesterday at around 5:30pm est and have not heard back yet today. Do I follow up tomorrow morning?

HVAC seems like the better choice but it's hard to find good talent in HVAC. Refacing is much easier I picked it up in just a few months.

1eb9udf,Pregnant and Made Redundant!,"My wife has been a chef for many years, with the past 12 in head chef and management positions. She’s great at what she does, super talented, kind and patient with teaching and super creative. 

This past month we’ve just found out she’s pregnant, no one knows yet as it’s early days, she’s also just been made redundant as the owner of the restaurant she works at has decided to close the business and retire.

She’s since been offered a number of roles from past colleagues and people within the industry, but she really doesn’t want to go back to those brutal hours and hard days whilst being pregnant. It’s almost a huge relief for her.

We’re looking for recommendations for industries or roles that may be suitable for her skill sets. The following are of interest:

- working as part of a team on a communal goal
- creative input and problem solving
- not too labour intensive
- will understand and support maternity
- something that will help and contribute to the community

I understand many people around the world don’t have the option to just pick something new to do, but we’re lucky that we are in a position where I can support us for a short time until she finds a role.

I really want to go into engineering and mechanical seems very interesting to me, but whilst being great at physics I am only average in terms of maths I'd say and from what I have heard maths is something you jave to be strong at for mechanical engineering.

My parents however want me to stay here but I know they will be alright with me leaving if I get a good scholarship in a good country.

Here pursuing engineering isn't great because government job is the only way for stability and the education is also not that great.

Any engineers, or doctors that can weigj on pn what path i should take. Im open to any advice.

I am having an issue where my confidence, mindset, or what have you, something mental. Where I feel like I am hitting a wall and am stuck in an area of development needed to achieve real success. It seems to me everyone that’s truly qualified that I’ve known in management is able to “act” a certain way where they convey that they are someone worthy of authority, respect, and it doesn’t matter if they’re “nice” or not.

1eb4mwv,"My boss just got fired. I just had a meeting with her boss, a C-level executive. Trying to understand how to feel about it","A bit of background - I was hired for this current role, as a senior consultant in our department, back in September by my ex-boss (as of yesterday), the Director of the team. This is a fairly new department and both my Director, and her boss, the CRO, were hired around the same time (end of 2022) to build the department out.

From what I hear, they had been butting heads from the very beginning. And I saw it in action many times when I joined as well. They both have fundamentally different ways of doing things, and different personalities and it just wasn’t working. To go into it in detail would take multiple pages but suffice to say that they really disliked each other.

It got to the point where they had started complaining to HR about each other. It was just a really toxic situation and me and my colleagues were caught in between.

I will say this - my boss was very good at her job, and mostly nice to us. But she was also kind of narcissistic and had a tendency to push back and fight on everything, and always believe how she was doing things was the right way. She would frequently fear monger and tell us that we might get laid off, or we’ll be replaced with AI, or outsourced or whatever else. She would constantly be hatching these plans to try and get rid of the CRO in some way, none of which obviously came to fruition. She would constantly be creating a “us vs CRO” environment. 

She didn’t really consider the impact of her actions and just did a lot of impulsive stuff. One of the big ones was that she reached out to our parent company’s CEO - so essentially the boss of OUR CEO - directly and asked if there’s a chance her team could report to the parent company instead of her boss. Apparently this rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. 

But for the past couple of months, it seemed like the tensions between her and the CRO were simmering down a bit. They still hated each other but it seems like they were at least grudgingly working together without constant tension and fights. I thought things had settled down a bit

Then we got the bombshell. Long story short - boss had been out of office for the past week citing an illness, with no communication whatsoever with us. Then suddenly yesterday, we get a meeting invite from the CRO, and he tells us that our boss is effectively no longer at the company. We didn’t get any details on what happened. I messaged my boss on WhatsApp but didn’t get any details from her. No one seems to know what’s going on - but it does seem like the CRO had finally gotten tired of her for good.

Now I’m concerned after this meeting, that my job is in danger, because I received an email from the CRO stating that he wants to do a one on one with everyone on the team. I’m expecting the worst, that I’m gonna get my ass fired as well. Cause honestly I wouldn’t have put it past my boss to tell the CRO that we were only loyal to her or something. 

I personally have a pretty cordial, professional relationship with the CRO mostly because I don’t interact with him much.

So I walk into the meeting today and to me surprise, I’m not fired. Not yet anyway lol. Basically the meeting was about the CRO wanting more detail on what projects I’m currently working on, and what I have coming up. He wasn’t involved in the day to day of what we do but while we search for another director, he wanted some updates. We also talked about what roadblocks I’m facing and how he can help, and what my future career goals and growth plans are for the team. 

He mentioned that he has a different vision than my director for the team (no shit lol) and he’ll need my help to implement it, and the work I do (which is a lot) will be vital. He also mentioned that what happened with my director is isolated from our team as a whole, and we’re not part of the overall decision and that we don’t have to worry about our jobs. It’s going to be business as usual with some changes on how we approach things.

Ultimately I know that these are just words and he could be lying through his teeth. Things might get ugly later on as well. The problem is that my ex-boss spent almost everyday telling us how bad the CRO is. 

But I guess it doesn’t sound as bad as I thought it would be? 

I’m still going to be applying for other jobs just in case, because I’d like an exit plan in case something goes sideways. If an opportunity comes up I’m getting the hell out of dodge.

I didn’t disclose too much but I happen to receive a msg on LinkedIn by a recruitment agent on the same day, he is wondering whether I’m still open to new roles that might become available soon. 

Since I already had an offer, I thought of my co-worker and screenshot that linkedIn message, forwarded to my co worker and simply ask” should I refer to you (name of agent)”

Fast forward today, I was called in by the company director to a meeting saying I breach one of the company rules which did exist btw.

1eb24ay,"Demoralized after reorg, now reporting to mentee","I’ve been at my big tech company for over 10 years. I’ve spent all 10 years on the same team, doing the same type of work. Over these 10 years people have come and gone, I’ve been the only constant. At one point, there was a reorg where the team was disbanded and I was the only one left keeping the lights on on our projects. Throughout this entire time, I’ve signaled that I have 0 interest in management. As a result, we hired externally a new manager to run the team. Since they were new, I invested a lot of time and energy helping them learn what the team does and setting them up for success. And for 1-2 years, it was just me and this manager and we developed a strong professional working relationship.

Over time our team’s responsibilities grew, so we started to grow the team. I was heavily involved in the hiring process, and of the folks we hired, I helped onboard them and unofficially took on mentor responsibilities. Around this time I was promoted to staff level as well. The team growth continued on for a few more years, and we’re now a team of 10. This team has been successful on many levels, and I feel like I played a crucial role in leveling up the team. In return, I’ve always felt appreciated, as my manager and colleagues leaned on me for support. I’ve always thought of myself (perhaps wrongly in hindsight) as my manager’s right hand man.

However, I learned recently that our team’s getting reorged, with a new management layer under my manager. I was disheartened to hear that I won’t be reporting to them anymore and they’ll be my skip instead. Even more so, my heart absolutely sunk when I heard that one of my colleagues that I mentored is moving to manager, and that I’ll be reporting to them. What really rubbed salt in the wound was when I found out a few others on the team will still be reporting directly to my current manager.

Am I wrong to feel this way? I know it’s technically not a demotion and it’s kinda my fault for not wanting to manage. But it really fucking stings to think that I’m getting buried deeper in the org chart, under a junior that I helped hire and mentor, even to this day. They’re a very capable engineer, but I’m not convinced they’d make a good manager or leader (I recognize that’s not my decision to make but would greatly affect my own job/career). I’m also concerned I’m losing impact and visibility. 

Is there anything I can do or say without burning any relationships? I really want to ask if I can continue reporting to my current manager instead, but that would be awkward regardless of answer for all of us. Or should I just swallow my pride and suck it up?

1eaz0va,Internship problem. Help,"Hi I am 20, and I am currently doing an internship in London in Data Science. The internship length is 2.5 months. My boss got me started on a large global financial dataset of transactions(TBs). He had an idea in mind and wanted to do a regression analysis on this data. He assigned a person to ""advise me"" maybe? Anyways, I worked on this data; however, the coverage is so bad for what they need—aka not my issue. 

The person I am working with and I supposedly told my boss, and we three met with the team who collected this data. I worked on this project, did the coding, and did a presentation with the issues I faced and my questions. For context, my boss was on leave for a month before the meeting. However, when the meeting started, the person I am working with started talking instead of me, but it's okay, I don't care; I am usually very quiet. However, when he got to the point where he needed to ask my questions, he phrased one of the questions wrong and I waited for him to finish what he was saying. The person from the other company was confused, and I needed to clarify since it was my question—however, the person I am working with tried to put his hands over my mouth, but he didn't really touch me. It was very weird. 

After that, my boss started thinking of the next steps we could take. However, my colleague told him that he would work on it and try to get me engaged with the work. He said he would try to explain what happened to me again, and if I didn't understand, he would go back to the old school and teach me on the board. It was very, very humiliating because I truly did everything they asked me to do. And of course, after the meeting, he told me to do what my boss suggested. And I did it! 

 my boss is now neglecting me. He doesn't respond when I tell him good morning, he doesn't say hi when he sees me, and he doesn't invite me to the team lunches and seminars. Meanwhile, he invites the other interns on my team. He even invites people from other teams but neglects me. He even comes to say hi to the other interns in my block and doesn't say anything to me.

1eax79e,Need help on life,"Hello everyone. I'm lost in life and in desperate need of some advice on what career to pursue.

To provide some background on myself, I'm in my mid-20s, graduated from a top-ranked university with a physics degree, and have no applicable skills, no work experience, nothing to put on my resume or linkedin. I was obsessed with prestige and college name-value in high school, and worked my ass off in high school to get into a famous college. As a result, I got into a top-5 school to study physics. After fucking around for 5 years, I've since realized that a degree from a good college won't magically bring me economic freedom and success.

I hated physics while I studied it. It was a major I chose because I was good at it in hs, and I've never really had a passion. I've always thought people who were obsessed with one thing were enviable and I've tried reading and diving into different fields, but I always ended up losing interest before really gaining depth in any field. I've done internships in programming, but felt like I would be behind everyone who had an undergrad/expertise.

Will I be able to start from the ground up now in say, medicine, or AI and be competitive in the job market? Am I too late? What can I do? What direction should I invest my effort in?

I crave success, I feel like I have above-average intelligence, I have a decent work ethic, and at this point I just need some advice on converting this to a stable career. I apologize for the hectic post, and I realize this probably just sounds like I need someone to make my decisions for me. Thanks for reading.

After graduating, I decided to pursue my dream of working in a professional kitchen, which I've been doing since the end of 2021. However, I now feel it's time for a change and a better work-life balance. I want to return to my field of study, whether that’s as a front-end web developer, UI designer, or graphic designer.

Here's where I need your advice:

1. **Skill Refresh:** It’s been about 2 years since I’ve coded regularly. How can I effectively refresh my programming skills, especially in JavaScript, React.js, and other languages I’ve learned?
2. **Job Hunting Tips:** What are the best strategies for someone like me, who has a gap in their relevant work experience, to start applying for jobs in the multimedia/design field?
3. **Portfolio and Resume:** How should I present my work experience and freelance graphic design projects to potential employers in the tech/design industry?
4. **Certifications or Courses:** Are there any specific certifications or online courses that you would recommend to get up to speed with the latest trends and technologies?
5. **Networking:** Any tips on how to network effectively in this industry, especially after being away from it for a while?

I’ve done some freelance graphic design work, so I’m still comfortable with tools like Illustrator, but I’m worried that getting back into coding might be a challenge.

I’d appreciate any advice or resources you can share to help me make this transition smoothly. Thank you in advance!",bryan-vm,1,1.0,0,1721812883,2024-07-24 09:21:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eax0lk/seeking_advice_on_transitioning_back_to/,7,2024
1eawhaa,Finance & MIS Degree… Don’t know what to do pls help,"I’m a rising senior in college, getting a double major in finance and MIS. I have a pretty good GPA (only get As and Bs), have some leadership positions in a sorority, and am in finance clubs.

I’m having  really hard time figuring out what I want to do career wise. Everyone tells me my major is a very smart move considering technology is the future and always advancing. But I just don’t really know what I want to do. I’ve gotten some hirevue interviews at J.P. Morgan for Investment banking and asset management but i don’t know if that’s the smartest move based on my MIS background as well. I don’t want the MIS to go to waste and then I never use it and lose the skills. 

I really am open to working anywhere in any field, I more so just want to get my foot in the door somewhere. I just need advice on what I should try to pursue. My problem is I’m well prepared but I don’t know what I want to do. I’m not like tunnel visioned on any career path but I’m afraid this makes me look uneducated and unmotivated to recruiters. But it’s just the truth. I’m open to working anywhere doing anything, I just want to learn and figure out what I enjoy. At the end of the day I just want to work somewhere where I enjoy the people I work with, the environment, and the pay is good enough that I can live semi comfortably. 

If anyone has any advice on a career path they think someone like me would thrive in, PLEASE let a girl know!!! ",Delicious-Status350,1,1.0,0,1721810744,2024-07-24 08:45:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eawhaa/finance_mis_degree_dont_know_what_to_do_pls_help/,7,2024
1eawcly,wanting to die but not wanting to commit suicide,"I believe it is normal for many people to think about wanting to die from time to time. I usually think about this 3 to 4 times a week. I talked to a pre-screener, and we made a kind of suicide prevention plan. She recommended an intensive outpatient program and medication. I honestly think they want to make money. I told them I didn't need that kind of therapy, and I disagreed that wanting to die means committing suicide. I am 40 and unemployed for 7 months. Applied more than 90 applications, 10 interviews, and 10 rejections. Everyone who told me to help me to find a job has ghosted. I only got paid for 130K, while my friends or colleagues who studied together for 200K. Also, I was one of the worst graduate students and got criticized about my performance. during my Ph.D. training. I never got any praise or any credit since coming to the States in 2012. I was never excited about my achievement at all. Just life sucks and I don't want to do anything. I didn't have any social activity since 2015 because I didn't have enough money to hang out. I love my wife and my son, but I keep making their life tough. There is no reason to live. But I am not brave enough to commit suicide. I want to know all of you to continue your life.

1eavz71,Renew Contract Advice ,"I started working as a contractor at a tech company (M***) for about a year now. My boss and I are cool, we talked about a lot of stuff and also been through a lot of shitz as well. That why I've been working my ass off to support him and try to gain experience as well.

My contract is about to end in 2 months and my boss started to acting really nice lately, he messaged me to have 1:1 meeting with me to check on my well being and gave compliments about me to the new team members (he gave compliments about me before, but never in front of me tho) - I know he doesn't want me to leave the team and also want me to sign the contract for another year. But working on this team really not give me any promises that I will be promoted or converted to be an FTE - even though I really work my ass off on this position. I know I can gain experience in the end, but I also don't like the feeling of working on something that I will never have it... It just meaningless...

1eav5t8,Quitting a job after a week and a half?,"I'm 22, I have a degree in Translation (I speak Portuguese, German and English fluently, Spanish at an intermediate level) and just got my Master's degree in Languages and Business Relations in early July so I could branch out and get some type of office job since translation isn't a very stable field right now. I was in 3 selective processes before I even finished my curricular internship (after sending out 12 applications). I got selected by all 3 companies and chose the one that offered the best pay and was closest to home - I rejected the other two. I believe I had a good experience applying for jobs because I speak German in a country where there's decent demand for it.

My curricular internship was a pretty terrible experience and it gave me a lot of anxiety right away but I stayed and ended up regretting it and feeling stuck. Now, I took a job as an Accounts Payable Trainee for the shared services center of a big multinational company and that awful anxiety is back. We have to process invoices all day from companies all over the world and cross-check a bunch of information on SAP, while also correcting mistakes and sending them back when necessary. I had the wrong impression of this job and, because they wanted a German speaker, I did not think 99% of my work would be sitting in front of the computer entering data and processing invoices, along with a big team who does exactly the same as me. It feels like we're a bunch of trained monkeys in a room, trying to process hundreds/thousands of invoices daily without leaving a backlog or making errors so we can hit our weekly target.

I really dislike this, as I was hoping for a job with more communication and writing. I am also not interested in finance at all and don't understand what I'm doing half of the time, even if I can technically perform the simple tasks I'm being given initially. Sure, I will come to understand more and more of what I'm doing but if I never intend on properly learning accounting, what's the point in staying here? 

I just don't think this is for me and feel like I'm wasting my time again. I want to cry every day before and during work, I have to hold back tears constantly and don't even talk to my colleagues despite the fact that they're very nice. The transition to the 9 to 5 lifestyle also has me a bit depressed, especially because most of my friends are enjoying their summer holiday right now and haven't started working yet. 

I honestly think I need a break, I'm burnt out and it was a mistake to start working right after graduating and finishing a terrible previous experience without giving myself time to breathe.

I'm worried I may be making the wrong decision and have wasted 3 opportunities that came my way because I'm sad about transitioning to ""adult life"" but I genuinely feel completely sick to my stomach at work, can't eat right, don't have any desire to learn the workflows or the accounting basics behind it.

My parents have told me they support me and that I should do what feels right. I live with them (most people my age live with their parents in my country) and wouldn't have to worry about expenses (although I will likely still feel guilt). I'm thinking of taking some time to myself and getting a job around September, since a lot of companies close in August.

I was really hoping to work a job that involves contact with clients or having meetings (but isn't overly high stress like some sales jobs) and that possibly allows me to travel to represent the company in trade fairs abroad, for example. Or any job that involves writing, creativity and communication. Just anything that isn't so mind numbing and feels completely foreign to me - I want to work a job I can understand fully.

Is this a realistic want? How can I go about quitting my current job and what should I look out for next? I'm thinking of speaking with my supervisor first and apologizing, then talking to HR and coming into the office to turn in my stuff. I feel pretty bad about doing this to them but I truly feel physically ill.",troubledlittlestone,2,0.6700000166893005,3,1721805312,2024-07-24 07:15:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eav5t8/quitting_a_job_after_a_week_and_a_half/,7,2024

I am an 18 year old fresh out of high school, I graduated thankfully after all the stuff I had to go through in my life but I don’t really know what to do next. I feel like my sister was the brains of my family but she kind of threw it away by getting married really quickly, yknow good for her but she could have really made something for herself and I don’t want to make the same mistake. I did intro to programming during my freshman year in my school which hard but I got out with an A, I then tried doing C++ programming after only doing Java in intro to programming. That was a living hell and I had to move so I didn’t finish the course but I was able to make it out with a C- even though the other students in that class were a grade above me and knew previous programming languages like Python. That class really discouraged from pursuing programming I was looking into App Academy but not so sure about it after they fired a really cool recruiter I was talking to. I also am really good at drawing I did a really big career search into that too but I found out you don’t really make money for a living unless you work for big companies and even then I don’t have a very good portfolio as I just draw manga and anime stuff, I’m pretty much a living copy machine that doesn’t trace so I’m not experienced in background or any logistics in art like three point perspective.

1eatwav,"Tech Company is paying for my online MBA but I have no outlined career trajectory at my current job, how can I maximize the benefits of this?","As I mentioned, my company is paying for my 
MBA no strings attached, at a US top 100 university ( definitely not a t10 school though).

My company is pretty liberal about paying for continuing education however I do feel I am hitting the proverbial career target wall at my current company. There aren’t and will be no leadership openings for many years and even if there were I’d be at the bottom of considerations due to seniority. 

For reference, Ive worked at a giant international global 100 tech and entertainment conglomerate in a division that has a lot of mainstream clout for five years. For 3 of those years I was criminally underpaid due to starting as an intern but I finally caught up to 90k in a vhcol city. 

 I have a couple high value industry awards, some respected publications featuring me and my work, and 5 huge mainstream media projects to my name. Two of which I had a lead credit on. My job title is similar to artist but a little more specialized and I work a lot with specialized platforms, tools, and am regularly coding and scripting, though do not consider myself a programmer by ANY means.

90k in my city is slightly above surviving wage, and not quite thriving. My goal isn’t to stay in my current job position, I’d like to quite honestly pivot to something else in tech but I’m not quite sure what to look out for. I figure this MBA is a good opportunity to pivot but I quite frankly don’t know what I qualify for. I enjoy working with people but not quite sure what kind of job I could get to maximize this potential. Any thoughts welcome.

1eatn42,Advice on college/career decisions,"Hello everyone,

I want to preface this by saying that I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity to go to college regardless of the rank and to pursue cs as my major and I really hope I don’t come across as some annoying brat.

I’m currently a student at a top 100ish school that’s next to a tech hub and I previously went to community college which helped me save up money and attend my first two years of college for free basically. I choose this option rather than going to a few top 25 schools that I got admitted to as senior in high school because I thought it would be smarter despite these schools offering me very generous aid packages (only realizing how generous they were now in retrospect). After finishing up my last year of community college I applied once again to these same schools and was only able to get into my state flagship 4 year college which is ranked top 25 college and they gave me a very good aid offer as well and would’ve set me up to be in a better position for my future with the alumni network, career opportunities, and friends I had attending this college (all highly motivated students that I hung around during high school)

However, I choose to goto a communter college that’s ranked about top 100 and to be honest my college experience pretty bad thus far. Part of my reasoning for going here was because I believed that it would be easier to get more opportunities for cs being closer to a tech hub and that since my tuition would be lower I’d be in a better situation financially living with my parents. It turned out I was pretty wrong in almost every aspect.

In terms of financials, for some reason, this college just had so many bs fees that they added on to despite being a commuter college and the amount I am paying is almost equivalent to the amount I would’ve been paying at the better ranked university. My living experience at home has been pretty bad as tensions between my parents and family have worsened and it’s constant arguments that I get dragged into. Additionally I’ve been struggling to find like minded indviduals that want to grind as its a bit difficult already coming in as a transfer (not saying they don’t exist but just that its harder) and the friends that I do have at this college from highschool don’t really care much about school. My grades have also kind of slipped too due to other family complications and things going on which makes me think that staying and thugging it out at this college is probably my only option but thus kinda burries me deeper into regret. btw I'm heading into my senior year at my current college 

So after all that, I guess my question is what should I do from this point on? I know that the past is the past and that really the only way to get over my bad decisions is to live in the present and learn from my mistakes, however I’m just not sure whether it would be best to stay at this college or try to transfer or maybe even take a gap year or something.

I apologize if this came off as me sounding like a brat I'm just really confused as to what to do because I don't want to make another bad decision and continue with regret. I just wanted to just get this off my chest as I’ve been thinking about it a lot and tbh I feel a lot better after writing this out. 

TLDR: regret choosing a lesser ranked university when I got into a few top 25 ranked colleges and have been misreable ever since.

Option 1

90K salary

40K bonus guaranteed the first year and after the first year its 1.5% on anything above 150K on my monthly sales, 

1.5K Extra bonus on every account landed all year round. I can bring in easy 8 accounts per year

I am familiar with everyone working at this particular company. Very good environment to work in, great company reputation. Company expects me to bring in above 300k in sales monthly after 12 months. Im currently at 380k monthly sales where i currently am.

My first year guaranteed ill be at 130k bonus included but after first year ill be guaranteed only 90k plus whatever i can bring in.

They carry the same products as where i am currently working so it will be an easy transition for my current customers who most are willing to follow me.


Option 2

150K salary with a 5 year guarantee of employment

15K sign on bonus provided first week after start date and 4% on anything i sell above 130k a month

Family owned, owner does not have the greatest reputation. Company does not sell the brand i am familiar with selling but owner stated he does not expect me to bring any of my current business since he wants me for the long term, and he will help me by giving me accounts already set to feel comfortable getting my numbers.

I wasn’t the best at high school, I graduated barely and I have no interest in studying anything because school was hell for me and I have no interest in going to uni. 

Some background info here. I am both living with my parents and my dad works at a FIFO job and my mum is a property manager. They are both extremely hard workers and have been in the same field of work for 15 years, and they want the best for me. And every time I bring up how much I dislike my job they always say ""Deal with it, no one likes their job"", ""That's just life I'm afraid"". I fucking HATE these phrases and I don’t think life is about hating your job is it? 

I have a very weird interest in aviation and I would love to do something working in the aviation industry. I would love to be a flight attendant but I’ve heard they don’t get paid very well, and I’m afraid I’m just going to be stuck at this dead end office job because I have no interests. I just feel I am very lost in life.",Throwaway97547997,2,1.0,2,1721791093,2024-07-24 03:18:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ear9jx/lost_in_life/,7,2024
1ear71z,Tell me what to do with my life!,"Hey y’all. So, to start obviously I want to point out that I know there’s nobody here who can actually tell me what to do with my life. I guess I’m just looking for some impartial opinions on me xt steps I might follow.

I am a 36-year-old married female, I have two kids ages five and 16. I also am pregnant with twins currently. I have a good amount of college credit, but no degree as I’ve dropped out (more than once). I have been working in insurance claims since 2017. I’ve worked everything from taking new auto accident claims to now working in liability/bodily injury. Specifically, when an auto accident happens it’s my job to work on determining who is at fault, and extend settlements to people if our insured caused them injury.

There are aspects I love about it. I love that I use my brain, I love that I’m helping people who have been hurt. I love that I make okay money, about $62,000 a year. I also have a LOT of flexibility - I work on a salary basis and I only need to work about 25 hours a week to get everything done. I also work remotely and I’m able to have my kids home with me instead of at daycare. So, there are HUGE benefits to staying where I am. 

But I just feel stagnant and stuck. I wish I could help people more - but jobs that help people don’t really pay well (teaching, social work, etc). I wish I could make more money, but jobs that pay better typically don’t offer the kind of flexibility and freedom I have. I wish I could stay at home and just be a mom, but that’s not possible given the economy and our family’s needs/my husband’s income. 

Am I just having some kind of midlife crisis? Do I need to suck it up because I’ve actually got it pretty good? Or is there a way that I could be making similar/more money while helping others AND having the freedom and flexibility I have now?

Be blunt with me - tell me what I need to hear, not what I want to hear. And thank you. ",RainbowUnicornPoop16,3,1.0,6,1721790872,2024-07-24 03:14:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ear71z/tell_me_what_to_do_with_my_life/,7,2024
1ear0f3,How do I continue working in my office when I feel unwelcome there?,"In terms of my performance, I have gone above and beyond, and my direct team praises me constantly. Even the VP of our group has praised me. However, none of them come into the office regularly, yet I must go in once a week. In the beginning of this job, I was placed on a floor by myself, but when the VP learned I didn't have any neighbors, she and my boss moved me to a different floor so I could be ""social"" with a group of girls around my age. This is where my problems began.

First, I was given a desk that two of these girls were using for event storage. So they had to move all of their boxes out, and I'm sure they complained about that. I apologized many times and offered to help but they said no.

Then, the facilities guy - we will call him Bob - complained to me about being forced to move all of my items (that I had packed in two storage containers per Facilities' request) to my new desk. He kept repeating, ""Why would they put you on \*this\* floor?""

Then, I decided to try to be social, which my boss and the VP clearly expected of me, so I made an effort despite my natural introversion. One of the girls said many times that she would invite me to her shared calendar in which they all list the days of each week when they'll be in the office, but it took her months to share it with me, and only after another girl noticed I wasn't part of it. Once I joined, I noticed that they stopped listing the days they were coming in until \*after\* they'd already come in. It felt like they didn't want me to come in when they did, but I tried to tell myself I was overthinking things.

I attended a few Happy Hours, and some incidents where I felt like one girl in particular, who openly claims she is autistic - we can call her Anna - was being especially rude to me, but I told myself it was just because of her autism (which she openly claims to have without any questioning). I confided in another girl, Gina, who I think is the nicest, that sometimes I feel like Anna doesn't like me. Gina said, ""No, she's just autistic and rude without realizing it.""

Last week, Anna, Gina, and I were in the office on the same day. Anna said she volunteered us for a work event next week (which will be this upcoming Thursday). I didn't mind, and agreed to attend. At one point during the day, Gina had disappeared into a private room for a meeting. I had an industry-specific question and asked Anna. She and Gina have both been in this business for a few years now. She said, ""I have no idea. You can Google it."" I felt embarrassed and made a mental note never to ask for her help again. Later, as we were all walking through the lobby, Anna mentioned how she gossips and spills tea with her coworker, Tom, every morning, and they s\*\*\* talk everyone at work. She paused, glanced at me, and said, ""But not balletbouquet."" I found that odd. Then, on the way to the subway, we were all chatting, and I expected us to stop at the entrance and chat a little more before saying goodbye. Without a beat, Anna barely looked at me over her shoulder and said, ""See ya' when I see ya."" Gina shot me a mortified expression and said, ""Bye"" apologetically. I smiled and waved but couldn't help but think that Anna really doesn't like me.

  
Flash forward to today. I came into the office, surprised to see Anna. It was just the two of us today, but she had not put her name on the calendar, so I didn't know she'd be here. She seemed a bit nicer today, until Bob came to collect everyone's trash. He greeted her with a big bear hug, as usual. Bob bear hugs every single girl in our section except me. Honestly I wouldn't want to hug him - he's old enough to be my father, and I don't hug coworkers upon greeting - but I would still like to be treated with kindness and respect. He just ignores me entirely. When I first met him, he smiled warmly and we chatted in a friendly manner, but ever since I was moved to this floor, he's treated me with disdain.

When he came to collect my trash, I was buried in my laptop and didn't notice at first, as my back was turned. He didn't say my name or even a single word. He just made a ""tsk"" sound until I turned around. Then he motioned to my trash can under my desk, frowning at me. I moved out of the way and waited politely. He picked up my trash can, and as he lifted it, a rolled up piece of paper fell out. I had received two boxes that week from the mail room, so I flattened them and laid them on the top of the trash can, and a piece of trash must have gotten wedged in between. 

He rolled his eyes and glared over at Gina, who was LAUGHING and giving him a look that said, ""I know, I hate this girl."" I immediately asked them both, ""Where am I supposed to put my boxes if not in the trash can?""

Gina stumbled over herself. ""Well, normally the rest of us toss them into a pile on the floor, and then eventually Bob takes them...""

Bob interjected, ""No, you know that's not true! You guys flatten them and lay them out on the cabinet here."" 

But I had never seen any flattened boxes on the cabinet before. I had seen piles of empty boxes, and I thought that was less considerate than flattening them and putting them on top of my trash can for the facilities team.

Bob then snapped, ""It's fine"" when clearly it wasn't fine to him, and left my now empty trash can in the middle of my cubicle. I was so upset, I couldn't focus on work anymore. I closed my laptop and tried to control my tears. Gina came over and pretended to need some pens, then returned to her desk. I packed up my things and left, not even saying a word to her, until I was halfway past and she said very cheerfully, ""Goodbye!""

Later, as I was sitting on the train, she texted me, ""Hi there! Don't worry about Bob, he can be an ass. I legit never talked to him until Anna started coming in.""

I never replied. A few minutes later, she added, ""And thanks for all your help today!"" We had worked on a project together.

Now I have to go into work on Thursday - a day I normally never come in - just to help with an event she volunteered me for.

But honestly? I am tired of spending time around people who clearly don't respect me.

How do I handle this?

TL:DR: I sit near mean girls (who are not on my team). How do I continue coming into an office when I feel so unwelcome because of them?",balletbouquet,1,1.0,0,1721790290,2024-07-24 03:04:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ear0f3/how_do_i_continue_working_in_my_office_when_i/,7,2024
1eaqk6p,"I have an intro interview for a Financial Advisor position with Northwest Mutual this week; what questions should I ask? Is it even worth going through with? 
","

For context, I am currently a Private Equity Business Developer for a small firm. I’ve been in this position for a little over a year. I’ve been successful in my position, but I want to change careers for multiple reasons. I am looking to become a CFP, and I believe this is the best path I can take to get there. I have an introduction interview coming up and wanted to know what questions I should be asking. I was thinking;



1. How can this role assist me in becoming a CFP?
2. How is the pay structured? (listed salary from $80k-$110k. I’m guessing it's commission. I don’t have a problem with that, but I would like a decent base pay as my current job is also commission-based but enough of a base to survive)
3. Benefits included



I’ve read some things online about how it’s a front for insurance sales instead of true financial advising. While I do like sales from the current role I’m in. I do not want to sell useless products to people I know that I know they don’t need. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

1eapa7q,Benchmarking in Financial Analysis: A Simple and Friendly Guide,"Hey everyone! Let’s dive into the exciting world of benchmarking in financial analysis. Whether you’re just getting started or want to refresh your knowledge, this guide will make it easy and fun. Plus, I’ll tell you where you can find more detailed info.

# What is Benchmarking?

***Think of benchmarking as checking your performance against the best in the business***. You compare your financial metrics to those of industry leaders or standards. This way, you can spot areas to improve and set realistic goals.

# Why Use Benchmarking?

***Benchmarking helps you measure your performance***, learn best practices from top performers, and set achievable goals using industry standards.

# Types of Benchmarking:

There are different types of benchmarking, including:

***Internal Benchmarking*** (comparing different departments within your company), ***Competitive Benchmarking*** (comparing with direct competitors), and ***Industry Benchmarking*** (comparing with industry averages or standards).

# Sources of Benchmarking Data:

You can find benchmarking data from various sources such as ***industry reports, financial statements of competitors, trade associations, consulting firms, and government publications***.

# How to Perform Benchmarking:

To conduct benchmarking, ***start by identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) that matter, collecting data from your company and competitors, analyzing and comparing the data, and finally implementing necessary changes based on your findings***.

# Real-World Example:

Imagine you run a coffee shop and want to benchmark your profit margins against the industry. If the average profit margin is 20% and yours is 15%, benchmarking helps you see the gap and explore ways to improve, like negotiating better prices with suppliers or tweaking your menu pricing.

# Dive Deeper with My Handbook Curious to learn more?

Check out my handbook, “**Financial Analysis Fundamentals”**. It’s packed with easy-to-understand explanations, practical examples, and exercises to help you master benchmarking and other financial analysis techniques.

In “**Financial Analysis Fundamentals**”, you’ll find detailed guides on various types of benchmarking, step-by-step instructions for conducting benchmarking, real-world case studies, and practical tips.

1eap94w,Need recommendation for a good job search workflow,"Hi all.  I've been following this workflow for job searching.  5% of the time, I get light feedback from recruiters.  95% of the time, I am ghosted.  

1.  Revise the resume (based on feedback) 

2.  Apply to job (via company's own ATS or whichever system is used) 

3.  Wait around 1-2 weeks.  In this time, research in details about company and connect with potential employees on LinkedIn.  On LinkedIn, I do not mention jobs, just casual conversations. 

4.  If no replies from ATS, try to connect with HR on LinkedIn or ask a connection on how to follow up.  

5.  If rejected, try a different job, revise the resume and go back to 1) 

The problems that I face are: 

- Step 3) and 4) feel like I am in limbo or even  No Man's Land.  A lot of the time, nobody wants to connect or worse, the connections are accepted but any casual follow ups are ghosted.  

- Between 3)4) and 5), I feel like I am wasting a lot of time.  Some.companies take +4 weeks to give any feedback, some take +4 months.  There are some that already accepted a candidate, but do not give any feedback.  So you are stuck not knowing if you are rejected or not, until you manages to connect with a HR.

Also, if anyone has any advice to help look for work I would also appreciate it.

I'm aware that having graduated over a decade ago I'm rusty on my skills which isn't going to help me get a job. If anyone has advice on courses or similar that i could look into so that my resume isn't dismissed immediately, I would appreciate it.

Some of it has been more recent factors, some of them were issues she had brought up that I had accidentally did a year ago or so and she is at the point where she doesn’t think I should stay here and has said that this would be my final warning because these were issues that I’ve consistently forgot to do like “turn the AC on” and I do blame that it is my fault for getting distracted for talking to talent or other coworkers and just not being 100% focused.

It hadn’t helped that my brother had a serious medical issue where his hand got blown off about a week and a half ago and was only given about a day or two to process but had to come back to work to help assist sessions either.

1eanvo8,"Feeling dread, unfulfilled and lost. Is life the same for everyone?","TL;DR graduated, worked for a year, feel it’s all pointless. Am young and all I want to do is experience the world, but no money. Now what?

Last year I graduated college and was hired onto the same clinic post co-op placement. I have been there ever since, learning and working my way towards becoming a well rounded veterinary nurse. Got a car and have tried to save a little. Life was merely okay for the first 6 months post grad.

Since then, I have discovered the toxicity of management and how little pay veterinary nurses earn. My coworkers who have been in the field 5-10 years say that it’s the same situation at every clinic you go to. Bad managers are everywhere though, vet clinic or no, so I am trying my best to fight through the bad. But I feel like I am not making a difference in the pet’s lives, which maybe you would while volunteering. But I am not making enough money to make up for feeling unfulfilled either. If I made more, maybe I wouldn’t care as much about feeling meaningless. I feel like a tool used to make the clinic owners money, but never seeing any of it myself. Classic problem in the world I suppose.

With the current cost of living I will never be able to support myself without a partner, let alone move out of my parent’s basement… because of this I am feeling quite hopeless. Almost “why bother working hard if this is all I will ever have” sort of feeling. I dread having to go into work now, which is a feeling I eventually get in a lot of jobs. I’ve done banking, food service, retail, now the veterinary industry too. I am simply not enjoying life. I’m not sure if this feeling is normal for the working class or if I need a change.

What’s kept me going since the new year is a very strong desire to travel the world—for an extended period of time, 6 months to a year, but despite trying to save some money I still don’t have nearly enough to go. I probably never will. I don’t want to waste my life away working and then be too old and sick in my retirement to travel the way I’ve been dreaming about. If I’m even able to retire at all…

I also don’t have a clue what I would do if I were somehow able to go on this life changing adventure, and then come back to be in the exact same position I am in right now. I have considered joining the military, going back to school to become a human anesthesiologist- I adore monitoring anesthesia for pets at work. But I’m jaded after working in so many industries and feeling the same way in every one.

I’m worried no matter what I do for work I’ll always feel unfulfilled and stuck. I’ll never be able to enjoy life and never be able to retire. I’ll work and live a miserable life in near poverty until I die.

So what do I do to get rid of these feelings? Is this normal? Am I actually stuck and this is just how life is?",TheNeighbourhoodDog,1,1.0,0,1721781055,2024-07-24 00:30:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eanvo8/feeling_dread_unfulfilled_and_lost_is_life_the/,7,2024

1ean8kt,This Position Was Set to Fail,"Title says it all. I started a new job at a later-stage start up as a project manager a couple of months ago.

The company is a complete mess, there is absolutely no foundational process (no business or overarching ops whatsoever) and many people with institutional knowledge and historical context are up and leaving.

I’m being asked to focus on one team, but the team doesn’t have clear boundaries and a lot of what they do seeps out into other teams, so I’m touching a lot of the company… and did I mention I’m the ONLY project manager at the company? That was news to me.

1eamwxi,Good performance evaluation/angry VP,"I work at a Fortune 500 company and I've been in my job for 1.5 years.

My current manager is great. She's wonderful to work with. She just gave me a solid mid-year performance evaluation last week. She's been with the company 18 years.

I'm convinced that our new VP doesn't like me. He doesn't appear to like my answers to his questions or the way I approach projects. This is a majority of the time but not all the time. 

My question: Can the VP push me out or fire me if my evaluations are good? Or is there typically a process to do this. I've never been warned or disciplined yet.

1eamqgv,How important is it that Title matches responsibilities?,"For the past 2+ years, I’ve had responsibilities at the Director level. I attend all Director meetings, have an organization under me, responsible for my discipline, and in internal organization charts am labelled as Director.

However, my official title in our system in Manager. All other Directors are officially Directors.

It doesn’t impact day to day, but I worry for my future job prospects, on a working history check, my title would be Manager. Potential future employers could think I inflated my experience?

I’ve raised this to my boss, and generally they’ve said not to care etc, and it will get sorted soon. I haven’t asked for a promotion (at this stage, it’s kinda embarrassing that I’ve been doing the role for 2+ years to get a promotion) but I’ve asked to have my official title reflected to match my responsibilities.

While many organizations offer parts of these services, no organization offers all of them. I have an app in development (a perk for the Indiegogo Campaign), and I'm working on a phenomenological workbook that will also be available as a perk.

1eal10s,Advice??,"I recently graduated college with a BA in Art and set myself on track for a career in graphic design. I knew the job market was going to be rough, however, I wasn't expecting it to feel this impossible to even get a foot in the door. Remote opportunities especially are saturated with 100+ candidates applying immediately within an hour or two of a job's posting. For those kinds of job offers, I typically don't hear back. I've had a better response rate when applying to places locally, however, there are hardly ever any graphic design positions available around me.

I spent 2 years working as a part-time digital office assistant at school (where I helped with graphic design and office tasks), so I began looking into office assistant jobs. I just interviewed for an administrative assistant position at a wallpaper and textiles company, but when I shared my creative abilities and interests with them, they suggested I instead consider their role as a production assistant. That career path would lead to greater creative advancement into their company as a color specialist or color design artist. 

I don't know the results of my interview yet, however, I learned that there may be plenty of hidden pathways into niche creative fields that I may not be aware of or realize I'm qualified for as a graphic designer.

I'm not at all picky about what kind of job I can get, I want to maximize my chances of getting a job in the next couple of months. My resume is pretty solid outside of the glaring 1.5 year gap.

  


What's the best way to frame this situation on my resume? Should I claim that I took a gap year? Should I leave it blank and say that I've been applying for a year and a half without any luck? Should I claim that I was considering an alternate career path (this one is actually somewhat true)? Obviously no explanation of my situation is ideal, but I want to get the biggest edge possible for landing an interview.

  


If I could get the insight of any hiring managers that happen to be here that would be extremely helpful.

Hi! So I’ve just graduated from university in International Business and want to get into project management.

I’ve looked on TotalJobs and Reed etc and there is a programme to be a trainee IT consultant which includes the PRINCE II qualification but they are saying only if you want to to be a IT consultant for which I don’t but the role still involves project management.

I do have a Project Management Ready certificate from Project Management Institute and did a JPMorgan Chase & Co. Agile Job Simulation on Forage, all of which are on my CV.

I’d appreciate if you could link below in the comments some job openings to relate with this based in Manchester by the way.

1eahbne,Therapist thinks employer might be violating FMLA,"I went on full time FMLA back in April and have been on part time FMLA since late May due to debilitating grief experienced from the death of my mother. My therapist wrote on my FMLA form that I get overwhelmed by continuous demands at work and need time to rest, and am susceptible to intense anxiety attacks.

Ever since I came back, my boss has been only negative about my work performance and hasn’t been giving balanced feedback and ignoring good feedback I get from peers. It’s one of those managers where you could have good feedback piled up, but if you get anything that is perceived as a shortcoming, it requires a meeting about not achieving expectations. My anxiety makes it difficult to work with certain people because their personality/work style can be intense, but that doesn’t seem to matter. Yesterday, I was told by HR that my position is getting reclassified from exempt to non-exempt and told me that I was not meeting expectations because a manager told my boss that I had to go back and fix something somewhat small on a project. I have personally gotten nothing but good written feedback from everyone else I have worked with, but of course that gets ignored.

I kind of vented to my therapist about this and she told me to consult an employment lawyer because this type of intense treatment from my boss could be interfering with the symptoms outlined in my FMLA form and that changing my job from exempt to nonexempt could be considered “changing” my job, when my job is supposed to be intact while on FMLA.",throwawayhhjb,1,1.0,1,1721764497,2024-07-23 19:54:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eahbne/therapist_thinks_employer_might_be_violating_fmla/,7,2024

1eafzrk,Should I ask for a raise?,"Hi, short-time lurker, have a compensation related question.

I worked for 4.5 years in real estate private equity acquisitions prior to starting my most recent job in March.  Prior to starting, I spent about 8 months from August ‘23 to March ‘24 unemployed due to the end of a 2-year contract coinciding with a downturn in the real estate market.  I ended up getting a job with a state economic development agency helping them do financial modeling for affordable housing, starting salary at $103k (negotiated up from $95k), and no bonus (typical of public sector work).  This is a steep drop from my previous PE job, which paid $150k base + $130k bonus.  I was fine with this salary when I signed on, since a job was better than no job, and the opportunity to work on affordable housing/mission based work was important to me and something I was willing to give up some salary for.  Plus the work life balance has been much much better.

Since I started, I’ve been asking for more work related to LIHTC properties, and my supervisor gave me the work of someone who recently retired, which involves screening applications for municipal bond issuance capacity from cities and counties around the state.  Some of these are housing projects, but a lot of these are just low interest business loans, and the work has been much less technical than I previously thought and hoped for, and it involves a lot of printing memos, folding them into envelopes, and sending them out.  Before taking on this work, my supervisor (I think mistakenly) emailed me some correspondence he had with HR, where they discussed hiring a new person for this “bond” role, which they had budgeted $125k for, $25k above what I currently make.  I am doing the bond work in addition to my normal financial modeling job.

I am thinking about asking my boss for a raise to $125k.. given I am effectively doing two jobs, and the second job hasn’t shaped up to be the career-advancing kind of work I was hoping for, and the team had budgeted more than they’re currently paying me for the work I’ve just taken on.  I’m hesitant to do this because I’ve only been at this role for 5 months, and part of me thinks I should just stick around for a year at my current salary and then leave, since I think I could be making $150k+ doing real estate in the private sector.  This new “bond” job also isn’t a ton of work on a daily basis, probably takes 2-3 hours each day, and I think HR probably over budgeted for it.  What do y’all think?

For one, I don't get much recognition for the day-to-day -- and amongst my colleagues, I can't point to any specific ""artifacts"" that showcase that my work is meaningful. Moreover, I don't get a lot of praise from other partners at the firm (who are a level more senior than me). It feels a bit lonely and unrewarding at times.

It's really the first time where I don't have any ""peers"" to commiserate with, no definitive work output to hang my hat on on a daily basis, and not a lot of positive feedback. It feels like all of the aspects of a ""middle management"" doldrum that is often chided.

I'd like to hear from others who have faced a similar transition -- how did you manage it, and what have been ways to stay motivated and positive?",michimoby,1,0.6600000262260437,1,1721761285,2024-07-23 19:01:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1eafzj4/transitioning_from_ic_to_managersenior_leader_how/,7,2024
1eafxx9,Incorrect job description in Workday linked to incorrect salary,"I recently found out my teammate/co-worker with the same job title as me and same pay grade had a 20% higher salary. She just left the company. We were both Senior Specialists. She was hired a year after me, and I come to find out the job description she was hired under was different than mine. Her job description listed more senior responsibilities and the qualifications required more experience and a stronger skillset. 

Obviously I found this very peculiar, so I go into Workday and notice my job description is for the Specialist role, NOT the Senior Specialist role. My job title and pay grade have always been accurate, and my offer letter lists the right job title, but I just realized the job description is wrong and the job title are wrong within that JD. I'm beginning to think that my initial offer from this employer was tied to the specialist role, and that's why I have been making 20% less. I looked through my personal emails and noticed the job description attached to the initial phone screen was also for the Specialist role (NOT Sr. Specialist). Should I contact HR to let them know my JD is wrong in Workday? How can I use this situation to my advantage? I think I've been getting underpaid for 3 years due to HR mixing up job descriptions!

I recently got an offer letter from a company doing exactly what I want to do. However, I was a little confused when I saw the salary. They were offering minimum $56,000/yr before taxes, but in the offer letter they told me $47,500.

  
I am a recent college graduate (Supply Chain Management) with no real work experience in supply chain outside of my internships. On top of this, the company is pretty small and doesn't offer heath insurance, but offers other standard benefits like 401k matching and PTO. One thing they are offering to me is a $5,000 check to help with moving expenses, as I am moving across the country. How should I negotiate my salary? I am thinking I can accept, but after 1 year of employment I want the 47,500+5,000 in my next year's salary, plus 2% of that. What do you think?

1eaesv2,Said no to a jobs and I heavily regret it. What do I do?,"Hi People,
I had received a job offer a month back which was supposed to be an onsite job. I negotiated and since the team really liked me, they made the role remote for me with intermittent (monthly) visits. They were also ready to sponsor my visa after an year of joining which I negotiated to 6 months post joining. However, my friends and other people advised me to prioritize stability over money and I said no to the offer citing personal uncertainty, because that felt right in that moment though I did feel like I would regret it because of the skills I would have learnt in that organization. I have been regretting my decision since the past 6 weeks and I decided to reach out again and see if the role is still open. I emailed the recruiter and didn't get back a response. I tried calling her yesterday evening but she didn't pick up the call or call back. It was late around 4:30 pm if that could mean she didn't pick up because she left early from work. I am not sure if I should reach out one last time to the recruiter or to the Senior Director of the department via LinkedIn who has really liked me and was vouching to onboard me. Maybe the recruiter is pissed off at me and didn't convey my re interest to the team? Should I try reaching out to the Sr. Dir directly via LinkedIn and ask if the role is still open and express my interest again? Or is this a lost cause and I should just give up.

I’ve been in the supply chain realm for two different companies for the last 5 years. I am extremely burnt out, I’ve been applying to other supply chain jobs for different companies thinking it’s the company’s fault but deep down I feel like the corporate world isn’t for me. I don’t feel fulfilled and am finding myself dreading going to work each day. I feel stuck because my degree is in operations management and the thought of going back to school right now doesn’t seem possible (I support myself and my partner on my salary, she just got laid off so we are on one income right now, even when she is working she doesn’t even make half of what I’m making). If I could go into a new field it would be potentially environmental law or environmental engineering, but that means going back to school.

1eaehu9,"Should I stay at my current job, or should I take a job offer for much less money but with the possibility to be happier?","Hello! I (27f) work as a PK assistant (no degree) for one of my local school districts. I currently make a little over $17 an hour and work M-F 12-6pm (we offer an after school care at my location). I love my job... for the most part. The students and their parents are fantastic! I love spending time in my classroom and really enjoy the overall environment of the school. The only real problems I've had are two of my fellow support staff. 

There was a lot of cattiness in my department last year. Rumors were spread, my feelings were hurt. In the end they even refused to communicate with me about student needs and behaviors from the earlier shift. I felt ostracized. I was convinced that I had suddenly lost my ability to teach and communicate with others., I was miserable, and our supervisor at the time (who was since fired this summer) did little in attempt to stop it. It got to the point that my job was negatively affecting my marriage and my health. 

**For context, I was in a horrific car accident last year and during my recovery time I wasn't able to do as much as I was in the past. I also was in a much more down mood than my normal cheery self. This became a problem and suddenly all of my value was lost after less than 2 months. I have apologized for my period of changed behavior, but it has not made a difference. I have not received an apology or an acknowledgment.**

Flash forward to now. School starts in a couple of weeks. We have a new supervisor that could really change things within our program. I've tried very hard to stay positive about this year being a fresh start. That was until the other district in my area offer me a job today. 

When I first got the call I was so excited! They really made me feel wanted and appreciated with praise of my experience. I found out the elementary school in need of an assistant is closer to my house by 15 minutes. They also told me that the hours would be 7am-1pm, yay! Then they mentioned salary... $13/hr. My heart sank. I explained that I really couldn't drop that low, and they understood. I was told that they have proposed a 15% salary increase, but the school board wouldn't be making their decision until July 30th. More importantly though, that it wasn't a guarantee. 

Now I'm extremely conflicted. On one hand I think I would a lot happier at this new school. I would have a lot more creative freedom and would feel more accomplished dedicating my timd to at-risk youth. On the other hand I don't know if it's worth a $4 pay cut for a chance at happiness.. especially in this economy. My husband says to do what makes me happy, and we will make it work. Looking at the budget he's right.. but we also want to start a family soon. 

What would you do? 

TLDR; should I stay at my current job where I have been treated poorly over the last school year, or do I take a major pay cut and go somewhere I could possibly be happier?

1eacst8,Approaching contract/1099 work and boundaries?,"I recently started a job as a (long term) 1099 contractor. I was looking to make a career shift and this is a great opportunity. Because it’s exactly what I’m seeking + good pay, I’m willing to 1099 and not get benefits, vacation, etc. I’ve had to purchase my health insurance, professional insurance, etc. I’m okay with this and can write off on taxes, etc.

However, I’m new to 1099 and trying to get used to being a contractor, especially when it comes to hours and remote work, etc. I have WFH for years and this job is in office and about 30-40 mins away. It’s a small staff and I’ve essentially presented myself as a team member and overall, follow the hours, norms and trying to onboard myself, etc. 

Because I don’t any benefits, I’d like advice on how to set boundaries/the cadence in this job. For example, I told in writing that I could WFH, although they prefer folks in office. I am happy to go into the office normally, but I’m ideally seeking 1-2 WFH days a week and would save on commute. Also useful if I want to combine taking vacation while working billable hours.

I just don’t know if it’s “too soon” to ask for WFH…or do I just inform them since I’m not an employee. Everyone also takes a long lunch and if I was at home I’d prob just work through it. And when it comes to sick days, taking vacation, etc…how should I go about this?

Overall, just looking for input on being professional and show my good work and be a team member, but yet also to protect myself and not being passive/walked over. The staff and my “supervisor” are relaxed and seem flexible, but I also worry I’m rocking the boat too soon. Any input would be great from current/former 1099s. Thanks!

Now im not looking to become the next CEO or pave a new path, I just wanted a career that was way less stressful and paid the bills.

I felt the initial offer was a bit meh for NYC considering my qualifications and the local market, but if they had met me in the middle at $125K I would have accepted it. Again, I think more than anything I was surprised they weren't willing to play ball and they just immediately pulled the offer without discussion or countering. Perhaps they found someone they liked more in the 48 hour span between the time they made the offer and the time they rescinded. 

But did I mess up?\* Did I get too greedy? Was it unreasonable for me to expect them to at least meet me in the middle between their initial offer and my counter? Looking back on it I should have just countered $125K, but hindsight is 20/20. 

\*I acknowledge that it may be tough for you all to answer my question without more information about my qualifications and the role and such. I think I'm just looking for general impressions as to how this went down.

1eaaurx,"Is Advertising a good major, and what careers would it complement?","I am transferring to another university next year for an advertising/art direction program (communication school) after spending two years at another studying marketing (business school). My reasoning for the switch is I want something more creative. I thought I would find that in marketing, but it was very analytical. I'm more of an artist. I wasn't happy in marketing, and after participating in internships, I felt the work didn't seem fulfilling. But I had this photography gig for a bit and loved it. Drawing, painting, and designing in general are things I've always felt in sync with. I think this could help me with art direction.

I haven't heard too much about working in advertising. Any honest thoughts on the work environment/average day? (spare no details) What could I do with an advertising degree? I felt kind of misunderstood as a creative in business, and I want to work alongside creative people who value artistry.

Background on me: I'm very visual, patient, perfectionish and love a challenge, but I am not naturally book-smart unless I study.

1eaao19,Vicious Cycle....,"Looking for solidarity, advice, help fixing my outlook on my career and life!!

Background: I've been working in the corporate world since 2012. I've held a ton of different jobs working for healthcare companies. I have worked in customer service on the phones all the way up to a good paying job now in account management. I've worked for a very large and now pretty small company. I've gotten a promotion with each new role I've taken and have probably held 6-7 different positions over the 12 years - marketing, communications and now account management. 

  
Issue: Every time I'm 1-2 years into a role, I find myself looking for something new. It doesn't really matter how great my team, job or boss is, I feel like I get the ""ick"" and want something different. I thought moving to a smaller company would help but here I am almost 2 years into a new company/position and I'm starting to look around passively. I KNOW the issue is with me. I get bored, frustrated and have a hard time feeling like I really care about the work I'm doing. I get pretty cynical about working for companies as I know I'm just a small fish in a big pond and really I could leave tomorrow and it would have no impact on the company. I hate working with people who are try-hards and put their work before their family, health, happiness. I hate faking like I like and respect people at work. I'm sick of brown-nosing and the politics that come with working for corporations. I just feel like I need a new perspective on the corporate world. I have a great salary, benefits, work from home full time and I still just have this kind of empty feeling like what am I really doing with my life?! I can't fathom the fact that I'll be doing this for the next 30-ish years?? So what's the answer? Try to find a job doing something that feels meaningful? I'm just scared that I would take a leap into a totally different career path and feel this same way just with less security, pay, healthcare, etc.  Is it that I need to throw myself into a hobby in my free time and feel fulfilled outside of work hours? Will it ever get better?! I'm worried that it comes down to the fact that I just don't know what I am really good at or love to do and I've tried so hard to figure it out with no success. 

  
TLDR: Looking for some tips on those that feel fulfilled with their work and proud of what they do everyday - what do you do? How'd you come across that path?

**Why am I doing this?**  
I believe in structured, practical learning. My experiences taught me that having a mentor is crucial who can make the learning process more engaging and effective. Having managed without a mentor myself, lectures often felt boring, and understanding Data Science from slides alone was challenging. Additionally, I found that affordable and practical options online was severely lacking. Most tutoring options were expensive and didn't provide the hands-on experience I needed. Code Kaisen is my way of giving to students (like me) and to assist you to gain practical experience and avoid the scattered, confusing path I took.

**Why Study with Me?**  
I've been teaching Data Science for the past 2 years. Within six months, I was awarded a super tutor badge on an online platform that I started teaching on. I have taught over 1,500 lessons and contributed to over 500 successful student projects, assignments, and theses. I have completed no less than 10 courses related to Data Science.

My success with teaching motivated me to aid more students, leading to the creation of [Code Kaisen](https://codekaisen.com/).

**Why Data Science?**  
Data Science is exciting. It is among the most thrilling fields of the 21st century, letting you turn raw data into valuable insights. Many companies want to hire data scientists. They can assist them make informed decisions. The demand for skilled data scientists is soaring, and there's no better time to get started.

**Bootcamp Details:**  
**- Starting:** 3rd August 2024  
**- Duration:** 4 Weeks  
**- Schedule:** Weekends (Sat & Sun), 2 Hours Each  
**- Timing:** Will be set by popular demand. There may be multiple batches at different times.  
**- Format:** Live online classes with interactive Q&A sessions

1ea9fmn,Help in regards to job and law school.,"Ok. I am not really sure what community to share this with but I am stressing so I am typing this at work. I am the sole EMT at a summer camp, and this is my first contracted temp job (the pay is actually really good, I just got my bachelors in May btw). 

I am also going to law school in the fall, and have had plans for this particular school since they accepted me and my dream school waitlisted me. So, with their orientation, I was only going to have to leave the job like a week early, which I feel like isn’t the biggest deal. 

Until today, when my dream school just reached out and accepted me! I am over the moon obviously, and did not expect this AT ALL (I am way below both their GPA and LSAT medians), so I didn’t think to bring it up during my onboarding, and its been radio silence for months! Anyways, their orientation starts at lotttt sooner, and I would need to leave work an entire 3 weeks early. 

I, personally, am not passing up this opportunity and will be going to my dream school. It is just under 3 weeks from when I am set to start orientation and I need to quit my job!!! I have never had to quit before so that is adding a little extra stress, and being the sole EMT here, they keep emphasizing my importance and I have not been able to get off work at all (that is a whole other thing). 

I work in a huge metropolitan area and am a part of a community with access to over 750+ EMTs, most who would be more than willing to get work and steady pay for 3 weeks, except my boss is very hesitant in hiring outsiders, especially for 3 weeks (which is super fair!).

1ea8dxy,I'm up for a new job and it has me scared to death. Can I get some advice?,"Trying to keep this brief - in 2022 I was the Media Director for a mid-size advertising agency. To be honest, it felt like I didn't quite have the experience for the role, but they offered me the job and the pay was too great to turn down. I felt I did a decent job with what I was given, but the agency's problems went much further than anything I was empowered to change or fix myself, if I even had the experience to do so. The team I inherited was already disillusioned with the agency and almost all of them left to other jobs, saying it had nothing to do with me, they just felt overworked and underpaid. At 7 months, the stress had gotten to me too, so much so I broke down and cried in the middle of a hotel room on vacation just thinking about going back, and despite the owner and the rest of the senior team really liking me, I had made the decision to leave...

...and then I broke my pelvis in an accident in Europe. Then back in the States last year, I had to have a hip replacement. All at a pretty young age. I've been unemployed for 2 years. My parents have been floating me, and I've been looking for work since January to no avail. I was hoping for a Manager role, or a part-time role to get my mind back in the swing of things.

I'm now in the middle of the interview process for another Director role. The pay is great, it's remote, they seem committed to work-life balance. I'm just terrified.

I can't tell if I'm terrified simply because I haven't had to work in two years, and having someone own my life again stresses me to all hell, or because I'm simply not qualified, or if I just have imposter syndrome. I'm trying not to get too far ahead of myself here, but I'm sitting here sick to my stomach on a Tuesday morning thinking about how I'm maybe just a week or three away from constant stress again.

Working has to happen, my parents can't support me forever, I need to pay the bills. But I don't know if I'm making the right move, doing the same thing again and expecting different results.

1ea35y5,Grad School or do I transition from Academia to Industry with Nanopore Sequencing Experience? (28M),"Hello everyone,

I’m looking for some career advice and would appreciate any insights you might have. Here’s a bit about my background and current situation:

* **Background:** I have an MS in Biology and have previously worked on diverse projects, including bird and bat acoustics, plant-pollinator interactions (MS thesis), and plant-soil microbial interaction ecology (briefly, post MS). Unfortunately, none of these projects have yielded any publications yet. Recently MS thesis related publication was rejected.
* **Current Role:** For the past 11 months, I’ve been working on a clinical trial project involving stool microbial analysis of cancer patients using Nanopore 16S sequencing. I’ve become quite skilled in this area and have been working hard to optimize and standardize both wet lab and bioinformatic workflows. Despite my efforts, the trial has not yet begun due to poor planning by advisors and systemic obstacles within my institution.
* **Previous Setbacks:** I had to drop out of my PhD program at Michigan Tech, resulting in a 1.5-year gap in my career which already had a gap of 2 years since my masters due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Given these challenges, I’m at a crossroads and seeking advice on the following:

1. **Career Path:** Should I consider transitioning to the industry where I might have better earning potential and possibly more structured support? If so, what types of roles or companies should I be looking at with my Nanopore sequencing experience?
2. **Job Search Timing:** When is the best time to start applying for new positions? Should I wait until the clinical trial actually begins or move on now?
3. **Leveraging Skills:** How can I best leverage my current skills and experiences, including my work with Nanopore sequencing, to make up for the career gap and lack of publications?
4. **Any Other Advice:** Any other advice or perspectives from those who have navigated similar transitions would be greatly appreciated.

1ea2yak,Pivot with a MS?,"TLDR; Any recs for a MS that sets you up for a well-paid and enjoyable career?

Hi Folks, thank you in advance!

Context: I graduated from a public university in SF Bay Area back in 2020 with a Biochemistry degree. Since then, I have stayed local and broke into Biotechnology a few years ago at a startup. I worked in strain engineering (microbiology) then bioprocess development (engineering) at the same company. I have since been laid off and am interested in figuring out the next step I should take. It has been a few months of not landing a job, and I have had time to reflect more in what I want. I am interested in committing to a field or industry that pays relatively well (>150k after 3-5 years, depending on COL) but still feels somewhat stimulating and enjoyable. I do not think that R&D is going to do that for me, so I am considering going back to school - which leads to the heart of the question

**Are there any MS programs (preferably online) that sets you up in an industry/role with a good salary trajectory doing stimulating work? Ideally something that does not require a ton of experience on top of a MS in order to get paid well.**

Further information

* I have been looking into data science programs (MIDS from UCB and OMS from Georgia Tech), I think it could be interesting to bring those tools back into biotech, or perhaps something to do with sustainability or helping the environment.
* I have strong interpersonal skills and do not mind working under pressure, so sales has been on the radar but I have difficulty getting a sales gig with no experience in the current job market.
* The main reason for wanting a high salary is due to being my first generation immigrant parents retirement plan. My interests include science, sustainability, robotics, and working with people.
* I am willing to do something completely different if it matches up with those criteria listed earlier.",FeSheik,1,1.0,0,1721724585,2024-07-23 08:49:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ea2yak/pivot_with_a_ms/,7,2024

1ea2w06,Need advice on things that I can pursue as a side hustle. Performance Marketing vs Social Media?,"Context:

I've a main job where I work as a Performance Marketing Manager in one of the biggest fintech companies. It is a well paying job.

But I've always been a guy who likes to experiment or build something on the sides. This was true even before I stepped into college. I used to build Instagram theme pages & sold them off in the US for a higher price. Made decent income out of 20-30 pages that I created at that time.

Since I started my first job I quit everything and focused on getting corporate experience and worked in different startups. Finally moved to performance marketing as a career where I run Google & Facebook Ads for a fintech company.

Question:

Now since last year, I started a twitter account where I reviewed phones. Bought multiple phones and posted reviews. Got over 89M+ views in one year and 20k+ followers. The account is doing decent but at the same time I've to spend a lot of money to purchase these products.

I've a young family with 1 year old kid. And that is why I am having double thoughts if I should keep pursuing this. Like this requires constant investment of money and returns are minimal at this point. But the upside is that once brands start to approach, this might become a really good side hustle.

On the other hand, since I'm already a Performance marketing professional getting started with the content game and linkedin and getting a few clients wouldn't be much difficult. Only issue will be managing the headache & pressure of meeting the monthly targets.

As of now I'm very confused if I should keep building twitter & investing in products for a long term gain or start off my performance marketing thing to start making some income right away? The money earned from here might even surpass my main job in next 6 months.",babubhaiyaa,1,1.0,0,1721724326,2024-07-23 08:45:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ea2w06/need_advice_on_things_that_i_can_pursue_as_a_side/,7,2024

Please note that I am **not** looking for advice on how to get software development jobs. I graduated 7 months ago and I have yet to get a single job interview. I really don’t care which alternative career I choose at this point. I just want a job where my degree has either got my foot in the door, or it’s of some use. Otherwise, I would have wasted the last 6 years of my education. I’m not being picky.

My main issue is that I only have retail experience and an ongoing four-year employment gap, which makes writing a resume exceedingly difficult. I simply don’t know how to write a resume given my lack of experience. My current resume only has my education, technical skills, and software projects sections. I struggle to fill a page. The bulk is the projects that would be irrelevant for alternative careers. Like what would I even put down?

Obviously, I first need to know the jobs I can feasibly get. I just don’t know what else my degree could be used for. It doesn’t need to be in tech. I just want to work towards a more desirable job/career as opposed to the same part-time menial jobs I worked out of high school. I can’t support myself with these jobs.

1ea1qpf,Am I missing the point?,"Hi all,

I work for a small, but growing college (USA). My role is primarily a backend support role for new student admissions. I've been here for 5 years, and generally enjoy it, though my boss and I don't always mesh well.

My performance evaluation is scheduled for this Friday. I hated how last year's went, and I'm not anticipating much different this time around. 

The goals they set for me are always things that sort of set me up to eventually be a recruiter. Marketing, public speaking, and community outreach are the general themes.

None of that has anything to do with what *I* want to do. If I were smarter, I'd be in IT. I'm most comfortable, and I thrive, when I'm behind the scenes. I genuinely enjoy learning new processes, building additional context behind the work I'm doing, and I would love to be part of some of the new initiatives the school is pursuing.

But each year, when I write something to that effect on my performance evaluation, the response is to push me back into those other things, because it's where I have the most room to grow. Last year, the documented response was something along the lines of ""We acknowledge his desire to learn X, Y, and Z however we feel he should instead do A, B, and C.""

Is my autistic brain missing the point here? I mean, I totally get that I'm just a pawn, and my job is really to be utilized where they need me.

1ea1nx5,I ghosted future employer after accepting offer letter,"I am in an assistant role in organisation I. I had been offered a job after I interviewed on 8th April 2024. My notice period is 90 days(India). I discussed with my manager on 16th April for my resignation but didn't send mail as he asked me to wait till his boss came in office on 30th. He tried to influence me emotionally to wait for 6 months as he was going through a crisis and his wife had a major surgery recently. Meanwhile future employer let's say N) was mounting pressure to get early relieving as asked to my potential joining date. I gave buffer of 1 week and told on call my joining would be 23rd July, thinking I could manage them for 1 week. But I asked them to be flexible with joining date on the mail I sent to them.

When superboss came back, the next day they promoted me(same work, just change of role name) and gave 15% hike letter, while I had repeatedly told by manager earlier not to promote me. Now as I was under pressure I didn't want to resign the same day as the promotion mail was sent to whole office. I took two more weeks to finally muster the courage to send resignation mail on 16th May. 

After that I got to know the true behaviour of my manager. He is constantly coming up and asking me every hour where I was going and making jokes aimed at me but not directly to my face. I didn't have the courage to ask for buyout or early relieving because I know my managet would object and wouldn't provide it because whole of lab depends on me.

Now because of late resignation my notice period got shifted later by one month and the replacement they found for me took 15 days leave as she had to undergo surgery as well. Because of this my manager constantly harassed me to extendy notice period by another 15 days and said he will tell the HR to do that. Which again made by final relieving date to 30th August.

Because of this I thought the job offer from N would be gone and I foolishly ghosted their attempts to reach out to me thinking the opportunity is lost. But they called me with different number yesterday and asked what was going on? So I made and excuse and told them I would call them later as I was in a meeting. But I don't have the courage to explain the whole situation to them because of the fear they wouldn't understand.

I know what I did was very wrong. But what would be the best way to respond to N as a human and not in a give me the job kinda way. I thought they must have a backup plan and would go with other candidate.

This was my first job change experience as I joined this MNC straight out of college and have been here for 7 years.

They fired me today unexpectedly for that incident. I'm still in a little bit of shock, so I'm trying to process what I need to do next. 

A little background: I started at this bank as an intern in May of 2023, had my internship extended, and was then hired/promoted to a full-time analyst in November. I finished my bachelors in December. 

I'm thinking it might be difficult to land a job given that I only have 8 months of analyst experience, however, while I was as intern I was pretty much doing all analyst work. So in reality, I have 1 year and 2 months of experience.

1ea04e9,"25F immigrant from HK to Sydney: from teacher to waitress to business owner, what career advice would you give?","I am a 25F from Hong Kong, currently living in Sydney. I graduated with a degree in sociology, although I don't recall much of what I learned during those four years. My secondary school life was uneventful and focused solely on studies, and I struggled with effective study techniques. University acceptance rates were around 20% in HK at that time, so I tried very hard to get into uni. However, I wasn't good enough to choose a professional course, or I didn't realize I needed to.

Uni is where I finally started to understand myself, left my family to live in the dorms, made real friends, and developed romantic relationships, while my peers might have been thinking about careers and doing internships. I always felt that I grew up later than others. Coming from a lower-class family, I had to be financially independent since graduating high school, which meant no internships or exchange programs, and working part-time throughout the 4 years.

I only realized that I needed to get a well-paid job in my final year, or I only faced the reality at that time, as I would need to support my family after graduation. I give my parents 10% of my salary, which is a responsibility for Chinese children if their parents are not wealthy. It was a life-changing moment when I scrolled through job-seeking sites and found that I didn't have the skills required for most jobs. I doubted what I had done in the past 4 years.

I eventually became a teacher at a local primary school with a poor reputation for treating its employees. I don't have a diploma in education (it was too competitive, and I didn't get in consecutively for years). I knew it was somewhere that would accept me, as teachers with choices were not willing to work there. I managed to earn 50% more than other soci graduates, allowing me to support my family and save money. That year was mentally tough, but I saved about 13K USD in my 1st year of working, enabling me to move to Sydney after dating my current partner, a 23 uni student from Sydney.

I had always wanted to leave HK due to the high housing prices, political issues, and general stress (e.g., I wouldn't be able to afford to buy a home even if I worked my whole life, and I would need to live with my family until 30 to afford renting a home). In Sydney, I started with a working holiday visa and worked as a waitress. I often doubted myself when I was cleaning tables, washing dishes, etc. In a few months, I transitioned to being a barista, moving between different cafes and restaurants to secure better pay. I also started studying child care and began working as a child care educator. Eventually, I became a cafe manager and educator, sometimes earning as much as I did as a teacher, but the physical demands became too much.

When I decided to switch to a student visa from a WHV, my first priority was physiotherapy, as I was desperate for something professional. I remember the hopelessness when I was looking for a job. I also chose physio because I am into weight training and am a certified personal trainer. I applied to around 10 uni, and 9 of them got back to me, with half offering scholarships. However, the fees were still huge, around 160K USD over 4 years. I cried a lot during that period when I tried to apply for loans from every credit card or bank account I had. It was still not possible, and I had to give up on the chance that I thought could change my life. I ended up doing early childhood education, which is not something I particularly like, but I love kids, and it was what I could afford. It came with stable job opportunities that might be better than being a waitress or barista in some sense.

In the past six months, I started a small lingerie business. It's a very small operation that I run by myself. I recouped all my investments by the 2nd month, and my monthly revenue is now around 7K USD, which is more than I earned working 5 days a week as a cafe manager. The best part is that I work for myself, and the job isn't physically demanding.

Now, at 25, I'm facing a quarter-life crisis. Sometimes I am teary-eyed thinking of myself as mediocre, but I have tried my best throughout my life. I don't want to feel desperate as I get older, and I can't imagine being unable to find a suitable job in my 30s and 40s. I'm considering three career options, although I'll only get the chance to get a degree again when I am a permanent resident and I'll be 30 by then (the price is five times different):

1. **Physiotherapy**: This aligns with my interest in weight training, but it's a physically demanding job and not highly paid. It would take 4 years to complete a bachelor's degree.
2. **Juris Doctor**: This is a prestigious 3-year program that could lead to a decent job. Some jobs are stable I guess.
3. **Master in Finance**: Working in investment banking is my dream. I've started learning about finance and the stock market. I guess it is a competitive field.

I'm seeking advice on which profession to choose and how to prepare for it. Additionally, I would appreciate any suggestions for my life so far.",Limp-Carpenter-1659,0,0.5,0,1721713355,2024-07-23 05:42:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ea04e9/25f_immigrant_from_hk_to_sydney_from_teacher_to/,7,2024
1e9yb3d,How do you deal with co-worker who tries to make you look lazy?,"I work remotely as an intern along with 3 other interns. The problem is with this one guy who is always trying to make me look bad for whatever reason. When we get assigned a task, we'll agree on the timeliness to do the work, or we'll have already been given a certain deadline. 

What happens is before the deadline, he'll send in just his work and indicate that on his part, he's pretty much done and it's my work that's pending. I can understand that some people get anxious about deadlines and want to stay well in advance of them, but he does this without consulting me how far along I am or even telling me that he's turning it in or is done and would like to turn it in, so it makes it look like I'm dragging the team down or I'm lazy.

I know I'm not the best at my job. I'm in college and I take other night classes too and I know that to our bosses I don't appear as eager for work as the other interns. My direct supervisor doesn't think much of me because of this and gave me a poor performance review stating that I prioritise school over the job. But the thing is, the job is supposed to be part time and I've completed every task that's been allocated to me.

I'm planning on leaving as soon as my contract expires, so it shouldnt bother me much but I got the job through a referral from a colleague who I hold in high regards. I would like to leave with a clean record because of this and because I still put in the work, so it feels unjust.

I got a degree in electrical engineering but would be hired as a “contract administrator,” where it seems like I’ll be tracking contracts, inputting them into the system, and analyzing performer and data and it seems like I do a bit of everything.

At first I was like why the hell would they hire me as an engineer for what seems like a business job, but it’s an engineering technical consulting company. I honestly only have a years worth of experience as an intern so I’d definitely am just going to wing the interview but idk if working for a startup where it seems like there is less than 10 people would be good.

The CEO seems legit, I just graduated college and I like the idea of gaining a ton of experience and really being a part of something where I can make a difference, and the office is literally right by my house (which is very rare bc I live in a residential neighborhood). 

So my commute is halved going to work, and to get back home it usually takes me 45-55 min and at that office it would take me 15 min. The only thing is that while I’m willing to put the work in, I’m not willing to work like 50 hours a week every week if that’s what this might be like.

I think it could be an interesting opportunity but idk I’m kind wondering if it would be a good idea.

1e9vj9h,Career Crossroads - Is it too late? Policing/Nursing/Paramedic in NSW,"Hi all, 

I’m 30M living in Sydney. Recently diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive) which is unsurprising to my family members. Long story short, I am subpar with things that don’t interest me, but I’m a very high achiever in things that do. 

Been in the corporate world (currently a project manager) for the past 7 years. 

After year 12, I studied Exercise, Sports and Physiology, although I did not complete it (deferred after 2 years following a major life change).

Always had a passion and history for health and fitness, fairly fit and active myself. I even tried my hand as a PT but that was too far on the exercise side of things rather than health care. 

I need variety in my work, i love to be out in high pressure situations, adrenaline pumping. My main skills are problem solving, critical thinking, ongoing learning and analysis. 

This, among many other reasons, is why I’ve applied to join the Police Force (both NSWPF and AFP) however due to my recent diagnosis with ADHD, I am looking for a backup career path (or potentially a new focus) just in case I am declined right at the end of the application process (health check). 

If I am accepted, I would love to go down the detective or forensics fields. However while I go through this process, I’m looking for a Plan B.

I’ve narrowed it down to the following (in order of preference and appeal):
1) nursing
2) paramedic
3) pharmacy

I’m not sure anything else appeals to me, but please advise if you suggest anything else. 

Nursing: 
I would love nursing, but I keep being talked out of it by a close family member who does the same. Some reviews about burnout and culture also throw me off, and I feel like I’m bias is ignoring the issues in the nursing industry. If you’re a RN, please advise? A perk of this is that it provides a lot more career options rather than just nursing. 

Paramedic:
Also would love this, but one big concern that I’ve heard and read is that it is a very linear career particularly if you’re spending 3 years studying. There is not much else you can do with a paramedicine degree other than be a paramedic in your state.

1e9vdqi,Internship advice ,"I started my internship last summer as a hs intern jt was a 6 week internship a month after it ended I got an offer and became a admin intern in October. I love my internship and enjoy the people around me. However the past couple of months have made me concerned.

My division had 2 freshman college students join at the begging of June. At the end of June 3 senior college students joined as well. Both the freshman and sophomore are only here for 12 weeks I enjoyed this because I was no longer alone. At the beginning I trained them on how our company ran stuff and explained certain parts of our process. Our supervisor slowly started taking assignments that were assigned to me and began giving it to the new senior interns. At first I was relived because it took some weight off my workload but it has now come to a point where my team and supervisor don't give me any assignments the last three weeks I have done nothing but busy work. I went from planning interviews making offer packets to stapling papers.

I tried to convince myself that it's just because there new and they need to also learn but it has left me to do nothing. I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I am simply being ignored but I don't know what to do ",Technical-Hyena-5155,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1721697973,2024-07-23 01:26:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e9vdqi/internship_advice/,7,2024
1e9uvn0,Difficult team member and manager and leadership won’t do anything about it. ,"Hi all, just want some advice on a difficult team member. This guy is 51M and he is the same level as me and also started around the same time in the company. I’m 30F, for reference. 

For starters, this guy is very negative and take self deprecating jokes to a level that’s not even funny anymore. He constantly complains to me and anyone who would listen that he has no agency and he doesn’t know why he was hired and no one listens to him, etc. He’s known to be difficult to work with and have made homophobic and sexist comments. He was reported but VP and HR just gave him a slap on the wrist. 

Usually, this guy and I are fine working together. I try to be friendly and seeing as we’re both new, we are working on some projects together. It would go positively, but behind my back, he would be telling our manager that I’m trying to steal his job or that I don’t know what I talking about and that he knows better because he has 25 years more experience than I do. Our manager would let me know but told me to not take it seriously because “that’s just how he is”. Ad infinitum. 

Now, onto the current issue. It’s another project and another day of this guy doing his song and dance. I have spent the last five months babying his feelings and tiptoeing around what I say to him because you never know how he would take certain messages and he loves to tone police in teams messages. He goes behind my back again to talk to our manager about how he knows better etc. Again, my manager told me to not worry about it and to ignore him. But I think it was just the last straw and I spent my lunch break crying. Afterwards, I informed my manager that I was really upset by the whole interaction and his response. Manager told me that it’s fine and we said our goodbyes to sign off for the weekend. 

It’s a new week. I have to keep working with this guy. And I just don’t know what to do. I feel so negative going into work knowing that I have to interact with this guy. Any advice?

No jobs are jumping out at me screaming, ""this is the one!"" I have a few maybes and lots of no's, but I'm afraid to pick one incase I'm picking it because I have nothing else.

A bit about me:
~My grades were all very high, 90's and high 80's.
~I'm a pretty shy person who would rather avoid having to talk with customers all day, a few would be fine.
~Absolutely no kids, no matter the age.
~I'm independent, learn quickly, and love to organize everything (currently organizing my collection into a Google Site lol).
~I'm easy to work with and contribute my fair share and usally more of work.
~I'm not afraid of hard work, I love to be challenged on some tasks.
~I do well under stress, but I'd prefer a less stressful job

However
~I love routine and scheduling to a fault. I try to schedule all of my days, when I eat, when I read, play with the dog, etc.
~I'm the definition of an introvert. I would stay at home with my books for the rest of my life if I could.
~I want a stable and reliable job that doesn't have too much vary between days.
~I have no hobbies or passions that could land me a job.

My ""Maybe"" jobs:
~Library and Information Technology
~Corporate Writing
~Proofreading 
I'm afraid for the last two, that the industry will disappear with rise of AI, and I'm not sure if it's worth it to enter into them.

My no's in jobs are:
~Doctor, dentist, nurse, etc.
~Vet, vet technician, etc.
~Lawyer 
~Accounting, or anything with alot of math.
~Teacher, or anything where you instruct children.

During a team meeting he flew off the handle when my team wanted to assign me a task to onboard people. He objected this decision and yelled that I'm incompetent and said he no longer wants to work with me. Another team member reported this to our CEO.

I didn't hear anything about it for a while, but now my CEO scheduled a meeting with me in roughly two months to discuss a personal development plan, and I wonder whether this is going to be a PIP in disguise.

I never experienced such a thing before, so I wonder the intention behind the meeting given the timing (up until the meeting).

Some context: I currently have a one-year contract which either results in permanent employment or being terminated. I have ~3 months remaining.

1e9pr7b,Suggestions for changing career path?,"
Im looking for suggestions to change career path. I am currently working as a freelancer in email marketing. While the flexibility and remote working is great, I’m just not earning consistently or enough. 

I’m ready to commit to a 9 to 5 job if that’s what it takes. 

To give you a bit of background:

- 31 year old male 
- From Ireland
- Computer science degree (ordinary bachelors, I completed 3 out of 4 years)
- No real working experience outside of what I do in marketing and a part time security job in my early 20s. I’ve also forgotten most of the stuff from my degree.
- No proper CV.
- Strengths would probably be soft skills/people skills. Ironically, I’m not very technically strong, so I don’t see myself being a programmer or anything like that.
Essentially, what I am looking for are options to upskill or use what I have to get a job that is consistent, decent to good pay that has potential to grow. Id be fine starting on a lowish salary to begin with, but ideally €30-50k.  

I’m a bit concerned about my age and relative lack of working experience and having a poor CV. 

I would be willing to spend 6 months to 2 years upskilling, but the upper end of that would have to be for a better paid, high demand position.

Id love to hear any thoughts or suggestions.",maturedtaste,1,1.0,1,1721683108,2024-07-22 21:18:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e9pr7b/suggestions_for_changing_career_path/,7,2024

1e9ovol,Need advice on how to answer why did you leave the company + follow up questions ,"Okay so advice is for my friend, as I’m helping her navigate through her career and before I see there’s been numerous of similar posts, we’ve read them too but please read the context cause this is a special case.

Context:
So as of now the job market is tough, I get it. It’s very hard to get a job as well as a lot of companies are being picky. My friend decided to leave her company because of the unorganized tion processes, lack of leadership and crazy deadlines. She was given numerous new tasks from a different department outside of her specialization and her manager didn’t really teach her processes so she was going in blind with these crazy deadlines every day which took a huge toll on her mental health (depression, dark thoughts, etc you name it) so she ended up quitting despite muscling through for a year in this crazy job market.

Challenge:
She’s been getting a few interviews and even making it past the initial interviews. The one thing she comes across is when the interviewer (Manager of the department/C-Suite exec) asks her why she left and she answers “im unfortunately not working there anymore because i wanted to look for better opportunities to grow as a professional and spend quality time looking for companies and grow my skillsets outside of working hours” and they follow up with “you didn’t want to grow within the company you were working for” 

How the heck do you respond to that? We’ve even said something similar to this: “I'm incredibly passionate about my current role and enjoy coming to work every single day. With that.
I'd be doing myself a disservice if I didn't try to advance my career and further my growth with more challenging opportunities. I feel like my skill set and what I can offer match what you are looking for and we can both make progressive and meaningful changes together.”

1e9lryx,Can my Psychology degree be beneficial for working in sports?,"A little background on me: I've been a diehard sports fan since middle school, with hockey, soccer, and basketball being my favorite sports. It's always been a dream of mine to work in sports, and now I've reached a point where I'm 100% certain that it's where I want to be. I truly don't see myself in any other field. My main areas of interest are journalism, broadcasting, reporting, marketing, management, or possibly even becoming a sports psychologist if I decide to pursue my Master's degree.

I'm currently in community college obtaining my Associate's degree in Psychology and then transferring to university for my Bachelor's degree. However, I've always been under the impression that to have a career in sports, you would need a sports-centered degree (Sports Management, Marketing, Media, etc.). I've been contemplating switching degrees, but since I'm transferring, I'm worried it will take longer for me to graduate. Plus, my family says that pursuing a Sports Management degree might not be beneficial or provide a solid foundation for my future in case sports doesn't work out.

Majoring in Psychology is not just about having a deep understanding of human behavior and emotions; you also gain a lot of in-depth skills in research, writing, statistics, and analytics. I figured that since these skills are versatile in any field, they could benefit me in working in sports, especially if I also add a minor in either Sports Management, Communications, Journalism, Marketing, etc.

Despite all this, I still feel like it's a long shot given how competitive the sports industry is.

Well a couple days later we got the schedule and I am only working 3 hour days. 
I work at a daycare (this is not my first time I’ve worked in daycares before) I asked my boss about getting more hours and she mentioned that she cut my hours because I called in. And I’m an honest person and explained to her that I was having a really bad mental health day as to why I called in 
She then asked me “are you able to work a job like this” despite knowing I have years of experience in childcare as to why I got hired. 
My therapist isn’t very happy about the question my boss asked. Of course I told my boss I was capable of working at the daycare. 
Does this sound like discrimination?

1e9kie4,Too late to become successful? 😕,"When is too late to become successful? Its possible to start from the bottom after +30?

Hey all I’m (M) 30, from Europe finishing my degree without no previous experience. I was worried reading that 45 years old dude with no experience and reading the comments.

I plan to finish my degree (BBA/Econ degree) next year and pursue a Master then start working. Can I have a successful career in a corporate environment (think landing eventually Manager, Sr Manager, Director, Partner positions in Corporate companies or firms) in my area of interest starting from the bottom or its a uphill battle and I should start again in another field like Medicine where age doesn’t matter.

To add some info my interest are mostly tech (bizz/ops side), venture capital and healthcare/medicine (to medicine I should start med school and should take very long tho).

Why I started later? Struggled with severe depression and anxiety and I didn’t have before any passion (maybe because I was much worse about my mental health).

1e9k82w,Is the lack of personal interviews a red flag?,"The company that I am interning at is trying to recruit me to come back for their 2-year leadership rotational program when I graduate. I know that this program will pay less than just getting an engineering job out of school, so the main concern is whether or not this ""leadership development program"" will truly develop me beyond what a 'typical' entry level job might.

The interview process for this leadership program has been two interviews:

1. a recorded interview (not personal)
2. a final, group, zoom interview (also not personal)

I am new to the workforce, so I don't know if this is standard for jobs now... however, I am curious for a program that touts leadership growth, is this process is a red flag?

Perhaps the interviews aren't as important for this process because I am an internal hire, but nonetheless. I know the impact that manager can have on my career, and I only feel like the rotational program will be worth it if I know the mentors will be exceptional. Otherwise, I will just be a glorified intern, moving around every 8 months for 2 years without developing real skills.

1e9j7oi,I feel lost and stuck in my life,"27 y/o male
Mechanical engineering technologist advanced diploma

I am seeking some help and advice from others as I feel completely lost and stuck in life. A bit of a backstory here.

I went to college and successfully completed my mech. Eng. technologist diploma to become a mechanical designer. I have always loved drawing, designing components to make machines or components. I did end up getting a job as a mechanical designer and it was ok. I ended up leaving the job to pursue my Bachelor degree in engineering but timing was terrible as I went during the peak of COVID. Unfortunately the bridging program I joined was all online and I couldn’t handle being solitary and having this work load so I dropped out. That was the lowest point of my life and it still haunts me to this day. I still feel like a failure for not being able to complete my degree. I ended up going back to my previous company and switched departments to manufacturing technologist. I was successful there but the issue I was facing was pay. At that point I wanted to start to build my life and unfortunately I could not even think of renting my own place as the pay was so low.

Later on an opportunity arose where I could join an industrial contractor as a junior project manager. Job seemed very fulfilling, lots of opportunity and pay was much better. So I took a leap of faith and I took the job. From the time I joined till now I have been a quality manager at a large project doing upgrades to existing facilities, managed a department where the existing manager quit with no warning for 6 months keeping the shop going and from sinking, established proper organization, workflow, etc. Now I have become a site manager for a very large automotive company and I have arrived at the point where I am miserable, depressed and I just hate my job. I find no satisfaction from it whatsoever and dread going to work every day. I have never received a single complaint, only compliments and good word from many coworkers.

I have never received any training for this position and this company keeps saying I am doing a good job, keeps giving more responsibility and I am getting to a point where I do not feel comfortable continuing as there is no support on my side to make me better at my job.

I have come to the conclusion that I do not want to be in this position and want to look elsewhere. This job is just not cut out for me as I never believe that I am doing a good job. It’s also been affecting my health severely both mentally and physically. Personal relationship is starting to get strenuous with my fiancé and I can’t see myself being a father with how stressed and exhausted mentally I am every day I leave work.

I don’t know if anyone has ever been in a similar situation or not but I do feel like I need some guidance as I feel my credentials will not get me anywhere. The only thing I have is my advanced diploma in engineering technology along with work experience. Any advice, tips would be truly appreciated. Thank you everyone for taking the time to read and reply with your input.

Wife can cover the mortgage until I have a new income. $300 in savings. Recieving $400/wk unemployment for up to 6 months.

Work history: Nevada cannabis work (cultivation and admin) or call centers (customer service and tech support).

Education: G.E.D. I am considering possibly going back to school for certifications if they can be obtained in under a year. Possibly something in tech, I am proficient with general computer programs. I found I like making spreadsheets that automate reports but I have no training. 

Physical Limitations: I am paralyzed and use a manual wheelchair full time. I am strong and take care of myself, but I can't climb ladders or lift heavy items. I know that some day I won't be able to work so physically. 

Location: Las Vegas, NV. (Going outside in the summer heat should be avoided at all costs)

I have a car and can travel, but due to my wheelchair it can be difficult. I've been looking at a Comptia A+ certification but I don't think just getting that would be enough to land me a decent paying ($50k+/yr) work-from-home job.

My wife and I have found out she's pregnant. This is great news as we have been trying for years. A couple weeks ago I was employed in a good manager position, but the company was bought out and my position was eliminated without warning.

With a baby on the way, we are talking about the possibility of finding a live-in nanny (possibly a family member). We have a spare room in our house so it wouldn't be cramped. 

The thought has been on my mind that if I stay home and don't work, technically I can sign up for social security because of my disability, and have a small income while taking care of the baby. The problem we run into, is that social security isn't enough to cover the bills. I was getting about $650/m when on social security  before going back to work. $650 is only enough to be slightly less of a burden on my loved ones.

I have tried investing in my own little business ideas but I've never managed one successfully. I used to mow lawns as a kid, tried selling survival kits on Etsy, sold smoked meats to some coworkers, drove Uber as a young adult (car does not qualify for Uber in Las Vegas and not something I'd feel comfortable doing anyways), tried marketing my admin skills to cultivations as a freelance consultant, and I bought a small claw machine thinking I could easily put it in a restaurant to make a little income. The claw machine is sitting in the spare room. I drove to restaurants and tried talking to owner and manager but I eneded up driving around using time and energy (it's a lot of work to get in and out of the car as I have to disassemble and reassemble my wheelchair each time) and got nowhere.

I don't want to take a job for less than $20/hr but a lot of entry jobs pay less than that and also have physical demands I may not be able to meet. In MOST cultivations, employees are required to change clothes to avoid cross contamination. I would have to use a second ""work"" wheelchair that's sanitized and at the facility all the time. Changing into scrubs takes me a few minutes and then I have to change out to go to the bathroom. That's just too much time and work to get nothing done.

I know that in the end, everything is going to work out. I would like to have a plan to eliminate the struggles where possible.

I don't know if I should focus my energy in getting back into cannabis, getting in a different industry, going back to school, getting my A+ certificate, or if it's more logical trying to sign up for benefits like social security and taking care of the baby.

I am open to ideas, suggestions, questions, encouragement, referrals and DMs.

Half-way through my second year in tech, I applied to grad school to study international relations, which is something I feel really passionate about. I got accepted into top 5 programs for IR, but unfortunately, I didn't get good enough scholarships to justify going. (I already have student loans from undergrad.) 

Now I'm 5 years in and I just don't think I have another 5 years to contribute. I've been working remotely since the pandemic, and it's definitely added to my feelings of isolation. But I think the bigger issue is, I'm just over tech marketing. I don't care about attribution. I don't care about selling this product. I became a manager and I really don't even like that very much. 

The things I like about my job are the writing, researching, and chatting with people to understand why they like our product. I also really enjoy when I get to be creative (in very rare moments). I like the data analysis aspect; I just wish that I was doing something that had much more meaning. 

I've been contemplating maybe trying to break into journalism (but I know only long hours and horrible pay await). I've also contemplated maybe trying to get into government type of work. I don't feel like I wasted my life doing tech marketing, I think it gave me many, many value skills that I can transfer elsewhere. I'm just feeling overwhelmed at the idea of starting from ground 0 again.

1e9g20w,Should I pursue a Psychiatry or Computer Science degree? ,"I'm just a fresh graduate out of High School, and I initially thought of taking up Computer Science for my career path. But I then suddenly had a second thought, and I can't seem to decide.

Computer Science for me was purely due to the fact that I do programming as a small side job. And also the tech market is growing, so it's a good career path and I hope to rise up the ranks or eventually branch out into my own company etc. It was my initial, especially due to all the new tech companies popping up here and there. But where I'm scared is the fact that I at least know 7 people who are pursuing IT in Malaysia alone. Then with all the tech layoffs, I'm afraid it gets over saturated and not worth the degree. Besides I know I'm not a 10x programming wizard who can sit on the pc for long hours.

Psychiatry for me is somewhat an interest. I have a somewhat passion for the topic and I heard it pays quite well too. And being a licensed doctor is a stable career path from what I heard. But then where it falls is the fact that it's a good 12 years of studying, and lot more costly than IT. Not only that but I'm afraid that after all the studying I'm stuck with a basic salary, where I could've made more in IT. And also the business growth potential isn't as shiny as the tech industry.

I know the simple answer is to do what I love, but I am dead worried about regretting my decision.

Would love any tips or suggestions, thanks.",Plainess,1,1.0,8,1721659480,2024-07-22 14:44:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e9g20w/should_i_pursue_a_psychiatry_or_computer_science/,7,2024
1e9fq7c,What to do when new job isn’t a good fit? ,"I’m very bummed. I left a job I **loved and thrived in** due to a new job that paid more, was a boost in career, and a good company close to home. It’s been almost 5 months and I still feel as uneasy as I did my first day. 

- I don’t fit in with my team. (Didn’t have this issue at my previous job, I got on with everyone)
- I have a control freak team member that oversees me.
- I feel limited on my ideas because of her. She only wants things her way.
- I find the work to be really boring and not what I was told I’d do regularly.
- I’ve occasionally had a good week but overall I’m not happy.

I’ve started to apply due to these feelings. I don’t want to look like a job hopper but I’m unhappy. Any advice?

1e9fk7p,Any advice? ,"So I’m kind of in a difficult decision when it comes down to taking a job offer. I’ve read a lot of threads about this and I don’t know if the kind of advice I’ve read really helps me with my current situation.

Essentially, I’m a healthcare provider in a very small and niche field. Everybody somehow knows each other through some sort of mutual connection.

Right now, I currently work for a practice that I absolutely cannot stand. My partner is in a different state so I’ve been applying to different jobs in the area where he’s working. The thing is that the number of jobs for my kind of work around that area are kind of far and few from each other.

I did get an offer almost two weeks ago for a practice that I sort of like? But not totally in love with… And I’m still waiting on my #1 choice as they’re not at the point where they are going to be giving offers yet (at least that’s what their HR has said) 

I’ve already asked for an extension by a few days from this practice that gave me an offer, but I’m wondering if I should ask for another one? 

I don’t want to sign the offer and then back out because that looks poorly on me and will come back and bite me in the ass professionally, although I’ve seen it happen at my own company before.

My current lease is also ending next month, so I feel like I need to make up my own mind on whether or not I take the risk of waiting and potentially lose out on an offer.

Not sure what to do at this point. Any and all advice are welcome. TY! ",DazzlingDealer7252,1,1.0,0,1721658207,2024-07-22 14:23:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e9fk7p/any_advice/,7,2024

I want a career where I can set my mind off or just generally something I enjoy. What I’ve been enjoying that is mildly career potential is reading philosophy and history but jobs in those fields are not exactly demanding outside of education as all you definitely know. 

Right now my major is information systems. I’ve decided my dream jobs would probably be being an airline pilot (The most experience I have is Microsoft Flight Simulator and from what I’m told from pilot subreddits is it is never too late to start) another would an attempt at an being a college instructor or professor (which to my knowledge isn’t an easy field to get into).

1e9ekln,Fixed term contract - I feel my learning and progress is being held back by manager. Will it affect my applications? Advice pls,"What would you advise please as I’m worried about my future. 

I got a fixed term contract, the job is very hands-on experience-based when it comes to progression and securing new offers in the future. 

My current manager suddenly got a thing for me after I non-intentionally over-performed on a task she had deemed her baby, and went from promising me support and acting like she recognised my potential and wanted to invest in me, to now literally telling me to not even bother looking at the structured skillset pathway earlier than… by the end of my fixed term contract.
Saying things like there is no need for me to engage with certain tasks and training anymore. Even though I am more than qualified/capable for these, just need initial guidance, she’s not even interested in assessing my actual ability just gives blanket “no”.

With how she’s been acting, I don’t believe my contract will be extended and there’s been some reshuffling meaning there is less work to go around. I feel given her attitude and this I will be the LOIFOO (last one in first one out) soon. 

My problem is that applying elsewhere (judging from job adverts) would require me to have done more than I’m being allowed to do and if that doesn’t change I’m worried I won’t be an attractive candidate for other emoloyers. It’s all by manager’s discretion how the tasks are allocated and who gets to learn which skills, hard to explain but it’s how this particular workplace “works” (it’s kinda chaotic and badly managed imo).

All training at my level I could find is by nomination so no-go.

I have been there for not quite a year and have a ten year gap as a SAHM before then. Childcare is both expensive and awful in my area so working under 30 hours a week to avoid after school childcare is needed. It was a very difficult position to find because part-time positions in my field are rare and because of my employment gap. I didn’t know that less than 5% of the company has been there more than a few years or that leadership had begun filling management positions with their friends. This has led to anyone not in their circle being blamed for mistakes. The CEO swears and yells at employees nearly everyday. Company culture will not improve and the pay is not great. I have not found another job and, honestly, I’m ready to quit despite the possibility of another employment gap on my resume. When I give my notice, I expect to be escorted out of the building the same day.

1e9dl8t,"25m, about to be stuck in a weird situation and looking for career advice. ","Hello everyone, after doing some research and conflicting results (Google and other subreddits), I am looking for some specific advice. 

Firstly, I am UK based, I have a bachelors degree in English literature and a MA in creative writing, having graduated in 2023. Directly after graduation, I was forced to become a live at home carer for a family member with acute mental health issues and some physical issues. As well as this, directly after graduation I had a small mental health “breakdown” of my own which resulted in a diagnosis of ADHD and maybe autism - waiting lists are very long, I think it’s fairly obvious I have it and for the sake of this post it’s easier to include it. Neither of these causes that many issues, except for a lack of social skills, a lack of understanding of how “jobs work” and some memory, motivation and concentration issues that are much improved with medication. I have also reached out to the charity Scope and have a meeting booked with a work coach that specialises in this at the end of the month. 

My “official” working experience is fairly limited - I have roughly a months work for McDonalds that was before uni but I had to stop as I couldn’t get transferred when moving there, I have 2 years experience as a teaching assistant at a high school due to a sixth form program that was integrated with the high school and finished with a 2 week full time position, 1 years experience working for a Literary journal as an editor which was mainly proofreading and critical analysis, 7 years experience working as an e-commerce sole trader on online marketplaces such as Depop and eBay (self sufficient business, but not enough to really continue in this current economic climate alongside a sharp rise in scammers and general unpleasant experiences), 2 years as a freelance writer in a very, very niche speciality and I have a small published portfolio with an award nomination for one of these, and 2 years experience as a freelance proofreader and editor that was very academic based and was reliant on word of mouth clients. 

Recently, I’ve had to put a few of these on hold to focus on caring a bit more and it is looking to take up a bit more of my time for the foreseeable future. I have no qualms about this as due to the conditions the care options are mainly limited to private companies in this area and it allows me to claim carers allowance which generates money for the house. 

However, because of this I am facing a real problem of stagnation, financially and skills wise. I have tried my luck with applications for part time retail jobs etc, but living in a small overpopulated town with limited places I am finding myself getting nowhere. Much of the local high street is dominated by charity shops which, whilst I am interested in volunteering there and personally believe that this would be a very good way to learn the ropes in a sense and to gain some valuable life experience that will benefit greatly. Aside, from this there is an abundance of factory work that due to my current situation I will not able to do. 

Sorry for the long post already but I now therefore have a few questions in light of this.

1. I am extremely interested in building and learning new skills whilst I have the time as I can do this alongside the care work. specifically, I would be interested in SEO development, an expansion of my Google suite knowledge (excel etc), copywriting courses, blogging courses and maybe coding but there is a lot of options to choose from. What is the best way to go about this and what courses actually look good on a CV?  (Open to anything at all, any sector any skill)

2. I would be interested in degree apprenticeships, but I have 2 degrees already and there is not a lot around me. Is having a degree already an issue and is there a market for them aimed for older people? 


3. I’ve seen a lot of posts saying that for retail jobs graduates should omit education from their CVs due to fears of being overqualified and the risk of leaving for better offers, is this good advice and how would I go about explaining the gap on my cv (I didn’t work at uni until my masters)? 

4. How realistic is finding a part time work from home job, in an ideal world this would be the best choice for my situation. Most i see advertised is AI training and I’m unsure about the legitimacy of these adverts and I am getting very different reviews of this industry. Are these a scam, and are there any other sectors that have low level part time work from home jobs? 

5. Finally, what are some general tips to avoid getting comfortable and embracing the stagnation? Before medication, I was very bad at this and wasted a lot of time being idle. Is there any courses or just life general tips to help improve executive function and improving an arguably “do the bare minimum” work ethic to put it kindly? 

Sorry for such a long winded post but I wanted to be as detailed as possible. Any advice is welcome, I am 25 with no direction, no preferred career path and hopefully any advice can at least help others in similar situations.  

Thanks in advance. ",Fromdon,1,1.0,0,1721652889,2024-07-22 12:54:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e9dl8t/25m_about_to_be_stuck_in_a_weird_situation_and/,7,2024
1e9d150,Need advice on extending probation ,"Need advice on how I (28 F) should proceed, and whether I should agree to an extension of my probation at my workplace. I will be as transparent as I can, but feel free to ask questions if you need. 

I joined a social service agency in January this year and my probation was six months long. Earlier this month, my manager had told me that my assistant director thinks I am an independent worker, and not a right fit for their culture. I was asked to either resign, or extend my probation by another three months.

My assistant director has had many one-on-ones with me, and never raised this. She always said I seemed to be getting well with my tasks and there were no issues with my performance. So receiving this feedback was a shock, as it was for my manager. She knew I was shocked and was equally shocked as this was not her decision to make.

Since then, I have been framed to take accountability for the mistakes other departments have done when sending me the information necessary for the FY’s annual report, something that I oversee) An email was sent by my assistant director with my COO in it, indirectly claiming that the team will “work better” but subtly making this about me even though I have nothing to do with the mistakes that were flagged by the Finance department. They provided the info, and they are the same people saying the text they provided has to be edited.

I used to be ok with the one hour commute to my office (and another one hour commute back home), but after my performance review, I have lost every bit of enthusiasm to continue working here. They do not believe in working from home even twice a week, and like to micro manage. 

I told my manager I would like to have a one on one talk with my AD to have a better understanding on how I can improve, but my manager was hesitant and insists to be there. She even says she needs to “check in with her”.

I am feeling so lost and down. I initially thought I finally found a healthy working environment, but I was wrong. I am not sure how I should proceed from this, or if I should resign and serve my one month notice. 

Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you.

I get reimbursed for my gas, but honestly the drive is starting to really get to me and I am only 25. I don't take a lunch, I eat at my desk and work though, I often have to stay late and I don't get paid any over time.. I also don't get any vacation time. They want to pay me like I am in the field, but not give overtime and they want me to work as if I am salary. I have said something to my boss about getting paid for the hours extra I am working and he slid it under the rug. I get I am young, but my time is valuable and I give a lot to this company and I am feeling like I am being taken advantage of. Their is no clear description of what my job is so now I just do anything that needs to get done... my project manager who I am supposed to assist is rarely in the office.. once a week at best! He delegates most of the tasks to me and I am overwhelmed.

1e98fzj,I want to get back to university full-time but my boss is very nice,"I am in a bit of an awkward situation. I did a university degree which is coupled with working in a professional environment (if you are also from Germany, it was a Dual Studium, don't know if this system exists anywhere else). The place where I work really isn't that great, especially the salary. Also there is soul-crushing bureaucracy so you have to be kind of cynical to work there because you can't get anything done and nobody takes responsibility. I am the only person out of 10 people who stayed at the company. Anyways, I wanted to continue my education. Since I am young and this system is not for me I wanted to do it at a normal university. They offered me to work part-time and study at the university after I did 1 year at the company. 'Great' I thought to myself, I take the bit of money and the experience and then continue. Now I realized that this is really not what I want. I just want to study normally and have some more years at the university living the college lifestyle. Doing this whole part-time thing is very stressful. Yeah I know I should have thought about that earlier. That is not my problem. I actually could just quit now and do what I want. I didn't lose any time anyways because the semester is yet to start. But my problem is that my boss and my co-workers are all very nice to me and my boss supports me very much. They even gave me a leadership position in a (very small) project, so that ""I learn to work in a project"". No promotion or raise involved, mind you. I know that they do it for their own gain but I can't stop feeling like an A\*\*hole about myself because they invest in me. The project is done early next year about the time I wanted to continue university anyways. So should I take the experience in the leadership role and quit next year? That's my plan right now.

The thing is the 4 years I was with my previous group my work was never questioned and I never had any problems. I don’t want to think the worst but I just think my new team doesn’t like me. 

Have any of you been in this situation, I feel scared, depressed and lost because I know I’m a good worker but transferring has ruined everything I’ve worked hard for. Losing my job I wouldn’t even know where to start.

2020-2022 - FIRM B
2022-23 - FIRM C
In 2nd half of 2023 I joined FIRM B again.
So recently FIRM B was acquired by another firm and there were layoffs and redundancies.
So I started looking out for other jobs due to job security concerns as i have lot of responsibilities on my headand also a home loan and also I cleared my CFA LEVEL 2.
So now I got another Job which is another city and different state (Chennai,TN, India) from a US firm with a 30% hike.
Now the management of FIRM B is trying very hard to retain me but I am not sure what to do as I am confused how the work will turn out due to integration of two firms and how beneficial it will be. The work is Chennai is much better but comes at a cost as I will have to delay my level 3 exams and will have to stay away from Parents which are quite old now and top of that the house that I bought is nearing possession. 

At this point I am unable to make a decision so please help me out.

1e915ep,Should I take a job that doesn’t offer maternity leave? ,"Hi everyone! 

So I had an interview was for a sales rep role!  I had three interviews in total for this role. Being a sales rep is something I have always been interested in pursuing. They ended up giving me an offer! If I reach my bonuses and add in my car allowance I would be making around 15K more than what I am currently making and the bonuses are supposed to be fairly achievable. The job actually sounds amazing where I would get to be a lot more independent and WFH  full time and go to different A&D firms for lunch and learns etc. There would be a decent amount of travel involved but I would get a car allowance and a gas CC. The only downfall that I am seeing (and it’s a big one) is that this is a small employee funded company and because of that they do not have FMLA and also offer no maternity leave currently… I initially rejected the offer when I learned this because I am getting married in one year and we are planning for a family! But the manger ended up calling me twenty minutes later and said that she talked with her boss. She fought pretty hard for me and said they don’t have a written policy for maternity leave but that they have had sales reps in the past have babies and have worked with them. She also said that her boss said it’s something they been wanting to add. I also mentioned I wanted the base salary higher and she said she could work with me. So I said okay with all of that in mind let me rethink this further.

1e8ybvs,Taking a step back in order to move forward?,"Hi all,

I am at an impasse in my life, maybe even a quarter life crisis, and I don't really know what the smart thing to do next is.

I am currently 29, and have been working since I was 21. In that time, I had some really valuable experience at a large multinational (a bit over 5 years) making my way up to Senior Marketing Manager. During that time, I worked my ass off, learnt a lot, and gained experience in a company that is very well respected.

I was getting calls from other companies quite often, and eventually one reached out that was in a completely different field. They offered me a position at basically double my salary, and I went off to start as a Product Manager.

It's been almost 2.5 years at this new company, and my role is very strange and changes every day but it certainly isn't Product Management. It's pretty much whatever is needed at that time to generate additional revenue or push a project forward. Nothing feels transferrable. 

Even though I am now making great money (>$190K), I feel like I am not learning any skills or improving myself in any way. It freaks me out to think how I would fare in another company after this as I don't really have the learnings that an actual PM would have. 

I feel very unhappy in my role and because I feel so disconnected and uninterested, I am honestly not a good performer. Since I am not a real PM, I don't feel comfortable applying to another company under that title. I think I need to take a step back to something more junior and work my way back up. Is taking a step back like this wise? I could return to being a Marketing Manager too (Senior or otherwise) but I would be taking a large pay cut for sure.

1e8wlpf,music industry ,"Hi everyone, I (18f) always thought I would go to medical school after high school as I love learning about the human body and find it relatively easy to learn new things. But lately, I think I've discovered for myself that my heart really lies in music. I never considered a career in music because whenever I mentioned it to my parents or relatives when I was growing up (I've played instruments all my life), they always dismissed me and told me it wasn't a significant career option. But I feel in my heart that music is the way forward, but if I want to pursue music, I want to be successful and make a name for myself. I don't crave fame or a title, but I want to be able to support myself and not have to worry about money, which is the case for most musicians. I want to produce, sing and make music like Frank Ocean or Tyler, the Creator. I know I'll probably have to move to LA because connections in the music world are VERY important. But I feel like all the other steps are still a big unknown for me because they are not often talked about in detail. If anyone out there has any ideas about the music industry and knows how to get started in it, or has any advice at all, I would be more than grateful for your opinion.

1e8vxeg," 22M, I have no idea what to do in the future, please help? (Long post Warning) ","I hope this doesn't become a long post but basically I have no idea what I want to do in the future, like I genuinely have no aspirations, no goals and no dreams for a career, I do know I want a career and I want to be financially wealthy but I don't know what path to take to get them.

A bit of my background, Family is Mexican so I can speak Spanish, but I was born in the US so I have an American passport, I never lived in the US however, I lived in Mexico for 7 years, then Panama for 3 years, then China for 8 years (so I also speak conversational Mandarin), and I've now spent the last 4 years in the UK.

I did A-Levels in China and I got AAB (Spanish, Biology & History respectively). I then went to the University of Warwick (a respected uni) where I did my BSc in Biomedical Science, then, I also did my MSc in Medical Biotechnology and Business Management at Warwick, where I achieved a Distinction.

After graduating I ended up working for an Investment firm in Canary Wharf even though I don't have much interest in Finance, but I was looking for work in the UK, in a place that offered visa sponsorship and good pay and benefits. I have now been here for a couple of months and there's already talks about which position I'll be moving into from my entry level role (all of which is to move to some sort of finance role).

However I feel like I'm having a crisis, I have 0 passion for what I'm doing or for finance, I find myself unable to know what I even want to do, I have lots of interest in topics but they're all topics for which I would have to go back to uni for, or I am not good enough at Maths/Computer Science for (Astronomy, Nuclear Physics/Radiobiology, Law, Forensics, Architecture, Aerospace/Medical Device Engineering, etc.), but I don't want to go back to studying yet. I didn't enjoy working in a lab as I enjoy social environments and the earning potential through academic research is challenging and not usually high. So I do enjoy science, but its difficult to pursue it in the UK (where Healthcare is public), if I'm working towards a certain lifestyle.

I was thinking of perhaps Medical Device sales as I am very extroverted and get along with most people and I like biotech, however, after working with the salespeople in my investment firm I realize that I wouldn't enjoy the pressure and stress of a sales job. I also know that I enjoy corporate jobs and I wouldn't want to do a trade job, as I worked in a pub for a year (during uni) and did not enjoy it, and it is not the kind of job I want. I am very extroverted and get along with most people so I am sociable person.

So could anyone provide some recommendations for jobs that I could look into that fits in my skillset and aspirations? It could be anything as well, I was even looking at something like petrol companies as they tend to be corporate (higher up), they can pay well, and it could be an interesting topic (not saying its a goal of mine but that it can be something as far left as that).

1e8uv1j,Career in HR vs OHS?,"EDIT: I am SO sorry about how long this is. I didnt even realise I had so much to say.

Hi, I (F28) in Canada and am currently at a point in my life where I want to make a change in career.

A little background: I am currently working in Operations (financial services) for the last 3 years. Its cushy remote job a large org with room for growth but I am bored out of my mind and have no desire to do more in this line of work. My work hours are usually 7/8am to 3/4pm. Previously I worked in event/catering management and that was derailed due to COVID. I realize that I do well in data focused, fact driven jobs and less people pleasing jobs such as events.

I have a BA in Communications & Media studies which I took simply because I had no idea what to do at 19.

Here are my current options:

1. I am considering using my financial ops experience into transitioning to compensation and payroll. To do this I would most likely need to pursue an HR Cert then go on to getting experience to eventually work in comp and also work on becoming a certified PCP. I would most likely have to work in the usual HR sphere (recruitment, L&D, etc) before I can make my way to Compensation. Great thing about the HR cert at GB college is that they have a co-op.

Questions: Would it be possible to not get the HR cert and go straight into studying for a PCP at like Humber College or UofT?

2. I recently started looking into Occupational Health & Safety. It seems quite interesting and I think I could do this. I have 0 experience in construction/factories or anything related. Being in Ontario I realize my schooling options are limited and those available are mostly self guided programs and do NOT have internship/co-op which really sucks. I understand that there is a possibility of moving around in this field and I am okay with this, in fact I look forward to it. I sucked at sciences in HS and realise that OHS programs would focus on them.

Questions: What are the chance of someone like me getting a foot in the door for a career in OHS? What types of work of OHS should I look into ?

Overall Qs:  
-Maybe I should get my HR Cert and leverage that experience to work my way into OHS later on?

-Is there any other career I should consider?

Thanks in advance, I look forward to your replies!!",Mysterious-Host-6361,1,1.0,0,1721591389,2024-07-21 19:49:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e8uv1j/career_in_hr_vs_ohs/,7,2024
1e8umj4,Any successful translators here that do not have a bachelors or masters? ,"Hi all,

I'm a 31 old guy who worked in a warehouse for the past 9 years. I live in UK and I'm originally from Romania. I am very confident in my English skills, and of course Romanian skills as well.

This being said, I was thinking of having a start in translating, been reading about this kind of work, it is something I'd actually enjoy doing, even if only as a part-time.

Reading on r/TranslationStudies , I see many people saying that if one does not have higher education in languages, it's near impossible to start. My problem is that I do not have any education. I do not have my GCSEs, A-Levels or any uni. Considering all this, is there a chance for me? Are there courses that I could do towards succeeding in this path? My ideal goal would be freelance work. Also, reading translators' comments on other posts about how massively their workload dropped because of AI is pretty disheartening...

Is anyone here who works as a translator without a bachelors or masters or uni studies in any field? What are my options here? My two languages would be Romanian and English and I like languages, I could see myself enjoying this kind of work.

1e8uj2x,What Now? Am I lost? ,"I wanted to see if I could get some advice.

A year and a half ago I relocated after we had our second child come early. I worked in politics prior, but made the career change to work in higher education fundraising at my Alma mater. I took a very entry level position that I was overqualified for but wanted to get my foot in the door. I took an incredibly large pay cut and as of today I have applied to six internal positions, from various
""levels"", different departments, some with internal ""connections"" and some without, I have had 6/6 zoom interviews but have yet to make it to the in person round. I'm in a coordinator level job now in a department that isn't necessarily the most popular team but one of the biggest colleges. I have a decade of sales experience from a family business I started in medical sales, years of political fundraising experience, a law degree and law license, but I cannot get any traction. I'm defeated at this point, I'm wasting away and the bureaucracy of higher education HR is killing me, I'm at a loss and don't know what to do. It would be fine if I didn’t have a strong background in other areas, and if I wasn’t in such a currently internal, systemic role where I don’t use my natural ability for external facing roles. 

Maybe I'm abrasive? Maybe I'm a shitty interviewer? Maybe it's my face? Maybe someone internally is killing my prospects? I don't really know but would love advice.

1e8sznh,"Is there any other lucrative career except in tech, finance or medicine? ","I [25f] just don’t know what direction to go anymore in my career. I graduated with Psychology thinking I am going to make a career by helping people. After graduation, I realised that while I love psychology as a topic I just don’t enjoy academics and research and I need money (don’t have a wealthy background and nothing to fall back on) so I couldn’t see myself spending the next 5 years dedicating myself to that.

Moved across the country (back to my home area) and worked as a social worker for 2 years. I am now officially done with that and just not interested in working with vulnerable people anymore. 

I am also burnt out from working and just can’t see myself working for not enough money for the rest of my life. My interests used to involve people, social justice, or creative arts etc. Having a meaningful career that will contribute positively to the world was always at the forefront but it’s just not what pays the bills. Those with the best work/life balance and pay seem to be the tech, finance and medical people. But I don’t have interest in that.

I guess the real question is if I should just give up on the narrative of „following my passions“ and just look for something that will provide me with a decent income and good work life balance so I could just enjoy life at this point? Or should I continue this „pursuit of my purpose“ that leaves me completely drained and burnt out. Should I just settle for some high salary career in tech for example.

1e8spvn,Second pip after sick leave?,"I’ve got a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan) back in February and was able to complete it successfully. The first PIP didn’t make sense to me, as I had been performing well. The only time I started having difficulties was when they switched me to a totally new project/client, using a new version of our proprietary technology, which was very different from what I had been using since I started with the company. But I took fully responsibility for my performance.

A few weeks later, they switched me back to my original project with the old framework, and I’ve been making good progress since then. Recently, I’ve had more consistent work with the same client, unlike before the PIP, where I switched between different projects and clients frequently.

Just a few weeks ago, I worked on a new request for the same client. My boss wrote the specifications and outlined what needed to be done. I developed and completed the most important part for the client (we agreed on that). However, the client informed me that the specifications were incorrect and needed to be changed. I reported this during our stand-up meeting, and my boss said he’ll handle her, and blamed her saying that wasn’t true.

Unfortunately, on the same day, I had an accident and was forced to take 12 days of sick leave. When I returned, my boss complained about my performance. He mentioned discussing it with his business partner and told me that sometimes I’m an outstanding developer, but other times I seem lost. This time, I asked him to provide specific examples, but he couldn’t mention anything concrete.

I explained that, as a junior developer, I am often left to work alone without guidance (this happened since I joined the company). My onboarding process was different compared to a new hire with 10 years of experience. I wasn’t given any training and was expected to start working on tickets immediately, even though they promised me 1 week office training which never happpened. I also mentioned that the last ticket I was working, we had done a code review together, but the code didn’t work when I tested. He accused me of not reaching out to him, but I have proof of all the calls / email I made to him.

In the end, I proposed (six months after joining the company) that I be assigned a senior developer for support, or someone who works on the same project as me, as no one on my team except my boss knows the system, and most recent hire are working in parallel with more senior people. My boss now wants to schedule a call next week to discuss the kind of support I need, how to measure progress, and timelines. It sounds like another PIP. Am I getting fired? He mentioned that if things don’t go as expected, they might have to let me go. At the same time, he told me not to worry and to do my best, assuring me that we don’t need to think about negative consequences.

A couple of days before the accident, he was happy with my progress, and everything changed after that. I really want to change company, but the job market in the UK especially for software engineer is bad, also have to do self-dev using popular technologies as I have been using my company framework which is basically useless, and remote jobs are hard to find.

1e8rh6n,How to avoid feeling discouraged by the job search,"So I have been searching for a job (22F) within my field and have no luck so far. I just graduated with a degree in behavioral economics (which I am kinda regretting now lol). I had a job lined up from a previous position internships which fell through right after I graduated and now I have nothing. 

During college I lived with my parents since my school was a 5 minute drive away. I am currently working around 30 - 40 hours a week at two restaurants, and am trying to applying to 3 or 5 jobs a day. Admittedly I have been slipping a bit recently. 

I still haven’t heard back from anyone expect for rejections, or scammy sales positions. I have had multiple people look over my resume, I have had three different internships during college and I feel so discouraged because I just don’t know what to change. 

I feel like a complete loser since I am still living with my parents and a good amount of my friends have full time positions. Scrolling on LinkedIn I just see posts on recent graduates I know about the jobs they are getting.

I work at a restaurant that is frequented by the college I used to go. Some of them will talk about the jobs or plans they have lined up and I feel like such an idiot and failure in life since we are the same age ish. My one coworker is 16 years old and it makes me feel worse since I feel like I should be doing something else. 

I know a lot of this will just be about continuously applying, but it is so hard not to get discouraged doing the same things day after day. I feel like a NEET and like I am not doing enough. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to not feel down about stuff like this? I am not even sure if this is the right subreddit to post on, and if it is I will remove it.

1e8rdpf,My career plan has completely fallen apart. Should I go with my new plan outside of my degree? Or do I still have a chance of getting a job within my degree?,"I am 24 years old and studied atmospheric sciences in college and graduated nearly two years ago. Ever since I was very little, I wanted to be a broadcast meteorologist. It all started when my parents had the tv on the weather channel and I was watching one of the meteorologists the weather and I pointed at the tv and said, “I wanna do that!😄” because I found the weather and forecasting to be fascinating and all my life, its been, “I want to be a meteorologist!” I worked so hard to where I even have a good GPA.


I applied for jobs right after I graduated, but I struggled to land a job at first. During interviews, the news directors would either scowl at me or snicker, but I didn’t think anything of it.

I finally landed a job December of last year as a broadcast meteorologist after a great phone interview. However, issues came ever since day one. I got a lot of hate emails, but I just brushed it off as one of my professors who used to be in broadcast told the class that hate emails were extremely normal in the industry. My boss told me, “oh don’t worry about the hate, you are doing great” which I was glad to hear even though I wasn’t worried about the hate emails, especially since none of the emails had any constructive criticism. It was always, “She sucks!!!!” “Get her off air!!!!” And all these emails people called me “little girl” which I find to be so indecent with how I’m almost in my mid 20s.

Later on my boss emailed me frequently, “Viewers are complaining!” And he would give me a list of things to do to improve, and I implemented them ASAP. Only then for my boss to ask me, “why haven’t you done what I said?” When I did do what he said and I showed him through my broadcast videos. He had no response and kept giving me critique. 

(Skip this portion if you don’t want the whole story)


The hate emails continued and eventually I was taken off air and given a digital job position at the station that just turned out to be a fake position to do until I was fired (I didn’t piece that together until I was fired). I was slammed with a performance issue plan weeks after the job position change, and it was filled with mistakes that I made that I corrected as soon as I was told to, and most of the stuff listed was stuff my boss told me to do and I implemented, only to find out he wanted me to do things that viewers actually hated a lot, and never told me it was an issue until it was listed on the performance issue plan. I did my best every week to correct my mistakes from the performance issue plan. 


One day, all of my digital tools of the station that I need in order to do my job, goes out. I told my boss and the digital director and was given these minor tasks to go make videos from my phone to post on the stations’s social media. I didn’t have access to the station’s social media, so I went to the digital director for access, but she didn’t want me to posts photos and videos yet, which I told my boss, asked him everyday what should I do, and he said each time do as the digital director says. I did and


(End of skipping long portion of story)


 my boss came up to me at the end of the week asking me why I have done nothing. I told him I’ve been doing what you said of do what the digital director says and he said, “i’m your boss not the digital director” and told me to go make posts using the tv’s live computer and green screen (which he told me previously to never touch until he tells me to). So I told him I’m right on it and 15 minutes later he sends me to his office to terminate me from my job. I only had the job literally right before my probationary period was up. It was all constant gaslighting the whole time. My boss’s last excuse for firing me was I put out a statement that the national weather service made about moderate snow coming that will make travel basically impossible and could cause risk of life if people were to drive out in it. I put out the statement verbatim of what the national weather service said and my boss told me, “don’t do that again. We’re just going to have a tiny snow dusting like always. What are you trying to scare people?”

The storm did come the next day, and gave moderate to heavy snow just as I said. So many people were shocked as if I didn’t tell them in advance 3 days before the storm.

So despite that, now I have no job and a performance issue plan on my record. After the constant disrespect between the dozens of interviews treating me like a joke and my gaslighting job, I decided I don’t want to do broadcast anymore. 


I looked into other meteorology opportunities, but they require specific experience gained through an internship that students do in school. I have applied to the national weather service, but I’ve been turned down because even though my GPA is pretty good, its not good enough for them.


I’m starting to think to do something outside of my degree cause my dad wants to put me in the military/navy but I don’t want that due to having severe PTSD (now minor due to therapy) with stuff that people in the military/navy go through. I also have cerebral implants, so I’d think they would turn me down anyways.


All I wanted to do with my life in general is help people. With broadcast meteorology, it was always “protect people and property from the weather elements” and I loved that. I’ve been thinking and I want to do something to help people mentally and physically. I’ve been thinking of putting myself through reiki training and getting certified to do healings, especially since I’ve had personal experiences of spirituality ever since I was 9, but I don’t know the success rate of this plan I’m thinking for myself.

I can’t afford to go back to school. What should I do? Should I go with my reiki plan? Or is there a better option?",Throw_away5845,2,1.0,5,1721582395,2024-07-21 17:19:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e8rdpf/my_career_plan_has_completely_fallen_apart_should/,7,2024
1e8qjzj,"Healthy ""second thoughts"" about new job turning into major second thoughts . . .","Hi all.

I am supposed to start a new job in a few weeks. I'll be working for a former colleague whom I would think would be overall OK as a manager, but it seems his new role may have gone a bit to his head.  Accepting the job was not an easy decision -- for a host of reasons -- but now I'm really having second thoughts.

Long story short, he called me the other day to say that, as part of my new role, he's going to give me an additional small team to oversee -- I had no complaints, really, and was fine with it -- and then asks if it would be OK if he also gives me ANOTHER team to oversee.  This *additional team* is going to be a big headache as it will require an overhaul and a lot of strategic guidance.  

I tried to push back, saying I was concerned it would be too much extra work, but he kind of made it clear that he had to give this team to someone and I was the only person he could give it to.  I could be overreacting, but I'm not happy about the whole thing.  Perhaps he was forced to make a last-minute decision, but it goes without saying that discussions about this additional team really should have been part of my original interviews as I would have been better able to make an informed decision about whether I really wanted the job.

I am not sure what to do at this point, but I was thinking about having another conversation with my manager to say that I'm concerned about what I'm stepping into.  Part of me thinks he's in denial about how much work my *main job* is going to be, hence the reason he tacked on this additional set of duties.

1e8pm3q,Should I leave given exacerbating medical circumstances?,"So I'm debating about whether I should leave my current job.The sheer increase in stress is taking a physical/mental toll and I am feeling it now after years of just trying to roll with it. I am also recovering from a physical injury from a while back that has led to major chronic issues/surgeries over the last couple years.

Firstly the positives about my job - pay and benefits are amazing and my manager is great. From my salary, I am also able to help out my parents with caregivers and saving up for a house for them. It has also helped me save and invest for the future and FIRE is something important to me.

However the negatives have been adding up for years and I keep saying I'm going to quit but don't. Negatives include toxic team leads who I report to, backstabby environment, a ridiculous amount of stress related to work, and a career direction (while lucrative) is not where I want to go.

Given everything, I am ready to leave. Unfortunately of course there are some complications with that.

1) I am the sole income earner in our household.
2) I have a wife who stays at home and takes care of our 4 year old. Her salary would go almost entirely to daycare.
3) I am recovering from a severe physical injury (non work or insurance related) that I may not be fully recovered from for another 3 months to the end of the year.

My medical issue and insurance coverage is my main concern. I have hit my yearly deductible, so if I leave I will have to maintain coverage with COBRA which is expensive for a family of 3. Also this injury has been chronic and I've been dealing with it for over 2 years. While I hope to be out if it by the end of the year, I'm always skeptical given how long it's been. The job stress has not been beneficial in helping my recovery. 

On the upside I have these things that are beneficial. 

1) Have an emergency fund that will cover about a years expenses
2) A small side hustle that will help bring in a little extra money each month to help alleviate minor expenses (odd utility bills, grocery portion)
3) PTO payout after I leave that should cover 80% of COBRA payments for the rest of the year.

My question is should I quit? I brought it up to the wife, who is worried about me, but is also worried finances. She could also find work but has been out of the workplace for about 3.5 years.

I know the financially responsible answer is stay at work until at least I clear my medical issues and find another job before quitting. 

However, if I quit now that will allow me to recoup from my injury without stress and give me an opportunity to study/certify/prepare for my next job. Also if i maintain COBRA my deductible is met for this year so my medical expenses are covered. The hope is that I can find a new less stressful job after I heal up (hoping 3 months).

Reasons not to quit are mainly financial and there is the adage ""harder to find job without a job"". Though I'm thinking I can explain any absence from working to new perspective employers because of my medical condition and if I use the time productively to sharpen and learn new skills. I'm also thinking a 3 - 6 month absence isn't a big deal breaker to future employers if I make use of my time.

Any thoughts, suggestions or feedback would be wonderful. Appreciate you all in advance!",PolyRetr0,1,1.0,3,1721577696,2024-07-21 16:01:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e8pm3q/should_i_leave_given_exacerbating_medical/,7,2024
1e8p0nd,I don’t fully trust my business partner,"Basically me and my friend went into business together. I have noticed that whenever he says one thing he gives me the run around and doesn’t actually fall through.

I had gone silent before not talking to him about my reservations about the whole thing, and he asked me about it and I told him. He said for me to bring it to his attention if I feel some way or have questions. I ended up bringing something to his attention on another situation and he got mad. Thing is he been in this field for longer and he promises to teach me and show me how everything works but I feel it’s all empty promises.

1e8o67m,Don’t know how to leverage my degrees ,"I’m (27F) based in a major metropolitan area and currently have been working as a temp for four months now.  The company pays by the hour and while I negotiated a higher hourly rate at my interview I obviously have no benefits, etc.  The job is an absolute joke and I feel so underemployed, underutilized, and underpaid

However, I think it’s my fault as I realized recently it’s not that I’m incapable of finding a better job but that I simply don’t know what I want to do.  Something tells me if I had a clear idea of what I wanted, I’d manage to find a way to make it happen

My entire childhood and early 20s were spent at a musical instrument.  After studying in music school under scholarship for my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees which I started at an early age I achieved some success in that.  Unfortunately, I hated teaching, realized that only 0.001% subsist on performing alone, and I realized I needed to expand my skills.  I returned to school for another Master’s degree in business administration and graduated in 2022.  I don’t know how I should position myself for corporate America and I don’t know how people get positions thru other people without making it seem totally transactional.  I think I’m too straightforward and probably bad at networking.  At this point, I don’t know if I even want to be a part of corporate America or what my other options are!  It’s super depressing.

1e8md2n,Should I approach this person? ,"I’m a B2B journalist covering [blank] industry, and I’ve come across a junior communication officer job opening at an organization within the same field. I'm familiar with this organization and their senior communications officer, as I’ve interviewed their representatives multiple times. A few months ago, the senior communications officer invited me for an office tour and an in person interview with the director. However, when I arrived, he informed me in the very last second that he couldn’t meet me that day. He was very apologetic and has since reached out to schedule an online interview and we also interact on LinkedIn.

My concern is that I lack experience in the corporate world and I come from a working class Eastern European background, so I’m often unsure how to navigate situations like this in Western Europe. Should I contact him to express my interest in the position? What should I say? Could our previous somewhat awkward encounter impact my chances?

1e8kbmi,Going back,"Hi all.  

I recently left the investment bank I worked at in my home country to move to NY and work for one of the best IBs in the world.  It is something I’ve wanted to do all my life, and I was super excited about the prospect.  Honestly, there was a massive part of me that hoped I could make it stick and to never head home.

Unfortunately, my wife was not convinced and decided to stay in my home country and continue to pursue her own career.  It was a decision I respected, and she agreed that if after a year I was confident that I wanted to be in NY long term that she would then make the move.  In the meantime, the plan was for us to visit each other as frequently as possible - about once every 3 months.

So I have arrived in NY, got myself set up and started work in the last few weeks.  However, my wife is now pregnant!  This wasn’t necessarily planned, but we are super excited about it and we are in the right stage of life for that.  There’s obviously just one problem…

Early indications are that my new job is great and I really like living in NY, but the truth is that it is shit not being with her, and I’ve been very lonely.  And the idea of her going to all the scans etc without me is heartbreaking.  NY was always my dream, but the dream included doing it together.   And now the pregnancy has totally changed my perspective.

When I left my home country, my old employer made a strong play to make sure that if I ever come back I would rejoin them.  I’ve got no doubt that I rang them up they’d have me back in a heart beat.

Should I go home?  How do I save face…. Even if I stay here for 6 months, it is still such an obvious red flag on my CV.  People will assume I couldn’t hack the work and failed.  Obviously those I work with directly will learn about the pregnancy - but it’s hard to sell this more widely obviously.  

The alternative is I stay here and try to convince my (now pregnant) wife to live here.  It would mean changing jobs and healthcare systems whilst pregnant, she probably wouldn’t be eligible for mat leave etc. 

Any advice would be helpful.  ",crewcoach,1,1.0,1,1721561783,2024-07-21 11:36:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e8kbmi/going_back/,7,2024
1e8jw4e,Advice please,"Situation
Mid level engineer. Met the minimum criteria but I realised I was constantly blocked from getting a senior appointment for minor reasons cited by management even though they acknowledged I've shown clear critical thinking skills (it's to the point I feel they're critiquing the most minor and lame things possible). This in turn meant no pay bump of a few thousand bucks and having to re-attempt in a few months time (aka delay in pay bump). It took a hit on my self esteem, and I'm furious and fed up. 

Concerns
Re-attempting in a few months doesn't guarantee I'll be able to attain senior appointment and I'm sick and tired of playing the waiting game (career stagnation). 

Alternatives
- I got an offer at another company. New domain, new things to learn, but at the cost of pay cut. They said if I learn the biz knowledge fast, promotion will come fast. 
- I have other interviews ongoing. New domain, likely higher compensation. But actual offer not guaranteed yet.

Since I am the one developing and refining the job description of this role, and because we are a start up with limited staff, my role has been consistently blurred to encompass a number of roles. Roles I have taken on for this position:

•Senior case manager supervisor
•Resource manager
•Donations manager
•Event planner
•Residential advocate 
•Donor engagement officer
•Project manager

I have enacted many policies, and put many projects into implementation. I work incredibly hard every day, most days being first in and last out. I work through almost every single weekend. Again, happy to do this. I love my life and have literally no social life. I'm happy to put in the effort. 

That all being said, my next review is coming up in about three weeks. I would like to approach my supervisor about obtaining a fairly significant raise. After doing some research on the internet, it seems like I make about 20k less than the median on the lowest paying of the jobs listed above. If you take all the jobs and average together their average salaries, I'm making about 50k less (I'm salary btw). 

I've never asked for nor negotiated a pay increase of anything close to this caliber. Is this even feasible? If it is, what is the best way to go about this? My bosses love me and give me pretty much everything I ask for. But I worry this would be pushing the envelope too far. So, any suggestions? I'm all ears. 

Tl;dr: making far below average for job being performed. Seeking advice on how to ask for significant raise.",lzharsh,6,1.0,6,1721540726,2024-07-21 05:45:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e8fb61/best_way_to_go_about_asking_for_raise_when/,7,2024
1e8ez2v,CNA or Preschool?,"Hello! Currently, I work at a daycare in the older preschool room (3-4 years old). My official job title is Teacher’s Assistant, but in the month I’ve been there, three teachers have left the job altogether in the room I’m in, including the girl who was pretty much viewed as the ‘main teacher’. I think that, since I’m pretty much the last one standing, I’m sort of being trained to take over the room on my own (with help, once they’re hired). I’ve been told I’m doing a great job, I really love working there, and when I interviewed I was told that raises are given every six months. However, this job is an hour away from where I live, pays minimum wage for my state (AZ), and pays the bills but I’m not really able to save or pay down my debt very efficiently. I am currently in school with the end goal of being an art teacher, preferably in a high school. My parents have brought up becoming a CNA, as there are multiple job opportunities that are much closer to home, and they are paid well with bonuses in my area. I know that if I were to follow that path, I would be much more comfortable financially and could really knock down my debt, but the thought of the healthcare field has always intimidated me, and I’m not sure if I would even be cut out for it. All of this to say, I’m not sure what path to choose for now. Sorry this was long, but even just typing it out helped a bit.

1e8e3rz,Advice on career dilemma ,"So for the last 2 years I've been creating my own career path within a large organisation. I was originally doing support/admin work and have spent the last two years assisting with overflow support/admin work but predominantly spending my time working on business operations (streamlining processes, developing/digitising systems etc) - basically the cog that links everything together.

I've since been offered two options for my next step (neither of which were in the business plan that we had agreed on last year, or are of much interest to me).

**Option 1:** to basically take over my old boss' job and manage the support/admin team to enable me to have some people management experience under my belt. However - I created a new role last year specifically so that I could get out of the support/admin work and do the more strategic stuff. I also don't think the team that I could inherit is a high performing team (I am often picking up their slack), so if I were to manage them I fear it would be difficult given I do not believe most of them are up to scratch, and if it were up to me then I would not have hired them. The team also has 6 people that I would be inheriting, and given I would be new to the management side of things, I feel like I would not only be taking on a difficult/low performing team (and cleaning up the mess the old manager left behind), but it would also be taking a lot of my time to people manage - when my passion sits within operational development.

**Option 2:** to continue the work that I am doing, but in another specialised area of the team and providing overflow support to a more senior team. This option I much prefer, however I know my boss would prefer me to take option 1 (I think part of the argument is that they would like to move the previous support/admin manager into a new role given they're not great at people management, and I have the respect and trust from the support/admin team). It's worth noting that the max number of counselees assigned to a single PM should be 3/4.

Keen to hear if I am just being entitled by not taking on the people management role to continue doing the work that I enjoy and had planned to do. Or if I am making a mistake and should knuckle down with option 1 to boost my career (it would be a 1-2 year stint as I definitely don't want to be doing this long term).",life_as_we_know_it1,1,1.0,0,1721536082,2024-07-21 04:28:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e8e3rz/advice_on_career_dilemma/,7,2024

1e8cw0p,Conflicted about which job offer to accept...,"I (24F) live in Philly but am moving back to NYC with my boyfriend and our dog soon, and I was recently laid off from a life sciences focused recruitment agency a few weeks ago (base salary was $65k and I didn’t make a lot of commission there due to the poor market, even though I worked my BUTT off). I had a few interview processes but it came down to two positions that moved me forward / I wanted to move forward with. I am conflicted which company's offer to accept because I really don’t know what is more priority. Here is how they both look broken down:

**1st offer - Company A (Received offer last Wednesday, need to respond by this Monday)**

- Healthcare company in the mental health clinic space

- Talent Acquisition Specialist title

- Base salary of $76,000, 20 days PTO/sick days, paid holidays, 401k + match, healthcare 

- Fully remote, with occasional travel to conferences (once or twice a year)

- Company size is around 300 people

**Pros:**

- Fully remote, I am an extroverted introvert at heart so I can be super social at times, but I am not a huge fan of being in the office and around people (would prefer being alone), I would be able to take better care of my poor mental health and have opportunities to explore NYC more

- Good way to get into internal recruitment (talent acquisition) which is an area I am curious about

- Not as stressful or time consuming

- Great opportunity to be in the mental health space (rewarding work)

- Seems like I would be a part of a great, supportive team

**Cons:**

- Not able to make as much commission/money ($2,500 commission per quarter)

- There are limited growth opportunities



**2nd offer - Company B (Received offer on Friday, need to respond by this Tuesday)**

- Recruitment agency in the financial market (insurance claims)

- Senior Consultant title

- Base salary of $70,000, 15 days PTO, 7 sick days, one week off between Christmas and New Years Day, paid holidays, 401k, healthcare

- 4 days on site (commute would be around \~45 minutes each way)

- Company size is around 800 people

**Pros:** 

- Can make a lot of commission (the average yearly commission for someone who is new to the company is around $40-$50k), I am an extremely hard worker so I feel like I could make a lot of money

- Ability to work with a great, supportive team (my potential manager's manager is the company's top biller and her manager is on of the global billers) and everyone was very nice (seems unlike your typical toxic recruitment company)

- Huge growth opportunities, people get promoted quite often

**Cons:**

- It is a 4 days on site, one day remote position with hours between 8:30-6:00 and we are expected to work after hours (but that is typical in this space so I'm not surprised) 

- I am worried my mental health will get a lot worse because of how hard I have to work and the stress I will have to endure.



So I guess the sum it up I either have to choose between more money and growth potential or remote flexibility and more relaxed....What do you think?

1e8cm2w,"Disliked at New Job, AITA?","TLDR: I suffer from social anxiety issues and started a new job this week. My shyness and awkward tendencies have alienated me from a warehouse of 50+ people who spent the last day of the work week actively avoiding me. I'm trying to wager the chances that my situation will get better however I have my doubts.

This week was a big deal for me because I started my first out-of-college job, in an industry that's very close to a passion of mine. This was my first 'big break' out of school that's providing me a livable wage and the opportunity to move up in a field I love. On my first day of meeting my coworkers, I noticed these guys have settled well into their own clique with interests very different from mine. They're all loud-spoken and confident in themselves, despite being relatively new like me. I introduced myself on our first break together and that's when the anxiety hits. I clam up and say virtually nothing for the rest of the day. They were sympathetic towards me which I really appreciated, though none of them could expect these lockjawed hours are a rather common occurrence for me and are plagued by stuttered, bumbling speech as I fight to regain control of my anxiety. It's like Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde. I'll be outgoing and jovial one half of the day, then completely shy and awkward for the rest. Let's just say Mr. Hyde's made his rounds throughout the warehouse this week and the consequences have been agonizing. 

As the week went on my team wanted nothing to do with me; some of these guys would walk to a different part of the warehouse or leave their chairs when I spoke or asked questions. I'll visit separate departments and some of the people there will walk away when they recognize me. 

Shit really hit the fan yesterday when I decided to break from the group. Our facility is currently experiencing a lot of downtime, so my team spent the majority of the day chatting with each other. I included myself as best I could however as the day went on their subjects seemed to get more exclusive; they talked about their private discord group chat (never sent me an invite) and the extensive D&D campaign they plan on playing together over the weekend. It came to a point where I couldn't include myself without being a nuisance. So I stepped away and decided to study procedures as best I could at the computer. The lead trainer, who had been the most forgiving and polite throughout the week, finally broke through and began giving me the cold shoulder too. He accused me of having shown up late even though I hadn't, we pulled up my timesheet (which proved that I was on time every day other than the first day, when I hadn't even learned how to clock in yet) then he walked off. He chatted with the team for the last hour of our shift while I still hung around at the computer trying to recuperate. Once we clocked out, I tried to apologize and explain my quiet behavior to him as he passed by. He flat-out ignored me and kept walking. None of the teammates said goodbye to me either.

Aside from that incident, there's been other off-putting encounters I've had at this job. A dude from another department said I resembled a famously obese cartoon character and made remarks as doughnuts were brought in on the last day of work (""you should have another one OP!""). One of my team members openly made sexual comments about a lady coworker as she stood no more than ten feet away from us during a training session. I understand that this is a warehouse environment, yet despite my own shortcomings I'm really starting to believe I might be the only adult here. Is there any use in staying longer than another week if things don't pan out?

1e8ck2e,Told my work is trash,"Hi everyone currently I’m an intern and a big company and doing data analysis for the company. But I’ve been told basically that my work was trash. Despite the crazy amount of hours I have put into it. 

My internship lasts about 2 months and during this time, I been mostly working on was project that should have taken me a week for the past 4 weeks. This has been due to inpart to many blockades I have experienced since starting. For example, not having access to the database where what I needed was stored. Also my manager being on vacation for the beginning  part of my internship and is leaving again(which I understand and don’t hold against him. Everybody should be able to use their allotted vacation time.). So as I’ve been going through the project I have made many mistakes some of which I own like one my excel formulas having a typo and this led to me having skewed results. Another example of a hurdle I’ve faced is being told who I can reach out to for the data I would need, me doing so and not getting reply’s. When I finally do get a reply they tell me that it doesn’t exist….  I relay this to my manger when he finally came back he sends an email and within 2 hours all of sudden the data is in my inbox. Along with this much of the data required having weird naming conventions which could not be intuitively inferred unless you’ve been at the company for years. Also, none of my coworkers would be able to help because it’s not their background or expertise. I’ve quite literally been told they don’t know how to do it.

This is all occurring while I’m working on multiple other projects at the same time.

I am quite literally working on the weekends to comb over everything in an attempt catch up. Running through the presentation with multiple people so I can catch any errors before presenting to my manager. Reading tons of research articles, all of this done for my work to be equated to trash…I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I’m quite literally doing everything i possibly can and it’s still not enough. How do I even proceed, i don’t think they will want to hire me after all of this which sucks but im fine with it. I am definitely more than capable of completing this work but there are SO many things you wouldn’t know unless you’ve been at the company for a while. 

If you read this far thank you for reading, it became more of a rant but I really am at a loss of how to improve my work. And basically show them I’m not incompetent.

I believe that if the company were to fire them, that would either free up cash for raises or free up space for better contributors. 

My boss is very much so the “Michael Scott” type. He is a super nice guy, so I’m concerned with suggesting this since it might make me seem like a jerk. I also personally like some of the under performers, but I think the company would be better off if we let them go.

I’m stuck because at my current job i’ve only ever asked to work from home BUT my manager has always given me a reason as to why i can’t do it but my other team members can. i’m overworked and i cannot keep working at this company because not only am i overly relied on i feel as i’m being taken advantage of. now, with all that it does have its perks…i’m able to fuck up as much as i can, i know my job inside out, and i love the people i get to work with…but this new job is sounding so promising. although permanence isn’t assured I’d like to venture out and see whats there but I don’t know what to expect from this new job especially since it’s so unreliable with it being contract and all.

I’ve spoken to my manager and mentioned that I’D love to stay but all he could offer me is 1 day to work from home…and it felt like a slap in the face because I’m so well liked throughout the user community but it felt like they didn’t even try to keep me. It’s obviously my fault for expecting something from them. I’m also really stuck because my job is really flexible but I feel like this might opportunity might look amazing on a resume. One more thing…for the contract job it’s 9-6, 5 days a week, and national holidays are covered. Anyway, I’m not sure what to do and I’d love to hear what you guys have to say.

TLDR; found a contract job at a fortune 500 company, pays really well, and will look really good on a resume…BUT i’d be leaving a stable job that overworks me and i have flaky teammates.

Despite my pretty heavy STEM background, I’ve always been somewhat interested in exploring the business/collaboration fields. I did a medtech internship after graduating and a supervisor told me that my personality was very social and had a hard time envisioning me working in a lab-type environment (they were definitely correct to a good extent). During the internship, I was told that I was extremely punctual with emails, good at setting up meetings, good at researching key figures/getting business information, and set up key collaborations with another company.

1e88rac,Should I take the job offer?,"I recently had a job kind of fall into my lap. A friend works for a local distribution center where an AP person is leaving. She really believes I will like this job and had me send her my resume but didn’t expect anything to come of it. She swore that I would and that I had the experience for it. News flash I don’t.

I currently work in AP processing where I enter invoices for an ambulatory surgery center. I wear a lot of hats. I check in patients for 2 hours then go work on medical records and AP invoice entry the rest of the day. I really enjoy the invoice entry the most. I do want to note I have unmedicated ADHD and bipolar type 2 that I am medicated for.

This job seems to be all accounting and the back half of what I do for AP.  They liked my resume and had me fill out an application. They called me for an interview and it was two hours long and I seemed to do well. I wasn’t too happy that they couldn’t answer some simple questions such as what the job really entailed or their management style. They told me what I would be doing but couldn’t describe it in detail. I don’t really feel like they sold me the job. From what I’ve gathered it’s doing bank drafts, check runs, checking statements, and booking of some sort. When I walked in it was dark and all the cubicles had no decorations or personal items. The whole area was just dark and barren. It’s business casual but way more professional than where I’m from.

I was offered the job 2 days later. The pay would be $25 an hour. The benefits and insurance would be the same as what’s offered to newbies at my current job. I would get 1 week pto for a year then move to 2 weeks after that year. I believe it was 1 week esl. They have 7 holidays and one freebie.  Currently, I make $20.18 an hour and I get 3 weeks pto that rolls over each year(currently have 24 days saved). My esl is the same and I’ve accrued 80 days worth over the 8 years I’ve been here. My current jobs is very relaxed and laid back. We wear scrubs and can socialize, have phones out, and goof off. I can listen to head phones. I tend to work fast and set my own goals and dead lines. This new place is a much more professional no nonsense work fast and quiet kind of place. They made it very clear it was fast paced and we’re concerned I didn’t truly understand how fast paced it is. She was concerned about my excel skills but couldn’t tell me what it was I might need of them. My hours right now are 6am-230pm which I love since I can get a lot done and miss traffic. Accounting I would have to go back to the 9-5 grind.  


I’m struggling to make a decision. Neither job has any room for growth into management. The accounting MAY lead to a HR position way down the road. This new job might also give me an opening to find other places that will allow me to move up, but there’s no guarantee of that. I’ve allowed my boss to counter offer and she knows she can give me $23 an hour and is trying to push HR for at least another dollar or .50cents. I’ve been teetering back and forth on the fence about to taking this job or not. I’m afraid I will get into this new job and be bored causing me to lose focus and make mistakes. I’m not sure if this is the right job for some one with ADHD. I’ve got till Monday afternoon when my boss makes her final counter offer to respond. I’ve been so stressed I’ve been disassociating.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

1e88f89,"M20 film major, can’t think of back up plan ","Like the title says I really want to have a secure backup plan if my Hollywood stardom dream doesn’t work out. I’m currently a community college student transferring to a film school in LA, I like operating cameras and acting. I believe with my hard work and drive I’ll make it far in the industry, but if all fails I’d like something to fall on. I’m someone who’s really kind, approachable, nice. I notice no matter where I am I draw attention to myself, I believe my height and skin plays a part. People say I’m naturally charismatic and have a “light” to my personality. I’m good at holding conversations with people. I do on the other hand ironically have a listening learning disability, I don’t let it affect me but at times I can’t stop my mind from wandering. Growing up my grades were poor, when I was evaluated during my senior year of high school my grades improved after getting the resources I needed but it felt too late. 

When it comes to school Film is the only thing that interests me, growing up I was dealt with trauma at school and home. Film, TV, and sports were my escape. PE, broadcasting, journalism, and some science were the only classes that interests me. Asking for this advice is tricky since I’m just a rambling redditor, I’m just wondering if anyone has advice/been in a similar predicament and if you were someone like me, who wants the privilege to have a career that allows you to travel alot please let me know :)",BackgroundTop7827,0,0.5,0,1721517507,2024-07-20 23:18:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e88f89/m20_film_major_cant_think_of_back_up_plan/,7,2024
1e876p2,Been offered an opportunity and unsure whether to take it,"Hey all - looking for some advice to a situation I'm currently facing. For context, 31M and happily married with a house that has a mortgage on it. Partner and I both work FT.

I'm a current government FT employee earning 120k, working within the data analysis/commercial asset space. It's a pretty chill job - good coworkers, good WLB and a very relaxed working model (2 days in office but nobody bats an eye if I come in once a week). Office is an hour away door-to-door so it's in a relatively convenient location. It isn't all rainbows and sunshine though - I had been waiting years for a promotion that was promised to me and due to budget/restructuring issues was constantly getting shafted. Also, the nature of the work itself is slowly transitioning away from my core skills and interests. I've been here for 4 years now and I've had some people tell me it's time to start thinking about my next move if I don't want my career to fizzle out.

I've just received an opportunity to join another department until May next year on a fixed term role. This is also government but the pay is about $40k more than what I'm currently on and is a substantial title upgrade (from manager to associate director). The work being offered is more along my core skillset and seems quite interesting. I have been told that they will allow me to go on secondment from my home team.

However, I do not think my home team will release me for this contract. I will have a chat with them this week but I have already been sort of notified they are generally against this sort of stuff. I do possess skills that are both crucial and unique to only me within this team and I am considered rather indispensable. I'm not sure if that's enough for them to refuse me to leave even for a short while, though. Therefore, I have a decision I need to make: do I still accept the role if I am not granted a secondment?

Way I see it, here are the pros/cons of accepting the new role (if secondment isn't granted):

Pros:

- Higher pay and job title

- More interesting work

- Opportunity to move to another team (been in my current team 4 years - risk of getting stale)

  
Cons:

- Limited term opportunity (if I accept this role, I will be out of a job next April and the way the current job market is atm, this makes me very very nervous to leave a permanent role to take a fixed term role)

- 2 hour commute each way for me to get to the office (albeit still unsure of working model of this team, if it's 2 days in office then that isn't so bad I guess - any more than that and it starts turning into a problem)

- More demanding in terms of hours and responsibilities 

  
I have a good relationship with my director so I'm hoping that they will understand my situation and allow me to move over for a bit. If I am given a secondment, then all the above is moot (since it's temporary, the last two cons I can deal with for a bit) - just need to prepare myself for the very real chance it won't be given to me.

  
Any advice (or what you would do in my shoes) would be appreciated!",quantumloopy,1,0.6600000262260437,1,1721514013,2024-07-20 22:20:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e876p2/been_offered_an_opportunity_and_unsure_whether_to/,7,2024
1e86v00,Should I step down from my role?,"I have been assigned a technical lead role in the Agile sense, which is supposed to be a role where you are effectively the lead engineer on a team and are supposed to help the agile management with understanding the work, as well as lead team of engineers to complete  a project.  

I am not the subject matter expert in this area, there is software architect who did the high level design, and has written a lot of the legacy code which is a part of this project.  I feel totally equipped to lead the team to a successful end product, and in my mind I would go to the architect when his expertise is needed.  He is overall a very busy person, and this one project is just one of the many blips on his radar.  

Why I would consider stepping down is for a few reasons.  The role is very grey, and feels like it changes all of the time.  It’s like the product owner and scrum master have started trying to go over me when needed to make calls on stories or planning, when I was under the impression that was one of my prime responsibilities. 

Another reason is that the architect also, when he is less busy, decides he would like his control back, and essentially just overrides everything I want to do or say.  It’s very frustrating, and when he’s too busy, he just delegates again.  

Lastly, I am to continue doing the same amount of work as my team members, and often still output more deliveries than them, while also maintaining this role.  For this next batch of changes we have to make, it involves multiple new subject matters that I have not been given the opportunity to learn.

1e844f5,Getting out of a long mental health rut. Need advice for types of jobs & places to apply to,"I'll just give you the main details in bullet points (sry for rambling):
- I haven't worked in over a year due to various mental health issues and what not
- I have a BA in International Relations - Global Security, graduated 6 years ago and haven't had a job that utilizes it
- Have about 9 years of on and off experience working in videography, news, film production, and photography
- On top of trying to figure out my life going forward I'm in the middle of an existential crisis as well, lol. I have many interests but always struggle to make decisions and stick with them. I want to dabble in everything instead of specializing in one narrow area.
- I live in the Portland metro area
- I own my car and my own video/photography equipment, having done some freelance work in the past but not extensively
- Have considered going back to school for something in STEM or business, but still undecided. Also have thought about looking into doing a course at a local uni to dip my toes in first.
- I struggle with identity issues a lot which makes all of this especially frustrating. I second guess and doubt myself frequently.
- I'm single w/o dependents
- I have a bit of credit card debt (<$10,000), but nothing else. But I am cash-broke atm as well
- Once I start working I plan on minimizing my spending until I pay off the cc debt
- I think I like to travel and still want to see more of the world. I speak conversational Farsi but it's very rusty. This is where I considered going back for a business degree, to work at some international firm


- I believe to summarize, I understand I need any immediate job to pay rent and expenses, but I'm worried (anxiety) that I'll get stuck wherever that is and that I won't ""live up to my potential"". I like the idea of eventually working freelance video/photography which would allow me to travel and work at home.

1e83eei,Working at a job that I took out of helplessness and now I am stuck here ft. Terrible Boss. ,"
Bit of Context: I am a pandemic graduate (in 2021) and have always faced a sh*t ton of struggles trying to land a decent job. Won’t go into the details of what happened there, but I ended up at a company which is entirely different from what my educational background and career interests are. Against my better judgement I ended up picking this job over a much more exciting one because this seemed “more safe”. I have tried to love my job, I have tried to delicate myself fully to this work, but even after being at this company for almost 2 years, a good number of the people here don’t know what I do, or who I am. I work tirelessly in building up the company visibility and yet there is no appreciation for it at all. A lot of the information that is important for my work, gets passed over me and I always find out from other sources. So not only am I being under appreciated, I am also overlooked and prevented from doing my job. 

Coming to my boss, I’ll use “they/them”. They were really nice to me in my early months of joining and then it was like a flipped switch! They too withhold important work related information from me and then get visibly annoyed that I am not aware of such a thing. They believe I am slacking and need to work harder and generate even further leads (than i already have, which they clearly can’t see).  This company is a very small sized place with hardly any recognition in the market so I’m doing the best I can, with the limited resources provided to me (because budget cuts smh!). This person would show up for ONLY an hour or two, few days a week and has believes the rest of us employees are incompetent. They also sarcastically berate and/or mock me in front of clients and dismiss it off as a joke and the clients seem to be positively awestruck with this human. I have also received ridiculous demands of what I should and shouldn’t do at every constant step. Now there is no point in involving the HR because the HR worships my Boss. And my Boss is the owner of the company too. 

I have tried diligently working to make my boss happy and also help the company grow, but the constant reminder that I am so far from measuring up is getting to me now and I wish to quit. But there is no other company that would hire me as entry level jobs require 3-4yrs of experience minimum. 

TL;DR: I never liked my job but still trying to be good but boss is an assh*le and narcissistic. Can’t quit this job because job market is terrible. 

Please be respectful in the comments I do not need any sarcasm or further berating. I am genuinely looking for advice.

1e82mlu,Finish Grad School or drop out and find another career path,"I'm 40 years old and considering making a complete career switch to commercial real estate.  I finished one year of grad school for a MSRE degree but I wasnt really enjoying certain aspects of the program (people/networking etc...) and I started getting concerned that I might end up taking on too much debt since the incoming class was twice the size of my class and we would all be competing for the same scholarships and grants.  At the end of the first year I ended up $10k in student loans but depending on the scholarship situation I could end up with another 30k for the second year.  I already have 40k in student loan debt from a pretty much worthless undergrad liberal arts degree.  

My biggest issue is my current career which has terrible hours and is very labor intensive with a relatively low earning potential.  I probably make 60k-70k and to break 100k I'd never be home.  I also have a kid and live in a high col area.  The positives are that I get to make my own schedule and I work in a pretty cool industry (entertainment) compared to a desk job.  Unfortunatly its a young mans game and I got into the biz in my 30s.  I also have no benefits.

All things considered I want to make a career change but Im not sure where to go considering my age.  The two career paths I was considering were software engineer, which I think fits my personality well (I've taken all the prereq cs classes needed to transfer to a 4 year but got cold feet because I was concerned about debt amonst other things) and Commercial Real Estate (development or appraisal).  I'm also open to any other career paths that have a decent work life balance and have good earning potential.

The ended hiring resumed for graduated with no experience towards the end of 2022, the gap by then was almost 2 years and after that due to some emergency I had to take a gap year of another year and a half. So, now everywhere I apply companies either keep rejecting my application or they reply that they can't hire because of no work experience and the gap years on top of that which makes sense.

I don't know how to overcome this situation. The worst part is that they are offering 2400USD a year at entry level and the growth isn't that promising because a uni senior of mine is getting paid around 5500USD after 5 years of work experience which is far from ideal.

I don't know what can I do now, I am lost. Is career switch an option? That's funny though because I haven't had a career to begin with lol. What should I do?

1e80jld,quitting job to get different hours/availability at a different one?,"alright so I got my first ever job at Wendy’s, but I am not a fan of the hours I work (6-8 till closing). I chose them at first because I thought I would still be in school when I started working (which wasn’t the case). There are also many cases where I am coming in far earlier than the hours I chose. From what I hearmost jobs disallow you from changing availability or hours for at least half a year (I’ve only been working for about a month), so I am considering looking for a job elsewhere so I can get different hours/availability. Since it is fast food I am sure they don’t care much, but I am wondering if this is even a good idea at all.

1e7yu3e,Getting over string of bad jobs and the worst year of my life at company that bring new meaning to toxic ,"Hi, I have found myself struggling last year being out of work following dismissal from very toxic company (how toxic 73% turnover rate, and at least two employees hospitalised during my 7 months in company, including myself where fired in emergency room). I have been trying make a recovery and the biggest challenges has been my mental health, which trying address but at the same time being out work with no safety nets is huge barrier to that so I determined get back in work but also aim to avoid another bad job as I just be repeating cycle and prior to layoff that and lack of direction has been the biggest issue. 

I started career in 2016 with admin role which stayed two years, I then bounced between admin roles not making progress as I had no support in the roles and my focus was placed on family issues, that occured 2016 well in 2021. Following one toxic job where micro managed and despite being green to industry was offered no training and despite minimum wage was walking out office at 8 or 9 most days. I jumped to another admin role for same salary just because it beat what was on offer. This one was shambles but I was given automony over my work, so I able to make changes digitalise records, create a adhoc ats system use that to bring in a full ats system, streamline holiday process down from 6 hours to one hour. However I soon found myself a big fish small pond and lack direction, to point while I was trying negotiate getting ATS system, I was looking into data analytics and back end programming in case I had to build one from scratch. 

I would take a new job in mortgage industry as operations manager, but that more in name only, as I would implement new process only have then shot down or undermined at each stage. I refined to mortgage application so you would have one point of contact at each stage to make easier for customer to ensure accountability and reduce mistakes. Instead told to change it back how it was before and ensure better results. Yes I was told I could not make changes but I had to produce better results from processes. Over time I found myself a jack of all trades, an operations manager, hiring manager, office manager, administrator, marketer all in one and as turn over continued I was doing more and more work for no compensation, unsure what do as I had so many things thrown at me I simple could not cope and at 120 hours week burned out. 

Since leaving the company, I had two jobs a factory job and admin both worked to contract ended otherwise, have been volunteering handling local concerts and community events and while unpaid love every bit.  I do want to pursue events and project management however I am struggling. I am deemed to over qualified for most entry or apprentice jobs( also financially I live alone no family) so I need something that pays okish at least for now. I have management experience but lack of support and size of company means a lot of it was problem solving other incompetence. 

I am however quick to adapt to new situations, able to problem solve, can pick up new IT systems and process quickly, and do have masters education, if that help in business management.

1e7xgiy,On the verge of ending it.,"

Gen1 advice needed.

I've been back and forth on negative-positive feedback with my client for almost 2 months now.

He didn't give me anything to work with since Tuesday and when I came on Thur(after national holidays), I sent them an email and 2 messages asking them if he needed extra help or assistance and if there was further feedback on my work. Got the response ""I don't have time""

I was pissed. And yes that did lead to me being frustrated and reaching out to my line manager. I did also reply to them while I was waiting on LM. Tried to get back to neutral state to say ""ok, but I'd appreciate if you'd let me know beforehand if there are no tasks, or give me something to research in order to improve our process.""

When the SS reached the support team, they deemed this response inappropriate and eligible for warning.

DIFU that bad? And what can I do further? I got this job after a career break and searching for 2 months, and everyone knows job market sucks everywhere rn. What are my options? (More than generic 'keep looking'. I've been passive hunting here and there but don't get replies or even rejections anymore)

 How do I also convey that I'm (yet again) disappointed by this client, and despite getting back up from my previous mistakes it feels like I'm walking on eggshells with my company and they'll call just about anything I do a bit by instinct as wrong?",Beneficial_Day_6459,1,1.0,0,1721487269,2024-07-20 14:54:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e7xgiy/on_the_verge_of_ending_it/,7,2024

1e7wm1t,Forgetting emails: how embarrassing is that at work?,"I've been at my job for 20+ years, and we've used Microsoft Outlook for work emails for the entire time.  The search function doesn't always work; we have a remote system, and whenever you search for an old email, such by looking for a phrase or a sender name, often it doesn't turn up.  (The email inbox searches for a while and then a message appears, stating that nothing was found and that I should search the server, or something).

So I have a problem: my job involves keeping track of minor details of things that are emailed, but it's impossible to retrieve old emails.  So very often I'll get caught by a client or colleague in that I won't remember that something was sent to me.

For example, yesterday a key client emailed me a document and said, ""Can you check to confirm that this is the same document that you approved before?""  I did a quick email search and the document didn't come up, so I responded, ""I'll take a look right now, although I don't believe that I've seen it before.""

The key client then forwarded my original email to me, from 2022, approving the document. 

That's really embarrassing.

So:

**1. How serious is the mistake of forgetting emails that you received or sent before?**

2. If you have to keep track of emails from the past 20 years (or other very long period), how do you?

1e7vywu,How can i find new career based on my experience?,"Hi,

I'll be 29 this year, and my life really changed since last year. For the last 3 years I was working for IT company as developer, but unfortunatelly we got closed by the end of 2023. At first, I really thought that this may be blessing in disguise - I started to get some stress related health problems, enviroment in this company was really toxic, and I thought that because I'm no longer considered a junior developer, I'll have no problems in finding new job in the field.

Since the day of getting closed, I've sent CV and Portfolio to every job offer that I could have find. I landed some interviews which I think went ok, but never ended up getting any offers - neither me, nor my friends who were working with me. After couple of months I landed a corporate job in completly different field, which means I'm starting from the point 0.

This job in itself is not that bad (some basic accounting stuff), but I feel like I should be doing something else? I would like to find some path that allows me to take my experience as Front End Developer or as accountant but I don't know what should I look for? Are there positions in marketing that will consider my experience valuable? Or should I just try again as developer, even though, I feel bad about my skills after few months of not using them? Do you have any advise what field may see my skills as valuable?

1e7vuzf,Can Being a Doctor Lead You Elsewhere?,"
I recently took the university entrance exam, and my results weren't as good as I expected. I was considering studying molecular biology and genetics, but I'm worried about job security since my family doesn't want me to end up unemployed. They believe that if I don't get into a top university for this field, I'll struggle to find a job. I also thought about engineering, but it seems that unless you graduate with top rankings, job security isn't guaranteed either.

My family wants me to become a doctor because of the job security it offers, but I don't feel inclined towards it. I'm not particularly interested in human anatomy or the medical field. I might end up liking it if I attend medical school, but it's a risk. In my country, medical school takes six years (plus residency and specialization, which means you reach your 30s). This long and intense journey, combined with factors like long working hours and the experiences shared by doctors who advise against choosing medicine, has made me hesitant.

What I want to know is if studying medicine would allow me to pursue biology through a master's degree or something similar. My career aspirations involve helping the planet, working on recycling projects, conducting plant research, and generally focusing on reducing human impact on the environment. I was aiming for a lab-focused career. While I know medicine isn't directly related, I'm hoping someone with experience can share their insight.

I don't want to lose hope because of my current situation. I also plan to go abroad after or during my medical studies, but I'm not familiar with the systems in other countries.

1e7unfg,Careers where you can be 20-30 min late and make up the time later?,"Some jobs fire you if you're 5 minutes late. Other jobs let you come in 30 min late or early, as long as you're there for core hours and make up any missed time by the end of the day or by the end of a 1 to 2 week period. They call it ""flexi-time"". I have ADHD and the biggest stress and barrier to progression in any job is getting there on time, rather than the actual work of the job itself (the quality of my work sometimes protects me from being fired).

 Some organisations or fields put the cart before the horse, and get rid of great employees who are making the company more productive, just because they're not there at 9am sharp everyday, due to the management being stubborn about following tradition. They'll literally keep stupid or lazy employees who get in at 9am sharp over someone doing double the work but who gets in at 9:15am. Other job fields simply require people to be in on time, due to the nature of the work (eg a manager of a shop needs to be there to open it on time).

Which careers are more flexible with their start time? Or what are common attributes of these careers? (Eg ""all jobs involving X have that flexibility"").

1e7twet,Which career/courses to choose? (easy work),"Hi! I’m in my early twenties and this summer I was thinking of attending some sort of courses. The thing is that I absolutely hate going out/outside and I want to mostly relax so I’m only open to attending 1-2 courses, each one of them once per week.


As a career I really only want to do minimal work, least amount of hours possible (absolute max 20h per week) for okayish pay. I’ll forever live with my parents so in the future I’ll either work part-time or be self-employed (which I’ll greatly prefer since I’ll be able to make my own schedule!). 


As for courses I have some self-employed career options, some normal career options and some fun options. Not sure what to pick tho and would like an opinion! I was thinking 1 self-employed option + 1 fun option? Tell me your thoughts tho and keep in mind some I’d prefer more than others (for example artist > photographer because I get to stay home, don’t have to interact with ppl and don’t have to stand up). 


I tried to list them from most preferred to least, altho it’s hard when it comes down to the fun options. Keep in mind I wouldn’t enjoy any of them as a job (not passionate) and just want to treat work as work. Two of them I wouldn’t take courses for, I just included them as self-employed options just for advice (tarot reader and voice chat „friend”). The fun options wouldn’t really lead to a career, they’re just for fun, altho some could (like giving piano lessons, but I easily get overly stimulated by noise). You can also suggest something else, but no sex work, nothing illegal, no betting and no physical jobs. You may suggest slightly immoral things tho. I’m not from the US if that matters and my major is accountancy (which I find boring). Thank you! 


1. Self-employed options: artist, photographer, make-up artist, tarot reader (I already know how to do this), voice chat „friend” (talk to lonely ppl; no video, nothing weird or sexual)


2. Normal career options: programming (which I find interesting, but idk in which direction to go; heard data analysts only work 2-4h per day), please suggest other easy options


3. Fun options: piano, learning how to build pcs, sewing lessons, singing, swimming, Italian lessons",More_Picture6622,0,0.5,2,1721476409,2024-07-20 11:53:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e7twet/which_careercourses_to_choose_easy_work/,7,2024
1e7tnxp,Job offer vs salary : should I accept the offer?,"Hi guys! I’m working for an insurance company as a technical support team supervisor and I got a job offer at the actuary as a business analyst. I’ve got to know the actuary team as I’m often helping them provide support to insurance agents regarding premiums and they say that my experience in IT would be beneficial to them. 

Here are the pros and cons from each job : 

My current job :
* My tasks are very diverse and I’m really not bored
* I feel like I can make a difference 
* I have responsibilities 
* I have an amazing team
* The pay is great
* But maybe my skills could be put to better use as I sometimes feel overqualified 

Job offer : 
* It would open doors for me as I don’t have experience in actuary or insurance 
* I currently love helping the actuary so I’d really like to further my skills
* A step up in my career
* But the job might be a bit monotone / boring as it would mainly consist of quality assurance
* The pay…

Here’s the deal about the pay, they’re offering the same salary, but a salary scale down from mine, meaning that my new salary scale would have a maximum that is 17k less than my current one. Also, this new scale has a target salary that I’ve already passed, meaning my pay increases each year would be much less than if I keep my current job. I have not yet reach my salary target, so I’m increasing rapidly each year until I reach it. 

What should I do? Take this job as it’s an opportunity that would open doors for me, or keep the same job that I like and that pays well?

I’m in my early thirties so I feel like now’s the time to try new things. I don’t really have long term goals career wise, other than being happy, having a great pay and making a name for myself.

I'll was leaving on Wednesday after 8 hours and my foreman spotted me leaving through the mess room and asked why i was going. I tried to tell the foreman I only wanted to work 10 hours of overtime a week because of the tax problems any more would cause me and I planned on doing an extra two hours the following day and 8 hours on Saturday. He then started going on about how my training was a waste of time if I don't do more than 10 hours extra a week. I think he was insinuating I work 60 hour weeks or something. This was in the mess room in front of others.

The following day I was leaving again after 8 hours, I decided not to work the overtime that day because the foreman annoyed me the day prior. When I was getting changed, I heard another employee speaking to someone else saying ""he's leaving early, the foreman annoyed him, I'm going to have to tell him because he just refuses to work the hours, he says it's because of tax but we all have to pay tax"" (as if his income is comparable to mine somehow)

This is typical behavour concerning overtime in work. They try every underhand tactic to get you to work as much as possible. Fake deadlines, pressure tactics by making you sign your hours down for the weeks ahead while the managers go around in groups watching you do so, low level bullying........it's like dealing with a bunch of 5 year olds.

1e7odla,My Chinese Father Has a Complete Different View of Working and Suggests I'm Dreaming While I Want to Restart My Career Path at Age 28. Am I really Wrong?,"Hi people,

First, thanks for taking the time to read this post.

I'm 28 years old, and I worked in pricing and credit risk at a bank, but I lost my job. I feel like I'm on a career path that doesn't fit me as the current job is more technical, and I work independently. My goal of life was and has been to develop people skills and advance my cognitive abilities. I felt my job limited me in a small world of auto finance, and all I learned was technical skills. 

So, I want to replan my career by researching what I truly want to do and what skills are required to break into the field. I figured I wanted to be a VC, and I would like to invest both time and money to get there. I believe it's never too late to start, and I have the cash to support myself for another degree. I decided to work for a little while, then earn an MBA degree and learn other skills along the way, and then I could have a chance to break into the VC world.

So I have this conversation with my father. But he quickly told me I was dreaming and this was not realistic. He said he felt ashamed that he could talk me into just finding a normal job and living a normal life. He said he've seen a lot of people dreaming big and achieve nothing, and he doesn't know how to stop me from dreaming. 

Am I really wrong, should I just accept the fact that I shall work in the current industry and stop thinking about careers that is hard to break into(eg VC)?

A bit of background of me: I grew up in China until I was 18 years old. I finished my bachelor's degree at MSU and have a degree in business analytics at SMU. I have jumped from position to position and believe I have the ability to adapt to any situation. If I die and start reflecting on my life, I'd rather die trying instead of giving up. But my father's reaction(and some of my friends too) really makes me think maybe I'm the one daydreaming.

Is it me delusional, or am I just not too confident about myself?

1e7mq28,Career Advice,"Medicated ADHD Australian GEN Z Male looking for career advice with the below information as guiding material for feedback.

  
I have been at a cross-roads for about 2 years trying to pick a career path for studying professional Qualifications.

  
I am looking to develop skills and not be limited to a minimum wage award and forever be classified as an 'excess employee', or subjected to 'No Right of Return' contracts and 100% in-office working conditions  whilst other members are at home leaving me to do 2 1/2 times my workload of others. 

  
Context: I have Vocational Education and Training (VET), Achieved a CERT III, IV in Business which were free thanks to Australian Government FeeFree Scheme at Registered Training Organisations.

Parameters: I am not looking for an Engineer, Scientist, Medical or Educational qualification pathway which pretty much leaves Business.

  
However,  Business degrees seem to be generic and not really worthwhile, job search databases like SEEK, INDEED, JORA and agencies like Randstad, Adzuna etc, cross-referenced with Jobs and Skills Atlas have built a strong picture of the current and future job vacancies and demands. However, it is not enough to determine if jobs within the Business Industry are feasible and stable. 

  
In Addition to my research because Australia uses Modern Awards which also assists with businesses developing classifications and definitions for their position descriptions \[Justifying the point of minimum wage jobs based on qualifications, both Private Sector and Public Sector are almost matched. Seems to not  really value experience in terms of pay entitlements unless its for a professional role but is more of a requirement as a Business Policy but pay is dictated by Modern  Awards, means pay cannot really be negotiated as an employee\]. I have had a long look at the Pay And Conditions Tool (PACT - Fair Work Ombudsman) and National Employment Standards confirms this. 



Job Advertisements in Australia:  
Be Aware and take into consideration the previous comment, when you see jobs for advertisement for example; A job with a range of 57000-85000, makes it look attractive and businesses do not disclose the modern award related to the position description until after the interview and reference check process. It's only when you receive an 'offer'. Therefore unless you are a HR specialist and know how to navigate modern awards and relate it to a businesses' adaptation for a position description that you have applied for, there is no way to tell or even negotiate expected salary. It is almost certainly going to be dictated by the Minimum Wage specified in the relevant Modern Award within the National Employment Standards. You will usually receive an offer at the minimum amount e.g $57000. 

Modern Award Qualification payment rates (GENERAL):  
  
Average Vocational Education and Training qualifications lead to jobs that will pay you 28-29.00 AUD an hour with a CERT III-CERT IV, a Diploma with years of working experience is around 30-31.00 an Hour. 

  
Most  Professional job's require a minimum of a Bachelor of Business, with a master's of Business being preferred for jobs that pay $35-40.00 AUD an hour.

\*Tax is calculated using Australian Tax Office 'Money Smart Tax income calculator'.  
  
Annual Income incl taxed income FULL-Time working conditions.

28.00 = 58,240 : - 9,395 = 47,681

29.00 = 60,320 : - 10,071 = 49,043

30.00 = 62,400 : - 10,747 = 50,405

31.00 = 64,480 : - 11,423 = 51,768

35.00 = 69,160 : - 12,944 = 54,833

40.00 = 79,040 : - 16,155 = 61,305

  
Doing This means you have to rack up approximately $104,000 AUD \[40,000 For Bachelor of Business + MBA 64,000\] Keep in mind indexation of Uni Debts to match inflation approximately 4.7-7.1% \[Using the Lowest rate\], is 4888.00 AUD in Interest Per Annum. 

Entering the workforce with a Bachelor's to fund your pursuit of a Master's in Business Administration.

Most Government jobs starts off a HR Consultant or Assistant Business Partner at 31.00 an hour this means with the added cost of compulsory University Qualification (Here is a breakdown):

  
ATO Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) compulsory repayment rates based on income range is:  
64,480 \* 0.02 = 1,289.6 =  

+ Indexation interest on a Bachelor degree, approximately:

40,000 \* 0.047 = 1880.00

SUM = 3,169.6:

Therefore your annual income is the following:

64,480 - 3169.6 = 61,311 (29.48 PER HOUR)

Income Tax = 61,311  - 10,393 

= 49,692.00 Is what you would bring home a year. 

This is an unlivable wage as the median rent for an 'AFFORDABLE' apartment or old broken heritage house  even in Adelaide is 550-600 a week. (550\*52 =  28,600 

SUM = 49,692 - 28,600 = 21,092 (You will need to share an apartment or House  = \[14,300\].

I’m willing to work hard, smart and personable…but have a tricky family situation. I’ve been basically financially independent since 18 but my old career (modeling) has slowed down for me a ton and it’s time for me to move on. My parents want to help me by offering to give me support with paying for school or getting me into the family business (hospitality) but they are incredibly homophobic and I’m a (semi closeted) gay woman. I can’t decide if I would prefer to thug it out in my own and figure out if I should go back to school, get into a trade, or lean into the NGO side of volunteer work I’ve done (although I’ve tried and it’s been hard to get a job with my qualifications). I’m exhausted and want to be able to accept help from my family but I know it’s extremely conditional and somewhat dangerous. I know that this is a bit all over the place but I think the core questions are really, 1. Should I go back to school if I’m not sure yet what I want to do? 2. Should I take the risk of getting involved in a business that might blow up in my face because it’s precarious to work with family…

1e7kimy,Is This A Good Idea? Mid-Life Crisis Advice.,"I know things are complex and none of you can ""see"" the future, but I don't have anybody to talk to right now so any, uh, career advice would be greatly appreciated! I will try to not give an autobiography.

So, I'm a 40 yo male living in a ""college town"" (major Big 10 university). I've been working a crap job at the school for 3 years so I attend their online school for free. I have a bacholer's degree from another school but have never ""used"" it. I have a paralegal cert. from the online school, but, uh.... didn't really learn anything and don't know if I actually want to do that with my life. Okay, quick back story. Oh, and I have an extreme disability/epilepsy. I have seizures all the time. I've spent two weeks so far this year in the hospital and might have to have another brain surgery. THIS is a major reason why things are tough for me because I can't drive,  I have to take a lot of time off, and, well, I can just be kinda crazy.

Well... I was going to get an online master's degree in something that I didn't give a shit about just because I wanted to not be a life failure. After a few weeks I dropped it because it was not for me. Waste three years of my life spending ALL of my free time taking classes that I didn't care about while working somewhere I hated? I'm feeling depressed and this is causing MORE seizures.

What if I do this instead:  
- Keep working the bad job at the major university for now to keep getting the benefits.  
- Spend half my freetime volunteering at my mother's small-town library to get something else on my resume. Some of it will be putting books away, some of it will be writing grants, some of it will running the library when nobody else is there. (Very small-town!) Do this for a year or two.  
- Spend some of my other freetime working on skills that can help get me jobs. Improving my writing (lol, my grammar sucks!) is a good example.

Or should I just give up and work in the dining court for the rest of my life and be miserable? 

Any suggestions for books, YT videos, etc. I should watch to motivate me? I'm trying to turn myself around right now. I'm feeling both hopeful and depressed.

1e7fhp8,Title change in job yet keep functioning as the senior in the department,"Hi,

This is my first ever post here on careeradvice and I must say I do have a need for some advice, hahaha, so probable will make a couple more posts describing other situations, for now I will go with this one. 

I've been with my current company for over 3 years, in such time I have been granted a couple of merit raises and promotions, moving from a grade 6 to 5 and then lastly with this last promotiom to 4, though now the company was recently acquired. The merger has been completed and as such a new grading system has been put in place based on the parent company system.

In my case I was the only member of the team to have a grade of 4, everybody else was a 5, this made me into the most senior member of the team.

Now with the new grading system I have been made a grade 5, so does the rest of the team, pay and responsibilities have not changed as it not in their interest for these to change. I did noticed that in a different departement a person that was also a grade 4 before the change has been kept as a 4.

Went ahead an preseted this to my boss (whom gave me the notice on the grade change), after we both went to HR, though at different times and I was beaten to it, which makes me believe that at least the boss had a concern or might have wanted to do right.

Couple of days pass by and HR speaks to me and gave me the same information in writting about how with the new grading system in order to qualify for a grade 4 one would need to be a supervisor or have people reporting to you directly, yet I know this is false due to the person that was kept as a grade 4 not having a single direct report before or even after the change, nor are they planning on having people report to him directly.

Basically HR as typical just said that I will have a grade 5, pay won't change and if I want to improve my grade then I should have discussion with those high above the corporate ladder for discussions on such, and that those people should provide guidance, though not wanting to count on that as HR told me that yet most likely those corporate guys don't even know why I would suddenly start wanting to have career discussions.

My boss hasn't asked me anything about my conversation with HR, boss has come to with requests and questions with concerns, not with me but with the day to day work and its nuances and how to best manage these.

I was planning on taking the initiative and bringing the conversation with the boss, especially as before I speak to corporate about career guidance and plan establishment, the boss will need to be copied on all emails, at least initially.

I decided to pause the conversation with the boss until I have my performance review in ~2-3 weeks as if I have a lackluster raiting, then wanted to bring up how now that I am the same grade as everybody in the department then how come the majority of the time I am teaching two members (A and B) constantly about tasks that have been taught previously and even taking some of their work.

Coworker A has a problem in which you teach A a task that has 4 steps, with notes taken by A and instructions shared, then in two months A will start blasting emails about how there are many errors preventing the work to be completed, yet when observing these errors A had forgotten to do one of the 4 steps of the task, emails will be sent kindly remembering A about to not forget to do one of these 4 steps and which one was missed, then in another 2 months another barrage of emails will have the same frenetic request on how to finish the task and observing those new errors, they indicate that now A has forgotten to do a different step on the task that it was not ommitted the first time, this whole situations with errors and whatnot has occurred for the last 2 years, A has been trained by me more than 5 times, A has taken notes 4 times, electronic copies of instructions have been shared thrice, emails with the steps that were ommited have been sent and the typical conversation with the boss where its just ""set up a meeting to train A with me present so it can be the last training"" has happened twice, currently jugling between replying to A emails or not about errrors.

Boss has had me do tasks that belong to A, has asked for my help in how to track A's work, create metrics that reflect A current work, create presentation with A's impact on the business and metrics for corporate, create plans for A on how to meet or go beyond A's goals, meet with A on how to achieve said metrics, this is just in the last 6 months, so yes I have done much more as A has been with the company for just over 2 years.

Also started learning a new software that A has had a headstart for 3 months, in two weeks I am now able to help others in the company or outside about any needs that they have, direct them to documentation and create/eliminate/review anything that they need. Boss has said how B was supposed to be the master of this program but was doing ""otherrrr"" work, other in quotes as he seemed to have a long face when saying that knowing it is a bad excuse.

Coworker B has been with the company for 1.5 years, this one took my previous role before the initial promotion to grade 4, B has been taught how to do all tasks even has templates to borrow again when creating its reports, B role is more focused on dealing with our customers, yet due to several improvements made during my tenure at that role the amount that B has is less than half on what I constantly had, plus due to the good standing that we have with our customers after doing so much work in dealing with their pains and providing beyond what they even desired and even to the company management which was the main reason why I got promoted to grade 4.

Now the customers only require us to provide them with commitment dates of when are we going to deal with their issues, where before I gave them dates, proof of implementation and the complete report detailing all these actions with pictures included, in some cases these reports where of more than 50 pages, two even passed the 100 mark, even with all that B still manages to be behind on the work with the customers. Boss is also now doing some of the work B should be doing with a customer, seems content with this as nothing is being done for Boss to not do it, though I know he does it to have his Boss involved on this matter

Remember B has templates to use on the reports where only the specifics of the applicatiom are modified and doesn't need to provide proof of implementation just commitment dates and has less than half of the work I had originally, yet the Boss still passes me work that should be done by B and B lies about having things ready or what is even doing, in fact even a customer decided to ask B why was there some lagging on some reports, B mentions overwork, yet as mentioned tasks from B were given to me. B is currently the typical coworker that if given a task it will redirect the email to somebody else for them to do it, then always blames whoever provided the information or recommended an action when a customer comments on it, even if they are making a remark, B jumps straight into ""a yes X person did that"". Also for some reason B lies a lot, have ask B is it has credentials to a customer website, 3 times have been told in the past two months that B will look for its credentials as it doesn't remember them, yet I was able to access the section in the customer portal where I am able to see who from the company has an account even former employees, of course B doesn't have an account. Have asked for B to do the work this specific customer wants from us, even if I could do it, as I am fed up of doing B's work, this customer is asking for updates but if they get desperate I will just told them to create an account for B and delegate the tasks to B.

So all of this rant is to show that I am mad, even if less now than days before, about how my title got changed, how I'm the same grade as A or B yet I'm doing a lot of their tasks, have taught them their work, have explained, have created metrics for Boss constantly, updated, provided direction in to which metrics we should focus on, even though Boss dismisses my case for the metrics then when Boss asks for help on how to manage a certain part of the department or how to track other similar goals, Boss realizes without me saying anything how my proposed metric would provide those insights being sought after.

So I with all that rant finally over and background explanation, I need some advice on how best to proceed, currently I have three initial paths on my head.

Path 1, don't say anything to my boss but speak to this corporate person and search for other jobs

Path 2, speak to my boss next week, speak to corporate and in conjunction create a development for goals that are to be achieved succesfully in one year calendar time for me to merit a promotion

Path 3, speak to my boss in ~2-3 weeks when the performance review occurrs, bring these points fordward and how I am now the same level as coworkers A and B therefore those two should start working hard and imply I am not given much motivation with such a lackluster raise, title, work conditions. Also speak to the corporate person on my own without involving my boss and search for other jobs in parrallel.

Yeah pretty much those are my thoughts yet I am open to suggestions as to what to do, I do like the job, that is why I commute betwen ~50 minutes to 1.2 hours each way for days a week, I am given the option to some days come really early or late and want some advice on how best to proceed, I know some people will say to just leave the place and that is certainly an option or others will say that it doesn't matter as my pay wasn't affected, that works if I had posted this on the antiwork sub, where those comments are warranted, welcomed and appreciated but I did it on the careeradvice sub, therefore well I need some career advice.

Thank you


P.S. Have seen my boss go to lunch multiple times with coworker B, though they don't know I know.

1e7fco9,going back to school at 35?,"so long story short I was one class away from graduating with my undergraduate but it literally meant I needed almost a perfect letter grade, otherwise I would need to take more classes. I wasn't confident as I was spiraling down with bad grades after another. So, I just gave up and never finished. Just last semester I decided to go back after 8 years to give it another go. I managed to get a A- which allowed me to graduate. Halalooya. Now, It gives me the confidence to maybe pursue college again and go into a different field. However my overall GPA is like a 2.2 with many F's and withdrawals and repeated classes. 

How are graudate school going to take me seriously? lets forget about medical school. Given I am already 35 years old, I don't have much time and if I am being honest with myself a post grad would be  \~ 2 years, getting into grad school would be annother 2 years. Then I need to  some internship, work experience (never working a real job, I've just been working on my business side hustle during that time). I'll be well into my 40s with my first real job with a stable career and 20 years before retirement, and most work place will rather take a young out of college than someone 20 years older with the same experience

1e7e4bc,Seeking advice: should I start my master's degree or become an entrepreneur?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 21-year-old who is at a bit of a crossroads and could use some advice. I hold a bachelor’s degree in International Business and will be starting my master’s in International Relations this September, which will take two years to complete.

However, I have a strong passion for entrepreneurship and dream of pursuing a career in copywriting and building sales funnels. The master’s program will open doors to a good job in the future, but my entrepreneurial aspirations offer the potential for financial and location freedom, provided I work hard and get a bit of luck.

Given my current situation, I’m struggling to decide the best path forward. Should I focus on completing my master’s and secure a stable job, or should I fully commit to my entrepreneurial ambitions and start building a business in copywriting and sales funnels now?

I’d appreciate any insights or advice from those who have been in a similar situation or have experience in balancing traditional career paths with entrepreneurial ventures.

1e7dup5,Mentor at Competing Company ,"For the past three months I have been interviewing for positions at two large financial institutions. At institution A, they loved me but passed on me for a much more experienced candidate. The person who would have been my supervisor offered to mentor me and check in via video chat quarterly. I said yes as I know I can learn a lot from this person. Check ins are scheduled during normal business hours. They have also said they would keep an eye out for job opening for me. 

Fast forward a couple of months and I have been offered a lucrative position at Company B.  The person who is going to be my direct supervisor at Company B is also super awesome!

Company A and B both know I was applying to the other company. My question is, is it appropriate to have a mentor at a competing company, especially one that I previously interviewed with? Also, I would be talking to a mentor from one company while another company pays me. Something about it doesn’t feel right, but I know people have professional mentors. How should I navigate this?

Company A was very small and my Google mail and Slack were still active when I rejoined 10 months later.

So, if a future employer asked company POS they would say I started 8/2020.  But do employers do more and pull, for example, a credit report that would show the startup in the middle?

1e7cpp6,How can I find a free or delayed payment career counselor?,"I been looking for work for years now, and this is the breaking point where I will be homeless and without internet soon. With a ton of experience and a few degrees to become a teacher (MEd, BA History, English), it sounded like it would be easy to find SOMETHING real online - a magazine, newspaper, educational journal, art gallery, clothing store, or decor company - but it has just been years of searching, testing, creating art, and writing articles for nothing.

However, it seems career counseling is expensive. Without any credit or debit it is impossible to obtain one. Slightly ironic to be told you have to pay 300-500$+ to get a job when the reason you are going to them is you have no money. If there was some way to be able to pay when possible, without loan sharks, that would be amazing.

I was a teacher that worked in online writing, then opened some art and graphic design stores that did well until a wonderful series of credit card scammer charge-backs put me into a little debt.

My husband has been thinking about a career change for a while now, but his current job always keeps him super busy so he hasn't had much time to do much research or self-reflection about what type of career he may want to pivot to (that is attainable for him given his work experience, interests, college degree, etc. and that still makes a reasonable amount for our household). We've had many discussions about this over the years and I think he feels like he's at a ""dead end"" and wants to make a change but just doesn't know where to go from here. 

He's said he'd be very interested in and open to getting some career advising or counseling by someone who can give some perspective and has knowledge about different career fields that could be a good fit for him. So I'm posting on his behalf to see if anyone here has any recommendations for career advising services? What we are looking for is a service that lets us set up a one-time phone call or video call appointment where my husband can tell an advisor his work experience, qualifications, interests and the advisor can discuss options, possible good fits, and even next steps.

Always wanted to make loads of money - but have realised money is not my main motivator. If i can maintain a salary of 150 / 160K a year i think i would be happy for the rest of my life 

As i work in a consulting firm - can try work up the ladder - with partner being attainable in approx 7-10 years  (but means long hours but salary is around 400K) 

Or i can try find work industry as a head of BI / MI lead for that salary 

Or go contracting and i think i need to get a day rate of approx £750 to achieve that - but everyone is saying its a bad contracting market at the moment

I want to spend the next three months developing the right skills / network to take me to the next step 

So the question / advice im looking for

Advice for people in my shoes what have they done

but that won't matter in a couple of years, and the only thing that will is how much my check will be every week.

i would ask my parents about this but they have this old, traditionalist idea of ""become doctor and all your worries will go away it's so obvious why are you thinking so hard"" but thats literally the last thing i want. i fucking hate working with blood, and have everything be so fragile and stressing to the point where i would have gray hair in my thirties

1e79oqt,"Boss belittles me and people takes advantage of it. Please, help!","I've been in this job for 3 months. I know, it's too earlier and may be I should think different. But this is driving me nuts.

My boss assistant didn't liked me since day one. My actual boss, wanted me to be there in the team, gave me access to a training to solidify my technical knowledge, and was generally nice with me.

However, now he's on sabbatical. Her assistant is taking over as the new boss, and she is just mean. She is always treating me as incompetent. With a smile, she just belittles me disregarding any effort as if she were talking with an intern instead of a professional with 5 years of experience in the field. She ignores the my good job and highlight any mistake or thing that was slightly off. Sometimes it seems that she is just looking for anything bad in my work.

The worst thing is that people in the team takes advantage of it. Even when she is talking nonsense to expose me as a bad employee, other college intercede as a ""good guy"" with a "" I'm going to work together with her so she can deliver something good"".

I'm so upset about this. Even more when I feel so vulnerable right now.it took me 7months to get this job, I had to move to another city because they wanted me to be near the office (no relocation package, every expense on my behalf). And I feel that since this company is a big name if I quit it would be a detrimental to my career + it's just hard to find another job.

Now my boss (the assistant) is putting so much effort in complimenting a consultant right after she belittled me.

1e79cl7,What are some career paths/specific jobs that allow you to move to the US more easily?,"Sorry for the vague title, but basically as of writing this I am just a teenager so I'm still at a crossroads phase as when it comes to higher education and ultimately my career, and I've taken such a strong liking to the US that I would like to move there: I've already wrote a post on [](https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/) a while back asking is this was even doable, and from my understanding the hard part is getting a company to sponsor your green card and sort out the immigration paperwork for you.

I want this to be more of a brainstorming post and I'm open to all sorts of suggestions. For instance, one user in that post I made suggested becoming a petrochemical engineer: on one hand, this would be ideal as it would allow me to live somewhere rural and sparsely populated where cost of living isn't too high like Wyoming or North Dakota, but on the other we're slowly transitioning away from oil so at some point I would have to switch gears and specialize into something else. I don't really have requirements in mind other than:

* Being able somewhere not too densely populated: anywhere other than a city or a suburban sprawl is fine.
* The possibility to make an above avarage salary (for instance, if the median income in a certain state is 65,000$, I want to be able to make around 80,000$ a few years into my career).

Also, I'd imagine there's going to be a catch with every suggestion: already having a few years of experience, having an oddly specific and specialized degree etc... after all, to hire someone from other country, a company must be looking for something specific in terms of higher education and/or experience.

Lastly, from my understanding workplace protections/benefits in the US are mostly left up to the employer so that's something else I should consider.",88-81,1,1.0,0,1721410094,2024-07-19 17:28:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e79cl7/what_are_some_career_pathsspecific_jobs_that/,7,2024
1e7941l,Was fired after only 4 days and it felt like I was setup for failure,"

So awhile ago I did an interview for an employment agency called volt to be a warehouse worker in fremont. When I did the interview I told the guy that I recent graduated from college and that I was just getting any job that'd be hiring. He said that it'd be a waste to hire someone like me for a warehouse position because I had a bachelors. So he decided to have me do another interview in a few days for a different position one that involve data entry and using computers. A few days after that I did another interview for a parts controller position that mainly involved data entry and sending emails. I was told that I was hired and that there would be two months of training involved and that I wasn't just gonna be thrown to the wolves. On my first day I was giving a short orientation where they repeated the stuff that was said in the interview like two months of training and safety procedures. 


When I met up with the guy who would train me he showed me around and explained a little bit about the job. Then he asked me if I what jobs have I worked before and I told him I worked at a warehouse before. We then went on break and when I came back one of the managers told me I was to work with the production guys. This left me confused as it felt like I was now being moved to production now. I was paired up with three guys who barely spoke English. They only managed to say a few phrases to try and show me what the work was. It was mostly playing charades with them to try and understand what work I had to do. At the end of the first day I had helped open boxes and put together the parts for the servers that the company makes. I had spent majority of the last hour of my first day trying to get the green and caution tape off the ground not exactly sure why I needed to do that. I was told I was going to be working as a parts controller and doing data entry but now suddenly I get put into another role without much discussion.


 I texted the recruiter guy who got me my job ""have I been moved to a different position now or what?"". He texted me that there was a materials shortage and that they asked me to help out with the production and that my real role would start the following week. So I thought I was just helping out production in the meantime before I got started on my actual role. The next day is when things got weird and frustrating for me. The three guys I worked with barely spoke English nor did they really have me do anything so I just stood around confused about what I needed to do. 


Then one of the managers came by and got really mad at me saying that I wasn't qualified to work and that all I was doing was just standing around and that I should just quit to make it easier for him and that he'll only give me one more day. I was confused and frustrated because I was put into a different position without much notice and paired up with three guys who barely spoke English who didn't seem to try and train me at all. I had texted the recruiter about my confusion and why was the other manager being so mad at me when I was promised a different position and training for a completely different role. I then tried to help out the guys a bit more after he got mad at me by helping them assemble to servers. They had put the trash all in the pallet Jack's and pointed to me where I had to go to drop them off. 


Then I metup with the recruiter during lunch time and he told me that since I told the guy who was training me on the computer that I worked at a warehouse that they decided to just move me to production because they thought that would better suit me. He then asked if I wanted to stay with production, move back to the computers or go do the warehouse jobs like what I had applied for. I told him I wanted to go back to the computers. He then had me go back to the computer guy who had me look at some of the materials and gave me a list to try and make some corrections. After that he gave me a big roll of labels and wanted me to get 488 of them. For the rest of the shift I kept trying to count the labels to get 488 of them but I kept losing track and I gave up and told the recruiter I made a mistake with the labels. On the next day in the morning one of the other workers went up to me and told me that the guy handling the trash said that there was still a piece inside one of the boxes when it was thrown out and he asked if I knew anything about it. I didn't know anything as the other guys just put all the trash together and I was just told to dump it off in the trash area. They had me go to the office where the manager guys got angry at me and said I wasn't qualified to work there and that in just 2 days I had already made big mistakes.


 I had tried to defend myself to the recruiter guy and told him the guys working with me barely spoke English so it was hard ro communicate with me. He told me he heard them speak English to the guys working in the sanitation. I told him they barely spoke English to me only a few phrases and mostly playing charades to show me how to do the work. He told me I needed to have taken the initiative to tell them to give me instructions to do the job and that I needed to ask more about doing what I need to do. I thought to myself why do I have to take the initiative when they are the ones training me also I was promised two months of training and that there was a supply shortage so there wasn't a lot of work to do. I got confused on why the other manager got mad at me and why the agency didn't really give me a chance to do the work right. 


The recruiter said I didn't show the computer skulls or qualifications to do the job. I then told him they didn't even have me use the computers at all they just showed me some stuff without giving me any actual hands on training. He said it wasn't a good fit for me and had me return the uniform and lead me out of the building where he told me I was never to be let back in and that security would be called if I was ever seen again. I then was out of the building and drove home. Not being giving the proper training to do my job and unclear communication and angry behavior from one of the mangers was all thrown at me and left me frustrated and how unprofessional and dishonest this agency was with me",EmergencySpare7939,2,0.6299999952316284,7,1721409494,2024-07-19 17:18:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e7941l/was_fired_after_only_4_days_and_it_felt_like_i/,7,2024
1e78zeg,How to justify my “asked for” salary,"So, it’s a long complicated story but here are the meat and potatoes:

At 40 years old I made a major career change into the world of Project Management. I had zero education in this field (have a bachelors in something totally unrelated and worked in unrelated fields) but I did get my CAPM and learned how to use MS Project. I was fortunate enough that a company took a chance on me and gave me a job as a scheduler, working through a contract agency. It’s been a year now, my contract is about to be up, and I know the company wants to hire me directly. I enjoy working here but I get paid pretty low. I accepted the low pay initially because I have no experience. My boss told me to apply to work for the company as a direct hire (still have to go through the interview process). Filling out the application, I asked for a much larger salary than i make now through the contractor. I know I won’t get the full amount I asked for, but I’m afraid they’re going to give me barely anything. Part of my justification for asking so much is because I have a friend who was in the exact same boat and worked at the same company before me (when he left I basically took his job) and his starting wage was basically what I’m asking for now. (He also had no experience when he started there but lied and said he did). He only has about a year more experience than meat this point but he’s now working for DOD making 3 times what I make. (I realize there’s a big difference between government and civilian work). Unfortunately because my bachelors is not in business, and I don’t have at least 4 years experience, I don’t qualify to get a lot of extra certifications that I would normally get. I am, however, in an online MBA program in Project Management. My eventual goal is to get into something like project controls for the DOE or DOD. 

Anyway, when it comes time to negotiate the salary, what’s the best way to justify it? I’ve never really had to do that before at my old career, so this is new territory. It’s feels kinda wrong to say “well I know when you hired so-and-so you paid him this much”. Do I just talk about what I’ve done so far? What I want to do?

1e77edu,Inadequate (?) test assignment- does it worth it? ,"Hi all! I’m currently looking for a job in marketing, have 1.5 experience directly in the field + 4 years experience in a huge PR agency. At my previous company (B2B , SaaS sector), I handled multiple projects related to social media managent, strategy, content planning and creation.

As I’m in between jobs, I recently had a job interview with a SaaS B2B company with a very similar product as my last employer. We had 2 interviews, one of which was with their head of marketing and marketing manager. Both interviews went really well. As a next step, they promised to send me a test task.

And I got it today.. they ask me to work on the 3 month long social media strategy for their brand, propose new content pillars, count budgets, suggest new channels.. and write 5 posts. 

Well, I definitely COULD do it as I have experience crafting SMM strategy and, of course, know how it works.

BUT my question it: is it an adequate test assignment? (Note: it’s UNPAID), and I’m given 1 week to complete it. Is it normal for companies nowadays test potential employees this way?

The company’s size is around 200 people, the salary they offer is slightly above mine in a previous company, so it’s definitely not a tech giant.

Am I overreacting, or unpaid test tasks like this that don’t give ANY guarantee of them hiring me, don’t worth the time and effort?

I really liked the position and the team, so want to know your opinion.

Even if you aren’t lying to employers, everyone needs to learn about this report because it can be used against you. The best way around this is to freeze it. To help our community, I’ve created a Compendium of everything TWN related including instructions on freezing. Note - they are locking down the freezing capability, so it's best that everyone does this sooner than later.

1e73hh1,Pay talks with Manager,"**Background:**

I'm in my late-20s and recently started a new job on £85k base. I'm currently in the standard 6-month probation period.

**Situation:**

My manager informed me that all our job titles are being updated to align better with other teams, assuring us that there would be no impact on our current salaries. However, I noticed that my new title would not include 'Senior', which looks to affect the pay range. The upper range for 'Senior' is £95k, while for non-senior manager roles, it's £82k.

Before signing the letter confirming the title change, I called my manager to ask how this change would affect my future pay raises over the next 2-3 years and what the differences are between my role/title and those of other team members as they will be 'senior'. During our conversation, he seemed surprised to find out that my current salary is at the upper end of the new title's pay scale, though he wasn't sharing his screen. For my current title (before changes), the upper range is £95k.

**Question:**

I didn't really get a clear answer, but am I right to think this would impact my pay rise for next/two years? Am I overthinking this situation? Did I make a mistake by raising this concern? and could it potentially put a target on my back during probation?

It’s my 3rd job in my whole career and this job gives me the joy in doing what I am doing daily. Often I find myself initiating things and wanting to do more or learn more that what is required of my job whereas my other colleagues seem to be following along with the flow and doing the own things only. My teammates were in the company for 2 years or more and they haven’t get promoted before. During meetings I took up the initiative to share about what I did and to follow up with any project progressions while my teammates don’t really share anything during meetings. 

Recently I spoke to my direct supervisor about the chance of getting promoted next year. He told me that he don’t really know if there are anyone who manage to get promoted in their first year and I’m completely lost after what he said. I’m gunning for a promotion next year that is why I’m working so hard to justify. 

What will you do if you are in my shoes? ",Mohd_Alibaba,2,1.0,1,1721391681,2024-07-19 12:21:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e72e1w/career_advice_for_someone_who_really_want_to_take/,7,2024
1e715yf,"I host linkedin webinars with industry experts in my current role. After my contract expires, can I continue to host these webinar series by going independently on my personal linkedin account? Would that be unethical?","Will it be unethical if I continue hosting webinars on LinkedIn which was part of my job description for a role, even after my contract ends.

I work for a small startup where one of my job responsibilities include interviewing industry experts for our Live LinkedIn webinar series. 

My contract ends in September but I genuinely enjoying interviewing and hosting these sessions and they are driving traffic and Engagement to the brands and only my person linkedin account.

I want to continue interviewing industry experts in our niche after my contract ends but would that be unethical?

I was the one that pitched this webinar series and it's growing my network and im truly enjoying it.

Plus I want to do something of my own for my linkedin personal brand until I find a full time role.

Am I being unethical by stealing this idea?

The founder is the sweetest and gave me an opportunity to hone my skills and build my portfolio when no one was giving me a chance.

I've really brought in traffic to her brand and I know she's grateful for all that I do (or atleast that's what it feels like)

It feels like If I continue doing this I would be back stabbing her.

But I really want to establish myself as an expert in my niche so I can find my first full time role out of college.

What should I do?

1e711pf,Relocate to an unfamiliar place for career advancement vs staying put in current stagnant job/location to satisfy my wife,"For context we both in our early 30s and I'm the sole earner in our house hold for now. I've been stuck in a rather dead end role and was not able to shift out due to many circumstances. But now I got a really good job offer after 10 years, but it requires me to uproot and relocate my family to an unfamiliar place where we don't know anyone.

 My wife is not very happy with the move because she has to move away from her family/friends. But this new job opens up a whole new category of companies/industry and the pay is also quite good. For context, if I didn't switch companies, I'll be getting the same pay in my current company after like 7 or 8 years. 

The new company told that I can move back to my current City after a year or so but it is not a guarantee.

So what to do? I'm stuck now. ",the30sguy,3,0.7200000286102295,4,1721387102,2024-07-19 11:05:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e711pf/relocate_to_an_unfamiliar_place_for_career/,7,2024
1e70sn7,What would you do in my situation,"I left stable comfortable job after 5+ years to try myself in a small start up. I'm naturally someone who plans for the worst hopes for the best so it did cross my mind that maybe this is a terrible decision and I am going to have to look for another job soon. However I did not expect how bad it will be in reality. I was completely ignored by my line manager since the day I joined. We are all sitting in a tiny office on top of each other but I would not even get a 10min chat or even ""how is it going"". If I joined chats she is having with others she would not even look me in the eyes or respond to my comments. She would selectively respond to some of my teams messages but not all and physically hide from me when we are supposed to meet for 1:1. I asked for onboarding on technical aspects, asked to have some objectives in my first week and didn't get anything, not even my accounts set up for HR and company expenses. There were a lot more issues with the company and how they operate with management style just being bluster and bravado and others agreeing to lie on behalf of the company. Another red flag was that most employees were under 27yo and a lot never worked anywhere else. 
I have 8 years of very specialised experience so I was excited to share my expertise and have the opportunity to build the team of my newly opened department. However because of weird behaviour from the management I started suspecting they are about to get rid of me and hire someone else. Colleagues that were nice to me from the start and took me on lunch breaks and even night outs together were actually involved in recruitment of all new staff so I was hoping maybe they would at least give me a heads up. Couple of days later one of the founders told me that he is very happy that he hired me so I for a few weeks I thought maybe that's just how this company operates and I need to get used to it. Then few weeks later another founder suggested we go for a coffee as he never had a chance to speak to me and it was very bizarre conversation. He seemed sceptical about my experience (he is younger than me and never had a job btw) and was implying that my department will only grow if they can see that more people are required (I'm doing work of 5 people) and if my aspiration is to lead the team he can't guarantee its going to be me in a leadership role it might be someone else. Very motivational coffee chat if you ask me. 
It's been 3 month now and nobody checks on my progress, I am doing the most mundane tasks, all my 1:1 get cancelled and I only get occasional messages asking something which indicates that they don't understand how to do my job. I seriously contemplating resigning without having another job secured. I am currently ill and had to take 2 sick days on 2nd day I received a message  from my manager saying if I feel better I should come to the office to meet a candidate who's being interviewed for my department (seniority level tbc they said). This is first time I hear they are looking for someone for my team and I think it's a very snaky move to announce it like that. I'm thinking of handing in my resignation today as it only gonna get worse.

1e70h4c,Career advice for a Master of Laws Graduate,"Long post ahead.  
Have posted this on another subreddit as well, just so you know. I am just trying my best to get enough opinions.

I do not claim to be in the best state of mind, after having spent 2 weeks obsessively checking linkedin, indeed, other job portals instead of working on my pending dissertation.

My\_qualifications I am a Masters student in Public International Law at a UK University, with subjects mostly around conflict and international peace and security mechanisms. For the longest time, during my undergrad, I felt I knew where I was heading. There was at least sense of direction. I knew the key was finishing undergrad (i.e. law school), masters (with some research experience at some organisation) and then a PhD. I obviously also wanted to move abroad for a 1000 reasons including better standard of living, better quality of work life that I don't get in India.

Now that I am nearly wrapping up my Masters degree, I do not know for jack where I am heading. There are no jobs in my field, unless I have a PhD/am an EU/EEA citizen or have \~5 years of professional experience (for entry level jobs, no less).

Before you ask, I was told to postpone doing a PhD at least a year after my Masters by my Professor. Now I know why - I still can't think of a literature gap that I can address on my own for 3 years.

So that leaves me with no option really - handful few jobs in my field are not available to me. Since I live in the UK, I do not know what is working against me; if its the fact that I will be on Graduate Visa, and then legally required to leave after 2 years for lack of sponsorship for Skilled Worker Visa; or if I am simply not qualified enough.

Before you say - I have scoured most of the resources. Some say use ChatGPT garbage - I have done that. No, it sucks and I would rather not use it anymore. That software can't get one thing right.

I have used colored templates for CVs, even though I have historically used Harvard and Yale Format for CV. Classic, no non-sense, pretty academic templates. I have also used similar resources available on sites like Legal Cheek, LSE's career services, etc. Followed same templates with the same way of mentioning my responsibilities in my work experience sections.

Basically, I have followed advice to the T.

All kinds of template, all combinations, sprinkling words from the job description, drafting each cover letter differently. Nothing is still working. I understand I lack skills for a Programme Manager or a Graduate Consultant job, but I think I can at least do research in Human Rights Law - an area that ***IS*** my forte and in which ***I HAVE*** experience.

I am sort of sick now because I can't seem to see why nothing is working and my job hunt is an absolute nightmare.

I am equally nauseated by the sheer number of advice influenzas who talk about writing 50 applications a day with ""winning"" CV templates and cover letters because guess what? Their advice doesn't work either. I am willing to blow £200 on CV/Cover Letter advice but I know for a fact that that won't work either; they cannot promise me jack.

I am absolutely clueless about my prospects at this point. If I leave after my Masters to do a job in India, the salaries in academia are peanuts and the work load is maniac. If I continue living in the UK, I will not land a job, unless by sheer stroke of luck, and therefore, will be forced to work in an hourly wage job stacking shelves or serving coffee. (No, I don't look down upon them; just stating that I don't wish to work in field I am not inclined towards).

Jobs in Europe are equally scarce, and I can't get even seem to land a job in Germany in my field (where there is apparently labour shortage).

I genuinely would appreciate some advice on this because I am pretty close to having a shutdown.

1e706v5,Looking to change careers,"I’ve been a software engineer for 3 years, I’ve had good internships and only have experience working for large companies with massive technology divisions. I (like many others I’ve talked to) feel insecure about their coding abilities in these environments with a bunch of very skilled programmers who are all extremely interested in climbing a ladder and building better technology along the way. The thing is, I hate programming with a passion and the team I’ve recently joined is small, many are passive aggressive, one pretty much called me dumb. It feels wild to me that I can’t communicate at all with anyone on my team about anything besides work and they seem entirely uninterested in speaking to me at all. 

I genuinely have been self sabotaging in this career path in several forms and I can get why my coworkers might not be very happy with me, I don’t think they’re being entirely unfair. But the root of this problem is that I absolutely can’t do this anymore. I hate spending my days reading documentation, running builds, and working on tickets. I can’t stand corporate bullshit and I can’t even mask it anymore. 

So I need to make a switch. I have no clue what I’m going to do and am very open to discussing. My fiancé is a nurse, and I wouldn’t mind going back to school for that type of degree. I know the work is hard, but it’s social and I’ve been craving that after years in computer science -> software engineer. More than that, it feels like I could be somewhat useful to the general public. I don’t think that the healthcare system is good at all thus nursing has some ethical in it dilemas too. Besides that it’s an extremely arduous and many times sad career. So im open to discussing, I’m somewhat interested in argiculture, economics, environmental sciences, and possibly construction management. Would love to talk to people who have found success switching careers for a better work life balance and want to offer any advice. Thanks!

1e6znql,My boss keeps taking things out on me for my co-worker being lazy ,"Ok so I am the ‘baby’ of the office… I’m 25, everyone else is 40+ last year my boss hired a new receptionist (he didn’t actually want to hire her he had a few other candidates he offered the job to but they ended up declining) anyway, she is notorious for being lazy and everyone knows it. He has previously made ‘hints’ to her that she is lazy but never actually sat her down and spoken to her about it as far as I know.

She is on holiday this week and she has booked in endless appointments to the point where my boss can’t get a break. One appointment in particular I told her not to book in because the work hadn’t yet been started, today I find out she’s went ahead and booked them in anyway. My boss came through started questioning me asking why they were scheduled in because there’s no work been done and I said ‘I know this’ to which he cut in and said ‘well who booked it’ 

I explained it was my co-worker and I told her not to book them in and he said to me “why are you speaking to her about this and not me” to which I explained he was on annual leave. He sighed and walked out the room and told me I had 15min to get as much work done as possible for this client - life’s not fair but I personally don’t find this fair picking up the slack of others.

I got everything done just as the client came through the door and my boss just said “great job thanks” then piled more work on me. I’m 25 years old, I’m really stressed out with work to the point I just go home and drink alcohol at night. My co-worker constantly lands myself and my boss in it by not listening and it’s not my place to do anything. I have tried to voice my concerns but he just says “I know you’re under pressure, it won’t always be this way, you’re young” 

It’s more the fact when she makes a mistake I get questioned and into trouble for something I haven’t even done! I just don’t know what to do anymore things were fine before she came along…

TL:DR my co-worker is lazy and I’m constantly taking the slack for her but my boss takes it out on me and has a go at me for her mistakes instead of speaking to her and I don’t know what to do about it. After he has had a go at me he will walk out my office and not return for a while because I reckon he knows it’s not actually my fault but is frustrated.

1e6y5nf,I keep messing up at work,"I (F19) got a job in late April/early May in the logistics/transportation industry and I’ve been messing up a lot. Every time I keep thinking that I’m improving, there’s always something that I have overlooked or didn’t put in the system.

I mainly do manifests, fill out deliveries/pick ups, close orders (check out dims/weights, select drivers, etc.) and make payments for customers. So it is a detail oriented job.

I feel bad because the my 2 bosses are family friends and now they probably think I’m incompetent because of how often these mistakes have been occurring. I just don’t want to keep messing up on something every week (or everyday)

It’s gotten to the point where I’m starting to dread making a mistake because I’m aware that this line of work is actually serious and one mistake can cost money.

1e6xdc5,Advice on my plan to apply pressure for a clear promotion timeline,"As the title states I want opinions on my plan to apply pressure and document my dissatisfaction with my career progression in my job. I do not want to leave the job as it’s flexible, decent pay, and I enjoy my work. 
  
The details:
Just over two years ago I joined an American multinational in a role I was slightly overqualified for, but the package was good and it seemed like a good name for the CV. The company was also planning to expand to more European countries so it seemed a good bet for  trajectory.
  
1.5 years later I was on track for a promotion after smashing all my goals. I had floated the idea to my manager of moving into a more technical role in an adjacent part of the business as a step up as I was already doing many parts of that role.
  
Then the layoffs happened and without much conversation other than a brief slack message before the layoffs, I was moved laterally into the other org at the same level.  I was given a team of engineers and my predecessors roadmap to execute against, until a month later when the engineers who were contractors were consolidated into another team and that team’s lead was made my manager. There was chaos and uncertainty but I soldiered on with the promise that it “is just a formality and in the summer we will promote you”.  
  
A few months later I was told its company policy that, after a move to another part of the business, I have to stick it out in the role for a year before a promotion. I accepted this because I was learning and I was happy to be transitioning into something more technical. 
  
It’s now summer and my review is positive, we went through the competencies for the next level and I’m already achieving most of them. Then my manager drops “we should be able to finish off the rest of these competencies by next summer”. I interrupt and state that the plan was for January, they responded with understanding but that we need a strong case and it might not be strong enough by January. 

The plan:
I will be documenting all these events and presenting them to my manager’s manager. This includes rough dates and the comments made to me (maybe not by whom they were made). This is for transparency and to not rely on other people to voice my concerns for me. I then planned to go to HR to get all of this on record. The outcome I would like is clarity and ideally a formal plan. 

I also suspect that my manager might not want to expend their political capital on me. It’s all smiles and compliments until I want something from the looks of things. I am also concerned that within this current team there doesn’t seem to be a role on the next rung, despite the fact that there used to be 3 people in the role above and now there is only one, my manager. 
  
Please don’t start with the LEAVE NOW comments as I want to exhaust the levers at my disposal first. Also the tech job market is shit right now and unfortunately a step up in another local company still might not pay as well because of American salaries vs. European ones.

1e6wu9i,Should I omit my last 2 jobs from my resume? They didn’t end well… but I need to use the experience.,"Quick history of the past 5 years, I worked for 1.5 years at a grocery store doing personal shopping, left on good terms to move onto a cocktail waitress job. I was a cocktail waitress for 2 years, again left on good terms. I had savings so I didn’t work for 1 year after quitting. Fast forward to this year, got my first job serving in a restaurant in February, but quit in may. Not enough money, didn’t like the management. I had already gotten hired at another restaurant when I quit, and I stayed at this second restaurant from may to July 10th, when I was fired. 

Now…the reason why I was fired is bullshit in my opinion, but what’s done is done. The owner threatened my job over a Facebook comment I made where I said I was poor claiming that it makes them look bad. I said sorry that was not the intent of my comment but she didn’t care and persisted being extremely rude. No respect, zero understanding. In the back I mentioned that she was a bitch towards me about it(my mistake I guess… but it’s true), another server ran and snitched, they fired me without reviewing the cameras. childish in my opinion. They also immediately banned me for some reason (I can’t even pick up my last check even though it’s basically nothing) and threatened me with a lawsuit if I speak negatively of them. Fuck them. Anyways since then the owner has gone on fb and lied (I have proof of this) about certain aspects of the situation. But because of this, I’m not sure what to put on future applications. They know damn near every restaurant and bar owner in the area and have probably already blacklisted me since places that I have connections at haven’t even hired me. I’m in a desperate situation and need to start working this week. 

Do I omit them entirely? I needed the bartending experience because that is my ONLY bartending experience, granted it was only a couple months, but I still learned the basics of drinks. If I do include them, what would I put for my reason for leaving? What do employers view as a valid reason for someone to check the “do not contact previous employers” box? Same with the previous restaurant. Even though it didn’t end as messily, I’m fairly certain because of how abruptly I left (I didn’t walk out or anything I just didn’t give a notice) and the fact that I didn’t get along great with the manager that they won’t exactly give me a great recommendation. And don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the work, I really just don’t think either place was a good fit for me. I’m thinking that I’m going to try and go for more of a bar atmosphere and stay away from restaurants because restaurant managers seem to be extremely childish and toxic. I’ve never had these issues at any other workplace nor have I ever previously been fired.

i talked to a (hiring manager?) first, it went well we mainly talked about my hobbies and future goals which were all easy to answer however i was a little nervous but i dont think it showed very much. He liked the questions i asked him and he answered them thoroughly. He went to bring the (head host?) to talk to me, and said that he will contact me tomorrow if they decide to proceed.

the head host was very nice and made me feel comfortable, but when she was asking me questions i felt quite nervous due to intense eye contact. I was able to get my point across in all my questions but she did give me advice and feedback on how i seemed very nervous, as well as saying how in a restaurant that may not be ideal. However she said everything else looked great and that she loved my vibe/look, she told me she was going to talk to management and put in a good word but she said that the final decision is from them not her.

I am feeling a big discouraged. Since February, I have been applying to supervisory roles to try to find career growth. I got one supervisory offer but it was a little too far from home/pay too low. Anyways, I am finding that I am getting interviews, but not getting a chance to prove myself. Currently, I am a lead medical scientist for the past two years, but overall have 13 years of laboratory experience (as a water chemist, QC tech, and MLS). Most recently, I got my hopes up and thought I was going to be offered a Chemistry Supervisor role close to home but got ""bait and switched"" and they tried offering me a MLS role instead, even though I told the recruiter before the interview that I am only interested in the role I applied for. For some reason, I thought I was finally going to get a chance, just to be let down. I do not know what I am doing wrong and why I cannot get ahead in my career. Has anyone else experienced this or adversity to growing in the field?  How am I supposed to get supervisory experience without someone taking a chance on me ? I was an interim supervisor for a few months recently. I am just feeling discouraged.

I'm currently a student in my university's biological sciences program, before I got accepted I considered applying to my local dental hygiene program but once I was accepted I just forgot about it. Until recently, I've started consisting it again before I get to far into my biological sciences program. 
 I think I'd truly love both, but here's a few things:
For biological sciences I'm worried about pay & the need for more education after graduation. I think I want go into research,  and I think I'd be fulfilled in a career down this path. 
For dental hygiene, I love that it would take 2 years instead of 4 and the pay is better. I don't think I'd be as fulfilled, but satisfied. My main concern is have pain. I asked already have trigger finger, so I'm worried that the job would cause even more pain.
 What should I do? If anyone reading is in either field, I'd love to hear what you have to say!

Is there anyway I can stall for a week or 2? I really like the first job that I interviewed for and will probably dislike the second job. My idea was ignore the call Friday and call them back on Monday to negotiate, then tell them I'll let them know by the end of the week.

I interviewed for this director position and they called me back the next day to offer me the position to my absolute surprise and offered me the max of the hiring pay range. During the interview they told me they wanted me to serve as a duo role and not only be the director for a certain department but also the director for an additional wing that is attached to the facility (this wasn't on the application). I fear I may be way over my head as I am now facing a lot of anxiety about being a manager. They told me they want me to start hiring staff and really stepping into this position, I've never hired anyone in my life. I'm scared shitless tbh

1e6pkl3,Needing Career Advice...Confused and Stressed,"I never post on Reddit, but after my day at work and the current state of my mental health, I am having a hard time knowing what to do going forward.

I work in security and emergency management at the university where I graduated. I joined our Campus Safety department in the fall of 2020, initially as a student worker. After three years, I was hired part-time as a security officer until my full-time position was ready. My hope was to transition into full-time emergency management and assist with campus safety as needed. However, I quickly found myself taking on more campus safety responsibilities than emergency management. At the time, this wasn’t a big issue since my job provided free housing.

The problem started in October 2023 when one of my coworkers left, leaving his graveyard shifts to me. I thought this was temporary. In January 2024, I received an offer for a full-time security officer and emergency coordinator position. I hoped this would allow me to focus more on emergency management, but I was still stuck with three graveyard shifts a week and only one day of emergency management.

By May, I had a meeting with my bosses to express my dissatisfaction with the graveyard shifts. Although the conversation was positive, no immediate resolution was reached. Eventually, I spoke with my assistant director and managed to get a schedule of 30 hours of emergency management and 10 hours of campus safety.

Today, I had another meeting with my bosses. I wasn't in trouble, but I learned that my director was unaware of the 30/10 schedule approved by my assistant director. Now, my director wants me to go back to two graveyard shifts and two emergency management shifts, which feels like a significant step back.

My job has left me feeling very tired, unmotivated, and stressed. I have a second job as a chauffeur, which was my dream because I’ve always wanted to work in transportation. The problem is that my current job offers free housing, and I’m nervous about leaving it because of the stability it provides. The transportation job, while ready to hire me full-time, may not be as stable, given the fluctuating nature of the industry. Additionally, living expenses in my area are very high, and I worry about my bills.

Can someone please offer some support or advice? I could really use it.",Dry-Confidence5265,1,1.0,5,1721345901,2024-07-18 23:38:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e6pkl3/needing_career_adviceconfused_and_stressed/,7,2024

1e6md7r,Submitted compensarion HR Request,"What happens on the other side?

I ran working part time by my boss who I respect, he told me to ask HR. Id rather not go down that rabbit hole. I am a top performer and this year I discovered that while I received a 4% merit others got upwards of 10%. 

While I was browsing the newly released HR portal I noticed we had the ability to submit compensation based requests. I explored more and found a new library that outlines the duties and qualifications of each job title.  Its become clear that my title is misaligned with my job duties, and people who have much less responsibility are being brought on at a level or more above me and as a result fall in a higher pay band. 

I went through the list and located the role that aligns with all of my responsibilities and experience which is 2 or 3 steps above what I am labeled in the hierarchy. I wrote a kind letter outlining why I believe a title change and salary adjustment is in order. I outlined how I meet each requirement and have all of the responsibilities one by one.

I did tell my boss that I was going to run my title and compensation by HR before I ask them about a conflict of potentially adding part time work. He said to go for it. My boss typically points to HR when something pay/performance/compensation based happens and indicates they have the final say in things. I never just contact HR.

How do you think the review of this is going to work on the back end? I am also a little worried about retaliation but I am a great employee and went about it very kindly and didnt make any demands.",Upsidedown_Desk82920,1,1.0,8,1721337246,2024-07-18 21:14:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e6md7r/submitted_compensarion_hr_request/,7,2024

So back in October 2023 I started in a IT Helpdesk contract to hire position, In February I was offered Full Time Employment. Now before I was formally offered the position my boss stated that he didn't know when but my schedule will change from 9 to 6 PM to 1 to 10 PM. I accepted the offer without giving it a second thought because I really needed the extra raise and job security. Now in April I officially switched over to the new schedule and as of now I can say without a doubt that the 1 to 10 PM schedule is killing me, its affecting my personal relationships with friends and family and also affecting my mental and physical health. Would it be frowned upon if I asked to switch back to my original schedule? Also how would I go about bringing it up with my boss?

He’s retiring within 2 years and we practice succession planning, essentially every executive has to name their heir apparent.  All the other executives retiring within the next year or two have named their successor so they can start grooming/training them for a seamless transition. His role is a little different because the CEO also has a hand in who’s hired/promoted for the position.

1e6kuqz,Looking for Guidance/Direction - All Responses Appreciated!,"**Hello Reddit,**

My name is John Smith (burner account). I am currently employed at a community college in Arizona. I graduated in 2022 with a bachelors in Business Administration, I have a Masters Degree in Higher education Leadership (2024), and I have worked Full-Time for about 2 years and a few months. First Real job out of college was teaching 6th grade science and social studies (absolutely hated teaching children). Now I am at a community college (been here a little over a year) and have PHENOMENAL work life balance, and I love my (very chill and easy but very repetitive) job, but I am really struggling financially, I have about 36k in student debt from my masters program (got my bachelors degree with scholarships luckily) and my fiancee and I 'own' a house (1800 a month mortgage payment).

**A bit more about Me:**

I am 24 years old, I have some EdD applications pending (I was denied at ASU despite have a 4.0 gpa), I am an academic advisor, and I feel as though my chances of climbing at my college are low, as I unfortunately am surrounded by colleagues with graduate education who have been in similar roles to me for quite a while. (one person in my role has been doing it for 20+ years!!) I am really good and photo and video production, making websites, and marketing things (tbh who isn't though in this day and age its never been easier). I do well in school and do not struggle with really any subject academically.

**My Question(s) for you:**

I have been heavily considering going back to school to maybe do an engineering degree, or a Nursing degree as I always hear of folks who are quite successful in these areas. A close friend of mine recently finished his astronautical engineering degree and got an EPIC job at a major company, and is making fat racks despite just starting. He had military service which he said he thinks helped him land the role. I've tried applying at Boeing so far for entry level procurement and contract management roles, but cant even snag an interview.

I have also considered commissioning into the military, but I'd really rather not have to pack up my life and start up elsewhere, I love my home, pets, and being near family.

I am really curious as to your insights and recommendations, as I am EXTREMELY ambitious, and I would like to make as much money as possible as quickly as possible, and I am the sort of person to commit to a NEXT LEVEL grind to get it done. (mostly because I am OBSESSED with cars and would love to buy a new car one day, my fiancee and I currently share a 1998 dodge ram 1500).

in an ideal universe id like to make 100-150k a year, but I'd love a role where I could start at 70 and work my way up over the years (to ideally surpass even the 150k threshold) and I am concerned working in education may not necessarily be conducive towards achieving this goal.

  
Thanks in advance reddit!!!

1e6khcm,Growing ornamental plants vs cannabis career?,"
Currently I work at a small ornamental nursery and greenhouse as a greenhouse grower, I also have a A.A.S degree in horticulture. I love my job but was wondering if I were to pursue the cannabis industry and become a cannabis cultivator instead would that be a better career path in horticulture. I’m thinking that maybe there’s more room for advancement in the cannabis industry because it usually has larger companies and more room for career growth. What’s the pros and cons of staying in ornamental plant industry vs making the switch to cannabis industry?

1e6ker9,Should I pursue this new job?,"Basically a dream job has fallen into my lap. It’s the same field I’m currently in, the exact same role, but more senior, with a more interesting product. I’d be the head of my department, but it’s a department one one because the company is so new.

I’m nervous because I’ve been at my current job for over 4 years and it’s gotten very very comfortable. Like, go on multiple errands every day and take a nap comfortable. But I’m young, I’ve been massively under stimulated, and I feel stuck. There is no room to grow in that role or company anymore. 

I’m torn because
 1. The new company could fail (my current company could also fail though)
 2. I’ve been in a start up before and it was pretty demanding. And it was led by women and this isn’t. I know that sounds sexist but I’ve already heard of some… interesting remarks made by the founder, and there’s no HR in place to guard against it.
3. This job may require me to move. I’m not certain yet but if they don’t meet my (admittedly high) salary requirements it would be foolish to move to a high cost city and uproot my life especially with the concerns I have about stability.

I don’t have a family right now but want one soon. I also want to buy a house. I don’t even have a guarantee that this job is in the bag, but I feel very confident that it can be mine if I want it. What would you do?

I’m a high school graduate and didn’t plan to attend college for various reasons, such as financial constraints, limited course offerings, and location issues.

Currently, I’m eager to work to help my family financially since we’re struggling to get by each day. However, I face significant challenges: I have social anxiety, I stutter, and I’m an introvert who prefers jobs that don’t require extensive communication or socializing.

I’ve actually seen opportunities to work outside, like in town hall, milk tea stores, and similar places, but I really don’t want to pursue those options because of my personal limitations. Ideally, I want a job I can do online, but I don’t have a laptop or WiFi at the moment, which makes it even harder.

I’ve seen opportunities for virtual assistants, social media managers, freelance copywriters, and other remote jobs that seem to suit my introverted nature. However, I feel completely lost about where to start. I need guidance on which specific skills to learn, how these jobs work, how to get clients, where clients would send payments, what platforms to use, and how to build a portfolio.

Additionally, I’d appreciate recommendations for free online courses that can help me gain the necessary skills. I’ve heard about platforms like UPOU and Coursera, but I’m not sure which courses would be the most beneficial (or, let’s say, “practical”). Any suggestions on free or affordable courses that provide valuable insights and practical knowledge would be incredibly helpful.

I feel overwhelmed and a bit lost. I really want to contribute to my family’s income and find a job that fits my personality and limitations.

1e6hrjd,Should I escalate this situation?,"In January, I flipped from hourly to salary. HR told me it was for legal purposes because our company got acquired by another company and we needed to align with the parent company. My title also changed from an associate to a staff position.

My manager didn’t tell me this was happening, but later let me know that this was NOT a promotion.

June comes around and it’s time for feedback and promotion discussions (I’ve been in my role 2 years). I asked about a promotion and my manager told me that HR looks at my title change from January as a promotion even though I received no pay increase. She called it an “indirect promotion”.

Luckily, I was awarded a 10% raise as part of the annual incentive plan instead of the 2.5% raise I normally would have gotten. My manager said it was because my pay didn’t increase when my title changed. 

In August, I’ll be getting a bonus, but I was told it’ll be based off my previous salary and not my new salary. 

Is this something I should ask HR about? If I was “indirectly promoted” in January with no pay raise, I want to ask how back pay works. And, I should’ve gotten the pay increase when my title changed in January, so shouldn’t my bonus be reflective of my new pay? 

It feels like I ran a race, crossed the finish line, and when I asked for my trophy, HR said it was 5 miles back but here’s a little something for your troubles.

1e6hbai,I just got a new job that I am starting in August but planned to start trying for a baby next spring. Please read below for more information. What do I do?,"Hello everyone,
I have been at my current job for 2 and a half years and have always wanted to get into the federal government and after a year of searching I finally got in.

I am 35 (going on 36 in October) and my husband is 39 (going on 40 in February 2025). We have been married for what’s going to be ten years in June 2025 and have the best life and travel everywhere together and are very happy. 

I obviously do love the idea of being a parent one day and due to my love of travel and my job I feel like I would be ok with one kid. So we agreed that we would start trying in 2025 since that’ll be the ten year anniversary.

He wanted to start in February after we do an amazing three week trip in Asia in January. I told him let’s wait for the spring and he said fine but I know he wants it sooner rather than later.

The plan was to stay at my current job and start trying next year because than I would have been at my current job for three years by that time.

However I got this federal job and my career makes me come in person everyday. I couldn’t turn down this opportunity with the benefits and pension. Plus some government jobs in my field allow you to go part time and cut back to 20 hours which would work well with an eventual family.

I feel like I now want to wait a bit longer until I am at the new job for at least a year so start trying in July/august 2025 versus April because I want to be settled in my job for a year, go through the probation period and not let the distractions of trying to have a baby get in the way of this.

Plus I’ll have to get off of the birth control and there’s the risk of becoming pregnant sooner which may affect my job.

I am in fitness and wellness so my body is involved.

Any advice on what i should do would be great,

1e6gqom,Eligible job role advice ,"TLDR : looking for advice to find job for my gf with Bachelors in computer science but doesn't want to persue programing.

Hey, 
Sorry for any mistakes which I make as this is my first reddit post ever. Do let me know abt them so I can correct then in future posts.

My girlfriend(27) completed her bachelor's in Computer Science in 2018 and worked as in an analyst role and left her job last year as the company she worked at mandate all full time roles to be converted into contract based roles for 1 year. She didnt want to be binded into a contract so she left which I fully supported her along with her family.

It's been 7 months since she is jobless and now she is getting anxious almost daily about her life and career and is feeling very down. She wanted to be a author but told me she would need 1 year to build her portfolio before she can start in that field by content writer and then write books in her free time. I pushed her a lot in the 7 months but it led to her getting more anxious and sick(hypertension) bcz of it. 

I want to help her but I am in tech field and have domain knowledge of tech related jobs but she has made it clear that she doesn't want to do any programming and she hates it. Her profile have Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and analysts experience. She doesn't want to again get into analyst as she didn't like it but as a last resort will accept it as her fate. She wants to explore other job roles besides customer service as she is not a social person. 

I am not sure which job role will suit her now and wanted advice on the same.
Any advice for what she can do or in which job roles she can search and apply for would be greatly appreciated. Also if you have advise on how I can help her please let me know.
I do remind her to apply for jobs and support her preferences but am unable to find any good leads.",Ok-Discipline-2773,2,1.0,2,1721322960,2024-07-18 17:16:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e6gqom/eligible_job_role_advice/,7,2024
1e6go73,Where Can I Go from Office Manager?,"I started at my company two years ago as a project administrator, and earlier this year I was promoted to Office Manager (while still doing my project admin work). There was a nice pay bump so I took the promotion. I am worried that there is no upward growth for me from here. I’ve worked in admin for 10 years now, and I’m bored of it. I’m fine to stick in the role if I can get elsewhere eventually, but I’m scared that by taking this position I’ve eliminated my growth opportunities. 

Does anyone have advice on where I could possibly go next? I love my company and don’t want to leave, but I also don’t want to be organizing the office supplies in five years.

1e6gcem,Refusing a job offer after accepting. Advice? ,"I recently took an offer for a new job after giving my current employer 6 weeks notice. I've worked at my company for 8 years now. The company I'm due to start at were happy to wait the given notice period. I work for a limited company and will be transferring to another limited company. 

It's been 3 weeks since I gave my notice, however my boss had a chat with me today explaining that he really didn't want me to leave, that I was as much a part of the company as any of them and after conferring with my 2nd boss, is more than happy to pay significantly more than I was offered from the new job offer with promises of a director position a few years down the line etc. 

I've been trying to figure out if I do really want to go and start over again at a new place for the past couple of weeks but if I were to decline this job offer after they've waited for me, I'd feel like I've wasted their time and it kinda doesn't sit right with me for doing so. I haven't signed any employment agreement yet but any advice how to deal with declining the offer if I do would be greatly appreciated.

How do I get promoted?,"I have a masters in business law and I can't get a permanent role after a year at my current company. I'm an agency worker and have been told I will be waiting at least 2 more years to be made permanent because department ""doesn't have the funding"". Thing is, I'm basically doing my supervisor's job *for her* to the point that even coworkers she's known for 8 years come to me first. I was hired to support, not *manage* her department which I basically do. I answer and action 80% of queries to our shared mailbox. She treats me like a PA and blocked me from a promotion 5 months ago because my work was ""too valuable to the the team"". Then 3 months ago a fellow agency worker left without notice and I was made take on her role and my own for no extra pay. Adding to this, said agency worker interviewed for a role I also interviewed for 2 months ago and she's gotten it.

I have no benefits, I can't negotiate a pay rise and my contract is so vague that it allowed them to give me 2/3 roles at once. I would leave but this company pays really well and my partner is an engineer here- it really suits us to stay. I want to go into HR or regulatory affairs. How to i kiss a and get somewhere? The 3 roles I've lost out on have all advised I make myself known to hiring manager going forward and make myself ""visible"". One advised I'm clearly capable but I lack confidence.  My mental health is really suffering. I need to get out of this job. I am barely above minimum wage. How do I network into a promotion?

1e6dkhp,Data Scientist or surgeon ,"Idk if I can post this here or not but I'm 20F on my 2nd gap year and I still cannot decide my career. I have the option to do data science from the top university in state or take a risk and do a 3rd attempt of mcat. (in our country we give mcat before undergrad). 

Reason I'm conflicted:
I love the idea of studying data science and computer but when I imagine working as a datascientist I don't like it much but I think I can bear it.. Whereas I don't like studying medicine much, I'll be in debt when I graduate with little to no job opportunities but I'd love to be a neurosurgeon and the thing is I've idolized the life of a resident surgeon in NYC so much that I feel like I'm betraying myself by not going. And if I put in actual time, I will start earning quite some money. 


So please. Suggest should I choose something that I love studying but hate as a profession or something I'll love to do as job but hate the idea of having to study it. 


I have the means to support both degrees and am good at them both as well. I also think I'd adapt well with the lifestyle of either of these jobs. What should I do.

job 2 interview is tomorrow, but i talked to her otp and the manager was so sweet and we talked for 10 minutes, it sounded like she was ready to hire me and told me to bring all the info, id, passports etc. 

both jobs pay the same, job 1 is short training and work immediately & job 2 is training for 1 month and then start working

what do i do? i like job 2’s environment & pace but i like the benefits of job 1 and how it starts asap.

if i get promise of employment does this mean i have to accept?

My new job offer is a director-level position, and I am salaried at $150k, which would mean more take-home because I'm taxed less. comes with healthcare and access to 401k with an insignificant match. the only catch is that they want me onsite 5 days/week (no WFH) and I'd have to drop my current clients.

what would you do? I enjoy the freedom of self-employment and like working remotely and being my own boss.

1e6d1fs,Stay with current company comfort or accept new company offer?,"Hi Everyone 

Long post here but have been going back and forth on a job change. Both would be in same sort of position. Looking for advice here or personal anecdotes because I am at wits end on what to do… 28 years old 3 years into current company in the US

Salary consideration:

Current: $75,000 + 5% annual STI

New: $92,000 + 6% annual STI

Current = $2112 take home bi weekly; $4224 monthly 

New= $2542 take home bi weekly; $5084 monthly

Net difference = $860 a month

Schedule and daily rate consideration: (I know hours don’t align but in my head if I’m there I’m there anyways)

Current:

4 day/ 10hr work week (7a-5p): 
$75,000 / 208 working days = $360/day

5 day/ 8hr work week (8a-4p but is lax with leaving whenever finished):
$92,000 / 260 working days = $353/day

Commute consideration:

Current commute:
2 ways x4 days x15 minutes=120 minutes in the car 

New commute:
2 ways x5 days x40 minutes=400 minutes in the car 

Gas consideration: 

Current:
8 miles x4x2=64 miles a week/ 25.5 miles per gallon =2.5 gallons of gas per week - current gas price 3.79/gal = $9.48 per week on gas/ $19 biweekly / $40 monthly

New:
27 miles x5x2= 270 miles a week/ 25.5 miles per gallon= 10.5 gallons of gas per week - current gas price 3.79/gal = $39.75 per week on gas/ $80 biweekly/ $160 monthly 

Health insurance consideration:

Current:
$65 a month but only pay copays

New:
$55 a month but $2,000 deductible 

Vacation Consideration:

Current:
16  - 10hr days PTO + 5 sick days (very flexible on this)

New:
15 - 8hr days PTO + unlimited sick days
(Option to purchase additional 5 days vacation)

Miscellaneous:

Current:
Pros:
I have a great reputation at the plant; have been promoted once after my first year
Love my team I work with
Having Fridays off hard to quantify
Somewhat lax work environment 
Employee engagement focused
Large global company

Cons:
Company is doing bad financially
Work at singular plant so advancement is limited 
Was told I am qualified for senior position but company budget won’t currently allow it; budgeted for 2025 though 
New company model flattened organization with a lot of uncertainty and lack of leadership positions
Inconsistent annual STI due to financials
Area is less accessible to future living arrangement areas (I currently like where I like)

New:
Pros:
Global company 
Offered senior position
Company also has headquarters attached to plant so more for advancement
Doing well financially so consistently hit annual STI
Few good friends work there
Area is more accessible to future living arrangement areas

Cons:
Want team onsite because they are transitioning team to headquarters location so WFH not an option currently
The uncertainty of a new company
Commute
Work Fridays

1e6cv2p,Considering a Move and a Job Change,"Hi all,

I'm a 30-year-old male currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at a large biotech company on the East coast (Fortune 500). I've been with this company for almost six years, growing from a Junior Software Engineer to my current senior role. My total compensation is about $300k (including base, bonus, and stocks), and the job offers excellent benefits and a good work-life balance. I'm married with two kids.

I moved to the East coast specifically for this job and, over the years, I haven't been able to establish a strong social network here. My family and close friends are all in Los Angeles, and I struggle with loneliness. I work remotely 90% of the time, going to the office just once a week. However, my company is against allowing us to be fully remote, which prevents me from moving back to LA.

I've been passed over for promotion twice now and don't see another promotion happening anytime soon. This has made me consider looking for a new job that would allow me to move back to LA and be closer to my family. However, I'm concerned that I might be letting my emotions lead me away from a good job. I understand how fortunate I am to have this position.

I haven't job hunted in six years, so I'm feeling quite rusty and unsure about where to start. I'd really appreciate any advice on the following:

1. How to effectively start a job search after a long time? Specifically for software engineers what skills should I brush up on. Any resources you recommend?
2. Any advice on negotiating remote work opportunities with potential employers or are those days gone?
3. Any recommendations for job opportunities or companies in the LA area? 
4. Best way to apply to jobs?

1e6coi3,I had not submitted my dissertation and unintentionally went no contact with university due to poor health,"Hi everyone,

I am a 28-year-old female living in Sri Lanka in need of dire advice regarding my life/career/education. I attended private school and sat the London O/Ls and A/Ls so naturally I also did my undergraduate at a private college for engineering in my locality that was affiliated with a UK university. Once I graduated I struggled with years of unemployment owing to my not being able to get accreditation from the Sri Lankan Board of Engineers - the IESL.

Since I was worried about having gap year(s) in my CV, I enrolled to do ACCA. I befriended a batchmate who was the office manager at an accounting firm and he offered me a bookkeeping position. A few weeks after I joined we went into a nationwide pandemic lockdown and my job role eventually changed to payroll operator due to difficulties training online. After a year and a half, I was not progressing professionally and reached a plateau. I decided I would try to apply for a Master's degree in Engineering and enrolled to a transport planning and engineering degree to try and take advantage of the post-study work visa (PSW). I passed all my taught modules but did not complete the dissertation due to my struggle with mental health. My initial submission date was due in  Sep2022 but I requested several extensions and had to return to Sri Lanka as my visa was expiring. Since then I have been in and out of treatment. This is the first time I am connecting to the web since I think Sep/Oct of 2023. So I have just seen the email from my university informing me of the board's decision that I submit the dissertation by March 2024 and if not I will not be eligible for the MSc award. I may only be awarded the PGDip. 

My guilt and anxiety due to not having completed the degree as planned and failing to stay and gain work experience in the UK have been further aggravating my mental health that I could not bring myself to switch on my laptop. In the past year and a half, I might have only used it 4 to 5 times for a couple of hours trying to get cracking on the dissertation and ending up inflicting self-harm from the guilt, frustration, disappointment, feeling worthless, knowing there is no future for me here as my degree is not recognised, loosing my **only chance at life.** My university has afforded me a great level of consideration in giving me extensions. My academic tutor had initially advised that I defer the course for another year and complete it when I felt better. But due to unexpected waitlist to get going with the treatment in the UK delayed my progress. MY psychological evaluation found that I needed secondary urgent care so my waitlist should not have been more than 2 weeks but it was delayed by a couple of months. My GPs repeatedly tried expediting me on the list but to no avail. After returning to Sri Lanka I have only had access to medication and counselling, there are no other tools and services used. The counselling providers don't help with any tools and techniques, they just listen with no feedback as to how I could approach the setbacks, my anxiety, depression and OCD.  I expressed concern about not opening my email accounts due to feeling extremely anxious and overwhelming sensation. Each time, I tried switching on my laptop and inflicting blows to myself with heavy objects. Many months have passed with this dilemma. Now I don't want to ask for yet another extension. I feel embarrassed about how I am not able to get a grip on the situation and have in the past told my faculty how I am hoping to have it completed by the newly extended deadline, only to not do it repeatedly. I am disappointed so much in myself I can't do or think about anything other than how I have failed everyone and wasted the money and resources.

I have carried this guilt over the 2 years on top of the underlying problems that caused my breakdown. I now don't take part in any activities. I don't go out of my room, or out of my house, and refuse treatment as I don't see any improvement. I only slept if I could, be fed by my parents even past their retirement age they are providing for me. I don't always get around to showering on difficult days. 

I suspect I might be bipolar but can't bring this up to the psychologist without offending them. My parents are now looking to see if there might be a different approach in India and hope to get me started on any available treatment there. I am struggling with these issues since 17 when my parents refused to get treatment for due to it being stigmatized in our society, which the physician at the time too agreed to not get help for. But now they see my struggle day-to-day and are willing to help me overcome this.

I don't know if there will be another chance, although the sentencing in the email seems that the decision by the board seems final. I don't even know if I want another chance, another extension. It has been a constant thought that I don't dare to confront.

I don't have anyone who could provide sound advice on the above. should I

1. still try requesting or deadline or deferring the course for another year if that is still an option.

2. exit with whatever award I am eligible for without the dissertation. This might be one less thing I would need to worry about.

3. I need to move to the UK to get the job but am not able to face interviews right now. So apply for a PGDip (not an MSC). I can do exams and assignments for taught modules, my weakness in writing the dissertation stems from the problems I faced when writing my undergrad thesis (something very serious and unprofessional unfair incidents that took place). If so what courses may I apply to considering my Engineering and ACCA background?

  
I'm sorry if this post has unnecessary info that may be irrelevant and long, this is my first reddit post and I badly need advice on this matter. Thank you for reading this post and trying to be helpful!

The problem is, no one works remotely in my company, so I'd be the only person working remotely. My job role requires 0% involvement with other team members, so doing my job remotely is 100% possible if they let me.

I'm getting anxiety about asking for remote work. What if they don't allow me? Do I just quit?

If someone has been in a similar situation, please advise.",CaptainPBee,1,1.0,0,1721308222,2024-07-18 13:10:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e6b21x/quit_or_wfh_for_health_concerns/,7,2024
1e6aw5z,Need Advice on How to Deal with a New Director Who Does Not Communicate,"Hi! Would love some career advice on how to make this marketing team work!

Background: I work for a large national dealership group. I am over 5 stores in a marketing capacity, with only a new Marketing Director over me. I work in a different part of the country than the new Marketing Director.

So, to summarize, we got a new Marketing Director - he does not communicate AT ALL any plans or goals or anything he is working on. I was very excited to dive into our new initiatives and work as a team. A big example is about 20 new websites - he said it would be a team effort, but everything is done in the shadows and he does not share timelines or plan deviations, or eve short term goals, about this or ANYTHING. I have heard from higher-ups he is working on SO many things that our team has no idea about. I am getting to the point where I'm starting to believe he does not share these projects so that, when something good happens, he will get all the glory. His communication style sucks, and we all believe (not disparagingly) that he is on the spectrum.

Everyone has been going to the head of the company that he doesn't make sense, he doesn't tell anyone anything, his communication sucks, etc. etc. The head of the company is listening, but he's at a loss for what to do. This guy is extremely smart and knows a lot, but my upward trajectory in this job has seemingly stopped.

What I need advice on: The head of the company asked me to think about what we could do to make the team work. I don't know a team structure where this guy is not over me, but I can still defer to him for expert advice, because I do really value his input. It's also a big issue that when I DO get him involved, he takes whatever it is over and no longer includes me. He has many conversations with my GMs without me knowing anything about it.

The head of the company thought of ""project boards"" to force him to have open communication because he can't force this guy to communicate with the team. I feel it is a bit juvenile to bring out working style down to his level, but I am not 100% opposed to not doing this at all.

Anyone have any ideas on how or what I could pitch? I would like to ideally be the manager under him of my region and have managers over the other regions, but I don't know if that is appropriate to pitch as of this moment.

  
I LOVED my job before this guy came in. It's began to get EXTREMELY frustrating and I've thought about rage-quitting more than a few times.

Before the interview they called me to check the information I submitted on the application was correct and they even confirmed my requested pay I put in the application. Once I got the offer letter they are wanting to pay me $24 an hour which is lower then my minimum requested. People around me are telling me to accept the amount but I am currently making a little more than what they offered. Glassdoor hasn’t been much help on giving me a good number. I am needing help on knowing if I would be asking for to much if I went over the amount they offered and/or insight on how to negotiate.

1e68kw3,Lost Both Jobs Due to Conflict of Interest and Lying - Desperate for Advice on How to Get My Job Back,"Hi everyone,

I'm in a pretty tough situation right now and I could really use some advice. Here's what happened:

I was working at a company that I really valued, but I got an opportunity to try out a job at another company. The problem was, there was a significant conflict of interest between the two companies, and I was well aware.

The problem was, there was a significant conflict of interest between the two companies, and I was well aware of it. When I went to try out the new job, I lied and said I wasn't currently employed. This lie backfired terribly, and I ended up losing both jobs.

In a panic, I tried desperately to get my original job back. I called the managers numerous times, pleading and even appealing to their sense of morality to give me another chance. At one point, one of the managers asked me what I wanted out of life and suggested setting clear goals. Despite all my efforts, it was clear they didn’t want anything to do with me anymore.

I even reached out to the company's director, explaining my situation and begging to be rehired. He responded that because I had lied to the company, taking me back would make him look foolish in front of his colleagues. I understand why they’re hesitant, but this job meant everything to me and I can't seem to move on.

I feel like I've exhausted all options – calling, writing letters, and even reaching out to the highest levels of the company. I'm at a loss for what to do next.

Should I write another letter to the director? Is there something specific I should say or do to prove how important this job is to me and that I’ve learned from my mistakes? I just can't let go of how much this job meant to me.

Any advice on how I could potentially get my job back or how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance.",Significant-Tart2420,0,0.46000000834465027,38,1721300304,2024-07-18 10:58:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e68kw3/lost_both_jobs_due_to_conflict_of_interest_and/,7,2024

The Executive Director I worked for left at the same time I did, and her replacement has upgraded my replacement's title to Director of Marketing and Communications. I am familiar with the person who took over my role and know for a fact nothing about the scope of the job has changed, they simply felt the title better represented all of the responsibility involved.

I've always heard it's within reason to tweak your job title to make your duties clearer, but would updating my title on my resume to match the upgraded one my replacement received be a step too far? If such a thing came up in an interview, would explaining these circumstances seem reasonable or just paint me as untrustworthy?

1e63xvo,Nursing degree advice ,"So I am currently trying to get some advice on how to direct my mother when it comes to acquiring her nursing degree let’s say BSN. My mother has been trying to complete nursing school for as long as I can remember, she’s taken classes and then stopped over the years. In 2004 she got
Her certificate to be a medical assistant and has worked for her company for over 20 years in that role. They also trained her to perform Surgical tech and lab tech duties. Recently my mom signed up for this expensive school ( which I advised her not to) where they didn’t accept any of her previous credits really and told her she needed to complete prerequisites and that she would then have her associates as an LPN. Once she paid them the money already they doubled down and told her that it’s actually an associate degree for medical assistant, and that she would need to do intern hours and then be able to continue on in the program for LPN. My mother lives in a HCOL state and I told her that before she continues with this school that she should check other schools in my area to find out if there is a way to transfer to a regular school for nursing and go straight for her BSN. 

The school
That she is currently in is basically a small private college and I feel like they are giving her the run around and moving the goal post everytime she gets close. My mother has more than enough schooling and hours of experience in the medical field to be able to take the NCLEX. I need some advice from someone who is in the actual nursing field who can better break down for me what exactly is going on and what should she be looking for or looking out for so she can finally finish school , because I feel like whatever she’s been doing is making things take way longer than it should and burning through a lot of money.

Meanwhile, I’m just a college dropout who managing (assistant manager) a shoe store. Not at all what I had envisioned. But now that I’m in my mid 20’s, I can’t stop thinking about my future and long term career goals. 

I’ve always been interested in biology and behavior. It has been my dream and aspiration to study behavior ecology/ethology (animal behavior in wild animals). I wanted to go into research or honestly, become a professor in a related field. Or I could even settle for forestry, or conservation careers. Anything of the sort. But the older I get, the more aware that making a living in a field (or anything terribly academic) like that is next to none, unless you are in a small percentile or just really lucky… A work a passion, really. Even fields like wildlife biology are pretty competitive, too, and I’m scared I won’t be able to secure anything that will provide something stable. 

On the other hand, I’m having to consider a “safe option”, by going back to college and choosing a more desirable career path, such as marketing, IT, business management, nursing, finance. All things I honeslty have no passion in, but know I would be safe when finding a job, given the need of these fields. 

I don’t want to be stuck in a world of debt for a degree that I don’t have passion in, or a degree I can’t make much money in. It feels that no matter who I talk to, or get advice from, everyone seems to have different answers, or mostly people just don’t know. I need a direction because I’m driving my self insane with all of this… Any advice or suggestions???

I'm facing a career dilemma and could really use some advice. Here's the situation: I recently accepted a promotion for a remote position, 10% raise, with 30% travel involved within my state. My start date is in a week. However, this week has been tumultuous as my current general manager and regional vice president were fired. Now, the president is urging me to step into the role of general manager with a strong insistence that I take it ""whatever it takes."" This promotion will most likely include 20-30% raise, however I'll be tied up in the office for most part in a very stressful environment. 

I've been with the company for several years, patiently waiting for a promotion. Just when I thought it wasn't happening, I pursued a different opportunity within the organization, which led to the remote position I just accepted.

I'm torn because on one hand, becoming a general manager has been a career goal of mine for the past two years. On the other hand, I'm excited about the remote position I just signed up for and don't want to lose the opportunity it presents.

How should I approach this situation? Any advice on navigating this unexpected turn of events would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Everyone 

Throwaway…

Long post here but have been going back and forth on a job change. Both would be in same sort of position. Looking for advice here or personal anecdotes because I am at wits end on what to do… 28 years old 3 years into current company

Salary consideration:

Current: $75,000 + 5% annual STI

New: $92,000 + 6% annual STI

Current = $2112 take home bi weekly; $4224 monthly 

New= $2542 take home bi weekly; $5084 monthly

Net difference = $860 a month

Schedule and daily rate consideration: (I know hours don’t align but in my head if I’m there I’m there anyways)

Current:

4 day/ 10hr work week (7a-5p): 
$75,000 / 208 working days = $360/day

5 day/ 8hr work week (8a-4p but is lax with leaving whenever finished):
$92,000 / 260 working days = $353/day

Commute consideration:

Current commute:
2 ways x4 days x15 minutes=120 minutes in the car 

New commute:
2 ways x5 days x40 minutes=400 minutes in the car 

Gas consideration: 

Current:
8 miles x4x2=64 miles a week/ 25.5 miles per gallon =2.5 gallons of gas per week - current gas price 3.79/gal = $9.48 per week on gas/ $19 biweekly / $40 monthly

New:
27 miles x5x2= 270 miles a week/ 25.5 miles per gallon= 10.5 gallons of gas per week - current gas price 3.79/gal = $39.75 per week on gas/ $80 biweekly/ $160 monthly 

Health insurance consideration:

Current:
$65 a month but only pay copays

New:
$55 a month but $2,000 deductible 

Vacation Consideration:

Current:

Current:
Pros:
I have a great reputation at the plant; have been promoted once after my first year
Love my team I work with
Having Fridays off hard to quantify
Somewhat lax work environment 
Employee engagement focused
Large global company

Cons:
Company is doing bad financially
Work at singular plant so advancement is limited 
Was told I am qualified for senior position but company budget won’t currently allow it; budgeted for 2025 though 
New company model flattened organization with a lot of uncertainty and lack of leadership positions
Inconsistent annual STI due to financials
Area is less accessible to future living arrangement areas (I currently like where I like)

New:
Pros:
Global company 
Offered senior position
Company also has headquarters attached to plant so more for advancement / department switches
Doing well financially so consistently hit annual STI
Few good friends work there
Area is more accessible to future living arrangement areas

Cons:
Want team onsite because they are transitioning team to headquarters location so WFH not an option currently
The uncertainty of a new company
Commute
Work Fridays

1e5zjcp,"Hired for job and allowed to work 6 months remotely. Supposed to move in 2 weeks, how do I talk with boss about not moving and keeping job?","I got laid off from my job last October with \~10 years experience as an aerospace engineer at a big aerospace company doing CFD work. I interviewed with a  smaller aerospace company located across the country in November, accepted the offer just before Christmas, and started the job end of January. The job offer came with the stipulation that I could work remotely for 6 months until August 1 and then would have to move halfway across the country to relocate. Halfway through the 6 month period, I realized this opportunity is not good enough for me to move across the country but definitely still good enough to be a remote employee, especially since I’ve been a remote employee for 6 months already.

I am supposed to be reporting for work in person 2 weeks from today. My boss has contacted me 3-4 times TOTAL throughout the 6 months to ask me the status of the relocation plan. Each time I respond with “I still plan to be there by August 1” even though I have known I don’t plan on going. The last time she contacted me about the move was the 2^(nd) week of June, and haven’t heard from her since.

I clearly would like to stay with the company and continue working remotely, but I just don’t want to move from where I am. The biggest reason for not wanting to move is I like where I live and my friends/family/long term girlfriend are all here. Also, I became a homeowner in 2021 and my interest rate is a meager 2.7%. If I was to sell my house now I would have to pay way more for rent something 1/3 the size of my house and also I wont be able to be a homeowner again for a long time due to the exorbitantly high interest rates right now. The last point I’d like to make is I’ve been a remote employee for the last 4 years and can do my job from home, moving across the country is not going to make a difference

How do I go about this conversation? I understand it isn’t a good look to have this conversation with my boss two weeks before Im supposed to be there and especially when I told her just 6 weeks ago I’m still coming. But if she says no then I can just put in my two weeks notice and start looking for a new job. I really enjoy the work I’m doing and I feel Im finally at the point where I can bring real value to the company so I’d love to work something out with the company to stay where I am.

The last point I’ll make is there is a guy in the group who is the same age as me and has the same time in the industry as me, but the majority of his work has been in this subject matter specifically whereas it’s all new to me. He lives 1 hr away from work and he works from home 4 days and is in office 1 day.",TRXMafia,0,0.5,24,1721266835,2024-07-18 01:40:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e5zjcp/hired_for_job_and_allowed_to_work_6_months/,7,2024

1e5yyna,Idk what to do with my life,"Hey guys, Im a M 20 from Germany and i would like to get ur opinions on my situation and maybe get some advice or inspirations, bc i really dont know what to do with my life. sorry if it might be a long post im trying to keep it as short as possible.

 I left school at 17 with a secondary school certificate ( realschulabschluss in german ), and went straight to italy after turning 18, because my uncle who lives there offered me a job in his company as a bricklayer. I didnt think twice and took the chance bc i didnt have much growing up, and i wanted to support my mum who was struggling and move to a warmer country. I only stayed there for about 9-10 months, bc i started to get depressed. It was a hard time for me because i didnt speak the language at first and people started to make fun of me or look at me funny. On top of that i was working very hard outside with every type of wheater, i had to leave the house at 5am to go to work and was back many times around 8 pm. i gained over 30kg in this time and spent most of my freetime on the ps4. I had very little contact with friends and family and struggled making new ones bc only 6k people lived in my town, and most of them were old, so i decided to move back to germany. 

Back in Germany i was commited to get in shape again and lost the 30 kg in arround 1 Year. In that period i had 3 jobs. the first one was a part time job in a restaurant, i enjoyed it and learned a lot there but decided to leave due to feeling ashamed of my appearance, and really low wages. i wanted to earn more and started working fulltime at a door company. After recieving an offer from mercedes i upgrated and started to do  trucks for them in assembly lines. I eventually left after 6 months because it was physically too challenging. My last job started on october 2023 and i was working as a door 2 door promoter for Telekom. i honestly loved that job and my colleagues and was earning decent money, but i started to hangout with the wrong collegues and got addicted to gambling, cocaine and alcohol. I used to always give my mum around 50% of my income because im still living under her roof, but i started not doing that anymore and wasting my whole money in the first week of payment. it continued like that arround 3 months and i stopped going to work in march due to depression again. 

After losing my job i wanted to take a break and try and think what to do with my life. The state is supposed to give me 60% of my income from all of my jobs in the last 2 years, i had to fill in a bunch of documents and go to alot of meetings but havnt recieved any money yet in almost 5 months of unemployment. Due to my financial situation i was forced to start a new job in the beginning of this month, bc i didnt wanna keep living off my mum that is already struggling. The new job is very boring and not very demanding and it really is just a gap filler to get some money. Unfortunatelly tho i got hurt really bad in an accident last week and lost my phone so i couldnt go to work. i let them know what happened per email, but they seemed pretty unimpressed with me missing already after 1 week.

Now i really dont know what to do, i gained a lot of experiences in the last 3 years. I can do physicall work, im good at talking to people, im good at organising things, good at maths, i speak 5 languages, and im physically strong and not bad looking. So i understand that in have a lot of potential, on the other side im sick of having a new job all the time i want to stick to sth long term. In those 3 years i could have got an education or saved some money, like most of my friends did. i really dont know wtf to do with my life.

Alternatively, if we don’t get a new role we can consider severance once the role is filled by someone. Supposably I’m a lead candidate for one of the “new” roles which is senior level, but I’m not holding my breath. This company has been through about three re-orgs in the last year and I have had just about enough to prefer working somewhere else. My question is: is it normal practice to say “if a job description changes x%, we now need a new role that you must apply to and eliminate the old position” or is it all BS to save salary money for the company since the tech market has softened?

1e5v61q,"Left my career, now I cannot find work. I want to get into something else but do not know what.","Hello, mid 20s M Canada, left my government position as I could not wake up to go to work anymore. Job was incredibly depressing and stressful, but pay was decent (75k, top out at 87k) with benfits, pension, etc… heres the problem.

My thought process was that I have the qualification and experience in the field (construction) that I could apply at any other municipal job to get the same position or hopefully better, but have been unsuccessful. I applied to multiple different private companies in the hopes to hit that high 90k to 100k+ figure in a sales position, or project manager roll but have been unsuccessful as they require experience. I disliked my career and the people I had to work around so much that I made the jump to put my 2 weeks in without any confirmation of a position.. and of course I didn’t get a position (still unemployed after 2 months).

The challenge is that I do not know what I want to do and do not want to start all back over with schooling. With the prices of housing now a days (a half a million dollar house is literally a falling down shack full of asbestos and lead) I am in a position where I CAN’T not make a wage less than 90k (because I could not afford a house or rent and build any sort of financial freedom). I feel my 75k salary gross got me absolutely nowhere and I NEED to do more, but the position was too mentally straining.

I narrowed what I think I would enjoy and also could be very lucrative, sale position in the construction sector. I like to help, I like to make build rapport, provide someone with a really good product that I believe in and enjoy people being in a good mood. However every employer is looking for experience. 

Does anyone have any advice as to what they would do? I could probably find another municipal building inspector job that pays 70-75 but its really not enough $ and the career is awful. I have big aspirations, 200k+ but I feel like I need mentorship and reality is slowly setting in that it’s very unlikely.

Thanks for ready! I really needed to get that off my chest.

1e5urok,Should I ask for a review before agreeing to more travel?,"I am a millwright currently working for a roof truss manufacturer in the Pacific Northwest. I have 9 years experience within my field, started with this company in September 2022. My current and previous employers have always been very happy with my work. I take pride in what I do, have other skill sets that are sought after and not typical for someone in this position. 

Throughout my time here I have been asked on multiple occasions and agreed to travel to other plants who need assistance. This includes 3 separate week long trips out of state and multiple 2-3 day trips. Travel was never discussed or included in my job description/offer letter. I do not enjoy traveling for work or losing my free time at home. Previous experience as a field service tech have cemented this for me. The last week long trip I had in March I expressed my concerns to management about travel and loss of free time at home and agreed to what I thought was the last of traveling. Now I am being asked again.

My last review was in May 2023, I received a great review and a $2 raise up to $34 an hour. This I believe is close to fair for the current position I am in but not for a position that includes travel. Should I ask for a review before committing to more travel? Or should I more firmly turn down the travel due to previously stated personal conflicts? I would consider a set travel schedule for an increased rate but I’m afraid the amount will be insulting. For reference my field service position paid $45 an hour in 2018 I left that and took a sizable decrease in order to avoid traveling for work. 

I appreciate any advice.

1e5ulj0,Offered a high paying job after starting my current one,"Hello all, I usually don’t post but I feel like I’m in a tight spot at the moment.

I’m a recent grad whose contract role started in January and ended in June. I applied to as many marketing/communications roles in hopes of starting a new position in July. My hope was to find a marketing/communications position at a school district, higher ed institution or with a non-profit.

I got extremely lucky and landed a role at a non-profit with $24/hr pay, great benefits, friendly colleagues, and a team that was really excited to have me on board. I even attended this non-profits conference while I was in college and gained an internship out of it. So, I’m the product of their success which helped me out during the interview process. Only downside is that its development work (which I never considered as a career) but I was up for the challenge!

But, I also applied/interviewed for a marketing coordinator role at a local school district. It was literally my #1 choice, I wanted it so badly. My first interview went okay (not my best) but I think it was the nerves and imposter syndrome that got to me. They hadn’t reached back out to me and when I called they told me it might take a while. I was positive I wasn’t getting the job. So I accepted the non-profit job since they offered to me first.

Then, this week happened. I started my non-profit job this week. The school district calls me yesterday and asked for a second interview and I went for it. I did….. phenomenal!!!! The panel was impressed with my experience. I actually applied for 2 positions with this district and was able to choose which one I preferred. A few hours later they’re offering me the role with a salary range from 70k-80k. Great benefits and I’m continuing to work in marketing and communications.

This is where I’m stumped. I literally just started this development position with this non-profit. But I’m being offered a way better salary continuing on with my preferred industry. Maybe it’s cause I’m a new grad and still navigating what to do but I feel guilty about resigning with my current company. But I cannot pass up this new offer. How should I go about this? I’m currently looking over the employee handbook to see if I’ll get penalized for this. 

What do y’all think? ",lanielovee,6,0.800000011920929,10,1721253410,2024-07-17 21:56:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e5ulj0/offered_a_high_paying_job_after_starting_my/,7,2024

1e5t6ij,Is HR or Finance/Risk better?,"I (20F) am in community college for an AAS in cybersecurity and am set to graduate in May 2025 at 21. However, I've never really been interested in tech/security and I only chose this major because I wanted to make a bunch of money, but I feel no passion for it.

I'm considering doing a BBA at a 4-year, but I'm stuck between finance and HR. On the one hand, finance is super versatile and there's more money in it, but I'm scared to death of accounting, calculus, and databases/programming classes. On the other hand, the HR degree would be easier and isn't as math/programming-heavy, but the money isn't as great and it just limits me to HR roles.

I thought doing finance and focusing on cyber risk management would be badass and maybe later I could do an MBA/DBA in cyber management, but cyber/financial risk is pretty competitive and I don't see many internship opportunities for it.

Should I risk it and go for finance or should I stick with something easier like HR and work my way up the ladder?",Otherwise_Elk4771,1,1.0,1,1721249901,2024-07-17 20:58:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e5t6ij/is_hr_or_financerisk_better/,7,2024

1e5q4ou,"Finding research unfulfilling and too insular, and looking for a new career path","I'm 1 year into my PhD (4 years total) in Civil Engineering and I'm considering leaving it because I'm really not enjoying it. I feel isolated--with little social interaction in my work day, apart from research meetings where students talk about their individual projects. Also, I feel discouraged because I feel that I could work or not work on a given day or week and it wouldn't make a difference because there's so much trial and error in my work (mostly error). Also, my projects in my PhD are now more complex and specialized than in my masters, so my supervisors can no longer advise me on a lot of stuff (I need to connect with other professors or just learn stuff on my own). 

I don't exactly know what I want to do--I was initially so revved up about becoming a scientist and doing research for a living, but now that I'm in it, I find it so isolating, tedious, and frustrating. I'm happy when I get away from work--on the weekends, I love socializing, hanging out with my friends, being outside, seeing family, etc. I'm happy otherwise, and I have a feeling that work isn't supposed to be so dreadful and draining.

I don't see myself working in academia because of the poor work-life balance and because I love the city I'm in and don't want to be forced to move. (Also because I'm not really enjoying my PhD, so I don't know if I would enjoy working in academia). But I have no idea what I want to do! I'm considering working in air quality, public health, building science, etc. because I currently do research in indoor air quality. I have a MASc in Civil Engineering, although I'm not an engineer--I did a BA in environmental studies and english literature then a bunch of courses in microbiology and chemistry to apply to my MASc. It would be nearly impossible to pass a qualifying exam to become an engineer with my background.

Please let me know if you think of any career paths that I might find a bit more engaging with: more apparent impacts of my work, more working as a team, more mentorship, etc.",Capybaracakybara,1,1.0,1,1721242392,2024-07-17 18:53:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e5q4ou/finding_research_unfulfilling_and_too_insular_and/,7,2024
1e5pxv9,What is the best way to explain this termination?,"I have been at my first job for 2.5 years. I work from home full-time as a software engineer at a large tech company in the United States. My salary is \~$110,000/year before variable bonuses, so I am therefore an exempt employee. I work from home and the hours are 8AM-5PM.

About 6 months into my first job, the company started to implement a 24-hour pager schedule where each team member is assigned to be on the pager for one week at time (yes, this includes overnight hours). This pager can go off at any time and you have 10 minutes to acknowledge and respond. If you do not respond, it will continue to escalate upwards in the management tree. The expectation after being paged is to log on to your work computer and perform a 5-10 minute investigation as to whether this was a false alarm or requires escalation (mostly going through logs or restarting something). Once your investigation closes, you can are done until the next page comes in (if a page ever comes in). The pager rotates among people on my team, so each person gets the pager once every 6 weeks.

The company provides $200 for the week that the employee is on the 24-hour pager as compensation. You are still expected to report to work at 8AM for regular work and meetings.

I felt it was not fair that the company only paid $200 for this while depriving me of sleep and time out of office for an entire week at a time. Let's say that I put in a 12-hour work day for five days of the week, feeling that it is reasonable to work 60 hours (8AM-8PM) from Mon-Fri. For 7 days in the week on the pager, that would be 108 hours on the pager outside of normal working hours (168 hours in a week -  60 hours working) and at $200 for that, that equates to $\~1.85/hour for that week.

As a result of this pager, I decided to seek out a second job working from home overnight because it did not seem fair to be paid $200 for being expected to go without sleep. I was terminated from the second job because I could not stay up for so many consecutive hours at time.

Previously, I asked on this subreddit a few months about if this pager situation is legal to place on employees. Ultimately, I was told that **as long as you are an exempt employee, it is legal for your employer to assign any hours of time for you to work; only non-exempt employees are legally required to be paid for on-call or standby work by the FLSA.**

I read up more about this situation, and the main debate seems to lie [here](https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/whd/flsa/hoursworked/screenER77.asp). If you are ""waiting to be engaged,"" that is not considered to be on duty and is not compensated for (e.g. a nurse who might be called in for hospital duty). If you are ""engaged to wait,"" then you are entitled to compensation. Hopefully, my description of the pager situation can be understood to be ""engaged to wait"" and not ""waiting to be engaged"". However, I still understand that this only applies to non-exempt employees.

Overall, I truthfully like my job and my manager. My manager does everything possible to alleviate the burden of these types of situations. The pager overall does not go off constantly or to an unreasonable extent. However, it does go off for me at awful times. It went off once when I was driving on the weekend and I almost crashed trying to acknowledge it. Most of the time when I am on the pager, it just so happens to go off between the hours of 1AM-4AM overnight.

However, the company can terminate you for not responding to pages as expected (which I learned from being terminated from my second job).

I'm looking for another first job now because I'm not happy anymore and I'm done with the pager situation. So, I want to know what is the best way to explain being terminated from the second job (if there is one)? I know the answer to this question is probably ""*Sorry, you were terminated from the second job solely based on your poor performance at the second job. The first job is irrelevant. Sucks for you, but tough.*"" I'm more so asking if this would be understood as a situational/circumstantial termination. My argument is that whether something extreme like this is *legal* is one argument. Whether it is *fair and realistic* is another argument. Putting pay and compensation aside, it does not seem *fair or realistic* to expect someone to be awake for 24 hours for 7 consecutive days at a time. I understand that the company is not going to pay me $50/hour to sit waiting for a page to come in, but even paying the overnight hours at minimum wage would be more justifiable.",anonymous2454,1,0.6000000238418579,8,1721241923,2024-07-17 18:45:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e5pxv9/what_is_the_best_way_to_explain_this_termination/,7,2024

1e5o4i4,"Have I failed or succeeded or neither, career wise? Should I do something about or not?","
I started with my current employer as a first level manager - it was an uplevel for me since I had not been a manager before.

However, within 2 years my performance feedback from upper management made it clear that I was not doing well as a manager. There were a lot of expectations from our group and I could not meet them. A year later I was “demoted” back to being an individual contributor. At that point, logically I should have left. But….

I was feeling burnt out and decided to givre up trying to play the career progression game. I decided to just stay put and do my 9-5 and wait to get laid off as I thought would happen imminently.

That was 10 years ago. There were 5 rounds of layoffs. They never laid me off. However they never promoted me either and I am still working in the same company for 14 years now, still as an individual contributor, though I have laterally switched roles a couple of times.

My salary has gone up 3% or so every year and is now about 55% higher than my starting salary 14 years ago. They don’t give me any stock, just a salary and some bonus.

My net worth from home equity appreciation and contributing to 401k and such, has gone up from $300k 14 years ago to $4.5M today. That’s a 15x increase in net worth while salary and position/title in company have stagnated.

So, what do y’all think? Have I failed or succeeded or neither? Should I look now belatedly for a new job or keep riding till that layoff comes eventually 2,5 or 10 years from now (the severance package will be better with each passing year of added tenure)?",Ok_Art_2874,1,1.0,3,1721237540,2024-07-17 17:32:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e5o4i4/have_i_failed_or_succeeded_or_neither_career_wise/,7,2024
1e5nj8g,Resign or ask for compensation and role change?,"I apologize for this long post. 

I will be very transparent with everything so that you could give me proper advice. 

I have been with the team for 6 years working directly with the operations managers while my current supervisor was just hired last 2023 and the rest of my teammates, which are all from another site in PH. I am the last one standing from our site.

My position/title is QA in BPO. 3 months ago, I was chosen by operations managers, not my direct managers, and asked me to do Compliance that are used to be done by multiple AVPs, which are being presented to clients directly. I am doing this task alone with the guidance of my former supervisor, now my assistant operations manager in US. I have been asked to also do ad hoc tasks as well that are requested by the Operation managers. I also assist my team and operations from time to time. I do that exclusively for almost 3 months with no salary increase. 

Now, I recently asked my immediate superior, in PH, if it is possible that they can revisit my compensation and possible role change due to the weight of my tasks that I have been doing for the last 3 months. I have stated all my contributions and the impact of my role in the overall performance of the whole team, but he Declined to raise it due to my poor performance in first quarter(low audit count), not with my current tasks. I tried to fight for it, but he assumes that I will be declined if he will raise it directly to our department manager. He offered me recommendation to apply to AVP again, but I said that I will think about it and did not give a positive thoughts to him about it because I was previously offered to join AVP positions(Training and Supervisor) thrice since 3rd quarter of 2023, but never progressed due it was not communicated to the hiring team properly that they already hired people even before I even get interviewed. Another reason was probably because we are in different sites and the communication and coordination was lacking. 

Now, I plan on just resigning. But at the same time, I plan and want to ask the assistant operations manager, to see if he can revisit my request. What are your thoughts about me asking the assistant operations manager about it? Am I bypassing my direct supervisor, who declined my request and my direct manager, who is not aware of my request? I am not comfortable and confident telling my current department manager about my request, but in case they ask me to speak to him, I definitely can. I am more confident speaking to my former supervisor about my request because he is one of the final decisions in regards to financial matters. I actually can informally tell about it, but I am having second thoughts because of my immediate superior and manager.

I am really torn if I will just resign since I have started applying to different companies or try to still attempt to request for an increase or role change. I really do not want to resign because my current position is WFH, chill for most time. It is only stressful when presenting to the clients directly and there are a lot of requests coming from the management, which is manageable if I will get paid fairly. 

Here are the things I am also considering with the decision that I will make in the next few days or weeks. 
1. I do not like my current team right now because I feel excluded. Never felt included. So in a way, this is a chance of escape. 
2. But, I also do not want to go back to zero and apply to another company again. 
3. Another thing I consider is that the amount that they will offer me might not be enough to keep me in the company, which I have been for 10 years. 
4. And my current status, WFH vs hybrid set up on most of the offers from different companies.
And others I mentioned above. 

Please help me. Your thoughts will be considered because I am really confused. Thanks you in advance.

Hey all! I turned 30 this year. So yay, I made it! One problem: I still don’t know what the fuck I’m doing! (X-posted with r/careerguidance to widen the net) 

To lay the ground: I am autistic. This is important. I have a BA in liberal studies, focusing on social sciences, and a minor in law and justice. I’ve always had aspirations for a higher degree, and for a long time, I wanted to go to law school to work in health law (https://www.apu.apus.edu/area-of-study/security-and-global-studies/resources/what-is-health-law/) on behalf of patients.

I spent many months studying for the LSAT and preparing for applications. I even got a job as a legal assistant. However, I suffered a major flare of autistic burnout, forcing me to drop to part time. I also started getting bullied on the job by my coworker, and then the whole office got laid off. (Not even joking) The whole experience made me question whether I was even capable of practicing law, and sent me into a major depression spiral, one I’m still in. Now I work at a café, and I’m stuck not knowing what to do. 

Part of my problem is that I want to do a lot of things. I’m an artist, and thought about going into graphic design, because I’m very good at visual problem solving, I think I’d enjoy it, and I’d be able to work from home. Eventually I’d want to get an MA in illustration and (eventually!) do design work for orgs with missions I support. But I’ve heard rumblings that graphic design is a dying field, and NOT one to get into rn. I also don’t know if it would nurture my deep passion for social justice and helping others. 

I worked in customer service for a health insurance company while I was going through school, and not only did I enjoy it, I actually developed quite the interest in healthcare and healthcare policy, which is what inspired me to look into health law in the first place. I left the job to try other things, and sort of kick myself for leaving to this day, because it really was a great gig. They’re not hiring atm, but I also don’t want to be in customer service for the rest of my life. I’ve thought about going back for an MPH and seeing what I can do with it, idfk.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I feel so aimless and lost. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what career would be good for me, who needs a lot of accommodations in order to thrive, and who has a lot of interests. What I do know is that I’m ready to move on, and whatever education path I pick, I want it to be the right thing. I would love some advice or suggestions for careers to look into. Thank you all so much.

","To give you a background, in my college, we have a compulsory term where you need to get an internship.

About the project, I have asked some seniors about it, they say it's a waste of time nothing being taught that consists of actual value.

1e5lif1,Advice on starting a new intimidating job? ,"Hi everyone, 

I am a 27 year old with a Masters in Liberal Arts with two years of program/project management experience in the field of Higher Education. I am on the cusp of making a career change and entering a high profile non-profit organization (waiting on an official offer but everything has been going very smooth). The salary is going to be double what I am making at my university job and it’s going to be dealing with program creation and project management for executives of the organization. 

Currently I am dealing with a little bit of imposter syndrome and am excited but also anxious about this job. I’m worried about getting into a situation where I am over my head. I meet or exceed all of the qualifications of the job and the hiring manager is very enthusiastic of my experience after talking with me and looking at my resume, so I know that it may be silly to feel nervous, but I think the high salary and the prospect of dealing with executives is kind of making me nervous. Excited but nervous. 

Can anyone give some advice on best practices when entering a new career field and maybe handling imposter syndrome?

1e5lehn,B2C home improvement vs pharmaceutical sales? Advice welcomed,"I've been selling door to door solar for 2+ years now. That was a commission only job, you eat what you kill. I'm getting out of the door to door space, and have started working with a patio enclosure company that provides leads that I have to just close. I've just finished an interview with a pharmaceutical sales company and I believe it went well. Should have the offer by the end of the week. The Pharma job offers basically the same benefits along with a company car. The base for that job gets maxed out at around $60k/yr.

I feel that if I take that pharma job I feel as if I'm leaving money on the table because I'd have a ceiling on the money I'm able to make. The main thing that's attractive to the pharma job is that I'd have a floor on the pay and know exactly how much I'd make. I have experience in commission only sales, so I'm familiar with eating what you kill.

Anyone been in either of these spaces or made these kinds of transitions that can offer any advice?

I did designs, designed a portfolio to find a full time job. Didn't succeed due to large number of competition and language barrier (german). I am trying to learn the language. I can speak a little but not fluently. So I tried to find a job in IT which required coding. I cleared my interview and got the job but could not perform well. So after few months lost it.

1e5isru,University course choice,So I finished my A levels early June and still haven’t been able to make a choice in what I want to do next. Originally was going to do an apprenticeship at JCB but was rejected due to lack of spaces which I am thankful for as I felt I was pushed into it when I was not interested in it at all. Lately been thinking of joining the police as it’s something I had an interest with around the time of picking my GCSE’s. However I keep being told by family and friends that a physiotherapy job would suit me as I’ve always had an interest in all sports and should have the required A level results for the course. I do have an interest in this as well but fear that it is not how it’s been described to me and I could be bored of it and potentially be stuck in a job I dislike forever. On the other hand hearing the conditions and low pay that the police get in the uk (i know it increases after being in it for a while but is very low at the start for what u have to do) is an extra hurdle. I’m just stuck in a dilemma as I don’t want to waste my time or money by choosing the wrong one. By not joining the police I fear I may feel I’ve opted out of being able to help people but wonder if it’s really worth it for the wage and work load as I still want to support my family where I can for what they have done for me. Any advice at all is appreciated as this is my last option for advice really as I’ve asked family and friends which has gave me mixed responses. Got little to no advice from my head of sixth form as she has always disliked me for some reason so she only told me to do what I want while staying late after lessons with other people to help with their choices. Will likely have to start next September which I have planned for by getting a part time job locally to save some money.

An employer who was looking to train me and help me grow in my field messaged me about transferring to her location. We spoke for a bit, she asked me questions and got to this one question that I was expecting to be asked. 

“Are there any issues at your current store that would help for me to know? What’s the reason for your transfer?” 

I thought I was so smart for coming up with this answer: “Thank you for understanding. I’d love to be transparent about that. The primary reason for my transfer is related to challenges with manager communication and scheduling at my current store. There have been instances of confusion and lack of scheduling, which have impacted my ability to perform consistently. I want to emphasize that this decision is not reflective of my dedication or performance as a pharmacy technician. I've always been committed to [Company Name] and look forward to bringing my skills and experience to this location. “

I guess it just came off as me bad mouthing my current location because she hasn’t responded since 8:22pm last night. I’ve been treated unfairly at this location, my current boss has left me without a job for 2 weeks because of something called constructive dismissal. I’ve had to apply for unemployment.

1e5e6g2,What should I do as a high school student?,"Hi, 


I’m a rising junior who plans on taking a pre med route in college and later on attend medical school. I’m wondering what I should do in these next two years to raise my chances of getting into medical school(seeking any kind of advice). I want to start off my saying that I’m pretty much unprepared. It was only this summer when I decided to pursue a career in the medical field. Previously, I had decided I would go into college as a computer engineering major(clearly not the smartest person💀) and so for the first two years of high school, I was focused on engineering and cs. I took a comp sci class freshmen year, joined an engineering club, signed up to take both geo and alg2 sophmore year (since I thought math was important for these fields), signed up for a coding club sophomore year, took a engineering class sophomore year, took a pre calc class this summer(so I could take AP calc junior year), signed up to take AP comp sci principles junior year and also another engineering class since you can get awards for completing all the engineering or/and comp sci classes my school offers(and passing with I believe a B or higher). 

I plan on applying to a 13 month volunteer program at hospital this coming year which would give me about 104 community hours, volunteering at animal shelters every weekend(only starting this year since I would finally be at an age where I wouldn’t need an adult with me), and I’m also considering applying to another program at a different hospital that would give 100 hours in community service(really want to attend due the fact it’s well known for its orthopedic program but most likely competitive as it’s ranked #1 hospital in my state) I also want to talk to my counselor about switching one of my classes for AP bio instead. I’m also worried over the fact I have not taken any AP classes prior to this coming year as freshman year, you simply can’t at my school and last year, I forgot to sign a paper agreeing to take AP classes. This year I signed up for APUSH, AP Lang, AP Comp Sci, AP Calc AB, and AP physics 1(might cry a lot this year). So far, I’ve also only taken taken about 4 honors classes which consists of honors Eng 9/10, honors chem and honors intro to engineering. 

Lastly, I would like to mention my dream of becoming an orthopedic surgeon(crazy, right?😭). This field is severely male dominated and as a women, I’m determined to break these barriers and prove gender should not limit you in pursuing what you want to do. I love a good challenge and being able to help people while doing so is a huge plus! Anyways, thank you for reading and I’m really sorry if I sounded stupid at any point.

1e5e0qw,what advice can you give as someone na di sure anong program ang kukunin sa college??? I badly need help,"so I'm an incoming 1st year college student next month, I chose psychology as my undergraduate but hindi ko alam if gusto ko siya kase parang mas gusto ko kunin ang bsba fm or com sci

idk what to do talaga, I have never been interested sa psychology kase ayoko nga mostly ng parang may social work (correct me if wrong pls) medyo nagustuhan ko lang siya nung nagki-kwento yung teacher ko sa shs kase psych graduate siya so I chose it as my undergraduate 

for the last few months I told myself na siguro ok lang to as a degree, since for me I really want to help a lot of people but I never thought na in mental health field, like tulong lang talaga to make their lives easier

but now pinagiisipan ko na if gusto ko ba talaga siya, I researched and have plans naman for my future kung mag psychology man ako pero iniisip ko rin kase yung magiging financial status ko in the future if ituloy ko man kase it's really hard to earn with this field as far as I know

If mag psychology man ako siguro itutuloy ko siya sa pag nu- neuropsychology kase that interests me but until now hindi ko talaga alam anong pipiliin ko

But tbh, last month I cried so much in my room saying to myself na ""ayoko ng psychology"" I've never had huge interest don

I just cried saying those and I thought of what will happen to me if ituloy ko, I realized na what if pinipilit ko lang yung sarili ko don and now that I cried it out parang naging honest ako sa sarili ko

idk how to change my program kase sa stateu ako papasok, iniisip ko na mag bsba fm kase gusto ko nga siya but hindi ako abm graduate kase nag HUMSS ako and need daw na aligned ang program sa strand pag stateu 

It's not like I regret na mag HUMSS pero sana nag stem/abm ako or gas 

For now I'm thinking na bigyan siguro muna ng chance ang psychology, try ko lang kase who knows what will if I take it as a chance since psychology is aligned with my skills din 
tas if ever hindi ko talaga want I'll shift


But your opinion will really matter to help me,
so what do you think should I do? your advice will really be helpful to me po  (⁠｡⁠•́⁠︿⁠•̀⁠｡⁠)

1e5dkyz,"what to do next , confused....","hii, so im currently pursuing bsc data science(just started my 2nd year) ,while the course is on the rise , my college is very very mediacore and since before my undergrad i wanted to pursue an mba so my plan has always been  an mba thats why i thought that taking a mediacore in my undergrad might prolly not affect me that much but now i realise how internship ,our past academic score and work ex ,matters for admissions and for job which im not gonna get in my current college forget placement im not getting internship from from y college im not learning any skills from here unless i do other skill courses, so now i have three options.... 

1) change my course entirely and start again from 1st year and pursue something in business and enterprenueship a working degree where ill get many internship activities after which i can try for cat and even if it does not go well i can work for a year or so and again try by this time ill atleast have skills .. its disadvantage is that ill have to start again from first year and its fees will be compartively very high ranging from 8 - 9 lakhs for total course (3 years) , ill also have to change cities as there no such colleges here so will have to bear living cost such as hostel and food approx 1.5 lakhs every year which confuses me as i am going to spend a good amount for my mba no matter what college mba fees are high ...

2) continue with current degree which is till 2026 and start preparing for cat 25 and 26 with coaching ,and do some side skills hybrid/online courses to get better .. as  ill not be getting  get any placement from college so ill have to go as a fresher into mba in whatever college i get so ill have to give my best to get good percentile .. its disadvantages are (no placements, my ug degree is not worth it unless i have good skills  , my only chance for mba as id have prepared for two years or so and i dont think ill have it in me to drop again for another year so will have to go where i get , lastly missing out on college life (as people here are kinda boring ) )



 3) continue with this degree and do side degree online such as iim banglore new bba(digital biz and entrepreneurship) course and also an iim banglore alumni status and few hybrid short course to develop skills as if i dont crack  cat i will get to do something for year work or something . but here i dont know how ill prepare for mba if ill do two degree ill prolly have to work an then prepare for 3rd option .. its disadvantage is studying for two degrees at once ,iim banglore course is costly approx 1.5 lakhs per annum , i dont know how ill prepare for cat along with this (any suggestions do give ) the online course is new and i dont know if its worth the money ....



 which option do you think is the best should i start prepping for cat now itself and do small courses side by side or do another side online degree as mentioned above or 1st option .

I did undergrad at a place where design was taught in a very multidisciplinary way- so I have done a little of every possible type of design, and have found UX design interesting.

1e590ri,"It's my dream to immigrate out of the USA, but I seriously doubt my current career will permit this. What should I do? Is it time for a career change?","I am at my wit's end with my job. I feel like I'm holding myself back from making a move to Norway sometime in the near or distant future by staying in it, but I've worked so hard to get where I am right now and I'm hesitant to give it up.

I work in management for Hobby Lobby here in Kentucky, and I have a bachelor's degree in History that I have never used after graduation. I've put in six years with the company and the benefits are decent, and the vacation time off and PTO are good enough to where I can facilitate a trip to Norway to visit my friends once a year or every other year, and them coming here.

But it's not enough, it feels like. It's absolutely crushing my spirit and happiness. I miss my friends on a daily basis, and I miss the country of Norway immensely; I fell in love with everybody there and the culture and lifestyle, of which I am growing so weary of Kentucky's after being here for twenty-one years.

I keep telling myself that I should be content with my job despite it's hardships and that I should be happy that I can afford and have the time to be with my friends as often as I've mentioned. But retail management (to my knowledge, correct me if I'm wrong) is not a ""skilled trade"" per UDI and it won't ever get me to Norway.

The job does not make me happy; I cannot stand the constant meddling of corporate level bosses thinking that they know how to run a store better than we do when all they do is sit in a cushy office all day long and give us arbitrary, unrealistic goals and instructions when they make the occasional trip to our store on the company jet. I cannot stand the crushing amount of freight that is constantly coming in and the plans of dealing with it never being set in stone. It's a constantly changing game. I get that this is retail, but it wouldn't be so bad if I was not made to do more with less people.

The past few days I have been on the cusp of just breaking down crying in the parking on breaks, lunches, and clocking out for the day, because the stress and immensity of my dilemma is weighing so heavily on me. I don't want to do this for a career but sometimes it feels like it's all I have, and I feel trapped doing it, and that I'll never actually be able to achieve the dream of immigration.

I know the above text isn't super pertinent to Norway but at the same time I feel it is, to a degree. My long goal is to move there and be among my friends who have accepted me and loved me more than anybody here in the USA/Kentucky has ever done. It is among them that I truly feel at home, respected, and loved. And while I do get some capability to be with them in my current capacity, I don't think (again, correct me if I'm mistaken; maybe retail is a valid career in Norway for an American if they married and moved there?) it's going to get me there.

I'm turning thirty in September and I'm not getting any younger. I feel like if I'm going to make a move, the time needs to be now!

One of the friends in my group is a crane operator in Oslo and absolutely loves her job, and has recommended that I pursue it as a means to immigrate. This would entail getting certified and working in that field for a few years here, I would assume, and then finding work there once I have the experience under my belt.

They also told me with my bachelor's degree that I could pursue teaching English as a second language. This is another option I would heavily consider. If it is valid, what steps would I take to pursue that? 

In addition I'm open to other fields of work that would facilitate a means to immigrate, as I know UDI mandates that a job be on the table for you here in order to even begin the application process (at least, that's what I understood). If people commenting could offer advice as to what trades or careers would be suitable for me based on the above information that I've provided (or just in general), it would be most appreciated.

Then again, if I stayed in this retail management pathway and ended up marrying into Norwegian society (which may be in the cards in the future), is this a skillset I could take with me to acquire a job, or not?

Or is this all just silly talk, and should I suck it up and be content with what I've made for myself in the USA?

I am 24m and currently a student at ASU, I will be graduating with my BS in Information Technology in a bit less than 2 years. I am not restricted geographically and I want to continue my education as I have enough GI bill to fully cover a masters degree. I have an interest in technology and finance as potential career paths.

After some research it seems getting an MBA from as top 15 school is the best thing someone can do in grad school to advance their career. I’m looking for any differing opinions or potential career paths one can achieve with an IT BS and a variable/mba masters degree. I’ve heard people talk about roles such as IT management, wealth management, and consulting as lucrative positions, which interest me. 

While this may sound shallow I guess my ultimate goal is maintaining a reasonable work life balance and maximizing my income, if not immediately then in the long term. 

Questions: What graduate degree should I get? Do I have it right with an MBA? Would it be a terrible idea to go straight from undergrad into a masters program? Should I continue gaining work experience first? Can I even get into a top school? Any opinions or thoughts greatly appreciated.


Background: I have 4 years experience from the AF, 2 overseas, worked in IT as a helpdesk/system admin. Sec +, TS/SCI Clearance. I currently work part time in 2 roles as an event coordinator for a school organization and IT helpdesk for my college. This summer I am interning as an IT finance intern for a F500. 3.93 GPA, Hispanic, first gen grad. Working on GRE.

1e576mo,"Where is the line between ""wanting feedback to improve"" and ""being anxious""?","My manager leads myself and one other person as engineers at a startup. The other engineer and I work on separate but related projects. 

I keep noticing that the manager works way more closely with the other engineer. They do tasks together, attend meetings together for things related to that project, and seem very friendly with each other. In those project-related meetings, he regularly chimes in and voices his opinion.

Although my manager is friendly with me, we do not do tasks together and he rarely attends project-related meetings with me. When he attends, he sits there totally silently. 

I asked him once about this to make sure that I wasn't unpleasant to work with, and he said he feels more closely tied to that project because he took it over for 2 weeks (5 months ago) while the other engineer was out of town. 

I just have this deep-seated fear that, for some reason, I am difficult to work with. I view myself this way as I can be kind of overprotective of my projects. I want to learn to do better but I'm concerned that my manager has just found it easier to be completely hands-off as opposed to dealing with my shortcomings. But at the same time, I don't know if this is all anxiety and I don't know how to find out. My manager rarely gives constructive criticism, so it is difficult to improve in this area.

1e56pdg,Need advice on accepting a new job offer…,"Hi all. I (28F) wanted to come on here to see if I can get some outside perspective on my situation with work.

So I’ve been working at my current company for almost 4 years now. I have a pretty great position as a supervisor, I learned a lot in my role and this field, and eventually learned the ins and outs of our processes and procedures. And I am currently one of the longer standing supervisors across all of our locations. Eventually, I became one of the top performing supervisors, and the one most trusted by our Head Office.

About a year and a half into my position, because of this trust that our Head Office had in me, I was of course assigned with additional tasks that I thought would have been a one-time thing only. It eventually became constant and these additional tasks, I’ve been doing up until now. If I compare the amount of work that I have with the other supervisors across our company, they don’t have the same workload that I do. I was eventually getting a lot of recognition for my work and the contributions that I put out for a company. There came three occasions throughout the years where I applied for a higher position and unfortunately did not get those positions. Which was, to me, just really disappointing considering my performance.

Fast forward to recently, in May, if there was no more opportunity for me to move up, I just requested for an adjustment in my compensation. It is now July, and I still have not received an update or an answer from my HR manager. Today, I just received an offer from another company that is offering a significantly better pay, but in a completely different field. Which to me, the opportunity still excites me because I love to learn new things, and I adapt really well to new environments and challenges.

My issue is, a big part of me feels this sort of guilt about leaving my currently company. I grew to love it, I really thought I would see myself here long-term. But because over the last few years I’ve just started to feel like I was being taken advantage of and not really acknowledged in a way that I deserve for my performance and contributions. So now, my views have really changed.

I have a meeting with my HR manager tomorrow about all of this. Which at the moment she already knows I’ve received an offer somewhere. My worry right now is that what if they match the offer that I got, but where I am mentally is, would this truly make me happy? My whole mindset on it is, did it really take me leaving for them to finally do something and offer me something better? Especially after waiting almost over 2 months with constant follow-ups on a resolution to my compensation adjustment request and still no answer. It would seem like a bit of a slap in the face in my opinion. 

I can’t even say for sure if they will match the offer I got, or offer better. I won’t find out until tomorrow. But I am leaning more towards accepting this new offer. How do I get rid of this guilt feeling I have about leaving?",BurntMarshmall0w,1,1.0,0,1721182438,2024-07-17 02:13:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e56pdg/need_advice_on_accepting_a_new_job_offer/,7,2024

I had a great first week during the fourth of July but I have had a massive drop-off in the week after. I think the more seasoned sales people are taking sales from me and the other new hire just based on the number of tickets they are getting. 

Some other red flags:
1. The other sales people are constantly smoking weed or vaping and just talk nonsense all day. 
2. The turnover on new sales people seems pretty high
3. The AC has been out since I started and it seems like it has been out long before that. There is also a raccoon in the ceiling that nobody seems to really care about.

1e52i6y,"Hot job offer, but, they don't want to negotiate - what can I do to move them?","Hello Redditors,

I just received a job offer from an amazing company. Short version: I work as a senior project manager in a technical field and can PM, design and implement fairly complex systems. The new Org wants both myself and a colleague to join their Org and start a division dedicated to what we do.

Long version:

I was approached by an organization that has a complimentary service business line that’s less technical, and, thanks to technology, their market share will eventually shrink significantly. They see my business as a critical path for the next 100 years. This is a large organization with a long history in their field. They view acquiring people (myself and a colleague) as the best way to take advantage of and grow into our segment. They have an impressive client list who are very loyal and can all use this type of service. These technology services are offered by a small handful of organizations (40-50 across the country), however, only a few have the core service business **and** are able to do what we do, combined with their current business. I can't give to much away because there's literally 3 companies that provide both the service component and my vertical.

I have worked with several of their team members on crossing projects over the last couple of years so there's a familiarity and comfort between their team and myself. I’ve met with the Pres and team of Directors multiple times during this year and have been presented with an offer:

Salary: $120k + COLA annually  
Vehicle: $9k/yr  
RRSP Match: 2%  
Vaca: 4 wks (+1wk at 5YRS)  
Bonus: $10k+/yr based on rev targets  
Profit Sharing: 7% (approx $21k+/yr)

My counter offer was closer to what I am seeing as the industry standard but there was significant push back due to this being an untested (for them) startup. I would be part of a team of three, we have a solid plan with aggressive growth and achievable targets but, we just can’t seem to quite convince the management team to jump in with the higher fixed costs. They’ve stated constantly that they want us and believe we’re going to do something amazing for their company, but, on our counter, they didn’t budge on a single point.

Am I off base with my new counter?

Salary: $130k + COLA (originally aiming for $150k)  
Vehicle: $9k/yr  
RRSP Match: 5%  
Vaca: 4 wks + either 1 week flex (originally aiming for 6 wks) or 1 day added per year  
Bonus: $10k/yr based on rev targets (hold for 1st year, re-evaluate based on yr1 performance), build in $10k salary increases based on performance goals up to base of $150k as rev increases and hits specific targets.  
Profit Sharing: 7% (approx $21k+/yr)

Some of my concerns are:

1. should I get a company vehicle in the future, there goes the allowance.
2. doesn’t 2% RRSP matching seem a little low for a senior manager.
3. finally, vacation, for senior management to start at 4wks isn’t bad for sure, but, any reason why 5 seems like too much of a stretch?

I am aware of the value of my role, my asks are pretty in line with industry standards. To me, the above three points seem like easy negotiables, the low hanging fruit where concessions should be made to improve the work life balance.

I am very motivated and really want to work with this team, we are VERY aligned in terms of vision, goals and the drive from every member (on my team and their leadership) is incredible.

Any suggestions on how to phrase or approach the management team so we can be more aligned would be appreciated.

As the fiscal year is coming to an end, I have to complete a performance review.  I'm not sure if I'll have another opportunity to negotiate after my one-year mark in November. So I will discuss the salary with my PM during this performance review.  I've received positive feedback from colleagues with a few nitpicks.   
  
When I started, my manager advised me to focus on learning rather than setting specific goals. So I don't really have goals set to say ""I did this or that.""  Now I need to document everything I've accomplished so far and hope he'll be impressed, because I don't know what his expectations are.

I feel apprehensive about asking for a raise before completing a full year, and I worry about seeming undeserving. But I'm challenging myself to initiate difficult conversations and advocate for my worth, especially after getting screwed over in my previous job. The company initially offered me $10,000 above my requested salary.   
  
What percentage raise would be reasonable to request after being here for 8 months at a big 4 company in an entry level role ?

Thanks!",Sherlockerer,1,0.6700000166893005,10,1721168335,2024-07-16 22:18:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e51mfo/seeking_advice_on_salary_negotiation_after_8/,7,2024

1e505lc,Need help choosing a target salary range. Mechanical Engineer - Engineering/Production Manager [9 YoE],"I am in an interesting situation. I had planned to take over the family manufacturing business, but finally accepted that I was never going to get my family to make critical changes and gave up on that dream.

We are selling the family manufacturing company to a larger company in the industry. The new owners will be staying with their existing out of state facility and managing us from afar.

I have made it clear that I am interested in a plant manager position. The new owners want to put me in that role after mentoring me for 1-2 years. In the meantime, they want to change my title to ""Engineering Manager"". Currently I am ""Product Manager"" with 5 years experience, before that I was a Mechanical EIT doing HVAC design work for 4 years.

I would continue to manage our largest accounts, review incoming engineering specifications, coordinate production requirements with customers and the production staff, implement their MRP system, and assist an interim plant manager. Allegedly they want to take quoting and ISO 9001:2015 management off my plate, which is fine by me!

I am waiting to see a formal offer from the new ownership. I could really use some help pinning down a realistic salary for my role as Engineering Manager, and eventually as Plant Manager. Currently I am underpaid at $90k/year, I am thinking of $115k/year as an absolute minimum with a target of $125k/year. The target I would give them, if I have to, would be $135k.

For context this is in Dallas, TX which I assume is MCOL. They are used to paying HCOL salaries in CA.

I don't want to sell myself short. I also don't want to shoot too high and lose any respect that I have gained so far. Are these numbers realistic?

Any advice is greatly appreciated! I'm happy to share a redacted resume if that is helpful to see.",aggierogue3,1,1.0,0,1721164610,2024-07-16 21:16:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e505lc/need_help_choosing_a_target_salary_range/,7,2024
1e500ga,"Using this “personality resume”, what could be my ideal career?","I am a 21 year old Canadian woman and have been working in libraries for 4 years now. I have no college experience besides a few courses and a performance art diploma, but I am an intelligent person so going back to school is absolutely an option, though finances will be horrendously difficult to manage in that case. With every job I’ve had (different libraries + cashier) I’ve been able to enjoy it for maybe 6 months at the most, and then it becomes an absolute slog that makes me question if I even want to live. I’ve been in my current position for 2 years and it gets worse every day, so I’d like some advice on options based off of my experiences and personality. 

TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM. 

Here is what I’m good at/want in a job:

I am a very empathetic and supportive person most of the time, and people around me at work have said I “spark joy”. I love listening to the experiences of other people and want to find out more about them, almost in an interview style. I want to help people who need it, and I have no problem sacrificing parts of myself so others can be lifted up.

I am extremely interested in politics, linguistics, and history. Looking at the past and dissecting it, unraveling how it lead to the present is something I love to do even in my spare time. I spend hours daydreaming about political systems, what worked, what didn’t, and dwell on moral quandaries associated with said systems. The way languages are formed and the role they play in cultural development captivates me as well. I know English, German, and I am working on learning Chinese and brushing off my French.

Aside from this I am also an extremely creative person, I love making music, I play guitar and piano, and it’s always been a dream of mine to form a band. I have an associate’s degree in performance art and I have 8 years of stage acting experience and love it, though in recent times my library jobs have prevented me from joining a theatre troupe. Whatever career I choose to go into, I will need an outlet for my artistic side, whether as a hobby I can have sufficient time for or as an actual part of my career. 

It is also a goal of mine to travel the world, and visit every country I can to experience as many viewpoints, cultures, and histories as possible. Being stuck forever in a single place is not an option for me, so I’d want either good vacation time or travel as part of work.

I am also very good at fixing things and solving mysteries. Because I love learning about things and analysing situations, I’ve always had a knack for diagnosing car issues, computer issues, and solving escape rooms. Solving and fixing things brings me a kind of joy that I don’t normally get from other activities, and if this was part of my job it would make it soooo much better.

I’ll note that I also LOVE biology, especially botany and marine biology, as well as geology, but I gave up on this due to being very poor at math and chemistry. I still have a great love of nature though.

Now for the bad stuff that I’m terrible at or can’t handle in a job:

Even though I love helping people who need it, one of my biggest peeves that just infuriates me are patrons who want you to do EVERYTHING for them. All of you who work in customer service know the kind. The ones who come in asking to change their library password weekly because they forget and refuse to write it down, that sort of thing. I do know that this a component of most public facing jobs though so it’s not a dealbreaker, just want to avoid it if I can.

On a similar note, I can’t work with most children. I just don’t really know how to interact with them. There’s definitely kids I like, like the little girls who come in to the library wanting to tell me all about their favourite Narnia story arc, but as a whole I couldn’t work with children as a main component of my job, like a teacher or ECE.

As I mentioned earlier, I am terrible at anything to do with numbers, whether it be calculus or simple money exchange, to the point where I suspect I may have dyscalculia or a similar disability. Anything like accounting is completely off the table.

I like hiking and similar activities as long as I can take it slow, but physical labour isn’t something I enjoy doing, nor would I be good at since I’m very tiny.

I am a chronic procrastinator and typically won’t get something done until the day it’s due. I was that kid in school who strategically sat in the back corner so my homework would be collected last, as I finished it while the teacher was collecting. I definitely procrastinate less when I’m doing something I enjoy, but it’s still a huge lifelong problem. 

I have trouble listening to authority because when I perceive a better way to do things, I just do it. I frequently skip procedures I don’t think are necessary, even if my boss tells me it should be that way. I don’t care if my boss wants the book drop duct-taped shut over the holiday, it’s already locked and the patrons informed it’s closed. I’m not spending time taping it ffs.

The main reason I need to leave my job is the lack of fulfilment. My current position mainly exists to keep the library open during later hours. Besides helping people find books, access accounts, and creating displays for the library, I don’t do much else. If my job were to disappear, it wouldn’t matter one bit. I need a job where I’m useful, and contributing in meaningful ways, whether it’s innovation, art, discovery, or helping others.

I am also pretty terrible at poster-making and graphic design. I am super creative, but when it comes to execution in terms of friendly, informative posters, I suck at it. I need to supplement all my displays with unique book placement and added paper crafts, like roses or flag cut-outs. As far as organisation goes for me, it’s non-existent. I try to clean my desk once a week but it immediately fills with clutter. I am not able to be a “neat” person.

These are the main things! Sorry for the super long post and thanks to those who read it. So, what career should I go for?

TL;DR

-Very important I get to make a difference in the world and help people
-I love linguistics, history, politics, solving mysteries, and fixing things
-I like botany and geology but am wary about the mathematics that comes with it due to possible dyscalculia
-I have an associate’s degree in performance art and have nearly a decade of acting experience and love it
-Very important I get a creative outlet. I am a creative and frequently write/play music and dream of starting a band
-Very important my job allows travel or I get enough vacation to do so
-I love nature and it would be nice to experience it more

-I don’t want to deal with people who unnecessarily waste my time
-I can’t work with kids
-I procrastinate a ton
-I’m messy and can’t organise my desk ever
-I have trouble listening to authority when I find better ways to do things
-I’m really bad at graphic design
-Terrible with numbers

Everyone thought it, and everyone has these feelings sometimes. A manager saw it and reported me straight to the regional who fired me because I ""lowered the morale of the store as others saw the comment"".

1e4wwax,I got fired on my first day. ,"I got a part time (student) job at a small gift shop.  
Prior to me getting hired, some things really threw me off: the listing said nothing about the salary, nor the hours, only that it was minimum 3 days/week. 

After the interview, they said that they required the same working hours from part-timers as from full-time employees, which is… not part-time anymore, right? Just full-time with a lower salary. The shift were 12 hour long. 

I still said yes. One day before I was supposed to go to my trial shift, they told me that I have to go to another store to work instead (not listed in the ad), which was a good 5 miles longer of a distance away. 



On the first day, they were patient with me and had more people coming (it was the weekend). 

Last Monday, on my 2nd day, however, there were barely any customers. When there **were** any, they did everything in a flash (which didn't give me time to catch up). I still tried my best, but when I did, they interrupted and took over.

After the shift, the owner pulled me aside and told me that I am wasting company money, do nothing, that I am not confident enough, and that it is useless for me to be there. So I said my goodbyes and left. It didn’t really upset me. 

But I had some time to think and I feel very incompetent. Granted, I am not a very social person but I am capable of interacting with customers. I **did** interact with customers, sold items, and handled the register in my 'I-worked-here-for-one-day' way, when I could hunt down the customers first.

Also, my coworkers ""jokingly"" ridiculed me for not smoking, drinking excessively, or using drugs (including the owner) at 18.

1e4wv88,Feeling Very Uncertain How to Pursue Future Career ,"Feeling Very Uncertain How to Pursue Future Career

This will be a bit of a long post but I'll try and make it as short and concise as I can


So a bit of backstory, I'm 21M who was recently laid off from a construction apprenticeship. I worked there for 3 years and was only a year away from getting qualified. 


I started sending out other apprenticeship applications, contacting local companies and explaining my situation but have had absolutely zero luck with getting another apprenticeship.


After some deep thought and self-discussion I made the difficult decision to abandon my apprenticeship aspirations entirely. No local companies are looking for any apprentices, and also thinking from a company's perspective, why should they hire a 21 year old apprentice for £24k a year when they can hire a 17 year old apprentice for £13k a year?


I've been working a temporary job at a factory for the past month now and good lord to say my job is demoralising and awful would be an understatement, there is absolutely zero chance I will last here long term.


So with all of that being said I've found myself at a crossroads of sorts. Do I pursue another apprenticeship in a different sector, do I find an entry level job somewhere, build up skills and experience and make a long term career from it, or do I go to university perhaps?


I know I'm probably coming off as a pessimist when I say this, but I believe my thoughts are justified as to why I have problems with pursuing all 3 of those options:


Why should I work for absolutely rubbish pay for another 3/4 years in a different apprenticeship with no guarantee of a job post apprenticeship?


I can't exactly get a entry level job anywhere really because when you apply for those jobs you're competing with at least a fair few other applicants who possess relevant qualifications and some minor work experience in said sector, which will be a no brainer decision for the hiring company as to who to hire.


Similar to the apprenticeship route, why should I put myself through 3-6 years of education, go into a mountain of debt in order to try and get a job with loads of applicants and so few vacancies?


Sorry if I sound like a bit of a grumpy gremlin with this post, it's just that I'm honestly scared and stressed with how my future is going to play out 


And advice, wisdom and guidance will be massively appreciated

1e4wh8e,How do I get something I don't absolutely hate?,"My job history so far is just three cashier jobs, one device repair tech job, and one assembler job.



I left all my cashier jobs because the accommodations that they all gave me didn't help enough with my sensory problems, and even then I would've left anyway because I *freaking hate* trying to convince people to buy stuff they didn't ask me for - like company credit cards - and I refuse to do that. I *block* ads. I will not *become* the ads.



I was let go from the assembler job because the work was incredibly tedious, and my as-of-then completely uncontrolled ADHD made it impossible to do my job without getting sidetracked every ten seconds.



The device repair technician job was my favorite so far; I would have stayed indefinitely if not for one thing. I can't drive due to sensory processing issues, and the commute that I had to take public transit for was 2 hours one-way on a good day. I had to get up at 5 AM to barely clock in on time at 8, and needless to say this was unsustainable. If it was closer to me I would still work there.

My coworker (who is a senior manager, but not my direct manager) is someone I am supporting for 7 more months (that is how long I will be on this team until I join another team). 

The senior manager (they) keep giving me confusing directions, by telling me to make rough plans and then calling them too rough. They also interrupt me whenever I present anything to them. I know that everyone has different ways of working and managing, and I want to continue being on their good side as I am going to work with them directly for a while, and will be on their team. They will also be providing me with feedback that will impact the next team I will go on. 

How should I navigate this? At the moment I thank them for their feedback (which is usually not delivered in the nicest way possible, but that could just be my interpretation), and I let them interrupt me sometimes (I do talk slower to accomodate for language barriers but I don't think I take pauses that seem like I am done talking).

1e4teur,I offended my supervisor and feel like I’ll never have a good job again.,"First job, I was fresh out of school with no experience and fell into someone else’s trap, ending up resigning. When looking for my second job, I needed references, and my previous boss mentioned my bad history. Although I eventually declined the offer, I started to fear looking for jobs, feeling like I would never find a good one again.

My first job had a union, and I joined the healthcare system right after graduation. Without any experience, I was nice to that colleague. Suddenly, colleague A told me that colleague B always badmouthed me. I was very angry because I always treated them as friends (I later realized that colleagues shouldn’t be treated as friends, it was my lack of experience), so I went to colleague B and told her not to do that, otherwise, I would let everyone know what she did. Then colleague B went to the boss and the union. The union talked to me, saying that I threatened a colleague. The company gave me a warning, but I didn’t want to work there anymore, so I resigned.

Later, I realized my stupidity. It was a trap, and the colleague A was the real bad person, but I fell for it.

When I looked for my second job, after providing references, the HR suddenly asked me one day if I had any conflicts with colleagues before. I guessed that my previous boss told her about my bad history, so I told her everything honestly. Fortunately, they still gave me the offer, but later I didn’t take the job due to personal reasons.

Now, this incident has left a deep scar on me. I often think about it at night and regret it, and I worry that I will never find a good job again. Sometimes I even cannot see the future of my career.

1e4qk05,International tax consultant - what do I do now ? ,"International tax expert here - finding myself at a crossroad…HELP! 

Hello to All! 

I reached a point where I am not sure what to do with my career. Hence, I need some advice.

Here is my profile : 
- PROFILE: early 30’s, full Law School program completed (master 2, i.e. LLM, completed), EU citizen and currently living in the EU, 7-8 years of experience working as an international tax consultant (both big4 and MNE). 

- TEMPERAMENT: our juniors like to work with me (I ask them for feedback). I am laid back, respectful and mainly care about results. I also naturally take the lead in discussions but I always leave room for others’ ideas and opinions as i see work as collaboration and not as the juniors “working for me”. I manage a small team but I am not particularly fond of it either as it takes a lot of time (and patience too). 

ISSUE: I really love international tax and all issues surrounding it but I absolutely HATE the “corporate” and “consulting” environment associated to it. I am currently working in a famous MNE and it’s awful: The work is very interesting but the atmosphere is so heavy due to constant passive aggressive behaviors, disrespect and condescending comments! I started to talk back at them and the middle management is now making my life hell (how dare I not allow a person to scream and curse at me!?🙄) Just to give you an idea : 100% turnover within 3.5 years! 

I am thinking of exiting asap (I am on the verge of burnout) and, honestly, I am not afraid of taking any risks (move across the world etc). I also stress that in the long run I want to work in a subsaharan African country (but could also consider Morocco!). 

I am now thinking of the following options : 

- should I stay in this EU country and take the bar exam and just work in a law firm present in the African continent ?  Then when I move I would have to take another bar exam to obtain the equivalence ? 

- should I forget about getting the lawyer qualification and continue working as a consultant? If yes, should it be better to go to a big4 in the Middle East (Qatar or UAE) for few years to get fast track promotion and then secure a senior manager position in an African country after ? 

- should I get an LLM in tax arbitration and then get the bar exam in the UK that could allow me to work in many countries (including Middle East and CW countries like Kenya for example)? 

- should I just leave my field and work in the beauty industry already? I stress that it has always been the plan that I invest in a beauty salin as a “side hustle”.

1e4plh6,Was this a verbal warning? Next steps? ,"throwaway account

In a team call, my coworker was told by a VP level manager out of the blue to limit work on certain projects unless absolutely necessary because it might ""negatively affect their performance review."" Coworker received no other context or explanation, no follow up to my knowledge, and was the only one who received that type of comment so far on their team. These are projects that they were assigned to oversee and have not received any other type of work 

This comes in the context of a currently rocky work atmosphere - major changes to department staffing and general operations, where employees have frustratingly received very little guidance/heard only whispers and secondhand information about how the company is moving forward. 

The comment about performance review was documented in a follow up email, where coworker emailed VP level manager confirming that was something the manager told him.  What would you do next?

1e4p4kt,Job Offer - Accept or Hold Off? ,"Hi everyone,  I interviewed with a company and finished my final round yesterday, and it went well. Got an email from the recruiter today asking if I had time to hop on a call - I'm assuming it is to discuss a potential offer. What do I say in this call in terms of salary, questions I should ask, etc? 

Also, they mentioned at the beginning of the process that if extended an offer, I would only have 48 hours to accept it. My issue is that I am currently interviewing with other companies I may prefer to work with, but I'm also at the beginning of the process with them. I also really want to leave my current job, but not sure if I should hold out or accept the offer? If needed/if given an offer from one of my preferred companies, I don't mind burning the bridge with this company, but want input on what to do in this circumstance.

1e4lipc,Should I tough it out or cut my losses?,"Ive been working at a retail chain for about three months now, for close to $30AUD an hour. Everything was going well up till tonight. 

I got into work and my boss told me as soon as I clocked on that he needed to talk to me. Myself, being an anxious person, took a deep breath to steady myself - 'we need to have a quick chat' is never good. He then proceeded to snap at me for sighing and saying 'i don't appreciate the attitude'. He then went on to tell me I was snapping at someone else (I wasn't - I was responding in a neutral tone in response to them snapping at me). When I tried to explain my side of things, he said he was tired of my excuses - which are always only me explaining myself, but he always says they're excuses. 

After this, I was visibly upset and got snapped at to start working. My whole shift, I brianstormed my resignation letter, because I deserve better than to be treated like this. And then I started second guessing myself - jobs are hard to find, and the money is good, and I like my team for the most part. So I'm not sure if I should just suck it up and tough it out, or if I should just cut my losses now and wash my hands of this.

Friends here have told me to take a job teaching english until I can find something else, but I feel conflicted over this route. I don't mean any disrespect to those who teach english, but I came here to advance my career and I was working in a great position at a tech company, so it does not make sense to me to do something unrelated.

My career is so important to me and as much as I like it here and I do so much, part of me thinks time is not waiting around, so I should appreciate the experience I have had and head back to the states where there are more opportunities. Then another part of me thinks I have not had the full experience here and I will never get this experience again, so not to rush and stick it out for a few months and hope something good is on the other side.

When I applied for the job, the application required me to list my salary expectations (number only, not range). I put in a number that is technically more than I make now, but not as big of a jump in retrospect as I would like for a new job. Problem is, in this first round HR interview, I was asked ""you put X as your salary expectation, is this correct?"" and I stupidly said yes because the interview was going really well and I didn't want to blow it since I technically could just take this small increase and hope for a raise later. But the more i've thought about it the more I wish I hadn't lowballed myself a bit, especially since I'm taking a risk with switching to a new company and leaving the one where I'm absolutely needed and valuable.

  
Am I stuck with this salary since I did confirm it in the interview? If not, when is a good time to bring up a different number? I'd only really ask for $5k more at this point.

1e4fbmb,"My parents are deciding my future, and I'm not ready to decide it myself.","(TLDR: Overprivileged kid struggles because of cheat code to prestigious universities offered by privilege, upset because morally uneasy and uncertain of future (like most people), and is thinking about stopping parents' involvement to basically ensure the future they want since I don't know what I want yet.

I feel like a lot of people here know how invaluable college education is, so I'd like to hear you guys' perspectives.)

I am currently in high school and a pretty capable student considering that I have good extracurriculars and got 5s on the 6 APs (one self-studied) that I sat for in 9th grade.
During 9th grade, I explored my interests, but I'm still uncertain about what I want to do going forward. Before high school started, I delineated a broad outline for the years ahead, but I'm hesitant to commit to what I thought I planned.

Meanwhile, my parents have taken it upon themselves to plot out my future. They have engaged the services of a college counseling firm charging 90k, which probably rivals that of my future college tuition, and while they urge me to remain open-minded, I still feel uneasy at the waste of money and disheartened that they think I should require so much assistance.

My parents believe my older brother, who currently attends a T20 university, could've aimed higher. Their hope for me to attend a top 5 university feels like a result of needless concern, especially since I am still struggling with whether I actually want to, or even if I don't want to, should aspire to attend one. I understand this sounds incredibly privileged, that if I even exhi a likelihood of getting into one with its many opportunities and resources, I should, but it just feels wrong for some reason.

Also, from a logical standpoint, a less competitive undergraduate institution is more preferable seeing as there are more opportunities to distinguish myself, particularly in getting research positions. Moreover, the general consensus suggests that the prestige of one's undergraduate institution is of little consideration in the grand scheme of one's career, especially the case since I want to acquire a master's degree (probably following work experience between my undergraduate and graduate studies tho).

Am I being close-minded and naive? Are they misguided in their approach, or is this entire situation justified by the ends? I would really appreciate some advice or even straight-up criticism at this point.

1e4cpus, Where can I provide the most value? ,"Growing up in an Asian household I've always done the things I thought I **should** be doing.

Focusing on school. Check.  
Working out. Check.  
Eating healthy. Check.  
Becoming a Software Engineer. Check.

But I never followed or listened to my heart. I never gave energy or focus to the things I liked, or the things that came naturally to me.

Somehow, I was able to land an amazing engineering job out of college, but I know deep down I'm not cut out for it. I feel like I'm trying to fit puzzle pieces that were never meant to connect.

But now I want out. But the question is, what do I do next?

Funny enough, the things that I like or come naturally to me are kinda odd, so I don't really know where to start. I'm going to list some of these peculiar things and see if anyone can shed some light on future possibilities.

The main question I want to answer for myself is: ""Where can I provide the most value?"".

1. I can strangely predict movies and TV shows

If a character is going to die, I can usually figure it out. Amongst my friend group I've been known to call out scenes right before they happen. Zoom ins, foreshadowing, character screen time all give me clues as to what's going to happen.

2. I'm fairly good at reading people

I don't have a science behind this, but I can usually easily sniff out if someone is being fake or is toxic. There have been times where I've told my girlfriend to be careful around certain people only to have this confirmed months later.

Things just feel ""off"". And I just pay attention to that gut feeling for myself.

3. I have a dynamic mind

Ask me to juggle 10 small bit sized tasks? Easy peasy.  
But ask me to study for 5 hours for 1 exam? It's almost impossible to focus.

The latter has been improved because of my software engineering job since college.

The former is why I'm able to plan super cool surprise party for my friends when there are 20 things to juggle and figure out.

4. Psychology

As hinted at in number 2, I enjoy learning about aspects of behavioral psychology. I'm able to pick up social patterns and at times I like writing about the things I learned. Here are some examples:

How to stop overexplaining.  
How to never let anyone get to you.  
How to handle belittling.  
How to convince someone.

My profile has a bunch of these writings.

5. Coup

There is this card game called Coup that I'm super good at. I can explain strategies on the whim, and see patterns.

6. Online Business

I have this weird longing and pull to build something scalable. The idea really fascinates me. My family is in the retain business, but doing something online has always pulled me more.

I'm able to break down business models from online businesses pretty easily.

Ideally the goal would be to do some online business but I just don't know about what yet.

Well, being that it was 5 nights of 3 hour outages, I knew heads would roll, but I didn't know it would be mine for volunteering to try and help. I am formally being written up for the first time in my career and this comapny ever by a hostile new Director and this gives him the perfect vector to advance his plan to also try and oust me from my long-standing position in the company. Not a conspiracy, has been told to be in private by my Manager that he is looking for ways because no one else wants me to be let go but the Director wants budget for someone with a different Skillset.

  
Anyways, so he took out of context MS Teams screen caps of chats from the group chat, doesn't of course include direct chats to other technicians I was working with, nor the fact that it was All Hands on Deck on a Voice Call every night all week.

  
The best part is, he is Director of Software Engineering and doesn't know much about Software Engineering at all nor the technical aspects of what even transpired, nor what the effects of my triage had, or the other engineers. And our Manager of Software Development is a glorified Secretary. She was hired in with no experience in any of our code that we use in our product whatsoever and we were told she has the correct mindset for the job. Our old Managers knew how to get into the code with us and work out issues. Now we have none of that. Really demoralizing. 

  
Should I fire back at HR and not sign the Write-Up / Admit Fault? I didn't cause any problems. If anyone should be responsible for this failure of the systems it should be the Director and Manager, not the Senior Tech Support Analyzt they called 4 times and begged to Help on a Holiday because the 1 MySQL dev that also answered couldn't figure it out.",Langrisser_John,1,1.0,1,1721091957,2024-07-16 01:05:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e4bpzc/taking_the_fall_for_an_inexperienced_new_director/,7,2024

1e4aomo,Am I a risky hire from too many job hops?,"Small background. I'm a military veteran, have a Masters in CS. I have 10 years experience in a niche field in software engineering. I worked at my first company for 2 years, my second for 4 and now I'm on my 9th company that I start next week. This year I got laid off in February, i panicked and immediately took a contract gig that I quit after a month to take a full time role at a fairly large tech company for a pay cut from what I was making in February(still more than the contract gig).

Here's my predicament:

I accepted a full time staff level role for 15% higher base and 25% higher total comp than what I was making before I got laid off. I start on Monday and already gave my notice at my current company.

Today, a really big name tech company wants to fast track my interview process after my 3rd round for a senior principal role. The salary would be substantially more than my job that I start on Monday (almost triple). It's an absurd amount of money that I never considered to be possible.

If I get the job and accept, do I look awful to employers if I need a new job in the near future? Never know when layoffs will come.

1e4amzi,Advice on being the new guy and getting used to a new environment??,"Recently started a new job and being the new guy and getting used to a new environment well, sucks. 

Some background:
I was kinda late finishing up college. I was about 25 when I finished. But I’ve worked since I was 16. While in college I worked 2 part time jobs and after college I landed a store manager position with a grocery chain. So that was my first real full time job. I live in a small town where there’s not many good jobs floating around, mainly factory work. I believe median household salary is between 20-30k. I was making 40k when I started my store manager position. So I thought I was doing well for myself where I live. I did that job for 5 years, I put a TON of heart and soul into my work. It actually paid off really well. When I started there were some problem employees, sales were tanking, nothing really special. But I (after all my hard work) turned things around. I got sales up, got rid of the problem employees, got involved with my community (the town I grew up in so it made it special), got to be around people I knew and interact with the community, things were going good. I got a lot of praise from local people, community, my coworkers, my hire ups/bosses. I got several raises, when I left I was making 54k. Not where I wanted to be but still a good jump from when I first started. 

Since I was involved in the community (small town) I knew a lot of people. I was featured in our newspaper several times. A few months ago the paper wrote a big article about how I was a community oriented person. 

A couple days after that article in the paper comes out I get a call from my father in law. He works in banking (a senior position). He says the president of the bank saw my news article and was very impressed and wanted to talk to me about a job working at the bank. I thought what the heck, sure I’ll see what he has to say.

I met and talked with them it was better pay, better benefits, more time off, better schedule and hours, I mean literally everything better than the retail work I was in lol. So I took it!


I’ve been there a few months now and I do like it, the work is slower paced, the schedule is so much better, I have less headaches, everyone’s nice to me, it’s so much better for my mental health lol. Retail can be HARD. A banking job compared to retail… night and day lol. 


HOWEVER. 

Being the new guy SUCKS. Other than my father in law I didn’t really know anyone that worked there, so I’m having to learn everyone, names, how they are, etc. I worry daily if people like me what they think of me. I’m still somewhat training and I can do some things on my own but I’m still asking a lot of questions. As a store manager I dealt with finances and financial reports and management but not really banking lol. So I’m coming in this blindly. People say I’m doing good but I’m always questioning myself if I really am. It’s hard to go from my first really full time job of 5 years knowing everything and all the people to a totally new atmosphere and know nothing. I’m the new guy, and it’s tough. Every time I mess up and I’m like “man I’m such an idiot”. And I feel like I have to prove myself because I was essentially recruited because I did a good job at my last job and so I feel like everytime I mess up people will judge lol. Another thing I’m having a hard time dealing with is I came from a job where I was praised a lot, got recognized by the community, was basically top dog since I was a supervisor, had a lot of responsibilities and while I don’t miss a lot of the headaches I guess I just don’t know how to deal with missing some of those things and responsibilities?? Going to a slower pace job where I’m not a supervisor?

1e49na0,Is it fine that i left my job? ,"I am 17 years old and a week ago I went to the season without experience because they were looking for a worker in a ""complex"" where my friend works. I did everything in a hurry without any thought and went there and I was supposed to work as a waiter (that's what the hiring guys told me over the phone, that I wouldn't work behind a sled but exclusively as a waiter) I came there and actually it's not as it was said but well, it wasn't a problem for me, I picked up everything quickly (in addition to being a sledge and a waiter, I also worked on ice cream because there are also people missing). The second day after my shift, I started to miss home and I wanted to go home, so I quit my job the next day. The reasons were the high heat, which I was not used to, the surroundings did not suit me, the said friend had a little word about the company she has known there since last season, and she did not even introduce me to anyone (she also wanted to arrange for me to work longer so that her friend from there he doesn't have to be able to go out with her, but I can't) so I was practically alone and it was honestly ugly. The accommodation is also terrible, it has a musty smell, there aren't half of the windows and it's hard to sleep at night, the roommate closes the shell because snakes know how to get in, there is no hot water, the sheets and pillowcases are yellow and they also smell of mustiness, insects are messy on the bed, etc... For example nobody showed me how to boil milk, so then I put myself in the awkward situation of apologizing to people (it's clear to me that you can't go to the season without experience, but it was said that someone would show me everything, but the guy who needed to show me didnt GAF ) And I quit my job after 3 days because I don't want to be there all summer alone, it's quite far from the first city, and besides work I have absolutely no one. The woman who was my roommate also said that it was crazy down there and that people (employees) behaved very badly, and that she saw that it would be better for me to leave and that I have a whole life ahead of me to work. They reduce people's salaries because they lack employees, which makes no sense at all.

Now I'm sorry that I left only for the money because the salary is very good + a big bonus, I had a goal to earn money for a car next year so that I don't depend on anyone and now I'm really angry with myself honestly that I didn't make it even a week. But I thought differently when I was there and couldn't wait to leave. I am now looking for a new job in my place where I live, I am ready to do anything as long as it is important for me to be at home.

Do you think my departure is justified or not? And that I will ""work a lot in  my life"" and that I still have time, or that I am stupid because I didn't stay there alone all summer, so I would somehow suffer and burn my nerves? Or that it is better for me and my psych to leave.

1e47kxj,Hourly Rate Adjustment MUCH higher than agreed upon – what to do?,"Hi all,

I've been in talks with one of my employers (I'm a sole prop) to get a raise to my hourly rate. After a few meetings and an exchange of emails – my manager agreed to a 4% raise to my hourly rate. This is in writing in an email. She said she would notify the contract manager who happens to be a third-party company to adjust my hourly rate.

I get the email today from the contract manager and it's significantly higher than the agreed-upon 4% raise – more like 20% (in terms of dollars it would be from around 70k - 80K). 

I'm assuming this is a mistake, and the prudent thing to do would be to notify my manager it and be honest? Is there a way to strategically word it so that I could maybe appeal to meet them halfway (at 10%, rather than the 4% we already agreed upon, for instance).

I graduated 7 months ago and I have been struggling to land a single job interview since then. Granted, I've only been applying for software development/engineering jobs; however, I no longer feel like my skills are as sharp since graduating, so I don't feel qualified anymore. I also do not want to limit myself to this particular role as I am clearly having a difficult time even landing a single job interview for it. I don't know what else to look for that is ""entry level"" and will take new graduates with just a degree and no experience.

Also, my main issue is that I don't know how to apply for those jobs if they exist. I already can't seem to put a resume together that doesn't get my application instantly rejected. On my current resume, I have my education (degree and GPA), technical skills, and projects sections. My projects are three course projects I did during my undergrad where I detailed what the project was and what my role was during it.

In terms of work experience, I've only had two jobs completely unrelated to this field, and I've been unemployed for 4 years now.

1e46db7,What should my job title be?,"Hi.  I work for an online brand and I was given the title of ""merchandiser"" but it was barely accurate when they gave me the title and now it is giving me imposter syndrome.  I'm going to ask my manager for a title change but I need some advice on what I should ask for.  This is my job in a nutshell...

Product development sources our new products and gathers the ""raw"" data.

Then they hand the project over to me.  I make sure all of the necessary data needs are met, then begin to format the data into a form that is digestible by our PIM system (Salsify).  I set up what we call a master file which in an excel spreadsheet with a tab for every other marketing department.  For example, there is a tab for pricing that I start and then our pricing guy gives me the final retail pricing.  I do the same for our copy requests, photo requests, installation requests and measurement requests.

I also assign work product activation tasks out to my team members depending on work load.

The reason I am uncomfortable with being called a merchandiser now is that we have two merchandisers (a site merchandiser and a product merchandiser) in marketing already that came after me.  My team (the data team) used to be in marketing but now we're part of IT and we've basically been told that we don't make decisions, we just import them.

I'm thinking something like ""Product Data Planner"" or ""Product Data Liaison"" but I don't know if there is already an industry title is basically the same.

1e461en,Help figuring out where to start,"I am 18 and have been struggling to figure out what I want to do with my life.

 I have worked at a state local pizza place for a year and a half, I’m getting close to moving into management, but I dont want to work here forever. I want to have a real job and make real money.

My goal is to move states and get a place with my girlfriend and start our life together young, I want to live comfortably, not paycheck to paycheck as i have been even while living with my parents. She has her career starter and set up very well in the medical field, already making much more than I do, and continuing to get more money and more opportunities very quickly. I feel behind and as if I need to have my whole life planned out, but i dont even know where to start.

I feel like I dont have many interests, which makes it harder to find a starting point. I have always been looking for something “tech” based, but I’m not sure what. I have always been tech savvy and enjoyed solving peoples tech problems. I would consider myself a problem solver in general, and I am a very logical thinker.

I have looked into cybersecurity and IT programs, but based on everything that I’ve found in the community recently, the courses that I have found aren’t gonna get me where I want to be. I barely passed high school, I dont see myself doing well in college (not that I can afford college at all). 

I was dead set on getting a cybersecurity analyst professional certification through a program called coursera, but after doing some research i feel as if it’s not worth it. Employers are looking for either a bachelors degree or 2+ years of experience even for entry level jobs. 

If anyone has any advice or questions and would like to help I would appreciate it so much, I haven’t reached out on reddit much but I know there are people willing to help, I’m open to all advice.

1e44re0,What should I make my hourly rate for a new career opportunity?,"TLDR; How much should I charge (hourly) as a customer service rep/support person for a startup software company?

I have a new job opportunity and they’ve asked me to provide them with my hourly rate. I’m struggling to land on a good number because it’s a slight career/industry shift and hoping someone on here can help steer me in the right direction. For privacy reasons, I’m going to keep things very vague. Here’s the nitty gritty:

The company: It’s an NYC startup that has developed a browser based software for an industry. It’s essentially a one stop shop solution that combines the features of multiple softwares so that companies in this industry can perform their normal operations all in one spot. They’ve been kind enough to allow me to mess around in their sandbox, and, I have to admit, it’s pretty cool and just makes sense. Sort of like one of those “wow, how has no one thought of this yet,” products. I believe they have a handful of people contracting in. The founder, and programmers and marketers, etc. The founder has been working on it for about 7 years and really making a go of it over the last 4 with a small team. They’re getting close to the finish line of releasing it publicly, and he’s starting to make more hires and that’s where I come in. 

My background: I have a degree in Sound Design for film and video and have been a freelancing audio engineer, producer, boom operator and musician since graduating in 2015. I’ve also always had strong people skills and have really honed them while acting as the manager and frontman of my band. I’m the face of the group in many ways, to both fans and people behind the scenes (venue owners, bookers, festival boards, etc.). Basically, one of my main strengths is I find it easy to talk to most people in any situation. I’ve also got just a lot of random basic level creative skills (like video shooting/editing, woodcrafting, laser etching, website/graphic designing, social media marketing) and have worked as a Swiss Army knife to bands and other entities over the years. Tell me what you need, and I’ll get it done. 

My involvement: I’ve had 1 video call and 1 in person meeting (in NYC, while on vacation) with the founder, and they’ve both gone really well. I love his vision, the product itself and I’m able to see how it can really benefit the industry. It also seems like a great time to join the company, so I’m definitely in, in whatever capacity they can use me. At this time, that appears to be as someone to learn the software in and out, help critique the website design, read and understand (and possibly contribute to) the help article manuals, and assist future subscribers of the software with anything they need. The best position title I can come up with is Customer Service Rep and/or Support. It doesn’t sound like I’ll need to sell the product, as it seems able to sell itself pretty well and there’s already a lot of interest from potential subscribers who have been given early access. During our meetings, the founder implied I’d be more support than salesman, which I’m definitely more comfortable with. And it would be a mix of video call check-ins and troubleshooting with the smaller scale businesses and some travel throughout the Midwest (where I’m located) to the larger companies to help train, present, troubleshoot, etc. Basically, he’s looking for someone with strong social and technical skills that can interact with a lot of big personalities across the spectrum of these various companies. At this point, those would be my main responsibilities, with opportunities to get involved in other areas as time goes on. 

Other notes: 

* The founder sees this software as having a lot of potential. He also stated that, while everyone is operating on 1099s for now, he sees it getting to a point where the employees will be salaried, with benefits and opportunities for equity compensation. Certainly sounds good!
* As I said, we really hit it off in our meetings and I already showed my worth by asking a question about a software feature, which highlighted an issue they’d completely overlooked. He brought that up several times during our last conversation. 
* I’m not entirely sure what the workload will look like. I know the founder and his team are constantly busy at the moment, but not sure if that’s just because they’re a (currently) smaller group and trying to finish up the design and functionality of the website. He did say that my hours could be fairly flexible. He used my band as an example, in that if I knew I had a tour for a week (which I will next April in Scotland), I just have to let them know ahead of time and that it won’t be a problem. He kind of implied I could work as much as I wanted to.  

My question: What would be a fair hourly rate? Or is there a plan I should present? Like, this hourly rate for now, then renegotiate to this rate if these certain thresholds are reached? Something where I can still make ok money if there aren’t a lot of hours, but I wont be laughed out of the room for such a suggestion would be nice. 

My initial thought was to ask for $40/hr, but mostly because that was my sound design rate and that’s really all I know, but a friend recently said I should consider something higher. Is he right? If you've made it this far, THANK YOU. This type of situation is very new territory for me, so any insight  you can share is greatly appreciated! ",Scotter-Intoxication,1,1.0,0,1721074087,2024-07-15 20:08:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e44re0/what_should_i_make_my_hourly_rate_for_a_new/,7,2024

1e43uo4,"Mid-career(life?) crisis, sounding boards would be appreciated.","Hey everyone -

Some quick background... I'm 38, Art History major from a top 20ish school. That seems less and less important the further away I get.

Graduating in 2008 was rough, as many people know. I eventually wound up on the West Coast, working in a somewhat arcane corner of the entertainment industry. It's a small and insular community, and jobs are scarce. People hang on for dear life when they get a good one.

It is feeling more and more like I need a change. The financial ceiling in what I do is a bit lower than I had hoped, and I can't quite figure out where my skills transfer. I am feeling... obsolete. I feel like I have taken all of the normal steps suggested on subs like this, and I just keep spinning my wheels.

I am fortunate to be working in entertainment. I am aware of the priveledge I have been afforded, and I in no way want to sound ungrateful. I am finding my self worth increasingly tied to my career trajectory, which has very much plateaued. I know I am not alone in these feelings, and wondering what some people have done to shake things up in a meaningful and productive direction. 

On a practical note, I'm not struggling financially, but I do not have a ton saved, more or less the standard 6 month(ish) emergency fund + a SEP I do not want to touch for 21.5 years (but who's counting)

1e43sj5,Anxious about flying out for interview,"I have been with my current company for a bit over 7 years. I've started my career there and admire the company and workplace, but the volume and pacing of the work has started to drain me and I've been open to looking for new experiences. I found a role at another company that I'm excited about and have made it to the final interview round. 

They want to fly me out to their HQ on Thursday this week. They originally wanted me to come out today (Monday) but I couldn't make it happen with some mandatory meetings I had.

I'm nervous to flag the out of pocket time as I am leading a large event next week and am worried about how to broach this with my leadership team. The interviews will take place over two hours. I have requested I fly in the day before so I can work in the morning and minimize my out of pocket time.

Any advice for this? I've read previous threads but am racked with anxiety about raising any red flags with my current team.

1e43nvr,Quit toxic af job before $6-8k bonus payout in 1.5+ months??,"I've been at an emotionally toxic and incredibly disorganized company for 6+ months now. (More details on why it's toxic at the end of this post.) I plan to leave after receiving my bonus

I asked my boss when we'd be receiving our half year bonuses since he had mentioned in a team meeting it'll be slightly delayed. He says end of next month. I'm concerned that with how disorganized the company is (they messed up my paystub several times in the past; HR said we'll have 401k benefits in the role, but it's been 6+ months and they have no new updates in retirement benefits after we pushed several times for it), that the date to get my bonus will be pushed back further. Things have been okay for now; no big fires but I feel frustrated half the week due to something stupid happening or the CEO blaming me for something I wasn't trained on or had no idea about. 

**So, is it worth staying a bit longer for a $6-8k bonus that** ***may*** **be paid out in 1.5 months? With a likelihood that it'll be delayed even further? I don't know how I can get some assurance that I'll receive it at the date he told me we will, without them suspecting I want to leave. Or should I just input my 2 weeks now lol.**



For those who might be curious on if my environment is actually toxic, it is. Details: CEO doesn't know anything about operations or finance, blames people for his faults, gets emotionally butthurt if you push back on anything, other co workers are drowning in workload due to him giving us tasks that don't grow the business but will appease his ego, few coworkers have been emotionally vindictive if you ask them to make improvements on XYZ. I just want to quit so badly.

1e42ccf,Standing up for myself and asking for a promotion ,"Context: 3 years in entry level HR adjacent, mainly recruiting coordinator roles. Joined this company and have been here for 2.5 months. Within 1 month, there has been 4 rounds of lay offs all of which I survived. I’ve quickly out grown my original job description as Recruiting Coordinator (they threw in a /HR in the offer letter so I’m a “RC/HR” which is a total cop out). I’ve been doing the work of an HR Generalist for the past month, reporting to the COO and a C suite executive daily. Instead of working at HQ 10 minutes away from home they have me working 4 days out of the week 50 minutes away from home for the past month, being the face of HR at 2 of their warehouses located a city away from one another. I pulled up all my colleagues in my HR department at corporate and they make leagues above me. I’m the only one making chump change at 27/hr hourly while everyone else (5 people who all joined only 2-3 months before I did if not at the same time. This is an entirely brand new HR team) still working in my department is salaried 75k, 85k, 90k, 95k, 100k. 3 colleagues of varying seniority were recently laid off so the COO cut 240k annually from the HR department. Our HR director also quit within 3 weeks and her salary was 195k. Thats -435k annually for the HR department now. She didn’t stay after the second round of lay offs and was quite embarrassed about the company, found another job quickly. (And about a -million annually from every other layoff after severances). One of them was an HR Generalist, the only other person who did the exact same job I do, face of HR but for 2 other warehouses across the country that are now closing. Company is in a more stable state now and they kept me because they need me and I’m paid next to nothing compared to my colleagues. To them I’m a fresh naive graduate that doesn’t ask questions, sent out into the warehouse like a dog for the HR department, who are all at corporate and all who live a comfortable and lavish life (they take pto and travel regularly,drive awesome cars while I’m fighting for my life keeping up with rent and bills in this expensive ass state California). I feel like I’m being robbed blind after comparing the job descriptions/digging into my entire department’s salaries.

My Plan: I’m going to have a brief chat with the COO when I’m at HQ this week and present the facts. (He encourages walk ins) I’m doing the work of an HR Generalist but on the org chart I’m a “Recruiting Coordinator/HR”. (I was never supposed to report daily to the COO or a C Suite executive in the first place.) I’ve out grown my initial job description which lists none of the job processes I’m now doing on a day to day basis. (I can print both job descriptions and put them side by side too for him to see visually) I was never supposed to work 4 days away from HQ. The HR department is now -435k annually so there is plenty for a minuscule pay increase. I’m going to ask for an increase from 27/hr to $65k salaried which was the salary of one of the 3 laid off employees, an HR Generalist from another state. It’s 10k less than the other HR Generalist still working here at HQ. I’m still going to be the least paid but at least I’ll be extremely content and loyal to the company for this.

Should I also fabricate a bargaining chip? Was thinking maybe I say I had been interviewing durring these past few rounds of layoffs and an offer is now on my table for $65k as of “yesterday” but I’d much rather stay with the company and grow. I’d like a decision by end of week or else I’m walking.

1e41wz8,Dealing with shitty coworker,"I’m currently trying to work through a situation at work and would love to hear some advice on how to manage this.

I’m working an office job which is comprised of 4 analysts, 1 supevisor (the shitty coworker) and a manager. I’m an analyst and report to the manager. The supervisor is a step below the manager, but has no direct reports. All of us analysts sit together in a pod of cubicles. The supervisor typically gets into the office a bit later than us in the mornings.

Over the last few weeks, I’ve noticed that the supervisor will greet all of the analysts when she comes in, except for me. At some point during the day, she will go around asking how everyone’s weekend was, how they’re doing, etc. except for me.

Now, admittedly im an introverted person, and it takes a lot of effort to build relationships, but I’m very positive and kind natured. I have a good working and amicable relationships with the other analysts and my boss, however for whatever reason I don’t think the supervisor likes me very much.

I know that I’m not necessarily going to be friends with everyone at work, but I will admit that her actively ignoring me while reaching out to all of the other analysts is getting to me a little bit. 

Any advice on how to proceed here? I’ve tried connecting with her a little bit more and initiating the conversation to talk about something else than work, and most of the times she’s reacted positively, however is still ignoring me when she comes in every morning. 

She’s also 2-3 levels above me and we work closely within our group, and she could potentially be my manager in the near future, so I need some plan other than completely ignoring her.

1e41h7t,Suggestions on Presentation,"Not sure if this is the best sub for this, but thought I would give it a shot. I was laid off in December 2023, and remained unemployed until June 2023, when my previous employer hired me back in a different, much lower-paying position. I have been going through training, and while I have been doing that, some jobs I applied to have reached out to me finally for interviews. I have a second-round interview tomorrow with one of those companies. The role is for what I did previously (before I was laid off), as a technical trainer. Basically, I teach others (clients, employees, etc). how to use certain software. The new role is teaching on different software than I taught on previously. 

For my second round interview, I have to do a 20-minute presentation on 'whatever I'd like'. The presentation is tomorrow (fast turnaround). And so far, I am coming up blank on what to present. I had a job interview about 2 weeks ago where I presented on using SQL Server Management Studio to restore a database and run scripts, but that was for an IT trainer role. I thought about cleaning that one up a bit and using it again, but I don't know if it will be too high-level for them. The new role is training companies on using the ERP software they are rolling out.

1e412hd,Freaking out - new job imposter syndrome,"I recently got a promotion to a middle management position at my workplace and I'm kind of freaking out. I (28) work in a health organisation and recently there was a lot of staff turn over. I asked for a promotion to fill one of the vacant positions and actually got it! I know I am qualified for the position and have the experience. But now I just feel out of my depth immediately. I have two employees who I now supervise and I want to protect them from the chaos that this workplace can be but also motivate them to do actual work. I keep feeling like I am missing opportunities to be impressive right away and sometimes I look around like ""am I meant to make a decision on this???"". After so many years of being stuck outside of leadership it feels strange and I am honestly out of touch with my instincts right now. I'm also conscious that the other managers are waiting for me to prove myself.

1e41278,"Feeling stuck at my current job, but unsure of what to do.","For starters, it's a leadership position in a call center. If you've worked a call center job before you know how bad your mental health can get.
 I've been working here for 3 years but I'm quickly growing sick of the job. 
I'll start with the perks, the pay is great compared to other jobs in my area. It's not a lot, but for not having a college degree I'm making over $50k, which is not easy to come by in my city.  

Currently I am enrolled in school for a BS in IT w/Cybersecurity Concentration, and my job is helping me with tuition reimbursement. My expected graduation is in 11 months. Which is not a lot of time, but it feels like an eternity in my current role. 

Given that it's a telecommunications company that I work for, there's the perks of free/discounted services. 

So, yes it sounds great but working the escalated calls is taking a toll on me. There's also the fact that the company is closing other centers and therefore incrementing our work flow. My colleagues and I were hoping for an increase in our pay rate but it got shot down quick. The company knows of the pay rates in our city so they take advantage of it. More work, same pay,  what are you going to do? Leave? You would struggle to  make a decent living...

I'm more so looking for advice and see what other people would do in this situation. I've thought about leaving and paying for school out of pocket but the jobs I find don't come close to the pay. I've considered staying and finishing school but I feel as if I've been pushing myself to stat for so long and don't know how much longer my mental health can take it.


Any advice is greatly appreciated.

1e3zzfr,What are my career options?,"I, 24F, am having trouble deciding what type of career I want to pursue. I have a Bachelor of Science in Biology, and currently work as an administrative assistant in a hospital. I like the idea of continuing to work in Hospital Administration/Operations, but I'm not closed off to other areas. My employer is currently encouraging me to go back to school, and is offering to cover my tuition 100%, and I absolutely want to take advantage of it. 

My question is, what should I go back to school for? What is a good program that I can take while working, that will help me build a career? I have been looking at a Business Administration or Business Management diploma (which you can easily upgrade to a degree after you finish, at least where I am), but I don't know what else to look at. I've looked at some MBA's, but I don't have a lot of the requirements, so I'd have to take some classes for that anyway, plus I have to be able to continue to work while finishing school.

I like numbers and math, I'm detail oriented, I can get bored easily. I would like something that is easy to work hybrid/remotely, but that isn't my biggest priority.

Something in my head has been telling me to start putting applications in, but I’m also hesitating because I feel like I’m being ungrateful and that I’d be burning a bridge.

1e3y04e,Advice: I’m hiring my own manager ,"I’m about a year and a half into a position with an organization. 6 months ago my manager who I was working under when I was hired quit and we have been slowly starting the process of hiring someone to replace them. For context, our team was going through a lot of changes when she quit and I had the capacity to keep things afloat while we waited to fill the position. 

My organization greatly values workplace culture and they have done a great job at making sure people we hire are the right fit for the team and the whole organization. Because of this, I was offered the opportunity to be a part of the hiring process as we find a manager. I am this manager’s only direct report and because we would work so closely, my other supervisors value my opinion on fit. (Other piece of context: I contemplated applying for the manager position myself, but did not feel like it was the right time and I’m perfectly content with that). 

The problem I am running into is that my previous manager was amazing. We got along really well and had a good balance of fun and hard work. She was one of the reasons I accepted the job in the first place. As we have been interviewing candidates I can’t help but compare them to her. I am scared that:
1. My previous experience with a great manager will make my standards too high and make me a little bit picky
2. That, if the person we hire does not mesh well with me, I will want to quit. 

Our hiring process is quite intentional, but there is still that voice of doubt that tells me that someone could ace all of their interviews and then be a terrible manager. I do not have any intentions of quitting right now, but I’ve had terrible managers in the past and really do not want a bad manager make me leave an organization I like working for. 

Any advice on how to approach this situation? I don’t think it’s very often that someone would be hiring their manager, so I would appreciate any insight!

1e3x306,Torn Between What is Responsible and What I Really Want,"Hey folks!

I understand if this post gets downvoted into oblivion because of the nature of it but that's fine. I just want to express myself and my thoughts in hopes that someone will be able to provide some advice in this area.

  
For background, I graduated high school in 2020 and went straight into college at an out-of-state school to study music education. Due to my reaction to COVID and a recent breakup with my high school sweetheart, I was led to insecurity both in my status as a musician and a student. This led me to change my major a total of six different times before I realized that out-of-state tuition was becoming too much for me to handle, especially given the fact that in terms of my progress towards a degree, I was spinning my tires in place.

  
***Note: I am not blaming external factors for my failures. I understand that there were thousands of people who were in the same predicament as myself and still managed to succeed. I am blaming my reaction to those events, which ultimately points back to me.***

  
I moved back to my home state a year ago and started attending community college for information technology. Since then, I have had an IT job in a local university as well as my current job which I guess can be considered somewhere in the realm of systems administration at a company that has more of an 'office culture'. I am 22 years old, salaried at 52k per year, with no degree yet. If I were to complete my associate's and eventually my bachelor's in IT, I would have a ton of room for my salary and job roles to inflate from this point.

  
That being said, music education had been and continues to be my true passion. I often beat myself up and think about the life that I could have had if I were to have stuck with that degree program and became a music teacher. For me, music education was about sharing my love of music with the new generation and keeping love for the arts alive. That felt like a goal that was so much larger than myself and is still something that I so desperately want out of life. Meanwhile, in IT, I sit at a desk all day and fix people's computers. My work now is important, but not influential, which is why I don't feel like it speaks to me.

  
I have an opportunity to go back and finish my music education degree, but it involves putting everything on the table. I've been in a relationship for 3 years now, and we are starting to get serious about our future. This would throw a wrench in that. Her parents are very keen on making sure that her immediate future is stable and that she will be on solid standing to begin her career. This puts that at risk too. My entire family has expressed pride and excitement for me in this new job and position, and I run the risk of their disappointment as well. But this is what I sincerely **want**.

  
Would it be selfish to pursue this? I'm not going to be dramatic and say that I couldn't live with myself if I didn't finish that degree, but I would be disappointed in myself. I also run the risk of other people being disappointed with me in the same way if I give up what I currently have.

  
The logical answer is to pursue IT and leave it at that. I made my decision and I should stick with it. I think I'm just wrestling with the emotions and telling myself there's still a chance that I could be a music educator.

  
Thanks for any and all advice.

1e3x0nt,New VP at our company and they should not be VP. Should I talk to the owner of the company?,"So, long story short the owner of our company passed and his wife promoted an employee to a VP role. She then turned around and sold the company to someone else. The new owner has been there like 8 months at this point and the VP in her role for 8 months.

She is incapable at this point of actually doing the VP role. I think the goal at some point was to have her in the role but it was going to be like 4 or 5 years down the road. She was kind of thrown into the role because she had to, so I have been trying to give some grace here, but I almost past this at this point and I am honestly afraid she is going to run the company into the ground and she is to immature as well.

I mentioned this the other day, but the new CEO told me I could work whenever I wanted as long as I worked 40 hr weeks since I am a back web developer and I never deal with clients. This was a contingency for me to continue working at my company going forward. I then proceeded to tell my manager nothing is going to change you can still reach me if there is an emergency, no productivity is going to be lost. She colluded with my manager and proceeded to override him when he was on vacation saying he doesn't know what he is talking about and she as afraid other employees would get jealous that I was the only one that could do that and I needed to wait because she needed to talk to him. I proceeded to tell the VP that I am the most senior employee here and you literally tell them it is a seniority thing, it is that simple. 

She proceeded to say well I have been in a the company a while too. Which was super immature to say. The VP is only like 29 or 30 years old and super immature.

I have been at the company since the inception of my company and I am the most senior person there by like 6 years.

I agree that the new CEO could have rolled out how the new hours were going to work better, but that being said she was talking negative about the CEO to me talking down on him acting immature and kept saying I am trying to preserve the legacy of the previously owner. She doesn't have the company's best interest in mind she just wants to preserve the previous owners legacy. These things don't go hand in hand. She hung out with the previous owners kids and were friends with them so there is a conflict of interest there.

We have had several large partners call in and say she needs to be removed from the VP role that she isn't ready for this role and shes still to immature to handle something like this.  One partner in particular has been working with our company since the inception of the company and she is very well respected in the community and she said she needed to be removed from the VP position. 90% of all my coworkers feel the same way.

My question with all this is should I go talk to he new CEO about all this? I am generally concerned she is going to destroy the company.

I do have the means to go back to school, but I still don’t know if it’s a worthwhile investment since I’ve gotten this far without higher education.

1e3wv6z,Divorcing your trade ,"I’m 30m. Been a barber for 9 years. Would recommended if you are extroverted and can survive on 60k your first couple of years. It would be a good career if benefits were more common and the wages weren’t basically “tipped wages”. Or 40-50% commission. Not bad but not great.   I’m booked a month in advance and do mainly requests but I find myself craving something else. I also dread interacting with a lot of my requests anyway. Also I would love to have my Friday nights and Saturdays free. 

I stepped out of hair for a scheduling coordinator position but ultimately went back to a barber shop due to the work culture? The manager and owner would constantly scream at each other and much more. 

Some unfavorable clients found me again already and now I am currently searching for a similar coordination position. Or something to do with admin / inventory management. I think I have quite a few transfersble skills. And can always do hair on the side. I have a chair at home. 

My main reason for needing career advice would be: I think I need to go back to college. I have some college credits. Would anyone have any advice on a career as a counselor/ therapist. It seems my state only needs a social work degree for some positions. 

My only other interest besides social work would be the arts but that seems like a struggle for the long hall. I don’t really want to work in a museum or be an art professor. I have seen graphic design jobs in my city but I have a feeling ai could impact that job on the future.

1e3vk9c,I just turned 18 and have worked a 9-5 office job for the last year.,"I turned 18 around 4 weeks ago and have worked a 9-5 for the last year. I live in the UK so I left school when i was 16 and did a year of college doing a pointless animal management course. I’m fairly anti-social and have never done well at making friends, after leaving college due to being left out and not enjoying it I started working in an office job doing freight forwarding at my dad’s work. Since i was only 17 at the time of starting, the only legal way of working these ridiculous hours is through an apprenticeship, which also means i’m legally allowed to be paid £6.40 an hour, despite minimum wage for an 18 year old being £8.40. A few months ago I asked my bosses for a pay rise since i’m essentially doing the same work as my older colleagues and getting paid a tiny fraction of their wage, the bosses said they believe i’m being paid fairly and that my wage will go up to £8.40 when I finish my apprenticeship (I had 9 months left at the time). Now that i have 5 months left of my apprenticeship, what was the point in dedicating over a year of my life to learning how to do this job? I have no friends or social life outside of work, I frequently go to the gym and take my health very seriously but my mental health is severely lacking. I’ve thought about looking for new jobs but I really don’t believe that will solve the problem, if i decided to leave and work somewhere else i wouldn’t have the convenience of my dad driving me to work with him and being here when I need guidance or help talking to the bosses. I’m really lost for what to do, I hate that i’m worrying so much about my future this early and so isolated from everyone my own age.

I would really like to move out of home to a new city - without getting into details I feel like it would boost my mental health massively and improve my relationship with my mum which is really important to me. Not sure how much longer I can take living with her and it seems silly to move out and rent a place in the city I already have a home in?

I don’t know how or even who to approach this with, the company are pretty lenient with flexibility and I’m getting pretty desperate. The other option would be to look for new jobs in the city I’d like to move to but I’m not sure it would be silly to throw away a grad scheme if they don’t let me work remotely.

1e3tul9,Complicated situation: 2 dream job offers at once— what to do?,"Hi everyone, I would first like to say thank you for taking your time to read this and help me. I’m in a bit of a serious predicament where I’ve got two job offers at once. However, the problem is that one job (job 1) is overseas and the work visa takes about 3-4 months to process— in which there is a possibility that it can also be denied which is out of the company’s hands. It is my absolute DREAM job and the career trajectory is positive and there is a lot of room to scale the ladder and move up. 

The other job offer (job 2) is based in where I currently live. It is not my dream job per se, as career trajectory seems to be abit stagnant and not really challenging. The pay is the same for both jobs when taken rent payment into consideration. I also absolutely loved and got along well with the team that I’ll be working with for both jobs.

My question is, I cannot wait unemployed for 3-4 months for the overseas job to apply for my work visa (with the risk of getting denied and then I lose both jobs), and in the meantime, I was wondering if it would make sense for me to take job 2 for 3-4 months and then quit and move when my overseas job finalizes the visa process. Is that rude? I feel abit unethical doing this but it’s what my friends and family have recommended. I have until the end of the week to decide. Any input would be extremely helpful.

1e3tkfl,Would you accept a good job offer even if you were later informed that the people you would be working with are the same people from the previous job you left?,"Today, I was offered a good job package from a company who reached out to me on LinkedIn. However, there is a big caveat -- he also informed me that the people I would be working with are the same people from my previous company. (shocking, I know).

I will be working with 2 teammates of the same level and we were teammates before in different projects. An even bigger shocker: I was informed that I would be reporting to the same supervisor I had during my previous job.

Apparently, this new company poached everyone from my old company to start this new team they are trying to build.

I am so torn between the money and the awkwardness of having to work with old colleagues. I actually don't want to work with my old colleagues in the past due to some personal issues and I also felt like I was left to fend for myself before. I don't want that to happen again. In addition, I honestly want to start fresh in my career where no one knows me and I get to ""reinvent"" myself so to speak.

But the money is sooo difficult to give up given that I have been doing freelance work only for the past months.

Am I dumb for wanting to decline this (around 90% sure about this decision)?

I am thinking, even if I accept this, I might not last long since I would still hate working everyday and having to interact with people I already moved on from a previous chapter in my life. I probably sound like I already have a decision in my mind but I am just looking for some validation from strangers who probably have more wisdom than me.

I have volunteered in the past and put this on my CV, but none of this is exactly in a retail or hospitality environment I've only really been able to stretch having volunteered as a student ambassador and having done some informal babysitting for a while saying I have transferrable skills from these experiences but again no luck.

(I don't have the guts to tell my parents that this has happened and I am just waiting till 2026 to figure it out) The reason it got pushed back was because I failed 2 subjects. I am not at all passionate or interested in what I study. I am more passionate and interested about sales and business/ finance. The reason I am doing this course is because of parental pressure. 

Ideally I would want to start a business and run that, I understand that this takes time but I am trying a FBA business on amazon selling something. I have ordered 100 products from my suppliers and if it works out this has the potential to generate 10K in profit every month. I am more passionate about this because it involves sales/ marketing and that sorta stuff. 

However, I do not have the guts to tell my parents that I do not want to study want I am studying and want to pursue a business. Obviously they want the best for me and therefore want me to study and see business as super risky. That why I have completely dropped out (they wouldn't let me anyways) because I want to first have a business that can generate me at least 10K a month before I quit uni. 

I also feel this way because if I already have profitable business it would be easier for me to tell my parents that I have something else going on for me and uni just isn't for me. Please help me and share your thoughts and opinions and if I am doing the right or wrong thing. I have been uneasy about it all and just stressed about and scared if a business wont work.

Any advice/ opinion is greatly appreciated.  ",Important-Extent-962,1,1.0,0,1721030046,2024-07-15 07:54:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e3p6hd/i_need_options_advice/,7,2024

1e3ooqv,Needing advice on probation getting extended for another 3 months ,"Hi all, 28 F needing some advice with my career.

I do Comms for a social service agency since January and I was expected to be a confirmed staff this month. However, my supervisor sat me down and said that my probation will have to be extended for another three months because my deputy director thinks I work ""too independently"" and ""not a good culture fit"" for the organisation.

I was in shock because this DD has had many one-on-one's with me, and has never once raised these issues with me. She has also told my supervisor that I do these tasks ""step by step"" and not ask questions right at the beginning when the project is about to begin, and only ask when the issue pops up.

See, I have made it known during my interview with them that this project is something that I have never worked on before, and that I am willing to learn the ropes nonetheless. My supervisor agrees with me that it is unfair of my DD to expect me to anticipate questions in advance, but since her hands are tied, she simply said, ""It is what it is.""

I also need to add that I work independently because the tasks that I am given cannot be worked by two or more people. But, I still update my supervisor and DD on any new developments and take their feedback from time to time.

I have been working for at least three years now, and I have frankly never heard anyone telling me I work too independently in this organisation. I have been feeling very discouraged, and having panic attacks about returning to office. Also, this company never allows us to wfh. They expect us to be in office every single day. This job was never my first option, but took it on as I believed I could learn a thing or two here.

My supervisor has also said that if I am not keen on extending the probation, I can serve my one month notice and leave. I have already started applying to other jobs, but have agreed to the extension of probation as it will allow me to earn an income while on the job hunt.

I am also feeling lost on how I should proceed with this. DD has been very snarky with her feedback on my project in group chats after she was made known my supervisor has spoken to me, and I don't know if I should just resign now and be jobless till I find another one.

Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you, and i will be happy to respond if I need to clarify anything.

1e3o9b2,Do I Stand a Chance at Getting This Job?,"I recently attended a 2-day interview for a graduate program placement at Company X, a financial services company. There were about 43 candidates for around 25 available positions. Most of the candidates were final-year or honors students in computer science/IT, whereas I graduated last year with a degree in computer science. Currently, I work as a business analyst at a major international financial services company.



When asked which role I would like to apply for, I chose the business analyst position. I noticed that many of the other candidates had attended prestigious schools and displayed excellent presentation skills, confidence, and a strong accent. In contrast, my presentation skills are decent but not exceptional, and I might have appeared nervous during my presentations.

There’s a whole bunch of other issues there too such as we don’t get our tips, there’s no benefits (it’s a private business) scheduling is tight so were only open 4 days a week and work in 10s and 12s (big issue for me because I want a more flexible schedule and to be able to come home and still have daylight to do at home duties) etc. I don’t want to burn bridges but I don’t like the work I’m doing and I was promoted earlier this year and now I’m stuck in a position that I never asked to be in when she asked me about it when I first started and told my boss when I first started I didn’t want to be in and she threw me into it anyways. I’m starting to become miserable. The place I work at my boss schedules clients a year ahead of time so all 2025 is scheduled which means we’re scheduled as well. I’m on that schedule all year and now I feel even more stuck because I know if I put in my two weeks I’ll probably get a worse reaction than my coworker did. I feel like I’m in between a rock and a hard place and I feel like I don’t know what to do or how to go about it.

","So the dilemma here is that I’ve been interning as an electrical engineer at a DOD company and honestly it’s been pretty shitty and I have no learned anything until I think the high ups realized I’m going to be handed down drawings so they are paying more attention to me now.

I’ve been there for a year already and have honestly not liked it, the team lead and person who is teaching me is rude, condescending, and mean. It’s quite literally a bitter old man who’s jaded and he used to ruin my day and make me feel sad, but now I just pity him and feel bad for him. He smoked cigarettes all day and drinks Mountain Dew, no kids, not married, and he takes his job very seriously which is why he “shapes up” the interns.

Anyway, they offered me a full time position and I don’t want to take it but it’s going to be around 80k. The thing is I don’t need the money but it’s going to be hard to find another electrical engineering considering I haven’t had much real experience. 

My parents and friends are telling me to just stay there and quit as soon as I find a better job. My gf is telling me that it’s morally wrong and to just work valet (I worked valet before and could go back) while I find a better job bc she doesn’t want to see me miserable and happy. 

I myself feel stuck bc I want to use my degree and feel like I’m progressing career wise, but it seems like it’s doing to be at the cost of my happiness. It’s Sunday and I’m getting the deep dread of going into work and it feels like I’m going to be trading in happiness for money.

It’s a very old office, kind of ok school environment, some people at work call it a toxic environment, and it’s just not where I want to be.

Idk if I should just say fuck this corporation I’m going to work there 6 months or less and just take my money and run (find something better or even with that 6 month paycheck I can at least have a nest of money) or should I just simply quit and apply to new jobs.

In 24 and living at home so really I just don’t know what to do, it feels like I have to choose some long term goals over my happiness, idk if that will be worth it. Idk if I’ll regret taking it or if I regret not taking it and I just feel stuck.

1e3m5iq,Making a life changing decision and I need your help!,"I'm at a cross roads here. This is about choosing between a good enough university versus a chance at a business school in India. This post is a long one folks!  
  
I got into Edinburgh Business School's MSc Marketing program. I can apply for a visa and go there right now, or prepare for CAT, GMAT and shoot my shot for a business schools in India (IITs, MICA, ISB and the like).   
  
Here are the pros and cons of both choices:  
The good thing about going for Edinburgh business school is that, I have an accepted offer, it is a reputed university and getting a visa isn't super difficult for UK. The bad things about it are the sub-par curriculum, and faculty.

The good thing about the Indian business schools is that they have incredible curriculum, faculty, equally reputed and are of 2 years. The bad thing about them is obviously being in India (read further why its so bad for me), the possibility of not scoring well in CAT, GMAT and not getting the international exposure.

There is a third option of applying for January intake in UK but if the curriculum is same as Edinburgh business school, I don't see a difference between going now and going then.

To give a bit of context, I've been trying for universities since last year. I wanted to focus on universities out of India because of my sexuality but, even overseas tensions appear to be rising. 

Academically, I'm interested in marketing, advertising, sales, business and negotiating. My interests narrow the programs down to marketing or an MBA (hence studying for CAT). The difficult thing is, being unemployed. I tried working and applying to universities at the same time. I could not cope with the stress (agency copywriter). I've been unemployed for a year now, and it feels like slow death at this point. Giving those exams and waiting for results, and possibility of being rejected all over again just feels like torture. 

I'm 23, meaning this is my first time making life altering decisions. I could really use some help from experienced folks out there. Any advice, please!

1e3l44o,How to prepare for retail vendor manager / pm roles - Current MBA + non tech background,"Hi everyone!

I'm currently a second-year MBA student at a top 20 university in the US. Prior to this, I worked as a corporate lawyer at a reputable firm in my home country. While the compensation was great, the demanding lifestyle eventually led to burnout.

In search of a new direction, I joined a family friend's clothing business and unexpectedly discovered a passion for retail management and vendor relations. The aspects of travel, P&L management, process optimization, negotiations, and constant interaction with new people perfectly suited my outgoing personality.

My goal now is to become a Retail Vendor Manager at a major company like Amazon, Walmart, or TikTok. I'm seeking advice on how to tailor my resume to appeal to recruiters in this field. Are there any additional courses or certifications that would be beneficial? Also, which MBA courses should I focus on to best prepare for this role?

I know this is a very niche role, and it might be better to prepare for project manager and product manager roles. I'm open to all of it. I aspire to work for a tech company and ultimately want to break into a tech managerial role if the vendor manager role doesn’t pan out. I want to use this summer break to prepare for full-time recruitment. Coming from a background so far away from tech and business, I want to revamp my resume and use this time to build skills that are missing from my toolkit. I would really appreciate it if you could suggest courses/skills you have found helpful for these roles or things you wish you knew or did when you were in my position.

I believe my unique blend of legal background, hands-on retail experience, and strong interpersonal skills make me a compelling candidate. I'm excited to leverage my MBA to launch a successful career in retail vendor management. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

1e3i3bb,Need advice about what to do now that I (22F) put in my notice and trying to figure out the option that will create the least amount of stress.,"I (22 F) have been working in the senior living industry for two years. One year as an activities coordinator and the other as an Activities Director (management position) at my current place. I just put in my notice at my current job because I’m going back to school full time online in the next few weeks and I am also incredibly burnt out from my current workplace. My anxiety has not been this bad in a long time. I dream about this job, the bad management, the residents, EVERY night. I started getting anxious hives again. I cry every day on my drive home for months now. It’s been debilitating because I work so hard but don’t get the support I need there from my boss. I care about the residents so much but there is also not much room for growth for me there. So I put in my notice. I will note, I am leaving on good terms with everyone there and explained that school as my only reason for leaving. I want to get an associates in social work and I am currently doing part time classes. By spring 2026 is when I will have my associates if I stick to doing full time this fall like I plan to.
   I also have a second job at an Amazon warehouse that’s part time flex shifts so the entire job is me picking up shifts and the max I can work a week is 60 hours. Amazon pays $2 less than my current place ($19/hr) but I figured if I do get tight on money I can just pick up some extra shifts. 
But I need advice. I interviewed at another senior living place that is $5 more an hour but is also as an activities director. I thought I might as well apply seeing how much it was and then I got an interview. The interview went really well and was almost two hours long, I was introduced to the whole management team, the Executive Director says he thinks I’d be a great fit and emphasized how he wants everyone on his team to feel supported. I’ll know for sure by this Wednesday if I get it. I feel like if I do get it, it would be stupid of me to turn down a job that would make me $800 more a month. But my fear is my stress level is so high right now and and I’m nervous another management position would be stressful for me with full time classes as well. And I am really set on going full time, I really don’t want to keep putting school off. Also, the place I interviewed is an independent living- my experience is in Assisted Living and memory care mainly. My view has always been that independent living residents tend to be the most mean and entitled out of the 3. That makes me nervous and also this place has gone through two activities directors in 4 months which I feel is a big red flag. I also know the senior living industry in general is such a mess. And I understand two years experience isn’t much but they’re the only real jobs I have ever had and I feel like activities with elderly is all I am qualified for. I don’t know what else I would be good at or if there is any other job I could find that pays at least $19/hr. 
In my ideal world right now, I would do school online full time, work somewhere I can clock in and clock out and truly leave and not have to think about work when I am not at work. And I do not want to put off school. I dropped out of college twice after I graduated in 2020 and I really want to stay committed and stick to my plan. I’ll have my associate’s in social work by spring of 2026 and my bachelor’s by 2029. Are there any entry level jobs I do in social work? Should I take this job that pays $24/hr if I get it and still do full time classes and just power through the next two years, even if it worsens my anxiety? I just want to pay my bills and do school and be not as horribly stressed as I currently am. I don’t even know what I want to do in social work! My mom worked in the field as a guidance counselor, my sister works with autistic children, I thought I had found my niche with working with the elderly but now I am not so sure. This post is just a scatterbrained stressed out mess. I feel so lost I just wish I knew the right thing to do.",legalizeleah,1,1.0,1,1721005282,2024-07-15 01:01:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e3i3bb/need_advice_about_what_to_do_now_that_i_22f_put/,7,2024

I’ve considered a few career choices but normally I’m shut out by them requiring PE, E.i.t, other certifications. Of course I don’t have an issue with going through a certification program.

The jobs I’ve been looking at are 
Surveyors, traffic/transportation engineers, architectural drafters (BIM), considered fire alarm design/electrical engineering. 

I don’t really have a passion for anything except Automobiles. That would require me to get into mechanical engineering and I don’t think I wanna do that. I do want to get into engineering and I would feel proud of myself if I was able to point at buildings and say I helped build it.

Total of 5 people were laid off including VP of marketing, Director of HR, Senior Mech. Engineer and a couple of Embedded Software automation guys from R&D. Contractors were hired in place of VP of Marketing and HR. Luckily I wasn’t impacted. But I am concerned if there is troubles brewing as I have heard a lot about cost cutting and “efficiency “ in the last two quarterly meetings and the morale in my team has been low since. We are now being given unrealistic deadline to deliver under very very accelerated timelines. But the strange thing is we are still hiring new people and there are job postings open. I am unsure as to if I should start looking elsewhere as the team and my manager are really good and I have enjoyed working here so far. The work hours are also flexible.

I was wondering what your experiences there have been like or what you've heard about it, if anything. I'm a potential candidate who has applied to one of their jobs and have also been messaging some of the people who work there. Some of the things they've told me is that there has been kind of a gap between the time they applied to the job and when they heard back, around 2 months ish. Many of them were also offered a job without an interview. Another thing I've heard is that DineLocal was removed from a job search website but the exact reason was not known, but I presume it was because of these hiring practices. What do you all think? Any thoughts or ideas you can share regarding DineLocal, start-ups, or just this general situation? Are they trustworthy?

1e3f42v,Should I Accept Offer at Company Which I Am Not Passionate About,"Hi all,

  
I currently have and been working at company ""X"" for the last two years. It is an extremely small company (10> people), but is exactly what I envisioned myself doing after college. Too add, the work is extremely interesting and I have learned a lot of skills. However, being such a small company the workload and stress is very high. The biggest factor which has led me to apply to other jobs is my boss. He has had multiple outburst yelling at me in front of colleagues, has thrown me under the bus for failures which objectively were not my fault, and  overall feel like every other day is an instance where I am walking on egg shells around him. 



One of my friends referred me to a position at her company and I have been given an offer. Too start, the type of work I would be doing is something I am not passionate about. The compensation the company offered me is also 23% less than what I currently make. I did make a counter offer and waiting to hear back. The reasonings I do want to work at this company  is as follows; my friend has moved up in the company and is making great money, the team I would be working with left a very good impression on me, and I wouldn't be working with my current boss. 

  
All advice is welcomed.

Thanks. ",BiologyBJJ,0,0.5,8,1720996935,2024-07-14 22:42:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e3f42v/should_i_accept_offer_at_company_which_i_am_not/,7,2024
1e3etcu,"For my nyc folks, Bus Operator or X ray tech ","22M Hey Y’all, I need some help deciding what to do with my career choices. My goal is to make enough money and hopefully move out of nyc. I wasted some time having hard time figuring how or what to start a career with, going to regular school wasn’t my cup of tea, however after doing research, healthcare is a very reliable career choice and i found out that x ray technologist is something i might like since the pay is good, one of the least stressful jobs in healthcare and if i pass the national exam, i can find this good paying job pretty much in other states. Since I’m not a A or even B student and community college is a much harder program to get into, i was planning to go to private school with a 30k loan for 2 years and i should get into the field right after graduating making at least 60k beginning salary which goes to 80-90k over the years plus good benefits. Now something else came up, I applied for MTA bus operator early 2024 and a few days ago i received a call to come in for interview this week but im racing against time to receive my cdl permit since i didn’t prepare myself (sounds like me). It might seem overwhelming since i’ll have to learn to operate a whole bus and weave through brooklyn’s streets dealing with the road and public which sounds like a nightmare but i think i can handle it. However, MTA is one of the biggest if not the biggest transportation union companies northeast of America, with really good pay, excellent benefits, Alot of OT and potentially making 70-80k first year and was thinking to join to grind up some money for a few years and leave the city. 
I know a dude(in same mta job) around my age maybe older who might not be rich but has good money for himself and even his own nice car, i would like to achieve this but many claim that this job ain’t for everyone but its possible. Even though i’m young i passed on a-lot of opportunities in my life because i’m dumb and if this bus job can make me bank and get me further in life, its a good choice and nyc folks talk about how the MTA is really good to get into and would be kinda dumb for me to pass on this. Thing is when i look at these jobs i’m always thinking long term and living in nyc is not something i don’t want to do and i wont find a good union like this in other states. I just want a stable career and not kill myself mentally for the money which is why i think they pay this much for the bus operator but i’ll have to struggle for another 2 years and
hopefully find a job if i go the college route but i wont be on the road all day stressed. What do you guys recommend?

1e3efzz,Wanting to consider a roadmap.,"Hello! I currently work as a Floor Sales Consultant at CarMax. However, the company is investing more and more into its Express PickUp and Customer Call Centers, resulting in less commission cut for Salespeople and overall less interaction opportunities with customers. I do enjoy my job, I love talking to customers, helping them pick out what they want and need, and making sure they know what their protection options are. 

That said, the company is heading in a direction I don´t agree with. I'm bilingual and have a Bachelor's Degree, and I believe that, if by a year and a half you don´t like your job, switching, hopefully for better pay, is a good move. With that information, what are some options I should look at? As a note, commission is not important to me, I rather have a good wage and schedule consistency than work commission, just personal preference.",National_War_2956,1,1.0,1,1720995176,2024-07-14 22:12:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e3efzz/wanting_to_consider_a_roadmap/,7,2024
1e3eax2,Is my ego getting in the way?,"I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid, or perhaps have and ego that's inflated a bit more than it should be, but I came across a couple of positions that caught my interest. And the conversation that followed with my boss, kind of put me in a thought process where I'm less trusting than I usually am. 
At my current job, the culture/expectation is to communicate with your superior before applying for a job so they ""can advocate for you if they believe you're a good fit, or reel you in if they think you're not ready."" I have feelings about that in general, but elected ""when in Rome, be a Roman..."" The catch came is that when I had this discussion with my leader about the two positions I was interested in, I was told that I shouldn't apply for both positions otherwise it might burn professional bridges if I end up progressing to the end of the interview processes for both of them and ultimately have to choose option A or B. I explained that would be unfortunate indeed, but in a professional setting, short of me trying to game both positions into a bidding war, I wouldn't imagine it being a problem. And even stated that it hardly seemed practical as when I (or any other candidate for that scenario) applies for a position, we're not in a vacuum. Recruiters and hiring managers are not focusing on a single candidate from start to finish, but instead a slew of candidates until they narrow it down to who they want to make an offer to. To further that, if I get the last round of interviews to only not be selected and the other job I was interested in is closed, I'm basically up the creek. Whereas I feel I'd be able to better reconcile if I applied for both jobs, made it through the interview and ultimately wasn't selected. My boss said yea, ""but that's different and just how things are."" And gave me something about being a good ""partner"" in the company. Again, semantics like this have bothered me because it seems like a manipulation tactics, but I might be reading too much into it.
To be honest, I've long been unimpressed by my company and the politics. But this sort of continued to accentuate my feelings about the self serving behavior there is at my company, and that I might not be a good fit here in the long run. Do I need to pull my head out, or is this a potentially valid red flag? It overall feels like something isn't being shared, or veiled as something it isn't and bothers me more on what I believe to be principle than anything else.",domino7873,1,1.0,2,1720994828,2024-07-14 22:07:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e3eax2/is_my_ego_getting_in_the_way/,7,2024

1e3dexx,Should I find a job abroad as a Software Engineer for better pay,"So I'm 25 years old and from England/UK. Been a software engineer for about 2.5 years. I'd say I'm more advanced than most juniors and have been told by my team lead that I'm essentially mid level and he's very impressed with me. But I'm either lacking confidence or being honest with myself when I say I'm nothing special as a Software Engineer. I just pick up things quite quickly since I have good memory and decent pattern recognition. 

All this to ask, has anyone made the move from UK to US as a software engineer(pr possibly another country if anyone has any suggestions). Is it worth it financially? Like I've heard it pays a lot more in the US, but is that then counteracted by rent/taxes/car+fuel etc. In the UK I work remotely full time and therefore have no need for a car and live with my parents so practically 0 expenses. But i'm only on £34k/yr. Wondering if the move to US would be worth it. My sister is a lawyer moving to dubai on £54k/yr and she's 2 years younger so my family's kinda putting pressure on me to earn more money. In the UK, £54k after 2.5 years as a software engineer seems crazy to me besides maybe living in London and even then I doubt it.

1e3c9p7,"Is my boss allowed to force me (W2 employee, 0.5FTE) to take PTO when I call out sick?","I accrue PTO relatively slowly at my work, which I am hoping to save up for a vacation. I've been ill a few times this year and every time I call out sick, I leave that day off my time sheet because I would prefer to just have a smaller paycheck for that week and keep that PTO balance. However, my boss logs in and clocks me in as using PTO, subtracting from my balance for every day I call out sick. (Obnoxiously, a few times they have made me use 7.5 hours, which is how long the FTE shifts are, even though my shifts are only 6.25 hours, so it's disappearing even more rapidly). When I have asked my shift supervisor if I can just take unpaid time off next time I am sick, she says that's not how this works. Is this legal? If so, I will bite the bullet, but if not, I am thinking of talking to someone else in the chain for further clarification. If it's not okay for them to force me into utilizing PTO hours, should I bring this up with my program manager (head of a dept around ~100 people, she knows my name and face), payroll, HR, or someone else?

1e3bpqm,Got a PIP at work and I feel this is the end.,"27M. I did my MBA from a fairly reputed B-school in India, and graduated in April 2023. I got my current job through campus placements and joined in July 2023. 

The day I graduated, I faced a huge setback in my personal life which led me down a spiral and also affected my work. However, I do not want to blame that for my performance. Ever since I joined, I haven't been able to perform well enough. Others who joined with me are performing fairly well in their own roles. I've been scolded a few times by my CMO and my manager has also been disappointed with my performance. He says I've improved a lot since the beginning but I'm still not at the level I'm expected to be.

Last week I got a PIP which my manager had warned me about a week in advance. I won't say I didn't see it coming, but still this feels like a big jolt. My manager says this was an extreme step which he tried to fight against, but couldn't do anything.

The PIP is for two months, and if I fail to perform during these two months, I'll be put on notice period, which is 3 months. I've already started looking for other jobs, talking to my network, etc. 

My family's economic condition isn't great. I have an educational loan and my dad has a home loan and the EMIs amount to more than 70,000 per month collectively. He has a small business but that barely earns us anything. If it wasn't for me and my sister's incomes, we would be living in abject poverty. 

I can't afford to lose my job. I know I should focus on finding a new one and simultaneously performing at work to get the PIP revoked, but this whole situation has made me very suicidal. If I lose my job, I won't be able to provide for myself and my family anymore, and the whole point of my existence would be void. I'm trying my best in this situation but all I can think of is killing myself if I'm out of a job after 5 months.

1e3b18h,How do I know if I chose the right career path (art)?,"I'm a 4th year art acedemy student, and recently I doubt my career choice. My whole life I loved drawing and I was very good at it, everyone around was encouraging of me to persue this further, and I didn't even think about other career choices because that one was the most obvious to me. I study at academy for free because of my good art exams and I'm a 1 of 2 students who recieve a bunch of stipends for my excellent learning, however I have no friends there, because talking to other art students is extremely hard, the whole environment seems toxic and I feel used by my groupmates, I pushed myself out of the limits a lot to make friends, but it seems like we are just different people with different values in visual art. But because of that I was very unhappy and started to gain insecurities and thinking that it must be something wrong with me.
I was lucky to do an exchange program in design this year in a non-art related university. Design isn't really my proficiency but I got a chance to hang out with students from different brunches like medicine, engineering, business ect. I discovered that making friends is pretty easy, even though we are from completely different parts of the world and different brunches of study fields. All of my insecurities got away and I finally didn't feel like an imposter. I'm graduating next year and I feel totally alone in the art industry, I have no relatives there or friends who would support me, most of my groupmates take part in different projects and exhibitions, while I did none. I feel like art people tend to overcomplicate things, which leads to the very pessimistic way of living. I don't like to speak in abstract terms all the time, and fake it, buliding that mysterious persona around myself.  I still love painting, but I don't want to spent the rest of my live in environment of snobs who pretend to know everything and anything, and discuss made up concepts. I want to surround myself with real easygoing people and real healthy emotions, but I don't know how it's possible in that scenario. Maybe I sound too dramatic, but I feel like I'm just a wrong person for that community, though I still like the craft and I know how to do it, but not how to communicate it.   What do you think? Usually there are stories about quiet creative school kids who found themselves thriving in art colleges after all those years, but in my case it seems the opposite.",SosiskaKill2020,1,1.0,1,1720986098,2024-07-14 19:41:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e3b18h/how_do_i_know_if_i_chose_the_right_career_path_art/,7,2024

I currently work for a small company with fewer than 40 employees. My supervisor is leaving for a new position, making me the sole data analyst at the company.

1e39cg9,"After further review, the team has decided to pursue other canidates...","Hi, I am a young man from the Balkans (Europe) in my early/mid-twenties who has been unsuccessfully trying to enter the digital world for a long time. After finishing high school, I enrolled in college, but after some time, I realized it wasn't working out, so I dropped out and got a job. Over the next five years, I worked various jobs—from being an operator in a betting shop, administration, construction, waitering, etc. During this time, I went through the hardest moments of my life, losing both my parents within two years and overnight becoming the head of the family for my underage brother. Currently, I earn about 500 euros and really need 3-4 times that amount for a more normal life for me and him. I am currently working as an operator in a betting shop and honestly believe that after this, I am ready for any kind of work with people. I have seen everything—from the lowest to the richest status, placed their bets, solved account issues, handled complaints and criticisms, and learned how to react in every situation in the best interest of the company. I am also in contact with superiors regarding promotions, online betting, etc., so in a way, I have already done customer support and virtual assistant roles, just in a different way. I have been applying for these roles for months now and think I am aware of my problem. I haven't lied or made up any stories in my CV, and I believe that 90% of companies use ATS to screen CVs, rejecting me in the first round. I was brutally honest and explained my situation in detail in my cover letter, but now I assume my CV hasn't even reached HR many times. What are your tips? Do you know where to apply where I have the best chance of actually having an interview with a real person and potentially getting hired? Should I give up on this digital idea and leave the country until I earn enough money for a more comfortable life (which is my plan B)? Any comments are welcome below the post or in DM.

1e395ke,AITA for telling my boss I wasn’t comfortable cleaning the bathrooms after I had been flashed?,"     I’m going to post this to a couple different subreddits because I want to try to get multiple different opinions on this matter. These are all fake names for the sake that I don’t know if I can get in trouble for actually using names here so🤷🏼  it’s also my first post I’m usually a lurker so I’m so sorry if this is a mess


     So I (20f) worked at a university campus as a custodian for 11 months and would primarily clean bathrooms and got fired like three weeks ago because I told my boss I wasn’t comfortable cleaning the bathrooms anymore after having multiple issues with people not respecting my boundaries while doing my job. 


     There were two huge problems I had on top of the fact that people would just not care about the fact that the bathrooms were blockaded (I even have pictures of the blockades) and would use them anyways. I would use a cleaning cart and a large garbage can on wheels to block off both the men’s and women’s restroom entrances and I would alternate between both bathrooms by step and I had a magnetic strip that would hang in front of the door that said closed for cleaning so it would be obvious that the bathrooms are closed and not to be used but that wouldn’t stop people. 


     For example, one of the first big incidents I had happened in a single stall bathroom where I had everything blocked off and all of a sudden this little Hispanic lady walks in and starts speaking Spanish. I was completely caught off guard and uncomfortable because what was she doing coming into the single stall? It wasn’t like the bigger bathrooms where she could have used a stall and I unfortunately don’t speak Spanish and only know like key words and stuff so I told her no habla espanol so she would know that I don’t understand and I said it in English too hoping maybe she would understand and just didn’t speak English much but then she pointed to her hair and said bonita. I realized she was talking about my hair because I had worn a long green wig for the day after St. Patrick’s day for fun and I said thank you and gracias which then she came up and started TOUCHING MY HAIR!!!!! 


     It made me super uncomfortable and I kinda froze up and she eventually just left after talking a little bit and I called my boss and told him immediately. There wasn’t much he could do because she didn’t work in the same department I guess as us is the best way to describe it. 


     I was super nervous about it and I found out she lives in my damn apartment complex so that’s why she thought it would be okay which I don’t understand that at all since like I said I don’t speak Spanish and she doesn’t speak English so we aren’t exactly friends (we’ve never interacted before this). I just don’t think that you should touch people you’ve never had a conversation with, language barrier or not. 


     We’ve had other issues since like her wanting me to transfer her clothes to the dryer💀but nothing exactly at work and that’s another story but the other incident that really made me uncomfortable and had crossed the line for me was that I was cleaning some of the bigger bathrooms and they’re usually just right across from each other so it’s pretty easy to block them both off no problem. I went to the women’s to wipe something and went to go to the men’s to do the same thing in there and I walked in and there was a dude using the urinal and I saw his d*ck.🧍


     I immediately turned around and walked out and then said something to him. He just laughed and said “oh sorry haha I just had to go to the bathroom” which doesn’t make sense because there were multiple other bathrooms nearby; if he had taken the elevator that was 20 paces away and gone up or down he would have been at a different bathroom. I was so upset and honestly scared for my safety. 


     I know that some people may not understand this feeling but I had the worst feeling in my gut that something more could have happened and I decided that was the last straw for me. I told them I don’t feel comfortable working in the bathrooms anymore and would be willing to do whatever else I just wanted to work in a different area. At that point I had worked on the bathrooms for 9 months with no complaints. 


     I told them I would do dusting, vacuuming, glass/windows, classrooms, etc I just didn’t want to be in the bathrooms. I think they completely misunderstood me or didn’t actually take me seriously because at first they did what they said they would and had me help with a project in the dorms. 


     I had some small issues with that where my supervisors weren’t able to be present a lot of the time and I was one of the only ones with card access to that building since it was an all hands and people got pulled from other areas. It was tiring because of how busy it was but it was overall perfectly fine and much better than feeling unsafe in the bathrooms. 


     So the project finished up and they tell me that I can work in the library which I was super excited about because that’s what I’ve wanted to do with my career (I want to be a librarian) and that’s why I was working there in the first place; to get my degree for cheaper.     

     
     Well I found out quickly that they wanted me to do the bathrooms in the library which immediately made my heart sink because it felt like they just forgot about what happened but I knew they were short staffed so I agreed to just do the women’s rooms. I was still not comfortable with this considering the thing that happened with the woman coming into a single stall bathroom; gender didn’t matter to me, I overall didn’t feel comfortable. 


     I told my therapist that the campus was paying for (which was really nice don’t get me wrong she kinda just didn’t fit my needs unfortunately) since the flashing incident because they give short term therapy if something happens at work and she said that I should voice my concerns to them, so I decided that I would tell them how I felt if I got asked to do the men’s. 


     I did the women’s for about two weeks or so and then I got approached by my boss, we’ll call him Karl. Karl came up and asked me if I was just doing the women’s restrooms which I said I was, just like we had talked about. He then said he was told that I need to do both the men’s and women’s. I would like to clarify there was someone also doing the men’s and he was aware of my situation and didn’t mind doing them from what I knew. 


     I told him I wasn’t comfortable doing that and he sighed and said he was worried I’d say that; which keep in mind I was on the phone with another coworker because he had just had a conversation with her and we were talking about it, so I had someone who heard this conversation. He then looked at me all confused and said “I thought you wanted to do the women’s rooms”like huh🤨I got a little upset and had said that I didn’t feel comfortable in any of the bathrooms and started to shake a little and I still don’t know if he noticed that but I think it was obvious I was upset. 


     Karl said that he would make some phone calls and that he would be back which then I asked if my coworker heard and found out she had another coworker there and they both heard it. Karl came back and said that this was over his head and that I should call Hector (another supervisor who is directly above Karl). So I told them I would call them back and I went to call Hector. 


     We ended up having a pretty positive conversation from what I thought where he said that the men’s rooms would be temporary (two weeks most likely) and had in general made me feel better about it. I agreed that I could do it if it’s temporary and I wanted a partner with me. He said that he could make that work. I thought we had come to an agreement. 


     I then called my boyfriend to vent a little before I was going to call the HR lady and the other supervisor who is two ranks above Hector since Karl and Hector had both suggested it. I was going to call them and when I walked out of the bathroom to get a different rag I ended up seeing both of them together. I was kinda confused and a little nervous but I asked if I could talk to them and they said they were actually there for me. 


     At that point I was so scared but I went with them into a meeting room in the library which then I recorded the conversation; I’ve recorded almost every conversation I’ve had concerning these issues for my protection. They just said that after assessing my performance that it’s just not a good fit and that they were firing me. 


     Mind you it had been three days after my six month probation period had ended and I had just recently had my half year assessment (I did 5 months part time 6 months full time) and there was nothing wrong with my performance at that meeting. I just sat there shocked for a little bit since I thought this was going to go a completely different direction and I told them that it was pretty messed up. We hadn’t even been able to talk yet and they made a decision to fire me within ten to twenty minutes. 


     I had tried to keep going even though I was really uncomfortable and they were letting me go over it. He then once again said that it just wasn’t a good fit and I asked him why and he wouldn’t answer me. I asked him why three times and he just dodged my questions. I then was told that I would be escorted out which was really insulting too because it’s a public library despite it being on a college campus. I felt like that was unnecessary. 


     I then ran almost literally into the two coworkers I was on the phone with earlier and just broke down. I felt so lost and broken because they wouldn’t even give me an actual reason as to why. I cried with them until my boyfriend came and picked me up and now I’m just so confused. 


     Is that worthy of firing me? Are they legally allowed to not give me a real reason for termination? Now I realistically don’t have any options to go to school and it’s terrifying. I wanted to appeal it at first but I don’t really know if it’s worth it or if I’d actually even want to go back anymore.

1e37tmb,Making a life changing decision and I need your help!,"I'm at a cross roads here. This is about choosing between a good enough university versus a chance at a business school in India. This post is a long one folks!  
  
I got into Edinburgh Business School's MSc Marketing program. I can apply for a visa and go there right now, or prepare for CAT, GMAT and shoot my shot for a business schools in India (IITs, MICA, ISB and the like).   
  
Here are the pros and cons of both choices:  
The good thing about going for Edinburgh business school is that, I have an accepted offer, it is a reputed university and getting a visa isn't super difficult for UK. The bad things about it are the sub-par curriculum, and faculty.

The good thing about the Indian business schools is that they have incredible curriculum, faculty, equally reputed and are of 2 years. The bad thing about them is obviously being in India (read further why its so bad for me), the possibility of not scoring well in CAT, GMAT and not getting the international exposure.

There is a third option of applying for January intake in UK but if the curriculum is same as Edinburgh business school, I don't see a difference between going now and going then.

To give a bit of context, I've been trying for universities since last year. I wanted to focus on universities out of India because of my sexuality but, even overseas tensions appear to be rising. 

Academically, I'm interested in marketing, advertising, sales, business and negotiating. My interests narrow the programs down to marketing or an MBA (hence studying for CAT). The difficult thing is, being unemployed. I tried working and applying to universities at the same time. I could not cope with the stress (agency copywriter). I've been unemployed for a year now, and it feels like slow death at this point. Giving those exams and waiting for results, and possibility of being rejected all over again just feels like torture. 

I'm 23, meaning this is my first time making life altering decisions. I could really use some help from experienced folks out there. Any advice, please!

We deal with a lot of financial transactions on a regular basis.  One of my younger employees is very good and I already rely on her heavily and consider her to be ""key"" despite her age.

The problem is I have suspected that she may spend time with unsavory characters outside work.

We are a small community and based on my past connections to law enforcement and other circles, I recognized him as a known drug dealer (and verified afterwards) with ties to individuals who have committed violent acts including murder.

I studied at home while preparing for competitive exams. Last year, I completed my BSc (I was preparing for NEET) and now I've changed my path due to my failure. I prepared for CAT and now I want to go into the banking sector. The problem is that my documented age is 19, but in reality, I am 21.

So, I took admission in MSc and passed the B.Ed exam, where I got selected. But I really don't want this; my father insisted, and I thought it was better to do something than nothing. Right now, I am preparing for exams in my mind, but in reality, I am just watching web series. I know I am wasting my time, but I thought I am not eligible right now.

By the way, last year in 2023, I took the CAT and scored 88 percentile. and in xat 85%ile

So, I am totally confused right now. For the last 3 months, I have been doing nothing, spending my whole day in my room with no contact with society. In February and March, I attended some interviews, got selected in a few, and waitlisted in the rest.

So yeah, I am confused, alone, and wasting my time. Please give me some suggestions on what to do next. It will be really helpful for me.

1e35ft9,How do you deal with the guilt of eliminating jobs?,"I led a project that successfully automated a process that eliminated 8 full-time positions. Initially, which is about 8 months ago, we were told that the displaced employees will be transferred to another area; however, a month ago, above site mandated that any positions that's made redundant by process automation will be eliminated due to cost-cutting initiative that's rolled out by corporate. 

I made the argument that the project plan to move the employees to another area were already approved and that we already spent the time to cross-train them during the transition period so they could be effective right away in their new areas. But apparently the policy is effective retroactively to all on-going projects.

I feel so mad about it and there's nothing I can do. I really think they're making a mistake here. The change management plan I had in place ensured the safety of their jobs within the company, and they were heavily involved with the knowledge transfer necessary to automate the process.

Any automation efforts after this will be met with pushback and will take forever to complete.

I can't really give out too much details, but here's some context: due to the manual nature of the process, the performance efficiency is 48% and it was a huge bottleneck in the value stream. After the automation, the performance efficiency went up to 87% and the OEE went from 51% to 72% based on initial analysis.

1e33s1n,Cracking Private Equity. ,"I graduated from Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode, which is one of the top 10 b-schools in India, in 2022. 

I’ve been working in JP Morgan Chase, since then, in Investment Banking Credit Risk. I cover a portfolio of companies in diversified industries and have had exposure to multiple LBO, M&A, JV and Carveout deals.  I have analysed 100s of financial statements, built dozens of financial models and have plenty of experience conducting due diligence where I understand the business in depth for said deals.  

I really want to crack into PE as even though I’m honing my business acumen and analytical skills here, the work outcomes is driven solely to mitigate risk and documentation for regulators. I want to create value and build my capacity to identify opportunities as this aligns with my long term goals which is to learn how to deploy capital effectively.  

Any advice to crack PE in India (or elsewhere in the world if feasible) would be greatly appreciated.

1e33ntl,Should I Take a Lower Paying Job with a Utility Company for Better Work Environment and Career Growth?,"I am considering a potential position with a major utility company that might offer slightly less pay than my current role but represents a significant positive shift from my current company.

Currently, I work for a firm contracted by a larger utility company, earning a $110K base salary plus a 5-10% bonus. I lead a team of eight engineers, each with about two years of experience. Over my three years with the company, I have developed a strong reputation and leadership recognition. Recently, my base salary was increased from $100K to $110K as I took on the role of Professional Engineer, responsible for signing engineering documents (though I initially requested $120K).

Despite my achievements, there has been considerable turnover within my program, and my departure would significantly impact the company due to my strong client relationships and high-quality work. My current boss, the third one I have had, exhibits erratic behavior that complicates my work environment.

The new position offers a modern office and a more pleasant work environment. However, it would involve fewer responsibilities as an individual contributor with no direct reports. The work itself is interesting, and I believe it could offer more learning opportunities than my current role, where I feel stagnant due to the lack of experienced colleagues.

The hiring manager indicated that an offer is forthcoming, and I am trying to decide if I should accept an estimated $100K offer. Balancing a potentially lower salary against a better work environment and growth prospects is challenging.

1e33arn,Mistakes in thank-you email and stressing. What are your opinions?,"I went in for an interview last week and spoke with the hiring manager directly. He was super nice, easy-going, and we had a great conversation. He liked my experience and said I would be a great fit for a different (better) role that he had available, so I was put in the pool for that one and had a follow-up interview with some of the team this past Tuesday. I then had a third interview with another panel of different team members on Thursday. On Friday morning I typed up three different thank-you emails to send to the hiring manager, second group, and third group. After reading and revising and re-reading multiple times, I sent them off.

To my absolute horror, I realized that I spelled the hiring managers name incorrectly (transposed the A and the E in his name). I then realized in a post-script I had written that I had omitted the letter U from the word thought.

To make matters worse, the email to the third panel had a grammatical error because I had revised and forgot to remove a letter, so it now reads, ""you have a both a wonderful team..."".

I realized after the fact that the notepad app I typed the emails in had spellcheck disabled; otherwise I would have easily caught the latter two mistakes. Additionally, I was asked in both the HM and third panel interviews how I thought my writing abilities are.

I've been so stressed the past couple of days. Everything on the internet says not to worry too much about the name thing... but I feel like a fool. I don't feel like hope is completely lost, because like I said, the HM was so nice and we had a great connection. But still.

What are your opinions on this situation?

1e330jw,Struggling with grief and workplace toxicity in luxury retail store - Should I stay full-time or switch to part-time time while searching for a new job?,"I work in a luxury retail store and get paid $22/hour (no commission). This is around $5 above the minimum wage of the province I live in. I started working there part-time while I was a student studying HR in university. 

During my last semester, I only had 1 class, and instead of looking for an internship, I was convinced by my managers to switch to full-time. I am in a very hard financial situation, and I'm sure they know this. I have since graduated around 6 months ago, and a lot has happened. 

My dad, who has struggled with alcoholism, suddenly passed away 2 months ago. This has been very traumatic for me. I used up my vacation and sick hours and took around 3 paid weeks off. Since coming back, I haven't been able to focus on work, and my sales have gone down. I haven't made my monthly goal the past 2 months.

The pressure to make my monthly goals has always been hard but it's been harder recently. They also changed the bonus structure. Now, the store has to make the overall goal but if you don't reach your individual goal, you dont get bonus. If the store doesn't reach the overall goal, you don't get bonus even if you reached your individual goal

Ever since they changed the bonus structure they have been pressuring all of us even more. During the last fiscal year when I transitioned from part-time to full-time, I made over $1 million in sales. This is the goal for full-timers. I am also one of the more ""senior"" sales associate. My managers keep bringing this up to try to encourage me to meet my sale goals but it's only been stressing me out even more. 

Since returning to work, I have had to leave work early or take unpaid days off multiple times because I broke down crying and couldn't keep working. My managers keep asking me what they can do to help me while I'm grieving, but than they'll pressure/question me the very same day on why I'm not meeting my sale goal.

This led me to have a total breakdown when my manager tried to give me a pep talk to increase my sales. I started crying and I basically went off on my assistant-manager. I felt like they were doubting my worth, I told her the sale goals were stupid and I dont give a shit about the numbers, I also told her she has favorites since she made the other full-timer's goals lower than mine (we're the only 2 full timers). I left work early that day and I sent management an email saying I don't want to make sales anymore and to switch me from sales associate to stockroom associate. 

The next time I came to work I had a meeting with the store manager and told him the same thing but in a more tamer way. We talked it out and he told me there was not an open position for stockroom associate. So I instead asked him to switch me back to part-time sales associate (I can't afford to work part-time but at that point I was so over it). He tried to convince me by using the benefits (only full timers get benefits). He told me therapy would help me for grief and that it was 100% covered but I checked later and it's covered at 80% up to $350 per calendar year. I don't even know if this would be practical for me or if I could afford it even with the benefits. Anyway because i was still hesitating he gave me a week to think about it before I make a decision. 

This leads me to the most recent events. I was telling one of my co-worker everything that happened. During one part of our conversation we basically joked around and said if we can't make bonus than nobody can and that we hoped the store doesn't make goal at all. I guess we were a bit loud, but aother co-worker, let's call her A,  overheard us and went to the managers and told them that I was saying all this. Management basically called me into the office and gave me an official warning not to make jokes that 
 undermine the store and brand as a whole and what it stands for. They made me sign a paper and sent me an email about the warning to have the paper trail. 

Co-worker A has hated me since day 1 for no reason. She basically bullied me the first few months I started working there and has made me cry multiple times in the beginning but I stuck through because of the pay. Eventually she warmed up to me and I even went to her birthday a few weeks ago and gave her a gift and everything. She's a few years older than me, has been in university for almost 10 years now wasting her time and her parent's money. They pay for everything for her (they literally got her a house) and she is basically a spoiled ungrateful brat. For some reason she's convinced that management wants to promote me into a managing position. This is totally not true and nor do I want to become a manager in this toxic/stressfull environment. 

Despite my breakdown and the warning, my managers are still letting me help in the hiring process for this year's seasonal sales associates because they know I studied in HR and that I enjoy doing it. This has aggravated A even more and I always catch her trying to eavesdrop on conversations I have with other co-workers. For example, during my last shift a co-worker who just started working at our store told me she was getting scheduled 40 hours even though she is a part-timer and that it was stressing her out. I told her to just let management know, to not be scared and that this is not her forever job so she shouldn't take it too seriously. Co-worker A kept glancing at us and now I'm scared on how she's going to twist the story to management if she heard us. I constantly feel monitored/watched by her and it's really triggering for me because I had stalker a few years back and it reminds of that time. It's been especially worse the past 2 months. She's super nosey and constantly asks other co-workers why I suddenly took 3 weeks off (only management and a selected few trusted co-workers know that my dad passed away).

Anyway I don't know what to do and would just like some advice. My 2nd meeting with my manager to make my decision is in a few days.

If I stay full-time: 

PROS

-I'll be able to more financially support my mom, younger brother and I (this is a huge factor for me, my dad left us a lot of debt). 

-I'll also be more likely to get therapy since it's partially covered which might help my mental health.  

CONS

-I have less time and energy to apply to for jobs in my field. It will also be harder to schedule interviews when I'm working 40 hours

-I'll also have to keep working with co-worker A who is basically out to get me and makes the workplace more toxic than my managers do. Thinking about her monitoring me has literally made me lose sleep the past few days. 

If I become part-time: 

PROS: 

-I'll have more time to look for and apply for jobs in my field. But I don't know how long it would take me to get my first big girl job.

-I'll also see co-worker A less and be less involved in the toxic environment she and my managers have created, which I think will be good for my mental health.

CONS

-I won't be able to financially support my family as much as I can as a full-timer.

- I can't afford to be part-time for long and the job market is really bad right now. I don't know how long it would take to get my first HR job.

1e320sj,Is this normal culture for a startup?,"I would like some advice. I've been working at a startup for the past 4 months and it's literally me and this one guy. The CEO and CTO have also known my coworker for over 6 years so there's the three of them and then me. 

Since starting my coworker has said some sexist comments to me including that I should flirt with clients to get sales, and that he doesn't believe in the pill or abortions. He also always comments on my appearance, especially when I don't wear makeup in the office and says that ""male scientists won't know how to react when I talk to them"". I worked hard for my degree and it just feels really degrading. For context I've attached a message he sent me with context.

I also wanted to do some things at the company for Pride Month and he said that he hates the LGBTQ community because he thinks it's just a ""scheme to make money"". He also makes me super uncomfortable, he gets way too close to me and constantly winks at me. I've told him I feel uncombable and he continues to do it. He also thinks that everyone who protests for Palestine is a communist and that what's happening in Palestine isn't a genocide. 

I've tried to talk to my boss about it (the CEO) but he completely dismisses it because he's known him for a long, though my boss has also made some politically not-so-great comments including that you can ""buy anything in Asia"" and refers to every Asian as a collective for example ""Asians like business cards"". Maybe I am being overly sensitive about this, so I would really like your thoughts about it. I've said to the coworker I don't want to discuss anything political but he still find a way to make these comments.

I'm a new graduate and literally don't have any money or family to fall back on so I'm kind of stuck in this job. I really don't know what to do because there isn't a HR and again the three of them are super close. I get that everyone has their own opinion and they're entitled to be different to mine but this just feels like it takes the piss. I grew up with a mum with BPD and I've struggled since to know what are normal reactions/interactions and what's not.

1e319uu,Disliked at Every Workplace ,"I'm disliked at every workplace. The moment I arrive, I'm assumed to be a lazy, incompetent slacker based on my appearance (I have long platinum blonde hair and I'm young). 

At my last job, I had an older male employee tell me I 'look like a slacker' straight to my face, while openly joking that I'm probably arrive to work intoxicated. And this is supposed to be a professional office environment. 

One older lady said ""she won't last long at that job"" when she thought I could not hear her. 

Being treated like a moron 24/7 (when had even more relevant education and experience than coworkers) is extremely frustrating and demoralizing. So I feel this urge to ""prove myself"" and demonstrate they made the right decision to hire me. 

The problem is that overworking and trying ""too hard"" is a surefire way to become the office pariah. If you work through lunch, arrive early, stay late, and make others 'look bad' you will be hated by coworkers or rewarded with more work by management. 

I feel like I'm trapped in a lose-lose situation. Even when I had brown hair, people still treated me like a moron and talked down to me from the second I arrived at the workplace. However, ""trying too hard"" and outshining others makes me absolutely HATED by lateral coworkers. I even brought in candies and donuts to work, and one of my coworkers was SOO angry about it. He accused me of sucking up to management and was very hostile towards me. He would report me if I arrived ONE minute late to work, when him and his friends sauntered in up to 40 minutes late on a daily basis....but of course no one cares about that. The double standards were the most frustrating part.

So, my desired path was to pursue Bsc Hons Biochemistry (Hopefully from University of Delhi, hopefully because results are impending) and then proceed with Msc Biotech or Bioinformatics in Europe (and I think this is a good point to mention that I will be relying on scholarships for that because I don't have any hefty funds). 

But I started questioning if it will be the best choice to earn good. Another alternative that I could muster (and find interest in) is B Pharm + M Pharm. Most of the people I've talked to from this industry say Pharma is far better than Biotech and that B Pharm I can do from any college but M Pharm from a good one. 

I also plan on doing MBA while I work after my masters (for either course). I'm good with studies, I like studying but highest paying sector (and job within that sector) is my ultimate objective.

I've researched A LOT, and asked SO MANY people, but I cannot decide, it comes to a stand still with equal amount of pros and cons with both. And maybe searching so much is clouding my judgement but this is my last shot. What do you suggest?

1e2wlq1,Stuck in a dead-end job in the Finance Industry in India,"Hello,

I am currently working in an Insurance PSU in India and I want to relocate to the UK/Canada/Australia within the next 2 years. I have experience in IT for 2.5 as a manual tester and thein around 6.5 years in General Insurance in the PSU. I am working in middle management as of now. I have no education loans but have recently bought an apartment and have hefty EMIs for that reason.

Can anyone suggest what path would be best to take so that I can land a job abroad? I would want to go for permanent residency in my target country eventually. I am 31 years of age.

1e2u42b,Seeking Advice on Moving Abroad for Work as a Product Analyst ,"
Hi everyone,

I’m currently working as a Product Analyst for a leading SaaS company and have 4.5 years of experience in IT. I’m planning to move to another country for a couple of years to earn money (obviously).

I’m just starting to explore my options and don’t have much knowledge about potential destinations. Dubai is on my mind, but I’m open to suggestions.

Which countries would you recommend for someone with my background? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!

1e2u320,Should I quit my second job? ,"Looking to the thread for advice on if I should quit my second job. A bit about me.. I used to work part-time at a bank, working 20 hours a week/$20 per hour with an evening job as a server for min. wage ($10.30/hour + tip pool share) with varying hours per week (around 14-25). The serving job paychecks have ranged from $500-$1100 at the highest. The bank was super comfortable, checks being around $800, easy-peasy work, but definitely not my permanent calling.

I recently started a new, full time job (8a-5p) that is $27.30/hour at 40 hours a week. This is the most I have ever made in a job, and I have no idea what to expect my paychecks to look like after taxes. For some added context, I won't have a full paycheck until the first or second week of August.

I'm also a student, who used to be full-time in-person student. but am now moving to part-time online due to this new job. I already have a bachelors + certificate, so I'm only continuing in school to get an added Associate's under my belt (more context: received nearly a full-ride scholarship for this - woot!)

I also have about $3,600 in credit card debt to pay off, which starts accumulating interest in mid-August. Aside from that, I have a family loan to pay off totaling $3000. I've been working various second jobs for almost two years now to payoff my debt and become debt free - I've knocked out almost $8000 over this time, and only have a little bit more to go.

This leads me to my dilemma. Should I keep working full-time at my new job and keep my second job until my debt is paid off? The con with this is that I will likely be incredibly burnt out and busy, and this is without even considering school starting back up at the end of August. Or, is it reasonable to think that I will be able to pay off my debt in a reasonable manner with only the main gig?

Some extra context.. my monthly bills (rent, electric, car insurance, etc.) sit around $1000-$1100 before groceries are factored in. 

Personally, I think I need to quit my second job, even considering how fun it can be and that the extra money has been greatly helpful. I also have to factor in the fact that because it's my second job, I pay extra in taxes and with reduced hours, a great portion of my check may go straight out the door to Uncle Sam.",Sad_Ad5130,3,0.8100000023841858,1,1720933204,2024-07-14 05:00:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e2u320/should_i_quit_my_second_job/,7,2024

1e2rj34,My new workplace is boring,"Hi, I just finished my first month at a new company as a content marketeer. I love my job. I’m good at it as well and I work hard. My boss knows that. He acknowledges that as well. 

But the office is boring. I have about 4 colleagues and 3 of them are developers. The (only) other woman is marketing as well. They’re nice. At least, I can only tell during lunch break.

No one talks, everyone has headphones on. I am someone that prefers a social break in between hours just to get my mind off the work. But when everyone has their headphones on for 8 hours a day, it’s not exactly inviting to start a small conversation. I understand, they’re here to work. But the lack of social contact drains me. And to be honest, I looked for a job to get more in contact with people and get inspired.

My job requires me to be creative. But the environment is all but creative. It makes me dull. 

My solution is to work from home 1 day a week. I work 4 days a week and I would still like to come to the office. The commute isn’t bad, a max. of 45 minutes. But the traffic drains me.

My questions here:
1. How do I stay creative in such an environment? I do want to keep going to the office for 3 days.
2. How do I tell my boss that? I’m mostly anxious about his response. No one really works from home. But some days I can’t bear to be in the office because it drains my creativity.

1e2q73e,Take a pay cut for “career progression”?,"I’m probably gonna get a lot of scrutiny for this but here goes…

I’m a remote worker. I make $180k base plus bonus which works out to be around $50k, and I get $35k in stocks every year. I am allowed to cash out roughly $15k worth of stocks each year. I get a premium company car that I’m allowed to use for personal use, unlimited mileage, gas card and they replace my car with a brand new one every 3 years.

Having said that, I have pretty much plateaued in this role. If I want career progression, I have to take on a role that would require me to commute to the office 3x/week (1 to 1.5 hours each way due to traffic). They would also take away my corporate vehicle which I’d consider a pay cut given how much people spend on car, gas and insurance these days. These roles may offer same salary or less.

Should I just be content in my situation? I don’t know if I can do this until I retire. I’m only 40. Part of me feel like I should take on a head office role regardless of pay cut to take me to the “next step” and part of me feel that I should just be content and be thankful that I get to spend a lot of time with my family (I have 2 toddlers).

1e2pfrn,How to Convey My Role and Experience Accurately on Job Applications,"Hi everyone,

I’m a Senior Marketing Manager currently facing a bit of a dilemma and would appreciate some guidance. In our marketing department, we have 4 other managers and a Vice President, but no directors. Over the past 18 months, our VP has tried multiple times to fill the director position without success.

As the only senior manager, I have the most experience and am considered the most reliable by the VP. Consequently, I have taken on most, if not all, of the director-level responsibilities, including Budget Management, Marketing Strategy Development, Professional Development

Despite performing these duties, I do not hold the director title. This creates a challenge because, on paper, I lack the formal experience typically associated with a director role, even though I am effectively doing the job.

My question is, how can I best convey this on job applications and to recruiters? I want to ensure my actual experience and the responsibilities I handle are accurately represented, even without the official title.

1e2p4qh,"Is it possible for the 'regular Joe' to make a career leap into one of the Fortune 500 tech companies? (Marketing, PM, etc.)","Hi, just something I wanted to bounce off people. How realistic is it for the 'average' Joe, someone working in regular small scale local companies, to be able to make a leap into one of the big tech companies - let's say Amazon, Microsoft, Google into any of their roles?

  
I'm not sure what the requirements are for tech, however I come from a very humble marketing background. I couldn't get a formal degree, let alone a masters, as my finances and family situation didn't allow it at the time. I went the apprenticeship route (UK) where I worked for three years at a local start up digital agency, which has grown substantially and has provided to be a very intense however proactive in regards to learning. 

Since then, I have had a few career hiccups - short breaks due to burn out,  covid etc. However have managed to land a few digital marketing roles in solid but somewhat small and unimpressive ( on the global scale ) companies. Life, cost of living and everything else in-between has impacted my career growth substantially, and I have found myself unemployed just about 8 months ago. 

I have been working on upskilling through google certificates etc. to improve my employability prospects, however, I am finding I'm extremely pessimistic about being able to take my career anywhere special. I feel discouraged about being able to get a job at a 'proper' large organisation, that will not chew me up and spit me back out for average pay. 

I dream of being able to find a position in a company that would really propel my work ambitions, I see people getting all these fancy internships at companies such as Google, Hubspot, or Amazon that truly define and propel their professional careers, but I just really don't see how I would have the opportunity to do that without a formal, exceptional educational background from some fancy university. 

I suppose what I am asking is, should I be more realistic and accept that the big fancy corporate opportunities are just not made for me, or strive higher ?",Key_Image2625,0,0.5,4,1720916759,2024-07-14 00:25:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e2p4qh/is_it_possible_for_the_regular_joe_to_make_a/,7,2024

However, around March 2024, a company had reached out and encouraged me to apply to one of their full time jobs. I wanted something to do over the summer that would give me money and experience to put on my resume so I applied and I got the full time offer. I started in June. The only thing is that its not something in the field that I want or related to computer sciene/tech at all. The pay is decent but it's not something I'd want to stay in. I've been looking for fall internships that are more related to the path that I want to pursue but I've been a little hesitant to apply since I just started this job. I had 2 questions: 

  
1. Should I put my current job on the resume when I apply to internships? I ask this because its my first corporate experience, I haven't had any prior internships before this, so I was thinking it would add more to my resume. Yes, it's not related to computer science/tech but its at a well known company and I have measurable impact. The thing is recruiters would see that I just started a full time job in June and now I'm suddenly applying for internships so would that be a red flag? 

  
2. I'm kinda scared of what would happen if I somehow get an internship, quit my current job, and then after the internship ends, I'm struggling to find a full time job. I was lucky in that this job kinda fell in my lap, but again the pay is ok, not related to the field, and if I were to try to get into the field that I wanted without any internships and only this job experience, I don't know if I'll get anything. So its a gamble with the same ending, but still I'm a little unsure and wonder if I'm being to hasty.

1e2jiib,Managing living and working in two different cities - open to advice," Last week, I started a new job in Seattle; I live in Portland. It's a contract position through a third-party contractor (not an employment agency), and it's loosely for two years—project-based. I am expected to be in the office Monday - Wednesday and remote at home Thursday and Friday. Eventually, I am expected to ""relocate"" or transition to Seattle to be in the office five days a week using their relocation funds.

I am driving to and from; I booked a couple of flights using airline credit (August)  and have accommodations for the next three weeks. I plan to get a small rental when I have to be there five days a week and return home on the weekends. 

I took this job because I was laid off from my last position in December, and despite my full-time job search, including networking, etc, I had no other offers. This was it, so I took it. 

I don't want to move to Seattle permanently because:

* I know too many people who moved for a job and were laid off or let go before they unpacked.
* The cost of living is higher in Seattle than in Portland.
* My husband and I don't want to give up our rental; we won't be able to find anything similar to what we have.
* I have a chronic illness and have a great medical team in Portland. I don't want to start over.

I am curious to hear others' experiences with living and working in two different cities, and I am open to hearing about other options.

But I'm starting to find myself going in a loop about the new offer, wondering if I'm actually equipped for the role, or thinking about ""what ifs"" such as the new company being worse than the current one.

Everyday at work, I think about how much I don't want to be there. But now that the exit opportunity is in my face, I almost feel like I'm getting cold feet/some type of Stockholm syndrome. 

I'm taking the weekend to go over the offer, and weigh the pros and cons. I do think, ultimately, there's not benefit at staying in my current position aside from familiarity.

1e2g5mh,Should I Lie About Having Another Job Offer?,"I've seen some similar posts that had a mix of opinions which is what I'm looking for, but wanted to share my specific situation to get peoples thoughts.

I've been unemployed for over a year. I've talked to a company multiple times over the past 2 months. All good conversations. The person I would report to said he and his boss (the decision makers) are both on board, but they can't make me an offer yet because they're still figuring some things out internally. He didn't provide a lot of detail other than they don't even have a job description put together, he doesn't have approval from HR yet and doesn't even know what their budget is. There was never a job posting, I was just sending my resume out to companies and they responded saying they might be looking for someone with my background at some point this year.

The hiring manager made me promise to let him know if I got another job offer and he would see if he could push things along with HR and get me an offer. He said he doesn't want to lose me to someone else. I don't want to lose momentum with them or have them post the job and then have hundreds of people to compete with. Obviously I know there's a risk, but do you think I should say I received another job offer to push them to move things along? I mean, what's the real downside, if they can't move forward then I'm right back where I am now anyways.

I don't love the idea of lying but he could just as easily be lying to me. Of course he said they were talking to other people about the role, without ever having a job posted or recruiter involved. It's all just negotiating tactics and trying to create leverage at the end of the day. I did tell him I was talking to other groups and had a final round interview coming up, which is all true. But the company I had a final round with ended up putting the position on hold.

It sounded like they just aren't ready to pull the trigger because of internal bureaucracy stuff, so I did mention to him something about getting an offer with a delayed start date in it and he seemed pretty interested in that idea, but still not able to do anything yet. This is a larger company, so I'm not sure all of the hoops they have to jump through with HR. I feel like if I don't try to push things forward, they'll just sit, delay, post the job, etc.

Thoughts, ideas, suggestions, advice?

1e2fr0m,"Is it a smart move to leave when you're thoroughly burnt out, but have no job offer in hand?","As a preface: I work in India.

My patience is wearing thin with my current role. I've just been here for 7 months, but every single day is a struggle. I handle 80+ people, and everything is on fire. People don't give a SHIT because they're all on third-party payroll and it doesn't matter to them if the company is up in flames or not. So no matter how many times you beg and plead for them to do their job, they slack off. Then I found out 3 out of 5 of my merchandisers and one out of two team leaders of mine are involved in some fraudulent practices and they might be fired.

The company is in such a bad condition, the CEO resigned (although it could be possible she was fired too). Everyone wants to just leave because we work at least 18 hours a day and the needle doesn't move. People are just waiting to get a new job and that's the only reason they stay here. Every meeting is just people blaming each other and half of the time I'm in literal tears when I'm on mute. In the past 7 months, I've not had one good day. I constantly sleep at 3AM and wake up to people blowing up my phone because there is some fresh hell that someone has released. I'm in retail so I can't have a peaceful weekend either. I've started feeling dizzy every now and then, blanking out, feeling empty.

My manager and his manager both know I hate it here, that I am burnt out and I can't even drag myself out of bed sometimes. They also know I'm not meant to be in this profile considering my background and that I'm meant for a more senior role. They just hired me thinking things wouldn't be this bad but this year, shit hit the fan and it feels like the more I try to help by doing the right things, the more I drown in extra work and nobody wants to help. By now, I've kind of accepted this mindset of accepting shit people say to my face and accepting that I have to do their work because no one wants to hear that I want their help with something. I'm supposed to work everything out on my own. If I ask for help, people say, ""Listen, I can't do this for you. You have to manage at your regional level.""

I can't seem to get any opportunities coming my way, and even when I look at opportunities on job boards, I don't see anything relevant. There are too many roles that have been open for months, so clearly, they're not hiring actively for these roles. But if I stay here any longer, I will have a meltdown at work. I switched off my phone in the evening today because it's a Saturday and I was really REALLY tired of the shitty news I got in the morning and didn't want to deal with anything anymore. I'm dreading switching it on and finding like 20 missed calls from people calling to complain or ask about status updates.

I have financial responsibilities that I'm scared for if I quit and can't find work in the three months that I will be on notice period. This fear is the only thing holding me back from quitting. But working here is going to severely hurt me. I feel like I'm paying for this company with my own soul.",dimpld9,0,0.5,8,1720891428,2024-07-13 17:23:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e2fr0m/is_it_a_smart_move_to_leave_when_youre_thoroughly/,7,2024

1e2ef5a,How to inform new job that I have a pre-booked trip two weeks after my start date?,"
Hi everyone! Looking for some advice on how to navigate this situation as I'm really new to all of this and unsure what to do.

This week I got my first office job after a significant time being unemployed. Prior to this I worked in retail for around eight years. After job searching for the last six months, this whole process has moved so quickly and I'm still a bit shocked to be where I am right now.


Sent my cover letter and resume to a health admin position that seemed really interesting, not expecting to hear back and got a call for a phone interview the day after the application deadline. I was very upfront with explaining the gap in my employment and luckily this wasn't an issue at all. 
At the end I got asked if I had a notice period from any current employment. I told them I didn't and was available at the earliest convenience for them. The process after that went: In person interview two days later, provided my reference details, got told I would hear from them by next week at the latest as they were looking to make a decision soon.

I left and two hours later got a call from the hiring manager asking for my feedback on the interview and how I thought everything went. They followed this up saying they'd love to have me join the team and gave an official employment offer. I was really surprised and excited, and accepted the offer. Since I was happy with the starting rate they offered (it was very competitive) I didn't ask to negotiate any details. We started discussing start dates and since I was available set my first day of training for the next morning. My contract and letter of employment was emailed to me that afternoon so I could read over everything and go through it with them at the start of my shift if I was still happy to proceed. 

The only issue is I have a pre booked holiday at the end of this month that's non refundable. I feel so silly for not realising in the moment with how fast everything moved that during this phonecall or the next morning before officially signing the contract is when I should've negotiated and brought up any pre booked holidays.

I had my first day of training that went really well and finished out my shift being provided the company handbook and policies. I didn't get a chance to talk to the hiring manager as they'd been doing overtime and clocked out early that day. Everything in the policies regarding the expectations around annual and unpaid leave, plus what I experienced on my first day indiciate that it's a very supportive company with work life balance. It's now the following day after my first shift (weekend) and I'm so anxious and unsure about what to do because I've missed the ideal window of telling them about the holiday before accepting the offer. 

I know that I have to make a decision this weekend to give them as much notice as possible. My plan is to email to explain the situation, apologise for not bringing it to their attention when receiving the offer, and that I'm extremely willing to work any extra hours/days needed in the next two weeks and know it would involve taking unpaid leave for the three work days the trip falls on, and to let me know what the best course of action is (cancelling the trip if that's not possible within the rostering plans that might already be arranged for my training).

I'm really sorry for such a long post and thank you if you've read this far!

I'm so worried about how this might reflect on me when I'm just starting and whether I could lose a job I'm really excited about over asking them this after accepting the offer. I keep thinking whether I should not risk mentioning this at all and just take the financial loss and not go.

Further context for the job, I'm in Australia and it's a part time position (4 days a week). The trip dates are two weeks from now and would require me to take three days unpaid leave (Wed-Fri) during my probationary training period (which runs over the next six months).

1e2dz1m,Change ,"Hello everyone, I've been thinking a lot about this, but sometimes we can think ourselves into a corner, so I wanted to just share my dilemma and get some outside perspectives.  

There weren't too many good opportunities in my home country so I left for Asia in the hope of building a better future.  I was previously teaching in China, I had a lovely time there, amazing people and vibrant cities.  However, I don't want to be a teacher all my life, and I felt like the mobility in China is not that good when it comes to visa constraints and the large number of competition.  So I moved to a neighboring country as a teacher but with the hope of being able to transition to something at a later stage.  This country is quite poor, but I believed it has an interesting and prosperous future and if there was somewhere I could do something different then it was here.   

Long story short, in this new country I managed to get an internship with an organization that gives me access to lots of policymakers and CEOs etc, essentially the sort of internship I wanted, with the promise of a job later.  However, I hate living here.  That's the honest truth, it can be a difficult country to live in and I haven't met anyone I'm genuinely close to.  My original plan was to stay in this job for a bit, network and try and get out that way.  But part of me just feels that the longer I stay the harder it will be to leave.  I could go back to China to teach, but it feels like a step back.

1e2cyrr,Written Warning - Questions ,"Hello all. I work for a large global company in its US division. I am mid level, no direct reports, focused on product.

I, for the first time in my life, was given a written warning for a very well deserved infraction of insubordination. While my intentions were good in my heart, I understand completely that I messed up and will have major consequences for this. Please, I do not need to be berated more for this, it was very stupid and I am very upset and embarrassed with myself for what happened. Trust me when I say that I am hard enough on me for all of us.

What I want to ask is can I recover from this? I have an excellent track record officially, but have inadvertently ruffled feathers at times. I am middle aged, and fairly new to the corporate environment (2.5 yrs) after working in healthcare for most of my adult life. Corporate culture has been very challenging for me to assimilate to. If after 2.5 years and I am putting myself into a position where I am getting written up, is it that I’m not catching on fast enough or am I expecting too much of myself?

I strive for self awareness, and am self aware enough that it may be a mismatch of right role/right person. But I am worried I’m missing more, and that if I can’t recognize an issue within, I can’t address it.

If you need more context, I will attempt to provide more info but need to keep from doxing myself for very obvious reasons.

The issue comes in though, when raise season is comming up. This younger generation is prone to quitting if they are not happy and we already put a lot into training him.

1e2bz31,Was asked to take on additional responsibilities with no salary increase,"Basically the title.  For a bit of background I've been in my current role for 1.5 years at a museum doing the database/paperwork end of things in the fundraising department. Prior to that I was at another museum doing a very similar role, plus other things like managing the membership program and visitor services. I was at my last job for five years and my role changed quite a bit over time. 

My organization has recently undergone lots of changes after wrapping up a capital campaign and opening a big, new facility. Long story short a few people have either quit and left already or just put in their notices. The organization is also in a hiring freeze, people who were set to get raises at the start of the new fiscal year did not, and allegedly the CEO and CAO are taking pay cuts and moving to a 4 day week schedule. 

On Thursday ,my boss called me and said that our CEO and CAO wanted to know if I'd be willing to take on doing some Executive Assistant and HR assistant work in addition to my current role with no salary increase (this was explicitly stated). The justification for no increase in salary would be because my time spent doing my current responsibilities would be ""reduced"" to accommodate the extra work (50% philanthropy, 30% admin, 20% HR). Honestly that seemed like a crock of BS to get me to agree to taking on this extra work, especially because I was told that since I'd be reporting to the CEO and Board I'd just have to ""answer the call"" if they needed anything regardless of how much time I spent in whatever area. 

I'm not really sure where to go from here... We have a meeting next week to discuss further and that's when I'll have to decide whether I agree to do this or not.

I don't feel like I have a lot of ground to stand on when it comes to negotiation due to the aforementioned hiring freeze and no raise thing. Plus, I'm currently fully remote which isn't typical at this job. I'm pretty sure I'm the only person who is fully remote (my bf got a job 6 hours away from where this museum is located and they just had me stay on when we moved). 

Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. I don't really feel like moving on from this job since I've only been here a short time, so I'd like to avoid quitting and starting a job search but I will if I have to.

1e2aklb,Career Planning Help,"I am 32, married for 10 years, and a father of 3. My marriage appears to be coming to an end which both of us have both fought against and also desired to fix at various points in the last 2 years, but which we know a mental health professional would tell us to end. We are friends on good terms overall.

I have previously worked in a medical business setting doing more than just billing. I worked for the same company handling their compliance paperwork, licensures, payroll, new hires information, and tracking their billing information for 8 years. I had a debit card for them with my name on it, and the job was 100% remote with fully paid benefits. Dream job. The company is being sold which is why I have to leave: the owner is retiring.

So, in the past 3 years I’ve tried managing a pop culture retail store, securing a new in-person medical business office job, and also getting a job for Parks and Rec as a level 2 tech.

Parks and Rec is my current job and was chosen because I worked for 3.5 years as a landscaper on a very high end golf course that exists in the forest. I left the golf course after becoming section leader due to the 90 hour summers I worked taking me away from my family, but I enjoyed being in the woods and also working with my hands. Additionally, I did grow up on a farm, so that kind of work is known to me, and their benefits package is one of the best I’ve seen.

I am miserable. No one at Parks and Rec seems to take pride in their work, take their work seriously, or do anything sensibly and completely the first time.

I was miserable at the retail giant due to all the gossip and infighting that goes on. I couldn’t stay on top of the social pyramid and it ruined my self perception.

I like to spend most of my free time under hypnotic trance or meditating, reading, writing. I prefer to be located in the woods in old Victorian type homes and cemeteries are romantic to me. I am a failed book author and would love to have time to try to publish again.

I’m good with my hands and also interpersonal counseling. I’m very detailed. I like cool, dark, damp weather, and I have the capital and means to move to any state in the US, but probably not for much longer which is why I’m trying to pick a career.

I also have my associates degree and could get a bachelors in around a year if I so-desire due to the additional coursework I’ve done since. I would prefer to both move states as well as have a flexible job that fulfills me.

I cannot become POST certified (so I think Park Ranger is out) but CDL and also CCW are not problems for me to get (I’ve lived a weird life).

At the company I work at, leadership is heavily female, and there is an astounding amount of cruel/passive-aggressive backstabbing behavior going on. The other day, one of the ladies (who is a VP & BFFs with the CEO) spoke fondly of how they used to ""haze"" one another. When she said that my jaw practically fell to the floor.

1e29cwe,"Resigning After 1.5 Years: Advice Needed on Unpaid Wages and Hostile Work Environment (Ontario, Canada)","Hi Reddit,

I'm in a tough spot and could really use some advice. I’m based in Ontario, Canada. I've been working at my current job (a private for profit company) for 1.5 years, and things have gone downhill fast. Here's what's been happening:

- I haven't been paid in 3 months.
- The work environment is incredibly hostile. I've faced inappropriate comments about my race and culture, and there's a lot of screaming and discriminatory remarks towards employees.
- Previous firings in the company haven't been handled well. They often use (possibly fabricated) confidential breach accusations to avoid paying out overtime after laying people off.
- I have 100 hours of accrued overtime (which is banked) and 5 days of vacation.

Given these circumstances, I have a few questions:

1. Can I use my banked overtime and vacation days to serve as my notice period?
2. What steps can I take to protect myself and ensure I get paid what I'm owed?

I appreciate any advice or similar experiences you all can share. Thanks in advance.",Trick-Location-7827,2,1.0,0,1720874019,2024-07-13 12:33:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e29cwe/resigning_after_15_years_advice_needed_on_unpaid/,7,2024

1e28npd,Is this company even real?,"Company name is Cedar Valley Exteriors

I’ve been exploring leaving my company and applied for a few roles. I was contacted by one company who has unusually high base pay ($75 an hour) for a sales manager role which to me is almost a red flag itself… 

They sent me a questionnaire to fill out which seemed normal but then I got an email which seemed to be worded poorly “$75 per hour salary” and offering the option of getting paid via check which I think is unusual in todays world especially for a fully remote position.

That kind of sent me down a rabbit hole of is this place real and I can’t find people on LinkedIn that I’m confident are real and the website seems oddly basic and outdated for the company. I don’t see many people talking about it online and many reviews seem fishy to me as well. 

Am I being overly skeptical? Can anyone confirm this place is real? Or that it’s a scam job?

1e26v32,Did I make a career mistake?,"Currently looking for some career advice from anyone in retail, particularly luxury retail:

I was a key holder at a lower, but still luxury retail brand when my manager who was leaving reffered me to a retail brand that it way higher in luxury and opening a new boutique. Extremely excited and flattered, I conducted a series of interviews applying for a sales associate role. After about 3 rounds, they offered me a position as basically an executive assistant role, with the possibility for promotiom to sales by the end of this year. After about a month since the boutique opened, it’s safe to say I hate this position. I’m passing 5k+ in sales to my associates on a day to day basis, as well as working in both front of house and back of house operations which is exhausting. The ethics of the company are also extremely questionable. We experienced a pretty traumatic robbery and instead of being sent home we were given a two hour break and were sent back to complete the rest of our shift. Our power went out in the middle of a heat wave for 4 hours and we were tasked to handle organizational responsibilities in a windowless building in the dark essentially with no airflow because we had a corporate visit the next day. And while my hourly is higher, I don’t make commission, so my checks are significantly lower opposed to my last position. Yesterday, I had my touch base meeting with my manager and basically was told that my opportunity for promotion is something that would be reviewed this time NEXT year, not by the end of this year, and they do not think I’m currently ready for the sales position. I was also told the only way I would be offered a sales position that soon was if a opportunity popped up in another state. I currently feel like a made a mistake and took a lower position just because of it being a higher brand. I watch my coworkers rake in thousands in commission, and I’m struggling to make ends meet. My coworkers and department managers tell me everyday how I should be a S.A, and thank me with snacks and hugs when I pass over sure sales to them. Clients are also often confused when I pass them off mid selling ceremony, and request to stay with me through their shopping experience. My family is so proud and wants me to stick it out, but I can’t seem to start another shift without crying and feeling so small. 

My question is.. what now? Do I stick it out for the year, beg for my old job back, find a new job around December? I’m just looking for some direction and wonder if anyone has been through something similar.

1e25sny,Transitioning from mechanical engineering to strategy consulting,"Hi everyone 

I graduated from a university in New Zealand with a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) in Mechanical Engineering. I’ve been working as a Graduate Mechanical Engineer at an engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) company for about 2 years now. My job mainly consists of piping design and procuring mechanical equipment such as pumps.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about my career prospects. Some days, I find myself getting a bit bored at my job. My mind interprets my job as mostly filling out paperwork to make sure that mechanical equipment is safe and complies with design codes, which have large safety margins. It has occurred to me that some of the engineering that I do is not really practical - for example, doing a calculation just to prove that a 3% overstress as per the code is acceptable, even when the code has a safety factor of 3.5, and I’m designing for a 1 in 1000 yr earthquake. I think I’d like to get a job that allows me to use my quantitative skills that I’ve gained through engineering, but also lets me broaden my thinking to something that’s more big-picture and related to the overall business. Even better, I’d love to leverage my engineering experience, as I hope it’ll give me an edge over other applicants. 

I’ve become interested in the role of management consulting, as I believe it will introduce me to more big-picture, business thinking, while allowing me to utilise my quantitative skills. I think it will open doors to higher-up roles at various large companies. Furthermore, the higher compensation and ability to travel appeals a lot to me. However, the problem that I see is I don’t have much credentials related to business. I’ve done some research on LinkedIn to observe the background of people who get into strategy consulting firms pre-MBA, and usually they have a conjoint degree between STEM and commerce, which I am lacking. Keeping this in mind, I’ve made a plan of action which consists of: 

1. Get promoted out of the grad programme at my current company 
2. While working, study and sit the GMAT 
3. Apply for an entry-level role at a strategy consulting firm, alhough it’s very unlikely I’ll get in 
4. Work for another 2 years, so by this point, I’ll have 4 years of engineering work experience 
5. Do an MBA, take part in consulting competitions, network and apply for consulting jobs 
6. (Hopefully) Get a job at a consulting firm 

I’d like to ask the internet to check if this plan has any flaws and/or tell me I’m being delusional, also if there are other career paths that fit what I’m looking for. ",BirthdayHelpful109,1,1.0,1,1720860650,2024-07-13 08:50:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e25sny/transitioning_from_mechanical_engineering_to/,7,2024

1e23q72,How to choose the “best” path ,"Hi all! 

Quick background: I applied to a physician assistant program last year and I am still waitlisted. The director has mentioned re-applying in recent emails, but the deadline is coming up soon. I told myself I would hold off to strengthen my application with experience, BUT I feel like “this could be my year”.

The BIG debate is that I have grown to love dental hygiene and planned to apply there instead. I’m not sure if I should hold on re-applying to the PA program to not waste my time and money as well as my colleagues who write letters. 

Another thing that’s throwing me off is cost. The PA program is over 90K for 2 years whereas the dental hygiene program is 10K for 2 years (only needing 50 credits out of the 80 required as well). 

Please help me!!!!! I don’t know why I’m second guessing when I wanted to be a physician/provider for so many years, but I guess things change?

1e22k37,Is it time to look for another job?,"I started my job fresh out of university last August, as a news producer (on contract). Of course I was excited but very nervous as I was still not sure if that was something I wanted to do long term. I was offered the job by my professor who works as an anchor at the station. I was extremely greatful.

 Unfortunately, we aren't on the same shift. I co-produce Wed-Fri night, and solo produce/web produce and source all the news on the weekends. 

However training from day 1 was a mess. Different people telling me different things. While it was stressful, I liked the job and got along with many of my co-workers. It didn't take long for things to get toxic and for me to see that the news director preferred to be non-confrontational when it came to serious problems between staff, and he would bounce back and forth on things he had previously said.

My news director meets with all the producers to go over the shows, and has said I'm doing great. 

Well today, I was brought into a one on one meeting, where he said a couple people have come forward and have critiqued the way I produce, he mentioned how he wants to see me take more initiative, etc, etc. None of it made sense to me because not only have I taken on several tasks, but I've never complained about them. In fact there are several days I have to go without a lunch break because of how much stuff I have to don

I did ask him if there was anything else I needed to improve on. The thing is he was extremely vague about what these people said. I asked him if there was a specific scenario that I could reflect on, and he said no...it was just general. It just felt like he was skipping around a lot of information.

This is also the exact same thing that happened to another one of my coworkers who was a friend. She was thrown under the bus, and left not too long after. 

My news director now wants to switch up my entire schedule and have me co-produce on the morning show, he hasn't confirmed when though. That was the last straw for me. I'm actively looking for another job now.

 I also had an attorney look at my contract and found out there were several things that went against California laws on employment, such as needing to pay a large amount to get out of the contract, and paying for damages. The station is also on a list of other stations reportedly up for sale. We all found this out through two articles, and had a meeting about it.

I've settled that this job just isn't for me and am moving on. Am I making the right decision?

1e21pjf,"My job is too easy, I feel like I contribute nothing to society. But it feels stupid to leave it.","I have a job where I work from home 3 days a week. I basically only have to do work when other people on my team ask for my help for something. I probably only work a real 10 hours a week on average but I'm paid full time. The stuff I do requires no skills, anyone can learn it. I can't believe it requires a 4 year degree and I can't believe I'm making more than anyone else I know. It sounds good on paper and it was for like a year, but I feel extremely guilty about it now. I feel like I contribute nothing to society.

Seeing people with blue collar jobs bust their ass off for half as much as I make, it makes me feel so guilty. Or seeing people have a passion for wanting to help others and going into social work. All these people are working hard and having an immediate impact. My entire goal in college was to get a general business degree and get a generic business job that was easy and paid well. I never followed my passions and I think I regret it.

I don't ever feel good about what I do. I have asked for more work and try to take initiative but there really isn't much more I can do, or at least I don't have any ideas. What really bothers me is everyone on my team likes me and tells me how good of a job I'm doing for some reason. I feel like they have to realize how easy my job is. They send me something that takes 5 minutes to do and thank me for it like I did them a big favor. I basically have no skills. All I do is run simple reporting. If I lost this job I'd probably be fucked. But I don't see that happening, I lucked out and got into a really nice family owned company that good benefits so I feel like it would be dumb for me to leave.

But any promotions pay barely anything more but the workload is WAY more obviously since most other jobs there are actual joba. So unless I really want that particular job I don't have any incentive to promote myself (except for if I start a family but I just turned 24 and I'm single). But even if I get promoted, it'll still be a pretty easy office job with a ton of downtime. I feel so selfish for going down the easy route when everyone else around me is suffering.

First time posting on reddit because I truly need some opinions and guidance here. I'm a 27 yo Female, Currently working as a Business Intelligence Engineer. I've been in the tech field for 5 years and I just cant do this anymore. I used to love what I do when I first started a few years back but I can't see myself being a SWE anymore.

1e1y2v2,Difficult job choice,"Hi everyone, my situation is this: I am 23 years old and have been working for 3 years as a factory worker in a large company in Italy and they asked me to join the after-sales department as a global technician and trainer (teaching how to use the machinery to customers, away and on site). 
I would solve machine problems all over the world but mainly in Europe and the USA, I would generally be away for 1/2 days, rarely more, but after talking to those who work in the department I know I'd often end up traveling for 15 days a month.
 I would remain classified as a basic worker but with a flat rate package (instead of paid overtime hours) in addition to the daily allowance based on where I go, I would net around 2000€ over 13 monthly payments + daily allowance ending up with, on an average month (according to who works there), 2400/2500€ after tax which isn't much considering how long I would be away (obviously hotels, meals and any expenses are covered by the company card).
Every year the remuneration will be reviewed based on performance and a production bonus of around 2500€/year is also guaranteed.  

On the other hand, another smaller company also in the area offered me a role as an after-sales employee but in-house, practically selling spare parts to customers and offering maintenance/repairs.
This role is now covered by only one person who, however, is no longer behind the growth of the company so the owner wants to expand the department with me.  I would be classified as office employee with a salary of €2,250 gross x 13 monthly payments + €2,500 gross annual bonus (netting around 1850€ over 13 monthly payments)
I am very inclined to accept the traveling job with the fear that I would soon get tired of traveling for work and that I would lose relationships with friends and regret not having accepted the office job.  I was wondering if in your opinion the differentiation between an employee position versus remaining a factory worker for future job opportunities is important, my propensity for the first job is not due to the money which is not a lot for the role but more to the possibility of growth and to open up future opportunities, in addition to the fact that in the last 3 years I have gained profound experience in these machines that I would throw away with my other job.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated.",theguyonthe_internet,1,1.0,0,1720833390,2024-07-13 01:16:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e1y2v2/difficult_job_choice/,7,2024

Not a great choice in my degree I know, but that’s the field I was(am) interested in and I went for it. Wasn’t a good experience and nor did I really learn anything. 

I worked for a few startups as a content creator but moved on pretty quick. Moved to Canada to study VFX (and to get away from home). Great experience, learnt a lot and even got a job. But the film industry at the moment is going through the toughest time it has probably ever, so I couldn’t keep my job for long and can’t find another. 

Im almost broke and Im about 8 months away from my visa ending. Cant go back home for a lot of reasons. At a stage where I dont even care about my interests and just want to get a good job. 

I want to study more, probably a masters degree, but not sure in what.

I’m planning to make a career change and learn a trade cause all the guys I deal with make so much more money and are generally happier and less stressed out. So I thought I’d join them.

I’m planning to go back to school soon and I was looking to see if anyone has some advice for me since this will be my 3rd time leaving this company 😂

I’m very good at my job but I’m getting tired of the excess stress involved in managing the work for shitty pay. (And it’s affecting my sleep / marriage/ friendships) I usually leave the company to work in my family business for a few months and just give them some random excuse on my way out.

When I’m no longer needed with the family, I can simply email them and they’ll give me the job back. (Because it’s very hard to find decently good coordinators in this industry and they’re always hiring) 

My idea of leaving was to leave a note for my manager along with my computer, phone, and truck keys and just leave on a weekend or something. They’re a pretty shit and unorganized company, but they pay well which is why I go back for a few months to save some money.

1e1vsj7,Being transfered at work. But haven't been officially told...What is going on?,"
I am tying this on phone and trying to do it as quickly as possible before my daughter needs me.

I have been at this company for 6 years. 3 in production and 3 in the position I am now. 
About 3 weeks ago a coworker ( I'll call Kevin) and I had a sit down with the new plant manager (short notice meeting, end of day) and she asked us about meeting with people in the other building about communicating with them and working on how to get our materials from them because there has been such a big issue with them in the past and feels like we could help and be a great opprotunity for us. I'm like sure I am always willing to help. She did not in that meeting ask us what exactly we do and barely let us get a word in. (This is going to be a theme here with her.) So we left feeling relived because"" Hey I guess we are not getting fired!"" Because she is cutting jobs he and I were both concerned. I am the bread winner and have a 3 year old and her father my boyfriend is disabled and cannot work. So that would be awful obviously.


Go to a week later my immediate supervisor ( Mark)  calls me into his office and asks me did I know that I was being moved to the other department. I am blind sided. I said no. He asked what exactly was said and I told him what she said to the best of my abilities. And also told him if I thought that's what she meant then I would have came to him immediately. He told me not to worry too much because he would talk to his supervisor (we will call Anthony) and convince her not to take us. We do somewhat similar jobs for the same building but different departments in that building but we are the only ones in our building.

So then I've been in limbo for a few weeks and then this morning my coworker we will call Andea asked me kind of reluctantly what planning and scheduling duties did I have and how long do they take because Anthony asked her. WTF.
Shortly after our supervisor Mark came in and she told him. He had no idea either. 

I finally asked my coworker Kevin because it was supposed to be hush hush and even I wasn't supposed to know. And he confirmed that he heard the rumor but no one has talked to him yet. No one had actually came to us directly spoken about being transferred instead talking to everyone else around us and we are hearing about through other people and they are avoid even telling our immediate supervisor. 

So now they are talking about absorbing out tasks  and them moving us to a failing department that can't keep people because the supervisors over there don't give a shit. When I spoke to a  few workers over there they talked about they have been working 12 hour shifts. The turn over rate there is high and every one is miserable. My coworker and I are constantly recognized for doing a good job and keeping things going. And now we are being plucked from places we do well at to a sinking ship while the higher ups are not even giving us the decency to tell us of these plans. Our previous super supervisor would have but the plant manager promoted him away from our department so she could restructure without resistance. She doesn't even know what's going on she's been there less than a year and tells us after year 2 she's out.

Kevin and I both said that if we get transferred we are looking for other jobs because the department they are trying to send us to is a hell hole with a high turn over rate. That department has been broken for at least 10 years sending us there isn't going to fix anything. It's management not holding production accountable. We are not management we do not have the power to change that. What should I do? What can I do? This plant manager won't listen to anyone i can't talk to her she is not that fond of my immediatesupervisorbecause she claims he got his positionbecause of nepotism. Everyone agrees she doesnt listen and just agree with her or you will get canned. She gets an idea and runs with it. It's so shitty because they will move or cut us and then after she leaves probably hire for those positions again.

Sorry this is so long. What is going on? What should I do?
Can someone decode what's going on here? (Not my wall of text.) LOL

1e1vrk2,"New role not what I wanted to do, should I stay or leave? ","I went from Marketing to Program/Project Management/Supply Chain & Logistics to Corporate IT Strategy. My goal is to make it to the data science/analytics space and so far, it's been rough. I just landed this job in Corporate IT Strategy and after the first week, I absolutely hate it. 

  
I did 3 rounds of interviews in 3 days and was offered the position. I didn't think it much at first because I was blinded by the pay, so I eagerly accepted without also fully considering the job description, let alone ask all the questions I needed to ask during the interview, so I am fully aware these were all my mistakes. 

  
I started the new job this week and was thrown into the role to fill in for someone that had recently left. I didn't know anything about Corporate IT Strategy or anything about what the previous person was doing, which is normal. I felt that it was normal to feel overwhelmed but I also had zero training sessions on anything. For this first week, I did a lot as I was trying my best to navigate the work that the previous person did and stayed back late every day even on my first week. my manager proceeds to assign me more stuff that I did not expect would be assigned to me and it's just so much stuff that it made me feel super inadequate. I know that it's normal to feel this way but it's all stuff I don't really want to do. It's not aligned to my career goals and frankly, I just made the mistake of accepting it so quickly. 

I also hate the company culture. It's dry and bland and everyone that I've spoken to so far seems to hate it there. I haven't heard one good thing from anyone saying they like it there. There's also heavy overseas cultural influence at the company (Asian company) so it's very traditional and I'm not used to the way things are operated. My manager is also extremely nitpicky, and the work processes are not documented anywhere so it feels like freestyling everything, which is something I am not good at since I want more guidance in a role. 

yeah, it's been a week, but I really don't see myself doing this anymore. I had a mental breakdown earlier this week about this role and my inadequacy and it made me question if I should even be there for long. If I can barely stand a week, how can I stand a month or two? Even if I stay in this role, I don't see myself moving vertically or horizontally because I don't like the company and I don't like the path for this career. 

I reached out to my previous company to see if they would take me back and allow me to continue to work and apply to jobs again. They said that they will get back to me by next week, and I am thinking of going back if they will have me as I genuinely like that company and the room for growth. I left because I just wanted to find something new. But other than pursuing this route, what would you guys suggest I should do? Thank you all!

*TLDR: I started a new job this week and it's not at all what I want to do. I don't like the company, company culture, the role itself, and I fear I will have many issues with my manager later down the line. I feel like I cannot stay here too long either as it will affect my mental.* ",Ok_Acanthisitta4965,1,1.0,1,1720826636,2024-07-12 23:23:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e1vrk2/new_role_not_what_i_wanted_to_do_should_i_stay_or/,7,2024
1e1vj8o,Any advice on lack of respect in the workplace for early career?,"Background: I’m a 25F who’s almost a year into my corporate career(been out of college for about two years now) and have proven way beyond my job description. My manager left a few months into my current job and I essentially have taken on her duties for half the pay due to work culture of shelling out responsibilities when people leave instead of backfilling positions. 

My team is very top heavy with me and one other person within my larger team being 1) my age 2) on my role level. The closest person in age outside of my counterpart has been in their career at least 5 years longer than me. Given this, I work on a lot of high risk and visibility projects which has been an amazing skill and career development opportunity. I’ve been leading lots of projects and initiatives for my department. However, I have noticed that there’s a huge lack of response and just overall respect when I am tasked with my day to day responsibilities. I feel flat out ignored most of the time socially or professionally. I also find myself having to ask over and over again for various tasks to be done or imperative information for lots of different projects with high importance. Compared to my coworkers of higher age and rank who only need to ask once. There are a lot of times where my team has chosen to not really be welcoming or talk to me but will do so with my older coworkers. I just want to know if this is normal for early career given my age and role status? Or is this a culture issue? Is this something I just need to expect in my early career until I’m able to establish myself more? Is it a generational gap?

1e1u56l,"Graduating in a year, now clue what to do for a living.","

This is a burner account, I wanna keep this off the record.


This will be a long post.


The reason for this post, I don’t think I have a passion for anything and it’s driving absolutely crazy, more than you think. 


I am 21 years old. 


Quick background: I major in Communication and Design, currently in my third year. 


First year we had some basic of design, some front end web development, some classes about Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.


Second year was focused on “storytelling”. We had very minimal graphic design work, a screenwriting class, some editing projects and made some short films.


Last summer I did an internship at an advertising agency as a Graphic Design intern. It was so bad, it made me despise graphic design as a whole, absolutely hated it.


This summer I decided to have an open mind and I am doing another Graphic Design internship at a much better advertising agency.


Third year was heavily focused on actual film production. We shot a documentary, and make a bunch of short films. I liked video editing quite a bit and I focused on editing most of the projects during my third year. I worked on myself a lot to improve my editing skills and I can that I am better than most people in my cohort. I used to have a passion for it, but that fire died down. 


Here is my problem. I cannot stop stressing over the fact of “what will I have as a job?”, and the classic “what is my purpose in life?”. It is actually mentally draining me. It’s always up there running in my head, for a year now.


A little bit about me personally. I go above and beyond when it comes to anything. I am genuinely curious and a hardworking person. I tried showing some interest in graphic design, but god I don’t see myself doing it, at the end of the day I didn’t study graphic design. 


When we are on long shoot days, I’m the most energetic guy. Everyone would have the attitude of “let’s film this and go”, but I’d like to take my time to not rush things, but at the same time I’d be energized and ready to go while everyone is tired after the shoot.


On my free time, I am constantly challenging myself and learning new stuff. I once started learning 3D modeling but it didn’t click with me and I didn’t like it. When it comes to filmmaking, my mind is always blown by it. Almost after watching every movie, I search up how they did it and take notes. I constantly watch essay videos on YouTube, trying to learn about filmmaking for instance. I never opened Adobe After Effects before. So I did and did a bunch of tutorials to learn, because it intrigues me. I wanted to learn motion graphics, and it seemed fun and I continue to learn. The other day I woke up and I was like “I wanna learn compositing in VFX”, just out of nowhere because it intrigues me.


My old brother keeps stressing the fact of me learning advertising and graphic designing. He has many years of experience in advertising, client service. He wants the best for me that’s all. His psychology is “learn everything and become good at them, then pick and choose”. 

But I don’t see myself designing shit, it’s not my thing. I put in the effort into learning it, I enjoy it, I am a fond of the work, but I don’t see it as a career. 


So I started stressing over the fact of “what if I don’t get a good paying job because I disregarded designing as a whole?”. And I start going into this rabbit hole in my head. 

I am genuinely lost here. I don’t know what to do anymore. All help is appreciated!",rankedcloudd,5,1.0,10,1720822342,2024-07-12 22:12:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e1u56l/graduating_in_a_year_now_clue_what_to_do_for_a/,7,2024

1e1r83c,Burnout in 20s and wanting to quit,"I (F, late 20s, English is not my native language etc) have been on a verge of a burnout for over a year and a half now and I feel like I have finally reached the tipping point. I have worked in an HR-adjacent role for a bit over 4 years now that I stumbled into purely by coincidence, Only a year into this job, I realized that HR is NOT for me, even a HR-adjacent role, as I am not sure if it is like this elsewhere as well but where I work, we are basically the punching bag for decisions made elsewhere. I quite literally despise my job and the only redeeming quality is having a decent team. Back when I realised HR is not for me, I tried to hand in my notice but was convinced to stay. And here I am, 3 years and several promotions later and my mental and physical health are absolutely shot. I have used up all of my PTO (5 weeks) for this year to try and manage and during PTO I have noticed a significant improvement in my physical symptoms (extreme fatigue, digestive issues, headaches), which is why I believe they are mostly caused by work stress. 

I am also in school for another degree (MSc) which I have almost finished, only a year left. As such, I am actively applying for positions in the new industry but have realised that even if I manage to score a new job soon, it would still mean jumping from one job to another with no break in between.  As such, I am seriously considering just quitting my job without having another one lined up with an excuse of wanting to focus fully on my studies for the last two semesters although the real reason is mental health related instead. I have roughly 2 years worth of living-expenses in my savings so I have something to fall back on as well.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation where you have quit your job to focus on burnout recovery while also actively trying to change industries? I come from a culture where emotions and mental health are very much not talked about as much as they should and this is why full-on telling people that I quit for my mental health is pretty much out of question, including to my family.",Short_Bus8309,2,1.0,1,1720814954,2024-07-12 20:09:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e1r83c/burnout_in_20s_and_wanting_to_quit/,7,2024
1e1r6d9,How to Talk to My Manager About Job Dissatisfaction Without Sounding Negative?,"Hi Reddit,

I’m looking for some advice on a tough situation at work. I’ve been with my current company for almost a year now, and lately, I’ve been really unhappy in my role. The main problem is that my manager isn’t great at communicating and doesn’t provide much support. I didn’t get the training I needed to do my job well, and because my manager isn’t technical in IT, I often feel lost without the right guidance.

When I interviewed, I was told there would be some flexibility with working hours, but that’s not the case. I even got in trouble for coming into work 4 minutes early one day, yet I’m frequently asked to stay late for urgent projects. Recently, I worked from 9:00 AM to 4:30 AM to ensure a project shipped on time. The stress and unexpected responsibilities aren’t reflected in my pay either. All of this has led to me dreading coming into the office every morning.

I want to talk to my manager about these issues, but I’m worried about coming off as if I’m just complaining. My biggest fear is that if I express my concerns, the company might see me as a problem and look for ways to push me out. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How can I bring up my concerns in a constructive way that shows I want to improve and contribute more effectively, without sounding too negative? Any tips or advice on how to have this conversation would be really appreciated.

1e1qjhq,Should I make the move to a LCOL Area with my career choice? Or should I wait?,"Hi everyone, this is my first post and I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this in, but I will try it out anyway.

For a bit of background, I'm a 22 yr old single Male no kids, living in Los Angeles, CA. I just started my career here with the district as a TA and coach while also going to school with the goal of becoming and Athletic Director of a University and hopefully getting into Pro sports as a GM or Coach, etc. I do not like Los Angeles and am wanting to relocate to a different state/city, first choice is San Antonio, Texas as I have family there and liked it when i visited, but couldn't help but realize the obvious pay cut that moving would bring me starting out as it is also obviously a LCOL area. From what I see, Athletic Directors make the same there as they do in LA, but that would be in 4 years when I get my degree and would be taking a pay cut starting out before then. 

For reference: I make $25/hr here and would be getting paid $16.50/hr over there. I would also be moving alone and taking on rent, etc.

Should I make the move now to establish my career over there since I'm just beginning and have little to no responsibility (no kids, wife, etc.) or would it be better to stay here in a HCOL area, save up and make the move once I have my degree (in 4 years), but run the risk that I establish my career here and am obligated to stay because of that?",gthagreat23,1,1.0,0,1720813227,2024-07-12 19:40:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e1qjhq/should_i_make_the_move_to_a_lcol_area_with_my/,7,2024

1e1poi8,made a mistake and my boss blew up ,"tldr: i got reprimanded in the company groupchat for missing two reports that needed to be completed for stakeholders, and im feeling really nervous about the disciplinary meeting the ceo set for monday.

i work at an engineering company with high level stakeholders involved with the ceo. i work technically as a business admin but i do a little bit of everything (crm management, data coordination and analysis, technical writing, marketing ads, data entry, autocad drawings, etc.)

lately i feel like ive been stretched thin because the ceo shifted my coworkers main work to me so she can focus on engineering documents. one of two account executives quit after they had me take over him admin duties because they didn't want to train him on it. plus the autocad drawings are being compiled with visio drawings that take forever to load and complete. there was one week where 3 drawings were assigned to me and due the next day. the day those were due, 4 more were assigned to me and due the next day. this is pretty common. currently so i don't have time to be doing the research and data entry needed for accurate reports of over 4000 items in the crm.

basically, i had a long list of items i was trying to get complete for a sales meeting that was going to happen next week where all the reports i've done had to be updated. the ceo added another long report right before july 4 and said it needed to be completed the following monday so he could turn it into the stakeholders. lots and lots of personal stuff happened over thursday to sunday and i forgot to add that report to my task list. engineering also assigned me two drawings needing to be done that day.

he sends out an email on wednesday july 3 saying the template for another report i needed to turn in was ready and at the end said, ""i will be delivering this on thursday of next week so please have it ready."" i didn't understand that that sentence was supposed to encompass the reports that i forgot to add to my task list so i completely glazed over those two. he referenced that email and highlighted that sentence. told me that i received this email so he couldn't believe i didn't get it done july 11.

fast forward, i had been working on yet another report all day and thought it was the last one to be completed. walk into work july 11, the thursday the ceo has to deliver this, and my phone was blasted 30 minutes before i came in to late afternoon because i didn't complete two of them. 

my manager called me to yell at me twice. i had to base those two reports i didnt do on a running report that when i get the numbers from the crm. that one consistently messes up because the account executive inputs in wrong information. so one of the calls was her asking me why they don't match up, i said i would need time to look into that because i would have to manually go into her log and go thru each line to match it up to the crm.

she cut me off multiple times to say no we don't have time for that, this should've been done. called back and asked more questions that i couldn't answer right there and then, and said,""anything that is wrong in the crm will be considered your fault so you have to keep up."" i've only been working here for 6 months and this was a product they been using since 2018 so i haven't been able to update everything because it's been so consistently busy.

my ceo put in slack that i exhibited poor performance to our group chat and that i need to have a meeting with him later in order to received disciplinary action.

i understand i messed up but ive been an exemplary performer. ive gotten things to all departments on time and have never been called out for bad performance. never had a performance review once my new hire period was completed. 

i'm really nervous about the meeting and don't think i can handle the ceo yell at me (which i've witnessed multiple times). i've tried to tell him and my manager that i'm juggling multiple tasks, being stretched then after they said i wasn't keeping up with the crm data entry and didn't receive a positive response which left me feeling like i shouldn't bring it up again. they just said ""well get it done"" or ""well that's what we pay you for so enjoy the gift of employment."" 

i just don't know how to approach this conversation and i feel really bad i didn't get it done. any pointers?",jalapenofur,1,0.6600000262260437,5,1720811043,2024-07-12 19:04:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e1poi8/made_a_mistake_and_my_boss_blew_up/,7,2024

In the last few years I have discovered a huge passion for cooking/baking. I've never been more positive about something I want to do. The problem is I have no idea where to start or if it is something I could even jump into professionally without some kind of schooling. I'm completely self taught but completely open to learning.

The current company I have worked with 4years now and they had told me plans to make me a supervisor and I was excited to move up.
2 months later and they have moved up younger guys with less experience and for less money  into supervision roles. Now I am in a production role and one of the top producers they have so may be hard to move me off tools and replace the skills. 
Another company with a project manager that knows me well has offered me a supervisor position but will be for a $5 pay cut to start out while I get situated with the systems they use. Pay would increase when I am on board and get into running jobs after I shadow and learn what they feel I should  have.

1e1nefl,Rescinded Acceptance; AITAH?,"I was employed at Employer A from 2013-2018 before leaving for 5 years in industry before they poached me back in late 2023.  I got a pay bump of 10% to 1,000 salary units (this isn't a brag so we'll use pretend money) but they were about 15% lower than my ask.  I figured it was better than nothing and a move needed to happen so it worked out.  Things are good. I'm good at this job and have been doing well and achieving metrics and billings goals. Overall, no complaints I wouldn't have at any job. 

Employer B was a client of Employer A who I worked with and was courted, interviewed, and eventually offered employment by in June 2024.  This offer was a 35% pay bump to 1,350 salary units and a setting I thought I would enjoy.  Mostly it was about the money but the opportunity was also exciting.  

In order to clear every employment hurdle for Employer B I 'NEEDED' to sign the offer letter and take a background check and drug screen. The letter was signed 6/25 and the formwork was submitted within 48 hours on my side before a drug test within 12 hours of notification of hte location etc.  Final notice that I was 'good to go' came in on 7/3.  

After PTO 7/5 I gave my notice to resign 7/8; on 7/9 I received a very generous and unsolicited (they asked if I would consider a counter but I did not ask) counter offer of an identical 1,350 salary units and 'golden handcuffs' on 7/9 that would have meant leaving a guaranteed and immediately vested 200 salary unit stock package along with a 1,000 salary unit; 5 year retention bonus structure to stay.  I accepted 7/10 and attempted to contact Employer B that same day.  We didn't connect until this morning 7/12 when I reached out again. They were pissed.  

AITAH? 

I am backing out of a signed offer letter 18 days before my scheduled start date and 2 weeks after signing the letter. I have definitely burned a bridge on a great client contact and it's a small world so I'm not thrilled with that... but...

I did not proceed with Employer B's offer expecting Employer A to counter given they had not been mobile on salary 9 months ago.  If they had just matched now I also would have declined but the retention of stock made it impossible to walk from.

Given employer B's testing hoops that I eagerly jumped through I could not (in good faith to my family) have given my notice to employer A any earlier (1 day of PTO aside) without knowing I wouldn't have any issues on a drug or background test (I don't do drugs but you just don't know...) and I could not proceed with those without accepting an offer. 

Obviously what's done is done but my question to this sub is should I have done anything differently? Ideally I would have given notice with a pending offer in hand before firm and fast commitments but that simply wasn't possible.  What's the 'politically appropriate' path here?

1e1mrh5,Career advice for a confused student,"Hey guys, I’d really appreciate some advice. So, I will graduate next month with a GPA 4.0 from an Ivy League (I’m mentioning the US equivalent since I studied at Oxbridge the UK).

I see a lot of my friends going into Big Law, whether that be US law firms or Magic Circle firms. I also see lots of people going into consulting firms like MBB, or investment banking positions.

I currently have a Big 4 accounting job lined up for September, but part of me sees what others are doing and thinks that there is more potential elsewhere? My starting salary will be roughly half that of my friends’.

However, some say that I’m still better off in accounting, as I will get professionally qualified and this will unlock opportunities, such as the skills to start my own business, or working at different firms after qualification.

I’d really appreciate some advice on what to do, and whether my current accounting path is worth staying on - my goal is to work really hard in my 20s to get ahead in my 30s and 40s financially. And if there are better options, what is the best way to pursue them?

1e1min6,Career choice (federal call center vs electromechanics) ?,"Hello everyone,  
  
I'm pondering my career choice and would like to hear your opinions.  
  
Currently, I work for the federal government (canadian) in a call center. The job is okay; I know for many, call centers are tough, but I manage well. I'm currently fully remote, but starting September, we'll be back in the office three times a week. If I could stay 100% remote, the decision would be easier for me; it's one of my most important criteria.  
  
The conditions are good, the salary (72k at the top) is decent, and it's an office job, which I prefer. I'm on contract with no guaranteed permanency, and the time I've worked doesn't count towards permanent status.  
  
Before joining the federal job, I started studies in electromechanics. I completed about half of it. Initially, I wasn't particularly interested in mechanics, but working at a large company where several friends pursued the studies inspired me. I'm not very hands-on, preferring white-collar work over blue-collar, though I expect my manual skills might develop over time.  
  
Electro mechanic salaries vary widely by company; I could rejoin my former employer and potentially earn 85k without bonuses (much better than federal). One major downside is the potential for night shifts (evenings wouldn't work for me) for the foreseeable future. I have a guaranteed job at the company as an electromechanic.  
  
Both jobs offer good pension plans. Here's a general list of pros and cons from my perspective:  
  
Federal Job  
  
Positive  
  
\* Office job (my preference)  
\* Telework 2x/week (better than nothing..?)  
\* Sick/family leave  
\* Possibility to move out of the call center (though it seems challenging)  
  
Negative  
  
\* Call center environment (not a fan, but manageable)  
\* Saturday evening shifts (12 pm to 8 pm)  
\* Contract position (no job security)  
  
Electromechanical Job  
  
Positive  
  
\* Salary  
\* Diploma + practical knowledge for daily life  
\* Better vacation conditions compared to federal  
  
Negative  
  
\* 100% in-person work  
\* Blue-collar job  
\* Night shifts (could change with a different employer)  
\* Higher risk of injury (""dangerous"" job, potential for permanent injuries like back or knee problems)  
  
In summary, the salary is what attracts me most to completing my studies along with gaining practical knowledge for daily life. Do you think it would be worthwhile to finish my studies and leave the federal job?

1e1mfuo,Torn between leaving my job because of high rent prices and staying for “potential” better job opportunities.,"To elaborate, I currently work in Ground Operations for one of the major low cost airlines. Unfortunately the pay is $20.52/hr and I happen to live in the most expensive place in California, the Bay Area (or for non-Californians, the SF Bay Area). 

Currently I’m struggling to find a place to stay, because of many apartments here requiring an income requirement of 2.5x base rent, however, not even manager pay here where I work gets anywhere close to the pay.

As a result I’m debating if it’s worth trying to hang in there with my current job and hope that there are better job opportunities (however right now we are currently in a hiring freeze and there is little movement in terms of going up in the company right now) so it could be months or years before I can see potential job growth. 

If I was to quit my job, my parents are willing to take me in and house me rent free for the time being, and as they live near a military weapons testing facility, I’m thinking I could potentially get a job there however, I haven’t secured any positions yet. But I’ve been told supposedly if I can secure a position there I could get close to a six figure but definitely a high five figure salary (this is up to debate and interpretation though). 

Basically, do I keep my current job and hope I can get some sort of growth but suffer as I barely make enough to pay rent, or do I drop it all where I don’t have to worry about bills, but then I will not longer be building experience, gaining income, and have a gap on my resume. 

I guess to tie up some loose ends I should add where my parents reside, it’s quite cheap (being a small city in the middle of nowhere) where rent can be low as $500, additionally, I’ve only worked at this company for 1 year and 4 months (and if one where to look at my resume, most jobs I was going to before where about year before going to another position), hence worried about making my resume look bad. Lastly I’m not sure if it matters, but I do have a college degree that is quite useless and won’t really get me anywhere, and I’m currently in my mid 20s.

Any feedback would be appreciated, and of course willing to answer any questions as of course no one but me knows my actual situation.",jetrun15,1,0.9900000095367432,3,1720802950,2024-07-12 16:49:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e1mfuo/torn_between_leaving_my_job_because_of_high_rent/,7,2024

Employment

As title says, need advice. I'm currently having a lot of trouble with this. to the point where its making me sick. my stomach is in knots.



Married, Father of 3 kids under 10yo.



Debts



Personal car loan $17k



Bank Loan $13k



line of credit $21k



Mortgage $260k



Current Job(started at 64k) pays a little under 81k CAD I have a company vehicle and a fuel card. I do have a scheduled weekly(1day) travel( 3hours total driving) Main office is close to home. I've been at this job about 8 years.



To be honest, I only applied to see how I would interview as I had interviewed somewhere else a few months ago and i chocked. i pretended my computer audio was screwed up and never answered them again(burned that bridge)



Taking this new job will very likely the bridge with my current employer as it will be seen as the new company poached me.



Job offer received yesterday is for $110k. I was driving when i received the offer call and email so i didn't accept right away i told them i had a few things to ask but wasn't able to concentrate on that as I was driving. I have until this Monday to give an answer.



My problem is the following. Yes it would be the biggest salary jump I've ever had however there are things holding me back.



First the company vehicle and fuel card. we are a 1 personal vehicle family so me having the car and fuel card is saving me what $500-$700 car payment plus $500-$700 in fuel costs driving to work every day.



Second I'm very comfortable in my current role( job wise not $ )



With provincial/federal/cpp/ei take home would look like $6,295/month vs my current $5,300/month



**I'm going to contact new company today and ask them the following:**



What is the role salary band-ranges?



How are salary increases determined ? % etc



company performance bonus what are the targets ?



How often do i have to travel, what is the mileage $?



what would my schedule be 40 hours, 37.5 , is there overtime ?



company phone ?



if the division they are going to have me working from closes would i be moved to another division ?



I want to counter the 110k with 125k to maybe settle in the 120k range.



Any advice will be appreciated. I'll respond and provide more information needed.



last minutes adds to this: travel related.

Current main office is 40km round trip from home.  New job would be 42km round trip from home.

Travel locations- Current job is 234km round trip weekly, New job would be 388km round trip and 492km round trip however i don't know how often I would have to visit these sites.

1e1kpla,"After 4 1/2 months, I'm leaving at the WORST possible time","I'll keep this brief.

Started working a clerk role about 4 1/2 months ago.  My boss who hired me left after a month of me working here (he worked here 3 years ish).  He still works per diem, but never in the office.  So, there's a big loss as he covered many programs and had knowledge of the company.

I had 3 co-workers.  One was let go Monday, and I found out Tuesday that another co-worker passed away Sunday (rest easy, Ronald).  So now it's me (23 y/o) and a woman (75 y/o) who was retired but came back to work 3 days a week (probably because we're so backlogged and we begged her apparently).

The upshot of all this is that I'm going to grad school for econometrics in mid August and will be putting in my 2 weeks notice today.  I just feel like shit cause the CFO (now my current boss) seems like a nice guy, and the 75 y/o woman might have a heart attack in all seriousness.

They made it apparent that they're counting on me for a lot of responsibilities, but I would never forsee losing two of my co-workers within a 48 period.

I'm very, very nervous as I have never formally quit before.  I genuinely feel physically ill over this.  

Anyone have any advice, or similar experiences?

Thanks",HotCartographer60,21,0.8700000047683716,14,1720798711,2024-07-12 15:38:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e1kpla/after_4_12_months_im_leaving_at_the_worst/,7,2024
1e1kks8,Asked for salary expectations for being hired full-time out of an internship,"I currently have an internship in an MCOL area. Paid hourly with partial benefits (just health and 401k and the sick time required by state law). If salaried it would come out to 50k/year. I am basically doing instructional design, running workshops, managing a sharepoint site, doing some change management stuff, all part of an internal Data Literacy program. The program was in a pilot phase when the sole employee working on it left. They hired an intern (me) to get it up and running for the summer i would assume because my boss couldnt immediately get the funding to rehire the position?

My boss says he will likely offer me a full time posiiton and asked (said i didnt have to answer) what my expectation would be for salary. He said theres people who give him a salary range - typically a tight range - and then he decides within that range. He says he's just asking me so he knows my expectations, so when he hears the range he can compare and make sure it makes sense to offer it. He says ""say you told me you expect 300k, then I would just not offer you the position"", so he seems mostly concerned with my expectations being too high.

Questions:

If i say something too low, and the range he hears is much higher, could he offer my a salary below the range, or does his offer have to be within the range provided to him?

Will what I say influence what HE says to the budgeting people?

What if I just give him a top range? Like ""I wouldn't expect anything above 100k."" Then he just knows my expectations arent something insane.

The real answer is that I would take anything. I have no other prospects, really. But at the same time, I basically replaced a full time employee who had experience and a degree and whatnot - she was probably making quite a bit more than 50k. The more sensible ""real"" answer is I'd want at least 60k with full benefits. But again I'm afraid if I say 60k then he'll just pay me 60k when the range could have been higher.",relentless_endurance,3,0.8100000023841858,3,1720798366,2024-07-12 15:32:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e1kks8/asked_for_salary_expectations_for_being_hired/,7,2024

1e1jbt3,Civil Engineering Student Planning to Pivot - Advice on my Plan,"| (22F) am currently studying Civil
Engineering. I'll be graduating in the next two years, have done two internships, and was planning to do my masters in Geotech. The internships were great, and while I do enjoy my program, I realized that I'm not 100% sure if this is what I want to do in the future. I only took engineering because my dad wanted me to.
My plan is to graduate still, but within the next two years I'll be working on my personal passions, videography and writing. If I find some success doing this by the time I graduate, as in I can do it as a job, I won't pursue my masters and pivot towards that instead.
I want a second opinion on whether this is a good plan or not. I don't want to drop out as I want a backup plan in case it doesn't work out. But I'm not sure if the workload of my passions will be manageable with my school work and my part-time.

1e1idfa,"Within 4 months at my new internal role, I was transferred to another team. The new team has no work for me and the new manager said she'd have to think about what to give me. Should I begin looking for a new role?","I've (29M) been with my current company for about 2.5 years. I was promoted to a Finance Manager a year in and then we had a few reorgs. I decided to transfer to an internal role about 4 months ago as I wanted an opportunity that would challenge me and help me progress in my career. I was told the learning curve is steep and that it would take 6-12 months to acclimate. 

4 months in, I have not learned as much as I expected to. If I expected to understand 40% of the business by now, I really only understand 10%. I worked on one big project that improved an existing process and that keeps me busy for a 2-3 days out of the month. The rest of the month, I have ad-hoc tasks and requests. I also help other teams. I am working on another ongoing project but it's mostly a matter of waiting for someone to have time to meet with me. I've told my supervisor in various 1:1's that I'd like to learn more about the business and in turn, take on more work. I've tried to shadow her and sit in meetings to learn but she stopped that because some meetings were sensitive and confidential. 

Last week, I was told that I'd be moving out of my supervisor's team into another internal team that reports to my current supervisor. I had a 1:1 with my to-be supervisor and voiced that I was not currently being challenged and throughout the month, I have a lot of bandwidth and downtime. She understood and said that she'd have to think about what work she can give me because at the moment, her current team has a good handle on things and it doesn't seem like they're overworked. 

I am thinking of starting to apply to a new role elsewhere because as of right now, I don't see an opportunity for growth in my career here. While I don't mind collecting an easy check, I do want to work hard, be challenged, and move up in my career. However, my only hesitancy is that my 401k match vests towards the end of the year and if I leave before, I would lose that ""free"" money. And on a not so serious side, we're required to come in 3 days a week and for most of those 3 days, I'm sitting and doing nothing.

1e1huzi,Advice about salary negotiation?,"A few years ago I accepted a promotion to supervisor. I did a 1 year term contract, a 1 year temp assignment, took a 6 month medical leave of absence then accepted another 1 year term when I returned. Salary is negotiable and based on percentage. For example, when I accepted the first term without supervisor experience I was offered 88%. I countered with 90% but was rejected so I accepted 88%. The scale is 88%-110%

At the end of my first term I was placed in a temp assignment and given a 3% raise which is standard. When the temp expired I took a leave of absence for 6 months and was offered another 1 year term at 93% when I returned. I countered with “97%-100%” and accepted their next offer of 96%.

Other positions typically take 3-4 years to reach the top of the pay scale but at this rate it’ll take around 7 years total to reach the top of this scale. My current contract is close to expiring and I’ll likely be offered 3%.

My question is: How should I respond to a counter offer of a lower percentage than what I’m looking for? I’ve only ever accepted the counter offer from my employer so I’m wondering to say if I’m declined the counteroffer and essentially declining the term renewal. “Burning bridges” is unfortunately somewhat common in my department so I’d like to try to avoid that.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. TIA

it’d be helpful to search for graduate/ any jobs within the business sector that provide accommodation alongside a salary to move here in the UAE or Qatar as I’d really appreciate it. I have thoroughly checked GulfTalent but maybe I’m looking wrongly. Entry level with these benefits would help too.


Now I’m aware it’s somewhat common here and less in the UAE (although correct and advise me in that country if you wish), so I’ve graduated with a business degree and so many expats from England migrate to Qatar because of the lifestyle as well as the salary and benefits that comes with it, more so the company paying for your whole rent and accommodation on top of paying you your salary.

Doesn’t even need to be a specific graduate job, just a job that is attainable with such benefits

1e1cjf3,How do I ensure that my career path and job responsibilities are more clear?,"TL;DR I’ve been working in a start up company for almost a year now, my contract renewal is coming up, and they want to promote me and give me more roles and responsibilities. But it’s not entirely clear. 

To keep it brief, I joined this very niche start up as a senior / mid level projects coordinator, but quickly took up more leadership roles and responsibilities such as HR, admin, tasking, operations, etc. as those roles were vacant and other team members didn’t show any initiative or care enough. The general manager was/is pretty indifferent, useless, and other senior team members only do their job (barely) and clock out. I surpassed all of them in terms of how committed I am, how much the junior team relies on me, and how much the owners trust me. I additionally also recently led and handled a big multi-country project very well, mostly by my own. I became the de facto leader organically and it’s not what I signed up for. 

The owners have a plan of promoting me (with a pay increase) to a project director and general manager (kind of a double role, which isn’t clear yet) they want to build a team around me, and make me officially lead company operations. I have reservations because I don’t fully get this new role, I don’t really want a lot more work, I don’t trust or rely these seniors (and the old GM who will be demoted), and I don’t think I am ready for such a big jump - I’m 30 and have little managerial experience. I’m also worried that my social life will be gone, given the amount of work to do. What would you suggest I do?

I have a strong interest towards automotive designing, machinery, and so on, which of course would be the sole reason why i decided to step forward in my career towards mechanical engg.
However things did not go as planned. As mentioned, i started my career in the middle east with a very low salary, without any health benifits. Even basic requirements like the accommodation was below the living standards, so i decided to rent a bedspace with my own money. I worked in this cramped environment for 2 years hoping for a better tomorrow when suddenly i couldn't take it any more. I was feeling clusterphobic and let down. I gave my resignation and decided to go home with the little savings that i got. I was really in need of a recharge.
After about a year of staying at my home country, i decided to come back into the middle east for yet another voyage, another adventure, hoping this time around things would work out a bit better than the last time. It is worth mentioning out that before going back, i tried a thing or two to go to europe for work/higher studies. But had to quickly give up due to my lack of finance.
After going back to the middle east and attending a dozen of interviews, i finally landed on another job. This time also the manager who interviewed me tried to keep my salary as low as possible. Desperate to land on a job, i has no other choice than to comply. After working there about a year, i was wrongfully terminated by my manager because of jelousy by 2 of my colleagues. I later found out that they reported a lot of things i did not even commit to the managers. I desperately tried to convice the manager that they were lying and tried to give him proof. But he was not ready to listen to my verdict. Shocked and angry but in a lot of pain and disbelief, i slowly began to lose a track of myself. Everyday i was slowy but surely driven into unavoidable depression. Having understood that this has the potential  to make me avoid sunshine forever, i tried to redeem myself by searching for more opportunities. After attending 2 dozens of interviews and a lot of unwanted and undeserved judgements, i still was not able to land a job this time. I tried for almost the whole year, but still wasn't successful with my attempts, with recruiters referring mainly about my so called perfomance in previous company. Now almost 2 years passed and still no luck, i have anxiety problems just by getting an unknown call on my phone thinking that it may be from any HR.
I rarely do tell my career problems with anybody. But to my best friend, the only person to whom i expressed some of my past, he suggested me to go for higher studies in europe. But for me my problem still prevails as i come from a middle class family and could not afford the severe expenses that I would have to take ahead.
What should i do next, do any one have any suggestion that would change my life for the good? Cos am still in a lot of anxiety and broken, but not defeated. I want to take back my life.",GurOk4590,2,1.0,0,1720772654,2024-07-12 08:24:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e1cgh8/requesting_a_guidance_for_what_to_do_next_in_life/,7,2024

1e1bzf0,Should I stay or should I go?,"I need some input regarding a current dilemma I'm facing. My head feels like it's going to explode if I don't talk about it. If anyone has experienced something similar, please let me know what you did!

I have been working as a consultant for 4 years and was promoted this year to Associate Manager, with a total of 11 years in the industry across three companies. Among them, my current company offers the best culture I've ever experienced. I receive a lot of appreciation, am frequently sought after for new projects, and still maintain the work-life balance I need. Just this week, my boss called me and offered to promote me to manage our entire support cluster. I was selected. I never imagined I would be chosen for a managerial role! This is a significant challenge, but a great one that I'm excited to take on. 


Then here goes the dilemma. I was not actively looking for a new one and I just kept my professional profile updated online. A job offer has knocked on my door, the technology they are using is not my bread and butter at the moment but I do had experience (8yrs ago so I definitely need a refresher course). I passed all the interviews and got the job offer. This is a non-leadership role. I emailed them for my asking, which is additional 100% of my current salary. I haven't received a response from them yet. However, if they extend an offer, I'm unsure whether I should remain in my current position, which feels secure and familiar to me. I've been able to develop both my technical skills and my career here, and I finally feel like I'm making progress. 

Or should I Attempt to explore uncharted waters???

To be honest, the main thing tempting me to leave is the higher salary. As a career woman in my 30s, what I really crave is uninterrupted weekends. However, it's hard to turn down a significant increase in salary, isn't it?

1e1b6ut,Currently onboarding for one job but just finished second interview for preferred job? ,"Hi! I’m from SoCal. I am already onboarding for a registered nurse job. I received a tentative offer as long as background clears and health screening is fine. I’m currently in the health screening step. This job is for LA county. However, I just went in for a second round of interviews for another job in Orange County. This location has a better commute and I was able to do a meet and greet for the second round. I enjoy the role in this job much more and I feel like I would fit in well with this group. Everyone was kind and supportive. I can really see myself staying there long term. I am worried that I get a start date for LA county before Orange County (my preference) makes a decision. 

What should I do? I don’t want to burn any bridges with LA county but I would much rather have the job in Orange County. And of course, if I don’t get an offer from Orange County, I would like to still move forward with LA county. Also, Orange County said that this round of interviews is for their top candidates so I am assuming they may not have anymore interviews to go through. I only had one interview with LA county and then I received an offer 3 weeks after. Advice would be appreciated!

1e1augv,Seeking Advice on Handling a Difficult Work Situation,"Recently, a misunderstanding occurred where this colleague misinterpreted an email I sent and wrongly concluded that I had excluded her from important information. Without clarifying with me first, she escalated the matter directly to her manager. This has happened multiple times, as she tends to forward everything to her manager, making it difficult to establish trust and collaborate effectively.

The situation is further complicated by her belief that there are overlaps in our responsibilities, which adds to the confusion and tension. I understand that as a new team member, she may be eager to make an impact as soon as possible. However, these actions are causing significant disruptions.

I only became aware of the issue when my manager brought it up, and it seems that my manager is also struggling with the situation. While I would prefer to avoid her, I understand that this is not a practical solution in a professional setting. I can’t avoid her as I have to lead the project and she is going to play a big role in it. My manager, who is fair and a peacemaker, is rather excited that I have to deal with this situation to learn how to manage people.

I tend to be sensitive and usually avoid dealing with petty issues, but I recognize the need to confront this situation in a healthy and constructive manner.

Given these circumstances, I would greatly appreciate any advice or strategies you can offer on how to handle this situation constructively. How can I address her misunderstandings and foster a more cooperative working relationship? Additionally, how can I manage my emotional response to ensure it doesn’t impact my professional demeanor?

It was a remote job and I made a little bit of money for saving but I just got laid off today for reasons I don't know. I feel so lost and I haven't heard back from any jobs. I've been applying since Jan and have done over 300 apps but have had no luck since I haven't had prior experience (or at least I think that's why). I don't even know if this is what I want to do with my life as I had lost interest in computer science in my 3rd year but decided to finish my degree regardless as it was paid for. Business really interests me but I can't find many opportunities that would hire a fresh grad with little to no experience for any role. My goal has always been money but I don't know what I'm going to do now as the job search has yielded no fruit.

  
I'm currently living with my parents and I don't have really any expenses so I know I'll be fine for a little bit but I just need help/advice on what I should do next. I don't have any projects under my belt but maybe I should invest some time into creating some I can put in my portfolio but I don't know if software engineering is the role I want to do as I have little interest in it.

I am one of those super lucky reps on the other side of a 1 800 number lines.

I am having trouble thinking of what I would be able to go into from retirements. I really don’t want to work in it or financial securities again but I will if I have to. I unfortunately hate sales.

1e19f34,Career change for a park ranger?,"I’ve spent the last three years working in museum and park interpretation, but got hit with the realization that these careers aren’t for me. I love working with the public, but I’ve come to decide that the pay and lifestyle requirements for promotion simply aren’t worth the trouble. I have a dual Bachelor’s in History and English Literature, for all the good that does. I try so hard every day to not let myself get down, but it’s so hard. 

This is the field I always envisioned myself working in. I struggled through being underpaid and overworked, having to constantly move around and do seasonal gigs, to finally get a permanent position, only to realize that this is not the life for me.

I really enjoy helping and serving other’s, and I’m not even opposed to a transition into medicine, even with all the horror stories coming from that field in the past few years.

1e18zzt,Two career paths,"I am in a situation picking between two companies that both want me for my work ethic and skill set. I work well with everyone regardless if I like them or not and have made a name for myself in a very short time. 

I am tech/low level coordinator in environmental science and have been with my current company for 6 months. In my short time with the company I have proven myself as an asset, taking over entire scopes of work which I am experienced in and filling in gaps wherever needed. I have a bachelors degree and ~4 years of experience in similar work. I am pursuing a professional designation in my field with possibility of getting more than one professional designation. 

The client I am working for, at a large civil project, is looking to poach me from my company to work for them as a high level coordinator. 

My company is aware of this and is trying to retain me. I have recently met with my project manager (and plan on talking to the owner) who has offered me career development pathways which could be considered rare in my field. 

The client who is offering me a job is offering a better financial situation (salary with overtime) and opportunity to grow with the already large company. From the role they are offering me there is opportunity to climb ranks but over a long time frame. They also offer benefits, RSP matching and share options. They have some career development pathways but not to the extent of the company I currently work for.

The nature of the work the client has requires me to work 2 weeks on 1 off which I have been doing since the start of my career. After this project if I am to continue with the company I will be required to be in camp/live away from home for the weeks I am working. I currently live in the same town where I work. I am able to live anywhere in my country and the company will fly me in to work the shifts.

The company I am working is relatively small (40 people at peak season). They can offer me a wage close to what the client is offering but I will have a tough time increasing from that rate until I am managing or a partner, even then I will not increase in wage very much. They can also offer benefits but cannot offer RSP options or any financial bonuses. 

That being said my company is able to provide me with professional development in any direction I choose. I like the upper management of the company but do not enjoy working with everyone at the worker level and would prefer more responsibility/management which they are willing to give me in time. I will be able to live where I currently am, and would like to continue be. The company has work in the general area and I would be able to choose projects I want to pursue.

The work life balance will be much better at the company I am currently with, as I progress in my career I can choose my own schedule working from home in the evenings if I want to do something non-work related in the day. Having my own schedule also has drawbacks as I progress in my career becoming more relied upon I will need to take calls/emails when I am doing whatever activities on my “off time”. 

Whereas with the clients company I am locked into work for the two weeks (excluding evenings at the moment) and have full freedom for my week off.

Both are lifetime careers. My company has mentioned they understand the client can provide better financials but believe they can provide better career development and work life balance which I agree with. They also have mentioned they do not have any hard feelings if I choose to leave for the client company, stating it is good to know someone who is capable on the other side. If I am to leave I am sure I would be able to return to the company if I so choose although I am not sure at what level I would return at. One project manager similarly left the company (early in the company’s existence) and returned years later and is now a project manager.

I am young and still in very early years of my career. At the moment I’m torn between the two as they’re both great opportunities.

1e175sc,nursing vs social work?,"Hi!



I am a 21 year old student in a Canadian university who is studying to become a social worker. I am in a general social justice program and plan to get my MSW after graduation. I started working at a hospital last year and I manage the front desk, but I've shadowed some nurses during the less busy shifts and I really like the idea of nursing. If I take this route my plan is to do an extra year of undergrad to get my physiology and bio requirements and then apply to accelerated two year nursing program. The MSW would be two years as well so the same time frame. And I would like to do medical social work if I chose this option, or possibly working internationally via UNICEF so I could travel and do social work abroad.



I'm not sure what to choose and I'm stuck! Please help any advice would be appreciated.



WHY SOCIAL WORK: • Help people • enjoy psychology and behavior • enjoy learning about neurons and the areas of the brain + functions. • Having clients and connecting to them • lots of workplace options



WHY NOT SOCIAL WORK: • I'm not super passionate about a particular social justice issue. I firmly believe in human rights (access to water / education) but havent done much work in it. There are people in my program who have done so much work in international companies or local organizations, they have a drive to make things better. I'm more individualistic, as in making things better for a person. • worried I would be settling for a career - do I feel as if I'm not smart enough for anything else? • I'm afraid of handling human abuse cases even in hospital work. • will I regret choosing this?



WHY NURSING • Help people • like learning about the heater and the brain Childhood development • likes multiplication useful for nursing •I want to learn a technical skill and this is the best profession for me that has this



WHY NOT NURSING



•12+ Hour shifts • career error- choosing the wrong thing • making critical medical mistakes • does this align with me or should I do it because I think the grass may be greener? ▪︎ would like holidays off • afraid of missing out on family and special life moments because of nursing • what if I realize social work isn't for me after i graduate from my masters and then I can't enroll in nursing because I'm unable to get into college again to achieve prerequisites? • what if I don't want to do nursing after nursing school?",TigerOrdinary7057,1,1.0,0,1720753427,2024-07-12 03:03:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e175sc/nursing_vs_social_work/,7,2024

1e15ogn,How do I make my resume stand out if my title hasn’t matched the work I’ve been doing? (HR & Training specific),"I (27f) have been at the same company for almost 6 years, since I worked my way up to being to sole employee of what used to be a 3 person Learning and Development Team (we are in transition and I am getting a new boss after being alone for 6 months ish. I am not bitter about getting a new boss or anything like that, she seems great.)

However, I have had the same title all 6 years, which is “training coordinator” instead of promoting me, or at the very least giving me a title change to “Manager of Training” at any point. I have been told in the past that I can’t get promoted to the current manager of training role because it is a “step down” for me based off my current responsibilities (even though it pays more, the role really only babysits new managers through their 9 weeks of training- which is very helpful, but I like having ownership of the material and sharing ideas- my role is more innovative- I have also filled in for the role for months multiple times, on top of my own workload, while in transition to fill the role due to turnover) 
They eventually eliminated that role and kept only me, which left me taking over a lot of that work load on top of the instructional design and company events/internal communication responsibilities.
My boss quit right after they eliminated that role, so I also immediately took over most of her task, and had to work with the COO to strategically decide what things need to be put on pause until they hired a new Director of Training. 

Since I worked my way up my pay isn’t competitive at all. I’ve been offered 2 jobs for almost double my salary, that were both a step down responsibility wise. I turned both down because I enjoyed the growth and experience I was receiving at my current role at the time. 

I very much want to go into more of a leadership role, and have more HR knowledge (I already do orientations, onboarding, manage people through their training, lead Teams, lead/plan all company wide meetings & celebrations, write training manuals, etc.) but I would like to learn more in HR. 
My new boss is asking me to go more of a Field Trainer route, which does not align with my personal development plan so I have started looking at other companies that I feel align with my goals to advance my career. 

My questions are below 

1. Any advice on how to stand out on applications? I am looking into a SHRM-CP certification. I would love to go for the SHRM-SCP certification but I feel like it will not help since my title does not accurately represent the level of work I’ve been doing for 3+ years. 

2. Specific roles in HR that make sense for a next step in my career. Salary goal is 75k+ 

3. Any other development advice from training or HR professionals that were helpful in general, not just for resumes (books, classes, podcast, etc.) 

I guess I am feeling a little bit of imposter syndrome for some reason, which is why I rambled so much

Also- please no hate for turning down the better paying roles, benefits weren’t as good, and like I said, I was gaining a ton of on the job experience in my role even though my title and pay didn’t match, now I’m trying to cash in 😁

1e13d0v,Fully Focus on my Career or Hedge my bet with a MA?,"I finally completed a long held goal of mine when I got my BA in Television, Film, and Media with a focus on Screenwriting. 

I am pursuing my hobby of Screenwriting as a career now but wanted to hedge my bet with a Masters Degree. 

My thought is that a MA in History will broaden my available knowledge as I work as a Screenwriter. Down the road, I would want to possibly teach and the topic of History has always been an interest of mine. 

My fear is that getting an MA in History will offer an out in terms of my pursuit of a career as a Screenwriter. My academic success and overall feedback is positive and lends itself well towards me feeling good about my ability as a Screenwriter.

The MA degree could help me become a better screenwriter but in reality, it’s not necessary. The only reason I would really be getting it is because I have a little downtime and could knock out the degree in a year or so. It’s more about having a backup path but it would require time and energy that could be spent screenwriting.

I’m feeling lost despite having a clear professional goal. I just know that at this age, having my bases covered is smart. Based on previous behavior, I could see myself cutting loose the screenwriting ambitions for something more safe, like teaching if times were to get real tough.

Do I sacrifice more time to hedge my bet on overall security or do I focus heavily on my screenwriting? 

Does anyone have experience working full time early in their career whilst getting their Masters Degree?


****Background: I turn 38yrs old on the 16th. I am the youngest Male of 6 children who were raised by a single Mother. I am the first to attend college and graduate. All my siblings have blue collar professions, play it relatively safe and are better because of it. I live in outside of Los Angeles and have well established contacts in the Screenwriting/Hollywood Community.

1e128ae,Should I stay or go?,"I currently work at a local college. I was a teacher but had been trying to transition out for a while as I am exploring PhDs in Higher Ed Policy. I’ve talked to current students and professors at my schools of choice, have narrowed down my research interests, and know that this is what I want to do, hopefully being accepted in the next year or two.

Here’s my dilemma: currently, my job pays absolutely nothing. Although I work long hours and work intimately with multiple colleges and universities in the area, doing marketing, enrollment, data analysis, recruitment, etc, I am literally barely making ends meet. I make $2k/month. I can’t even afford to rent a place so am living with family for the time being. My partner is also transitioning and has started his own company, so finances are very tight. The school I work for is on the brink of losing accreditation for being a political shitstorm. I do like my boss, but my position is super unorganized and I’m wondering if they hired me as part of a retention plan in an attempt to keep the college alive. Apparently my position is “pivotal” to the organization, but they won’t budge on pay.

HOWEVER

I was offered a position starting in the fall as an adjunct faculty member teaching 4 credits. It’s not much more money at all, but it does help the CV as it’s aligned with my overall goal after obtaining my PhD. That means I would be working my full time job as well as teaching for basically the same pay, and I would have to be here through next year.

We do not want to be living with family as it is truly a toxic environment for us both and we are in an area of the country we don’t want to be. We desperately want to move, but we realize we have two options: I get a new job that pays more so that we can save for a move, or I get accepted into the PhD program of choice which is fully funded and we move then. 

My question is: should I stay or should I go? On one hand, staying allows me to put college teaching experience on my resume and improves my chances of being accepted into a PhD program. On the other hand, I risk staying and continuing to make no money not knowing if I’ll even be accepted.

I have yet to do an internship as well, don't know how or where to start. Is it wiser for me to take my time, and graduate in maybe 3 years, and get straight A's, (my transfer GPA is 3.2 so I have a ways to go to boost it to anything near a 4.0) or should I just progress at a normal pace, sacrificing good grades, get mostly B's and C's, and graduate sooner and get into the field faster and get on that job experience? 

My logic is that I am probably not going to get into a fancy company even with a good GPA with how saturated everything is, so I might as well graduate sooner so I can start making more than $16 an hour. And after the 1st job they don't care about GPAs anyways (right..?)

So I guess is it more valuable to have a good GPA, or an extra year of work experience while a mediocre GPA? After my 1st job, will my work experience from that 1st job be just as valuable as my GPA if say I did want to apply to a tech giant like Google or Microsoft?

1e117jw,Tech industry advice pls ! ,"Hiii everyone, 

I need some advice on my situation and the best path to take for beginning my career in tech. This August I will be going into my senior year of college, graduating May 2025 with a bachelor’s in CS. 

Although I have enjoyed coding up until this point, it is not my passion and I have always been more of a business oriented person and do very well managing a team. Therefore, I think I would be best suited for a non-technical (or very minimally) role at a tech company. PM maybe?

Throughout college I have had the unique opportunity to work as a Personal Assistant/Estate Manager to an UHNW individual. I work on a team of 20+ house staff, managing virtually everything that goes on in my boss's life, who comes and goes at the house, etc. It has been an incredible experience that has helped me grow in many ways. Also making six figures as a college student was a plus. 

Eventually, my career goal is to work my way up to a top executive position at big tech/startup (ambitious i’m aware). 

I have a very strong referral from a Senior Executive Assistant at a top tech company. She seems very confident that she can get me an EA position given my background. My questions are:

- Should I take the EA position just to get a big name on my resume (in this job market!), and then try to work my way up to PM or something like 1 year in? 

- Or should I just directly apply to various PM roles? (She could still give me a referral to this company but wouldn’t have as much influence and I assume there would be much more competition)

- How realistic is it for an EA to transition to the roles I am aiming for?

- I rarely see any entry-level PM positions across companies, just senior. What roles do these applicants typically come from? 



Any advice is GREATLY APPRECIATED! Thank you for your time!!

1e10x9r,What degree should I get after completing my pre-requisites?,"I graduated as an LPN in 2018 and started working an office job as a case manager almost immediately after graduation. My job went remote which I loved and it made me realize how much I enjoy remote office work and how much I dislike hands on nursing. 

I know the most logical next step would be getting an RN degree which was my original plan, but I don’t want to be a nurse anymore and would like to branch out into risk management/ medical coding/ informatics. The RN bridge program is only 12 months long and I have already been accepted into the program, but the more I think about it the more I realize I don't want to go through nursing school again. 

I also don’t want to waste the two years I spent completing my pre-requisite courses, so I want to get a degree in something. I have learned a lot about risk adjustment and medical coding which interests me so I am considering a degree in health information management which is completely online. 

One of the community colleges near me combines technical diploma credits with pre-requisite credits which satisfies the requirements for a general associates of applied science degree. I have all the class hours I need for the associates degree. The only bad thing is having a general associates of applied science would be pretty useless on its own, but could be a stepping stone to a bachelors degree. 

The school also offers a medical coding program and the credit hours count toward an associates in health information management. I could self study on my own for a medical coding certification, but this way my time would go toward a useful degree in health information management. 

I’m not sure if I should get my general associates of applied science degree, take the coding program and then work toward an associates in health information and then a bachelors, or just deal with one year of nursing school and get my RN anyway. Does anyone here have a similar experience?

1e10ci8,"Huge school problem, need help.","Class problems. How to solve this problem?

I wanted to change my class because i got extremly bullied by classmates. My parents supported me to change class, keep that in mind. Principal told me i can change my class and on the day i should have went to that other class, he ended up making up a fake story why i cant change class. The real reason was because there was no space for 1 more there. That was in january and i had to stay with my class untill the end of this school year and the bullying continued. Recently my friend from the class i wanted to go wrote me a message saying that 1 of his classmates changed class and that there is a free spot. 
Same second i ran to my parents to tell them about it and thats when the huge problem started. My mother asked me 2 weeks ago if i still wanted to change class, i told her no because i was not in mood for a talk and i knew there is no space for me. Well, she knew from her friend who works in my school that there is a free spot in that class but still didnt told me when she asked about the class change. She talked with that friend and with my main teacher(sorry, dont know how to write that in english, anyways, that is the teacher whose in charge for class behaving and stuff like that). Now that friend(also main teacher of the class i want to move in), my mother and my main teacher think everything is ok while it is not. I still get bullied online event tho it is summer and there is no school. 
Now, after all that talk my mother did, she refuses to apply for class change and she keeps lying that that other class is evil too while i know it is not. 
What the hell should i do, it is mid july right now and im scared that my place in that class will be taken by somebody else if im not fast with the application.

1e10bre,How should I plan my career path?,"Im from Sweden and I will go to college in the US in 2025 (not decided which college). Im thinking about a career as an Investment banker and later transitioning into private equity, on the premise that I will do well as an investment banker.

As someone from overseas I am not entirely familiar with the process, my plan right now is that I go to college and get a bachelors in finance. Then I transfer to a university of higher academical status and take an MBA (Master of business administration). At that point I think that I should have applied for internships and hopefully I have one at a decent bank. For context I got 1550 on my SAT this spring so I am confident I would do alright in school. After I have interned hopefully I can get a job as an investment banking analyst and 2-something years later as an associate. After that there is a possibility I get scouted to private equity but only if I do well.

1e0zvr5,deciding between 2 different paths?,"I am trying to decide between two different paths professionally. One is 100% remote and allows me to take off as much time off as I want whenever I want (completely unpaid time off, this is 1099/self-employed - don't work, don't get paid). The other is in person W2 for the first 2-3 years, then remote potential, but most likely always unable to take off more than a few weeks a year.

Being 100% commission based/self-employed doing retirement planning (selling financial products) vs. being a W2 employee working in commercial insurance. I have been doing the retirement income planning on and off for the past few years and have had some serious challenges with previous business partners (mentors to teach me the business). Previously it was not profitable or sustainable. 

I am now very recently (last 2 weeks) with a good mentor who has thus far shown to have everything to run a sustainable, highly profitable business - good marketing, spending enough on ads to generate sufficient lead flow, good sales process and products, etc. I don't think this is what I would spend the next 30+ years of my career doing; I would get bored, but assuming it all goes accordingly, it would allow me the ability to go travel while I'm young (27) and don't yet have any kids. It would also provide the flexibility to pursue other entrepreneurial ventures should I become curious (which I'm sure I will in the future).

I have done very little travel in my life, but have wanted to since I was 21/22. Have tried to pursue entrepreneurial ventures for years to enable this desire, but haven't been able to make it work yet financially.

The W2 commercial insurance work, however, seems more intellectually stimulating (different customers, complex products/solutions, far more technical) and relationship based. It's an industry with a lot of entities/individuals involved, so it's highly relationship based - many have said their customers/coworkers genuinely become their friends (and I can tell this isn't BS).

Also, commercial has the potential to build an actual business (start as an employee, but eventually build your own individual 'book of business'). Meaning, not just being 'self-employed' where income starts at 0 every year + is tied directly to hours worked. 'Actual business' = Recurring revenue + able to build a team that operates independently + able to potentially be sold in 10 plus years. Simply put, much more upside longer term in commercial insurance, but I believe I'd make more in the next 2-3 years in the retirement income planning.

If I could go travel for 3, 6, or 12 months and 'scratch the itch' I think the decision would be much easier. I'd be much more okay with working in person. Thinking about being full time in an office right now though definitely makes me feel trapped. 

Ideal scenario would be I could work in the office most of the time, but go work remote for a month or so while traveling/living abroad. Not sure how to make this decision truthfully.

I have not had any write-ups or conflict with anyone at the organization and get along well with my co-workers, unlike my boss who has created conflict with many people and lacks productivity when working from home to the point where she was reported by a fellow coworker.  When she was reported, she claimed the job responsibilities were too much for one person,  so they hired me to work under her.  Since i’ve been hired, i’ve been bullied by her and even demeaned in meetings that our CFO (who is her boss) also attended.  She has not taught me relevant responsibilities to my job besides making purchase orders, when I am supposed to be doing purchase orders, expense reports, and invoices.  
Around 8 months I inquired with her about transitioning to a full-time position to which she said they are not making changes until the fiscal year is up, to which I was understanding and patient.  I inquired again today as we have just started a new fiscal year, to which she said they are now on a “hiring freeze”.  They have hired a few other part-time employees after me, and they have given them a macbook pro to work with.  I was given a Dell and when I have asked my boss to work on a mac, she gives me the excuse that Quickbooks doesn’t work on Mac which is a lie because all of our executives use Quickbooks on their Mac desktops and laptops.

This is a typical problem that many new hires run into; they don't know how to meet expectations and be acknowledged for their efforts. 



To exceed expectations and never receive such negative feedback again, employ these three key strategies:



* **Complete Tasks Efficiently:** Optimize your workflow to complete tasks on time or even ahead of schedule. This demonstrates strong time management skills and the ability to manage multiple priorities effectively.



* **Bring Fresh Ideas:** Don't just complete tasks, actively look for ways to improve them. Propose innovative solutions, identify areas for optimization, and contribute fresh perspectives to projects.



* **Anticipate Needs:** Don't wait to be told what to do. Be proactive and anticipate your manager's needs. Identify potential roadblocks and take initiative to address them before they arise.

1e0wfk7,"7 months into a good job, but don’t like the location and miss home","Okay, so I’m 27 years old, and in December I started a decent job, my first actual career that I went to uni to study for in 2019. This job has required me to move about a 2 hour drive from home and about an hours drive from a city that I love, which is also full of my friends.

The place I have moved to for this job is desolate for somebody my age. Don’t get me wrong, it’s beautiful, but it’s quiet and the opportunities to meet people my age here are very very low. It’s a seaside retirement town in North Wales (I’m trying to keep this as anonymous as possible). 

2021 - early 2023 were the best years of my life so far. I had family and friends around me, a relationship, time for my hobbies and passions, however I lacked a career and I had some anxiety around that, but I was so much happier than I am now. In that time between uni and now, I basically built a whole new life, then the opportunity finally arose for me to go into something I studied, so fresh out of a relationship and heartbroken…I went for it.

To cut the long story short, I sacrificed a lot for this career and to move where I have, but right now I really dislike living here and I miss the things I had before. 

I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place: either I stay here, be patient, build my life again slowly in an environment that is currently killing my soul, or hit a hard reset and go back home and try to find something else. 

I’m homesick, heartbroken (still), lonely, nostalgic and bored.

But hey, at least I have my career. 

Giving it up doesn’t even seem like an option, it seems ridiculous and I don’t see anything beyond it. So I guess I’ll stay and try my best to work things out. This is just a rant and to get my feelings out, but advice is appreciated.

1e0u654,Life After Retail - Feeling Really Down and Looking for Advice,"Hello! Apologies in advance - this will be a somewhat long one. 

I have spent 16 years of my professional life in sales leadership and operations. I was the store manager for multiple companies, with my longest stays being about 6 years each at two different companies. I worked my way up from seasonal sales associate, getting promoted 6 months after hire - I'm a hard worker. I lead teams between six and almost 100 with holiday hiring. I handled HR needs (hiring/onboarding/scheduling/paychecks/payroll management/paperwork/personnel issues/performance management/training and development), sales needs (sales goals/sales plan/sales techniques/product training), and operational needs (supply ordering/maintenance/IT troubleshooting/cash handling and registers/preparing and submitting invoices/payment portals/expenses/POS and software system mastery and training/customer service and customer issues). I'm sure there's things I haven't listed; anyone who has managed retail will tell you that you have to be a master of many, many things in a given day. 

 Two years ago I finally was able to get out of retail and got a service coordinator job. It's client-facing, but is supporting the sales department with invoicing, CRM management, coordinating lots of deadlines and information with other departments (one of my main areas of focus is international conferences, so I speak to marketing, tradeshow teams, programming, etc). In a given morning, I'll touch three product lines and speak to two other teams before 9 AM. I handle a lot, but my role is mostly treated as 'customer service' since I am the liaison between everything my company does and the customers: I send their invoices, deadlines, and specs as needed and answer their questions. Last year we implemented an event fulfillment system and I own adding event sponsors and inputting their information and deadlines into this proprietary software. I came into this industry knowing nothing about any of the software I use on a daily basis and now own spreadsheets/resources used by multiple teams. 

I like the job but it's a dead end. It's a not-for-profit, which means I took a small pay cut when I left retail. The pay is becoming harder and harder to manage, and opportunities for advancement are incredibly few and far between. A role recently opened up for a sales operations manager; great, I thought! I'm a shoe-in! I did this for 13 years before I came here and I was damn good at it! Nope, a woman who used to do sales operations for <2 years got the role because the director 'knows her better and sees the potential.' I'm completely devastated, since this is the first thing I've seen that directly spoke to what I spent all those years doing. I feel hopeless that I'll ever be truly successful. I'm making south of $50k annually and I could never afford to live on my own. I'm tired of budgeting to the last penny and praying that I don't have any emergencies. 

I've been applying to any job that speaks to the many facets of what I used to do - payroll, HR, project management, sales operations - and never get callbacks. I've submitted at least 25 applications already this week. If I hear back, it's a polite rejection. I've reached out to job posters with a tailored follow-up greeting and still get radio silence. I have reached out to those in my network, although most of my network is still retail-based. I know some people are very happy working retail/service hours, but I just can't anymore. I want more and know I'm capable of more, but I can't seem to convince recruiters and hiring managers I can do more than fold t-shirts and ring on a register. My partner told me that he can't continue to lose out on the passive income of renting out the small extra bedroom I use for my office (I WFH a few days a week) and the guest room so I have until January 1 to make $80k or I have to move out - we split the bills 50/50 but he owns the house. I told him I couldn't afford to pay the market rent in our very HCOL area when he bought the house (which he said was fine) but split property taxes/water/utilities but he's upset with my low salary and feels like I'm not following his outdated advice (exaggerating my credentials, cold calling, and sending my resume out blind)  - so I'm pretty desperate to find something. 

  
If anyone has advice about how to better speak to my abilities to recruiters and hiring managers or has been able to successfully make the jump to a mid- or senior-level role from retail, I would appreciate the advice. 

FWIW I have begun the Google Project Management Certificate program through Coursera. I didn't end up finishing my degree and cannot afford to go back to school right now.

1e0tsh5,I (23F) am thinking of switching jobs- need advice ,"I (23F) work at a boarding school in my home state. I absolutely love my job, but the hours can be intense (7am-11pm M/W, 7-3pm T/Th/F and every other weekend from 7am-11pm). Again, I love what I do and my community, so the hours haven’t bothered me at all. My only issue is I want to get an additional degree, and getting my class work done is next to impossible with my other commitments to fitness, friends, and family.

I was offered a job in California for 33% more than what I’m currently making and I’m hoping to negotiate. I’ve always wanted to leave my home state and I’m scared that if I stay in my home state I’ll never make the jump. The hours are also different (3pm-10pm daily) and I’d be able to attend in person classes in the morning. The caveat is that the administration has 1.5 stars on Glassdoor. Im inclined to take this with a grain of salt because of the high turnover rate my position inherently has, but I don’t think administration is going to be as good as mine now.

My current boss is expecting me to stay at this job for 2 years. If I accept this new offer, I’d have to leave immediately, breaking my word with minimal notice to my boss. I’m a cherished staff member in my organization and I might be able to come back here, but leaving with this terms might make it so I can’t come back if I make the decision to switch jobs.

","Hi i'm trying to survive a toxic workplace. I've been working nonstop 8 hours a day, 7 day per week, for 4 month and only getting 100 dollar for each month!! 😭

I'm 20 years old(f) from the middle east living in a small city. I had to take the first remote job I could find to help my family's financial crisis. i hope you understand.

I applied for a remote job, entry-level position in a German startup. I became assistant CEO but in reality, I'm doing the work of 5 people! they assigned me Marketing, Content Creation, UX/UI Design, Customer Support and Quality Assurance all at the same time!!

I worked tirelessly thinking that I'm working for a big German company but then I realized they are actually a small team of 12 all from Iran. (that's why the money was so low)

It was my friend who invited me to work there. she said that i fit the job because i'm capable and can wear so many different hats. she was right but honestly working this much for a 100 dollar is just offensive.

I just wanna quit but I'm afraid she might get mad at me. I don't want to ruin our friendship. also the company policy requires 60 days notice.

How do I disappear entirely? can I tell them my laptop suddenly got broken and I can't get online? my laptop had troubles before due to overwork. 😥 i had to spend all my money to fix it and be able to continue working.🤦🏻‍♀️ If something goes wrong again I will never be able to repair my laptop. I can't even afford to buy a new one. 😭

If I tell them that i don't have a functioning laptop anymore, will it be a white lie? or will i be in trouble?

is there any chance this method can help me survive and get away?

If you have any other solution please tell🙏🏻 i appreciate your help.🥺",ReadingAway8731,4,0.8299999833106995,12,1720715195,2024-07-11 16:26:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e0t2k9/whats_the_safest_exit_strategy_to_survive_a_toxic/,7,2024
1e0s5rg,Should I pursue an Engineering degree or continue to pursue employment.,"Hello All,

First time poster here. I (24M) have completed a Biology degree, I have been applying to jobs and due to the current market have not been successful in any hits. Within that time I have been exploring electronics, arduino and writing code. I learned more about myself and my interests and I have learnt machine learning and have continued to build my skills. I was intrigued by this field and really enjoy the problem solving aspect of it all and decided to just apply back to school for an Engineering degree. I got in and am expected to start this fall. Someone in my ear, (my mother) is 100% disagreeing with my choices and thinks that going back to school full time is a horrible option for me as she wants me to go to school part time and continue to try to find jobs using a career coach. I feel that these career coaches can be somewhat of a scam. 

I honestly do not agree with this mindset as I will be on an accelerated path with this engineering degree and truly enjoy the field. I know it will be hard to do and accomplish but I am prepared to work hard for it. I also feel like it is better to admit I went down the wrong path and take a step back than to try and push through on this current one (pursuing a job). 

Any advice would be appreciated. I just want to keep my mind open to any ideas and maybe I'm being too rigid with my thinking (as she told me). I think it is better for me to push through with school and find a job in a field I enjoy than to do a part time degree that takes longer to complete.

1e0rsmo,Stay at current role or take on new role with similar pay?,"Job 1: current - Operations Manager 

Company car: pays for my insurance & any company gas (saves me $400 a month - Insurance is a rip off where I am).

50k

No benefits 

Working 50-55 hours a week, 44 in store and the rest I’m working from home. I do the job of 3-4 people/ wear many hats (procurement manager, store manager, sales rep, and driver) and it’s becoming exhausting. All I do is sleep when I am off and I have little time to invest in myself. Some days are 12-15 hours. I’ve saved the company tons of money but they are a small business and refuse to reinvest some of that money into me. 

Job 2: offer - Cold calling position 

9-5 strict schedule 
A few events per year (4-5) I will have to work at
Quarterly Commission 
Benefits 

55k but counter offered $60k due to my experience in the industry.

Not the most comfortable with cold calling but the role does have some aspects I have not experienced in my 5 ish years in the same operations/management role. My biggest fear is not closing enough sales or becoming bored (I have adhd and my current position keeps me on my toes - but is also overwhelming).

After doing my budget, due to having to pay for insurance on my own, I will make $200 more per month. 

Biggest benefit will be commission, health benefits (Ontario Canada) and a more balanced schedule so I can pop in side jobs & self care.

I am struggling with my decision mainly because the monetary difference is not much. $200. I will have to purchase my own car which will drain my current savings of $6k. 

I am comfortable where I am despite the chaos (I basically run the company). I don’t like that I utilize a company vehicle but not paying insurance has been great. 

What would you do?

I'm a 24 year old student from Belgium, currently studying computational statistics. I will graduate next year and I want to start my career as a data scientist. 

Given that I'm still young, I would also love to work abroad for a few years. In the first place for the experience, but I'm also curious about where the best opportunities are. (For now, I'm especially interested in the US, Canada and Switzerland.)

Therefore, I have a few questions and I would greatly appreciate any advice or experiences you could share:

- For those of you who have moved abroad to work as data scientists, where did you go and what has your experience been like? What were some of the challenges and rewards? 

- I'm aware that the cost of living might be higher in some countries, but is it still worth it in terms of career growth and salary?

- How difficult is it to apply for a workers visa in the US or other countries? How will I have the best chances?

- Any other tips or advice for someone who wants to make this move? 

Thank you in advance for your help! I'm looking forward to read about your experiences.

1e0pz39,"""can't"" leave family business - Just doing what is expected and nothing else. Should I be feeling bad about it?","Hello there,

First of all I know I can quit the job and I make the decisions in my life. My point is the question at the bottom.

Here is the situation: I'm 36 and for the last 10 years I've been working in family business (but it is a big business, but still, family owned by 2 families). 

I am a little bit underpaid for my role (legal services) but that is not an issue. The thing is I've been very frustrated for long years because I want to take more responsability around other areas, be more relevant and grow inside the company. I pursued education outside my area after Uni so I could be a more ""complete"" professional.

The struggle is my father, the founder, is a very competent guy who is an extreme micromanager, who doesn't delegate and doesn't share relevant information most of the time. To those points I don't think its personal because that is the way he is with most people.

What is really different towards me is that during meetings, lunches or other situations with people I am quiet most of the time and if I start sharing my thoughts he interrupts me all the time. Sometimes I feel its like a father thing he may be afraid I say something stupid, idk. But that happens all the time. I spoke to him about it. He always says he will try to avoid it and then it happens again.

I had enough and decided to talk to him that I am not satisfied, that I wanted more space, that I was starting to consider options out of the company. He said I was growing etc that I had to be patient, etc etc, and that he really appreciates having me around. 

**So it seems to me he doesn't give me space but appreciates having me around.**

I don't wanna burn bridges right now for 2 reasons.

1) It's a family thing. If I quit suddenly I'm afraid it damages the relation.

2) Money. I have two very small side business that together could pay only 1/3 of my bills. So I need this payment.

  
I think point 2 is more important than 1. I can't stay here forever just to make him happy while i'm unhappy.

**So, considering leaving right now is not an option, I decided to adjust my expectations:**

**Instead of all the time trying to help with everything around, know what is going on, go after stuff, I decided to be passive.**

**I'm only gonna do what I'm asked for. Do it well. But only what comes to me.** 

So that is gonna give me some free time at the office that I would spend reading books, studying a 4th language, focusing on my business and considering other options.

**The thing is everytime I consider I would come to the office to read a book while nothing shows up I feel bad. Should I?**

1e0odsg,How to move forward several years after being terminated via settlement agreement,"I was recently terminated and offered severance in exchange for signing a release of claims against the company, and I haven't been able to move forward in life, or professionally. 

I was terminated exactly 7 months after the day I took medical leave for being involved in a car accident. I only shared details of the car accident with my direct manager and requested that it not be shared throughout the organization for fear of others concluding that I was ""unstable"". 

The day in question was also the date of an important presentation which I had been asked to present at. It was believed that my last-minute medical leave was done spitefully/deliberately in order to avoid having to do the presentation.

The official reason for my termination, exactly 7 months after the car accident, was directly tied to the presentation, and I was advised by everybody to take the severance payout. Moreover, I was advised by a lawyer that it would be difficult to definitively prove that my car accident was the sole reason for my termination.

This ordeal was devastating for me, and I felt paralyzed for months afterwards. When I began interviewing for jobs in the months following, I didn't know how to speak about why I left my previous job which I had held for several years. It perplexed the companies I was interviewing with, and they sensed there was something I was hiding and not being truthful about.

Truthfully, there WAS something I was not explaining to them, and I didn't know how to speak about my termination in a way that was professionally acceptable and honored the release of claims.

It has caused tremendous difficulty in securing another job in the same field, leading to large gaps in my employment history.

Lately, I've begun thinking about just moving into a completely different career field altogether, basically starting over from scratch. 

This has all made me feel incredibly defeated, like I got chewed up, spit out, and left without any way forward. It has been utterly devastating to think that I will never again have a career that I had worked so hard for.

1e0ndco,"High School Graduate, Struggling to Choose b/w Bsc (Hons) Biochem + Msc Biotech (or similar) vs B Pharm + M Pharm","Hi, I just graduated from CBSE board in India, and priorly aspired a career in medicine (before 11th grade), but have came into a conclusion that it is not for me due to a negligible work-life balance and a good amount of years before any substantial income. 

So searched for alternatives, and currently in the stated dilemma.

My main concern, if I have to be honest, is the pay that both sectors offer. 

I'm aware that India has no great facilities or opportunities in sectors like biotech and bioinformatics. So, my desired path was to pursue Bsc Hons Biochemistry (Hopefully from University of Delhi, hopefully because results are impending) and then proceed with Msc Biotech or Bioinformatics in Europe (and I think this is a good point to mention that I will be relying on scholarships for that because I don't have any hefty funds). 

But I started questioning if it will be the best choice to earn good. Another alternative that I could muster (and find interest in) is B Pharm + M Pharm. Most of the people I've talked to from this industry say Pharma is far better than Biotech and that B Pharm I can do from any college but M Pharm from a good one. 

I also plan on doing MBA while I work after my masters (for either course). I'm good with studies, I like studying but highest paying sector (and job within that sector) is my ultimate objective.

I've researched A LOT, and asked SO MANY people, but I cannot decide, it comes to a stand still with equal amount of pros and cons with both. And maybe searching so much is clouding my judgement but this is my last shot. What do you suggest?

1e0n8yb,Is it a bad idea to take a slightly riskier job as an early career Engineer?,"So, I'm \~2 years into my career as an Engineer. To cut to the chase, I basically hate it. I chose to do Engineering since I love math and problem solving, but my current role consists only of paper pushing and writing reports. I understand that my problem is not with Engineering as a whole, but rather my specific job. I can safely say that I absolutely loathe corporate and cubicle life, and can confidently say that's a part of my personality that won't ever change.

  
I'm looking for a new job, and have come upon a hypothetical (but potentially reality) situation that I'm hoping to get some advice on. I will present the basic ideas of the job I'm interviewing for.

  
Job: A small R&D research lab within a university. I'd be one of only a few engineers actually working at the lab but some of the projects they are working on are very cool and the smaller team size appeals to me. I have concerns about the lack of mentorship but it seems very hands on and like I would be a true contributor instead of just a paper pusher with little impact. The pay would be noticeably lower than I am currently making, but honestly I'm not very motivated by money, especially when it means I'm still miserable. The work is done in a lab and is very hands on which is a huuuge win for me, as I'm sick of being stuck in a cube literally all day.

Would it be a bad career move to take a job like this? I have concerns about it stunting my career growth due to a lack of senior mentorship teaching me best practices and the work being pretty disconnected from what most other companies do. But at the same time, I have zero desire to work for and progress at other big engineering companies so maybe that doesn't matter. I'm currently completely losing my engineering technical skills (as there is no use for them at my current job) so it's essentially guaranteed to be a step-up from that.

  
All that being said, would it just be better to look into a more traditional role? I'm also interviewing at a company/companies that fit into a more traditional mold without seeming too bad. The work at them seems much more interesting than what I'm doing now and seems like they'd be great for my career growth, yet I'm concerned it will still be too soul sucking to be in that environment. I'm really interested in really challenging myself and being a real contributor which is why the research lab interests me, I'm just not sure if it will end up hurting me in the long run.

1e0mse8,"I need to choose between two job offers, one abroad and I don’t have the visa yet, one local and better paid.","I live in Switzerland, I’m 29F.

I met my current partner in the US and wanted to join him, also I would love an experience of living where he is. I managed to get an offer from a prestigious employer, who will take care of my work visa request. However, the process is taking forever and it took 4 months to go from verbal offer to written offer and now I am waiting to obtain a visa, but apparently their visa application system is down for a month. So I am not 100% certain that it is going to work out even if it’s likely. 

Even if it does, I have no guarantie that they’ll be able to extend my visa after one year.
Also, the position is a lower paid one because the US does not recognise my diploma.

Because this process took forever, I applied as a second option to another job in Switzerland, before I finally got the written offer from the US. It’s a great work environment, they just told me that they want to hire me, but now I have the written offer from the US. I told them I have accepted that offer and now they (the Swiss) want to give me a counter offer with an even higher salary. The salary in Switzerland will be at least a third if not double higher than in the US.

I am afraid that i am making a wrong decision.

What should i do? I have to meet the Swiss HR tomorrow and take my final decision.

Some part of me thinks that I can always go back to Switzerland when I want, whereas getting a job in the US as a foreign national was maybe a rare opportunity. Also money isn’t everything.

Thank you for your answers !

1e0lt6k,I'm No Longer Relevant,"Good day

I've been a software developer for a long time now, my tools are C#, Blazor, [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core, WebAPI and Minimal API, MS SQL, Javascript, and .NET MAUI.

I'm not great, I'm not great in my career. working for more than a decade, I felt, I-relevant.

I was in a company for a long time, and my performance there is okay, sometimes bad, sometimes good, but as one of my colleagues says, I'm one of the best, it kept me, alive when I was young, I have pure of passion, I was excited for this upcoming projects, I was eager to be recognized, I want to put my name on the top.

But it's not that easy, even given everything: my time and my energy. But recognition or awards are not given, I gave that company one of its first applications that our clients can use, and they are still using it now. Even I was no longer their employee. The recognition was given to others, and it's made me sad.

I am a late bloomer, I was using [VB.NET](http://VB.NET) during the early days of my career. And then I moved to C#, and the way I code for C# is similar to what I'm doing in VB.NET. It was very late when I learned Object Oriented Programming, SOLID Principles, Clean Architecture, Repository Patterns, CGQRS, Clean Code, and Optimization. When I learned those things, I was eager to learn more, I learned Blazor.

  
I was more advanced than my co-developers, I was a mentor to them, and they asked me questions and tips when it came to software development, and I also conducted IT sessions. I'm not a great developer, because I'm still on research, checking vlogs, and YouTube, to get be up to date and know what are the best practices.

But having better knowledge comes with greater tasks. They gave me too many projects and tasks, my schedule was full, and they requested too many features on a project, with a shorter timeline, I didn't brag about my knowledge or skills, I just helped my colleagues on their projects, sometimes one on one with my colleagues to help them on their projects. and when I said it cannot be done. 2 of my managers started to give me poor performance, and one of them said, ""He is not impressed"" with my work or how I performed, I was drained for two years, and I haven't done any vacations.

So I decided to look for a new job, and I got 4 offers, I chose the company that is very well established, then the other 3, 1 of them offered me more but I will be a one-man army, while the other one is a same offer but the one that I chose has better benefits.

I took the offer because I thought it was a better company, on my first week, I was working 24/7, and they had me task monitoring our third-party application if there were errors in the data provided by other applications, I had to re-run it. I have to bring my laptop wherever I go. even on holidays. they gave me legacy projects that are created in [VB.NET](http://VB.NET) and [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) WebForms. I felt downgraded that time, I was hired because of my C# and Blazor, but they haven't given me any new projects and stuck to the legacy applications.

I stayed there for almost a year, and then I resigned, I took some vacations with my family, and some consultation jobs at my previous company. I started refreshing myself on C# and Blazor, I also started to learn new stuff like React. After a whole month of taking a break, I started to apply again.

A mid-tier company sent me an offer immediately, they said that they were impressed with my skills, and I already told them why I left my previous company, I started to dream again because they said they were trying to improve the software development of the company and improved the IT department. though their software developer resigned a year ago, and they asked me if I could maintain the legacy system first, which is created in C# and [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC, I said yes and took the job, they asked me to find another developer that has the same skills like mine.

On my first day on the job, I was treated nicely and warmly, and then I found out that, the Business Analyst had resigned all of his work would be turned over to me. Now I'm a BA, Developer, and Technical Support. when they gave me the legacy applications, and all are created in AngularJs 1.8.3 (I don't have knowledge on that), and there are 10 of them, the latest documentation was 3 years ago, too many updates happened and there is no proper documentation. The users are flooding me to fix the errors on the system, I tried, I tried to learn angularjs in a short time just to accommodate it, but the codes of the former developer are ridiculous, no proper coding, too many repeated processes, the javascript files are too long because of the repeated code, probably having a problem on javascript's asynchronous nature.

I tried to fix everything, but it makes it worse, I can't refactor the codes are I have no time, so I have to patch things up, no QA to test, so I have to test myself, and when the app is deployed, it causes another error, I get exhausted, and got reported multiple times, my manager felt that they had a mistake hiring me, he did not tell me, I just felt it, the way he talks to me is very different with my other colleagues, he talk fun stuff with them, but for me, it's different, I felt small.

To lessen my workload on old applications, so we can create a new application, we tried to find another developer, all of the developers we talked to for me are good, the last applicant is good, and he can develop 5 applications in one year.  My problem is, that he does not know, OOP, does not do relationships in SQL, and does not know about proper web security, but my manager hired him.

All the new projects were given to him, and he created them fast, he's young and smart, but he did not excess himself to know more about the technology he knows. I taught him my skills, and he created applications so fast but did not bother to check the performance and optimization. Everyone loves him, and the users recognize him. but for me, I was known to make everything worse. I'm the weakest link.

Here's what I learned ""Performance, is better than skills and knowledge"", and ""Even if you have knowledge on how to approach things, if there is no output it's useless.""

I started not to share my knowledge, because they would not listen, I told them things that I needed to my manager, but he declined, because yeah, why do they need to listen to someone who is not doing a great job, there is a problem on one of my colleague's application, and I know at first that the problem is a memory leak, but instead of saying how to fix it, I kept my mouth shut, the last time I suggest a fix to my manager, he immediately ask my colleague on how to fix it.... a sign of distrust.

I tried to find a new one, I want to try IT Companies, but guess what, I know and can do is not enough, all of the exams that I took failed, too many tool stacks are needed, and all of them want knowledge on python, I want to study it but my job makes me work during weekends. And then AI came, and everyone wanted someone to have knowledge of it.

Every day, I failed my job interviews and exams, and I became much worse at my current job, I'm a senior, but now now I'm a junior..... I was demoted, and my colleague is the senior. everybody loves him, and I don't hate him because he's good at his job... and his a nice person.

There is a thing that happened to me when I was looking at something, without thinking, like just looking far for nothing, and my wife noticed it, there are times that I fell asleep while watching movies with the kids, I also notice that I don't talk too much, I rarely talk.

I started to think, Am I still relevant? should I start a new career? But if I do that, the salary that I will get is lower than my current, I don't know, what to do. I do not trust myself either. I'm irrelevant.

1e0kfla,Feeling lost ,"Hi all,
I'm a 28F who has lots of experience in random jobs: I've been a barista, housekeeper, concierge, front desk at hotels, volunteer coordinator, research assistant/data entry, administrative assistant. I have a Bachelor's in psych but these days that doesn't help you much. I'm not sure what I want to do next.

Of these jobs I've enjoyed barista and housekeeping the most. I've also made a very small amount of money occasionally selling stickers and prints of my artwork which was fun.

I really don't want a job with a lot of customer service anymore, it's just not good for my health. It would be nice to make some better money as I'm becoming more worried about affording rent and necessities in the future. As a kid I was praised for my writing & reading skills, and lately I was thinking about getting into proofreading or something similar. I'm also interested in nature and was thinking of becoming a state park ranger, trail maintenance person/gardener or something like that.

If I went back to school it would really need to be worth it because it's so much time and money to invest.

I'm honestly not sure what would make me happy, and I feel like I don't have many specific skills to pursue higher paying jobs. I get depressed feeling like it's unnatural for humans to work so much.

This is a bit all over the place but wondering if anyone has any advice or feels the same way.

1e0k2vt,What is career?,"
I am a 20yr old full time student from India and I live with my parents. 

In my life ,  I hv always passed and cleared exams when I worked hard  towards it. This was the first time I failed despite working hard tremendously. I am doing a course similar to CPA US. This was my 3rd attempt But now I am getting bored by it.

At all times as I cleared the exams I always had the hype of moving on and doing things irrespective of me feeling bored. Now I am faced a point where I am failing and bored of this and its genuine disinterest in this field of accounts and tax , not bcz I failed. I just dont want to do a job in this field even if I pass.

There are 2 philosophies which I hv come across. And I think both are correct

1. You need to do somethings in life even if they are boring , bcz they pay bills. 

2. Life is about putting efforts in what you love to do , that the true meaning of career.

I want to know what should I do ? Should I leave the current course that I am pursuing ? And pursue the course I love  which CFA /CMA US. These are the things I want to do in life.
I am also learning little bit of coding from YouTube , I like that too

The cons of leaving this course are :

1. I am losing the chance of clearing within the next 6 months and there is 90% chance that I will clear if attempt again.

2. If I clear the current exams it will open more job  opportunities and I could add being a semi qualified professional. Also this course is super cheap to pursue but very difficult 

The pros:
6 months of absolute hell , sickness , mental stress could be avoided. I could be happy. :)

Also if I leave my current course  I am gonna seek some job / internship though it wont be sufficient but I get some hands on exp but again getting job w/o degree at my place is like finding needle in grass.

If I choose to leave this course I am also paranoid that what if I get bored doing new course too ? I am just feeling nervous rn.

1e0jwz6,Advice on how to get over feeling of screwing up,"Hello hive,
Recently me and a colleague were talking about the cool project which makes me very excited. They had a side idea for a PoC and since I am more connected into what they may need, I asked my connections to introduce me the corresponding person so the team gets what they need. I let my colleague know before doing so, he was okay with it. 
This whole introduction made some people sensitive I think, so my colleague came to me asking people sort of complained who I was and my connection to the other project. He was very understanding but I feel extremely bad he had to be contacted with such questions. I made it clear in my request that it isn’t me but it comes from the team, yet this whole escalation happened and I feel very sorry. 
I just wanted to be helpful and make this connection possible but now I cannot even sleep and feel mortified towards my colleague who will probably not talk to me about that project anymore. 
I already apologized and he was very nice.  also acknowledged the fact that our organization is very weird. 
How can I shake this feeling and move on? My job description actually requires making such connections but I really cannot get past this issue and potential trust breaking with my colleague.

1e0igjv,"Probation extended and manager + her manager asked me to think carefully if I want to continue this role, how should I answer?","For context, my manager said my probation will be extended as there is still areas that require improvement, and explained that if she were to pass my probation, I would be viewed as a “proper permanent employee” and have higher expectations etc. and that the extension is to buy time for me to improve. 

I had a meeting with my manager and her manager (head of sales) regarding my probation extension. The head asked me how I feel about my performance so far, I replied that it’s only been a short period of time, and even though I’ve been able to go out and chase orders etc. and step out of my comfort zone, I’m still lacking in confidence. She asked me why I lack confidence, and I just kind of broke down and started crying. I’ve been bottling up my emotions and stress at work the whole time, and I guess being in a formal meeting with both managers made me feel nervous/emotional. 

We talked a bit more and I admitted that I do think there is a personality mismatch, and that sales is not my ideal role, but rather a stepping stone for me to get my desired role. Overall they seemed understanding, and she said if I decide this role isn’t for me, and choose to quit, it’s completely fine. But they also said if I choose to stay in this role, I would really have to work hard to improve within these 2 months, but they would be there to support me throughout. However, if I’m unable to show substantial improvement in 2 months, I would be terminated. Also, one of the reasons cited by HR is that I don’t talk to coworkers enough lol

In the end she asked me to think carefully if I’m happy in this role, if I really want to pursue a sales job and whether I can overcome this. She wants an answer by tomorrow, but I’m not sure how to answer her. On one hand, I reallly do think I’m not suited for sales - I’m extremely introverted, I dislike small talk, and I dislike being pushy. I also would rather quit on my own terms rather than end up being terminated. On the other hand, I don’t want to quit without another job lined up, and if I were to omit this job in my CV, i would have a 10 month resume gap.

1e0hu5i,"Stuck in a High-Paying, Low-Effort Job – What Should I Do?","Hey everyone,

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice. I (31M) have a great job in London, earning £85k plus bonuses, and I only have 1-3 hours of work a day.

At first, it was amazing – all that free time to do other things and relax, especially since I work from home 3 days a week. But after 4 years, I’m incredibly bored and feel like I’m stagnating. My skillset isn’t growing, and it’s starting to affect my overall happiness. I often feel like I have nothing meaningful to do.

I’m torn. On one hand, I love the freedom and the pay. I could probably switch to a new job and earn even more, but it would mean actually working a full day.

Part of me thinks I’ve hit the jackpot with this cushy role, but another part worries I’m wasting my potential, especially as I’m nowhere near retirement age and will have to work for at least another 20+ years.

1e0htrj,Confused,"I'll try to keep this short. I've been a Banquet Porter for the last 6 years. A year ago I applied to a resort that was reopening, but they didn't have any Banquets happening at the time. So I took another job that I applied to. Fast forward, the resort calls me, I take the position. But come to find out, they don't have the proper equipment for a banquet operation. The chairs don't stack well, and I'm only able to transport 40 chairs at a time. Every table has to be pieced together and each piece weighs more than 75lbs. So even small events require two people, when a single porter should be able to handle any event under 100 people.

So I've been wondering, should I stick it out? The operation isn't good. But I was really looking forward to this job before finding out what a shit show it is.

I also have a casual job at another resort. The money is good, but the drama is high. So going full time at that resort is also another option I've been considering.

These past 2-3 weeks have been confusing for me, and I'm having a hard time deciding. So any advice is greatly appreciated",Dat1Jumbo,1,1.0,0,1720677869,2024-07-11 06:04:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e0htrj/confused/,7,2024
1e0h6nm,Am I at a severe disadvantage applying for Finance career positions? Any guidance for applying for roles would be appreciated.,"A little background, I'm 31 years old and currently working in Finance as an Operations Processor at a large investment firm that I've been with for nearly 6 years. Have a background with wealth management, retirement accounts, defined benefits and nearly passed the Series 7 exam. Another thing is I'm a stellar employee, my metrics have been awesome this year and I really do go all in on accomplishing tasks with 100% accuracy.

It's my absolute objective to land a 6 figure position in same career field for the last few years. However the job market in Finance roles seems extremely cut throat with their qualifications. Last year I made roughly 70k, but that was in combination of my current Finance position and a second job involving online sales.

So here are my disadvantages that might fuck everything up when applying to jobs:

* Unfortunately 3 years ago I was arrested and charged with a DUI which I tried to fight with a top notch lawyer and lost the case. Did everything right, notified my HR/employer immediately, paid all my dues and I'm planning on having this expunged from my record, but the idea of this coming back to haunt me when job searching weighs heavy.
* Another disadvantage is that I do not have a college degree, only 13 years of work experience including sales, management, and financial roles.

Is there any hope out there for someone in my position to land a 6 figure position from my work experience alone?",SinisterSurferr,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1720675368,2024-07-11 05:22:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e0h6nm/am_i_at_a_severe_disadvantage_applying_for/,7,2024

* My boss is the current owner of the company.
* We used to work in person but are now fully remote, so it would be a phone call or an email.
* We're in the middle of an acquisition, and I am a key employee.

The truth is that I've wanted to leave for several years, but my respect and loyalty to my boss and the company have kept me from doing so. I couldn't bring myself to have the conversation with him. But with the sale, I feel a large chuck of what has kept me anchored is gone, and now seems like a good time before I dig my heels in too deep with the new owner.

Hoping for some advice on how to broach the topic, how to even start the conversation?

1e0ebe8,How to pivot into traditional stable 9-5 job?,"Hello Friends,

I am looking for some wisdom and advice from those more seasoned and who found success in a more non-linear way. To keep things short, I graduated college years ago and was planning on studying law. However, upon moving back home my plans took a different turn.  I ended up taking care of my handicapped brother and helping my Mom manage things around the house. As a result of the situation, I ended up taking jobs that were simply readily available rather than jobs that tactically helped me grow into a career. I did retail for a while which was fully a dead end, then moved into virtual work as an admin and also working for Amazon and recently becoming a trainer there. 

  
But what I really want to do is have that traditional 9-5. I would love to break into sectors like business, insurance, and human resources.  I am totally willing to be humbled at low level positions and work my way up. However, every time I apply for these types of jobs I get the age old question: why aren't you already in this field? Why don't you have already have direct experience? It can be hard to explain how I ended up sacrificing years to help my family rather than move up the ladder. What can I do to break into a stable 9-5 with the experiences I already have? Should I be taking certifications or courses? Also, where should I be focusing my time to apply (Linkedin, Indeed, etc)?

1e0btwu,What should I decide in my situation?,"Last year I got a Masters degree in environmental studies. I was lucky enough to get a job pretty quickly as an aquatic biologist, where I got to be in the field almost every day. I made about 50,000$. The company ended up laying me off after 8 months due to money issues. They ended up shutting down 2 months ago.

I was super upset when I got laid off and I wasn't in the best mental state. I ended up accepting a state government job in Ohio. It pays about 27.84$ an hour. The position is reviewing grants and thats it. It is 100% a desk job and not really in my field. I decided to try the position out before getting an apartment. I have been staying in airbnbs for the last 2 months while I try the position. I have been stressing myself out with the job and throwing up often. I got in trouble about 6 weeks ago because my boss thought I was lying about my hours because I was not at my desk when she checked on me. I was in the bathroom throwing up. I ended up getting a 6 week long punishment where I had to message her when I start and leave and I was no longer allowed to use flextime at work. She ended up quitting her job and no one has filled her position yet. When she left she told me I was doing great and her boss would re evaluate my punishment. He never reached out to me so I ended up messaging him because I wanted to stay a bit longer to finish a grant review before leaving. He said I do not have to message him when I come and leave anymore but I am still on a set schedule. He didn't explain why. Every other coworker in my department is new to the position (less than 1 year in) and they all use flextime to have longer weekends or go to appointments without using PTO but I am unable to do this. Overall I am feeling very conflicted about the position. It pays well but not in my field and I do not understand why I am still punished.

I had applied to a different State job in Ohio as a naturalist 6 months ago and just heard back from them a week ago. They offered me the position. I assumed it paid the same as my current state job but it only pays 20$ an hour. The position is a mix of basically babysitting a campground, watching a nature center, kayak rental, and some environmental education programs. I like the idea of doing programs again. The big issue is the pay. The job is in a high tourist area in Ohio on a peninsula. The town it is in is extremely expensive and does not have rentals. The closest town with rental options is about 30 minutes away in another tourist area where rent would be about 1,500$. Other than that it is very rural until you drive about an hour and 10 minutes away. I do not know if realistically I could afford to do this position because of the pay and cost of living.

Before accepting my current position, I was living with a friend who let me and my roommate stay at his place for free. They are really worried about my mental health and said they will do whatever is best for me. He thinks I should quit my current job and move back with him and my roommate and focus on myself. He thinks I should relax on focus on applying for jobs I am actually passionate about. He also said he would pay for me to get certifications and trainings to improve my resume and give me 1.5k$ a month for things I need. My roommate agrees but will move where I end up choosing. Currently, my roommate does not work and is finishing school. She doordashes but her income is not reliable and most of it goes to her student loans.

I want to know what people think I should do. Ill summarize:

1. Stay at current State Job and keep job searching and get an apartment.

pros: income is okay, won't worry about money

cons: I am unhappy doing a job not in my field where my boss is acting strange.

2. I accept the naturalist job and try to find a place to live. I will most likely have to commute an hour or more. pros: not a desk job, in my field

cons: feels like an intro job, pay isn't great for the area, no job advancement, long commute

3. I quit my current job and move back with my friend and focus on finding a job I actually like.

pros: I can relax, no bills or rent, free trainings, time to focus on job search

cons: being unemployed, health care, feeling like I faile",Loveshuffle0,1,1.0,1,1720658240,2024-07-11 00:37:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e0btwu/what_should_i_decide_in_my_situation/,7,2024

1e07fb4,"What role does LinkedIn play when considering a qualified candidate? Recruiters & hiring managers, please help!","I'll try to keep this short as I'm really looking for some guidance/input. If there's a better subreddit to get advice, someone let me know!

I am currently employed in the STEM industry. I have worked at the same pharmaceutical company for 9 years post-graduation & the market/expectations have changed a lot since I last had to look for a job.

I have poured my heart and soul into custom resumes and cover letters for 3 different companies that I would LOVE to work for. I am fully (if not over-) qualified for these positions, so I felt very confident that I would hear back pretty quickly.

I got an email from LinkedIn that recruiters from 2/3 of the companies had visited my page in the last day.

The problem is, I am NOT active on LinkedIn (or any social media for that matter). I have barebones details about my career progression and a few connections from colleagues who have sought me out, but otherwise I don't have a profile photo, resume, etc on it.

I would be devastated if I don't hear back from these companies because of this.

My question is, at what point are recruiters looking at my LinkedIn & how much weight does my LinkedIn actually hold? If I'm not interested in being active on LinkedIn, should I just delete it? Or would that be even worse?

My resume and cover letters have all of the necessary information and I never thought twice about my LinkedIn.

Any input from those in the hiring process would be GREATLY appreciated.

I make salary at 55k a year but it’s not enough for me and I am constantly living paycheque to paycheque and always in over draft.

Not only am I feeling depressed with this job, but it’s not even paying enough. In my area, there are no jobs what so ever. Small town, so I was lucky to get this remote job.

1e06tcx,Withdraw from internal job application?,"I’ve been exploring internal opportunities and speaking with recruiters at my company for a couple of months, as my contract is ending soon. A recruiter mentioned they would keep me in mind for potential roles and recently connected me with a hiring manager for a position in my area. Since my initial conversation with the recruiter a few months ago, my contract has been extended indefinitely until I find a permanent role.

After reviewing the position, I wasn’t sure it would be a good fit but decided to have a call with the hiring manager. Before the meeting, I discovered the role is a level below my current position, but I went ahead with the conversation as it was only a few days away. During the meeting, I mentioned the job level and salary differences, and the manager responded positively, saying they would work on a reasonable offer.

The issue is that I've realized this role doesn’t align with my career goals, regardless of the pay. I intended to email the manager to withdraw from consideration, but they emailed me today stating they’re working hard and “jumping through hoops” to get me a good offer.

How do I withdraw without seeming rude?

1e063o4,Working on my Masters but worried my security experience is looked down upon,"Currently working towards my MPA. Most of my jobs have been doing security in cultural institutions (was a lower manager at a previous job); I recently started working at a state building. 

I do have a fair amount of volunteer experience on my resume pre-2020 also.

I recently applied for a 25/hr part time gig where the minimum requirement was to have a Bachelor’s in progress. I got offered 18/hr for a part-time gig and tbh I’m a little insulted given that I’m a Masters student and have a lot of working experience.

I’m paranoid having worked mainly in security the past decade will be looked down upon by potential employers as I try to go for admin jobs in the future (or anything other than security), almost worse than people who were only students and didn’t work during school. I’m not in a position where I can just do school full time and take an unpaid internship or part time graduate work study to transition into another field.

I do want to stay at my current job about a year because I think it’ll help when applying for other state government jobs, but I’d appreciate any advice for eventually transitioning out and not being seen as a “dumb/lazy security guard” (unfortunately working in cultural institutions i’ve encountered this attitude a lot).

1e05p64,Advice,"
Hello! I am about to be on my senior year in college majoring in software engineering, and I am very lost on what I want to do when I graduate. I have never really looked at a major/career and thought it was something I would truly enjoy, but I will share some of my passions and goals out of my career, and maybe that would help. I am someone who enjoys listening to music, watching movies, playing/watching sports, hanging out with friends/going out, doing/seeing new things, getting out and being active, etc. When I think of a career, I want something promising and where I know I am in an important/key role. I also would like to be at a well-off salary. Starting at 70-80k and knowing that I will be able to reach six figures would be very nice. That may be totally unreasonable, not really sure haha. I also want a great work/life balance. A dentist/orthodontist is what seems to make great sense to me, being an interactive and outgoing person and wanting to make good money, and I do have a lot of those pre reqs down because I was pre med, but I also would not enjoy that much more school haha. Please ask any questions if needed and provide any insight.

1e05ms8,Is a CSC (Canadian securities Certif.) worth it for my career?,"Hi! I have a rather layered question but some background - I just graduated with a bcomm studying economics and finance. I have no work experience in those fields as all my internships were related to sales, marketing, data analysis, management and other aspects of business like strategy etc. I'm currently working at a company (not in the finance industry) I interned at as a growth analyst.


I would like to work within the finance industry but with my limited experience I think my best shot would be to start with commercial banking.
Is acquiring my csc enough to me get in without heavily related work experience? Is the sc even valued that highly or would employers be dismissive as it's not a cfa?

In terms of getting my cfa, I heard it is extremely difficult and expensive. I feel like I'm not ready to take it yet and would need at least a year to prepare which is why I'm hesitant to skip the sc and go straight into a cfa. But if it's worth it I can probably lock in.

From my research many advisory/planner jobs prefer a csc or something similar.

Thank you in advance and sorry for being all over the place! Just a little confused on what to do",asap6789,1,1.0,0,1720642329,2024-07-10 20:12:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e05ms8/is_a_csc_canadian_securities_certif_worth_it_for/,7,2024
1e05ecc,"What would you do in my shoes? Work part time, interested in technology; no degree","

I’m mid 30s, no college degree, worked retail/retail sales and did a little food service for all the jobs I’ve ever had my whole life. 

I job hopped a bit in the last 5 years but as I get older now I realize it’s caught up with me. I’m currently working part time retail making a little over $20 an hour but I’m somehow managing. Living with family, paying really cheap rent and not having a ton of bills helps. But at the end of the day I make under $2k a month after taxes and I feel pitiful. 

I have an interest in technology but the layoffs in the programming field has me worried. I looked into iOS programming, some web development etc but then I look at jobs and I see the requirements: companies looking for a ton of experience that even after I study I probably wouldn’t be qualified , looking for well seasoned folks etc. Should I pursue this field? I wouldn’t have any money to go for any certifications or degrees. 

The saving grace now is my job, even though it’s part time, has potential for growth. I could become a store supervisor or gain other roles that pay more, the job itself isn’t difficult or stressful and they have 401k which I’m in. But obviously that takes time and I’ve only been with in this job for a year. I’d like to make more money but it’s a waiting game. I feel stuck making under 2k a month for the foreseeable future. I’ve applied for other part time gigs but not one has emailed or called me except for one and I didn’t end up getting hired after an interview in person and being qualified. 

Does anyone have any recommendations? Advice? Suggestions for my situation? I don’t have any self pity btw. I understand that any decision I’ve ever made is on my own and not the result of others. I’m not into the blame game. 

Thanks in advance for any and all advice even if it’s brutally honest and maybe not what I wanna hear. I’m pretty open to hearing what people have to say.

Also my age is beginning to catch up and have developed pretty bad plantars fasciitis, which I am currently going to PT for.  

Now, I have been laid off for a couple months, but work is ramping up again and Im expecting a call any day.  

Heres my dilemma... I have been studying and preparing to take some placement exams to potentially return to college.  I have this little dream of becoming a radiological technician.  

I have about 1 year of tuition and living costs saved up, and would likely find some part time job while going to school, work next summer, go back for another year and cover any differences with student loans.  

Is this feasible?  Should I take this job again and save another years worth of tuition or should i just get the ball rolling with school?

Also one more possiblity is there to apply in US universities for Spring Intake(but such universities are very few, most of universities are doing only fall intake).

I am so confident and sure that with efforts and my interest being in Business, i will definitely be able to score good in GMAT. but i am afraid about my bachelors degree grades and how will i be able to land a job after this degree so i can get 2-3years work experience, and as i have no interest now in engineering it will be tough for me to work in it for 2-3years and as my degree is engineering and that too with not good grades i think it will be so difficult to get job in business roles just after this degree. what i feel is that if i want to get into top MBA program of USA, so my work experience and degree if possible should be of USA so as to help in admissions.

1e02l9z,Seeking Advice on Transitioning from Chemistry to Accounting,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some advice on making a career change into accounting. I've spent the last 15 years working as a chemist in a manufacturing environment, but I'm ready for a new challenge. I've completed the 150 credit hours required to sit for the CPA exam through a local community college, but due to a busy work schedule over the past two years, I haven't had the chance to start studying for the exam.

I'm ready to make the switch now, but I'm unsure where to begin in looking for an entry-level accounting position. Should I be focusing on roles like bookkeeping, accounts receivable, or billing? I don't have a specific direction for my career in accounting yet, just that I want to move away from chemistry.

I've been passively sending my resume to large industry companies, but I haven't had any success. I assume my lack of direct experience and a resume that highlights my chemistry background aren't helping my case.

I read this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/16f1ihn/getting_an_entry_level_job_at_40/) where someone mentioned taking the QuickBooks certification and possibly reaching out to a recruiter. Do you think these steps would be helpful in my situation?

Additionally, could you elaborate on the types of companies and positions I should be targeting? My main goals are to continue to have health insurance for my family, achieve work-life balance as I study for my CPA exams, and gain valuable experience.

Any advice on how to navigate this career change, particularly in terms of job search strategy and potential entry-level roles, would be greatly appreciated.

1e020g8,Please Help ,"I have been working in a lovely Multinational product-based company for over 3 years now and recently switched internally to another team. Since day 1 in the new team, I have been observing and being subjected to certain illogical and irrational and outdated KPI system, and have been penalized for outcomes which are not in my control but due to company's policy constraint, which I politely voiced with my manager, who again in response politely justifies or asks to not to take is very seriously... But this week, I have had enough... where another manager (who is not a people manager but an individual contributor) in my team tasked has been pointing our silly and stupid errors in work such as "" why did I address a person while writing an email with his preferred name in the company' system and not the legal name"" . and why I have used italics in the body of the email while quoting a company policy... ( both these picks are not subject to debate as we use preferred name because the employee wants us to use that , hence entering it in the system and we use italics to emphasize a particular part to draw attention like a company' s policy , the IC Manager has marked this as an error and penalized in my KPI... This instance has completely shocked me because the company overall does not have such ways of working or culture or KPI measurement but this particular manager colleague is hell bent on the above practices as examples.. I am sure this ""preferred name and legal name"" case documented error is something which I can use to my advantage to escalate as no person of sane mind can justify this as an error, as this clearly stupid and unnecessary which clearly displays his lack of that IC Manager's knowledge or incompetency... my question how do I deal with this situation as it mentally very agonizing.

1e01uy6,27m how can I get my career back on track? ,"
So I graduated with a bsd in architecture. 

I got my first job out of school at this big firm. Really nice place. Got the job because a professor of mine knew one of the principal architects and got me an interview. That guy was my boss and really nice guy, looked out for me always. 

Ended up walking out after 6 months cause I was going crazy. Didn’t love the job but also a lot of anxiety and depression issues. 

My boss reached out and met with me for coffee a few months later I don’t think he has anything against me. 

I ended up working for a different firm for also like 6 months. Got laid off when lumber prices were going crazy there were a lot of lay offs in architecture at the time. 

Ended up going to grad school during Covid. Got into an Ivy League school thought it would really help but after 1 year of online class going into a bunch of debt I quit cause I didn’t think 2 more years of debt was a good thing……. 

Ended up unemployed living at my parents. Still living with my parents and now working for my friends landscaping company. But man this work is tough, hot days. Soar everyday. Really wishing right now I didn’t fuck up my first job by leaving. I’ve been on medication and really hoping right now I could somehow get a job back at the first firm and just make more money cause I’m broke. But now my resume is shit because I’ll just have big gaps of no work. When I got out of school it was actually decent. Maybe I should meet with the professor who helped me get the first job idk or reach out to my old boss.

1e011dz,Created essential work tools. Now asked to hand over code. Legal worries. Advice?,"TLDR: Started as a Configuration Analyst, self-taught programming to automate processes. Created multiple tools that significantly improved efficiency. Now being asked to maintain or hand over code, but I've lost interest in doing so. Worried about legal implications of not sharing the code. Seeking advice on how to proceed.

So here's a rundown:

I started a contract at a company back in August as a Configuration Analyst. On my first day, I was trained to license and configure access points, a process that took about 1.5 hours with two people. Believing there had to be an easier way, I taught myself programming and created a process that reduced the time to 10 minutes with one person.

After the person who trained me left, I became solely responsible for access points and continued to improve the program. I kept relevant people updated on my progress to validate my skills.

I was then moved to a different team handling various devices. I modified my program to make their processes easier as well and distributed the executable to other team members.

A month later, I returned to access points while my previous team moved to a new automated platform. My manager then asked me to improve another team's process, which I successfully did despite having no prior experience with their system.

Next, my team lead approached me about creating a better system for techs to track their daily device work. The existing Excel-based system had issues with data manipulation. I developed a SQL-based solution that addressed these concerns.

I created a few more automation tools, some of which are only used by me. After all this, I approached my manager about potentially creating a programming-focused position for me, but was told it would be ""looked into.""

Things changed when I had a week-long vacation coming up. No one else was trained to configure access points, and my program wasn't user-friendly. When I suggested reverting to the manual method, I was told it was impossible due to production demands. I reluctantly made my program user-friendly for others.

At this point, I decided I was no longer interested in maintaining these projects or supporting users. I've since started focusing on non-work-related programming, establishing my own LLC and developing a SaaS product.

Now, the company wants me to either maintain the programs they use (which have had process changes) or give the source code to someone else on the team with coding knowledge.

I'm inclined not to give them anything, but I'm worried about potential legal issues. Can they claim ownership of the code and sue me if I don't hand it over? Am I overthinking this? Should I just give them the code?

Any input would be greatly appreciated. There's more I could explain if needed, but I felt this was already quite lengthy. Thank you for your advice.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",Fearless_Leadership8,0,0.33000001311302185,8,1720631154,2024-07-10 17:05:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1e011dz/created_essential_work_tools_now_asked_to_hand/,7,2024
1e00m0b,Quitting your job when other people on your team are leaving?,"I’m been at my current job for almost 2 years. My team consists of 6 people plus my boss.

Just a few weeks ago, they told us that we now have to come in three times a week. My team is alternating where 3 of us do the third day twice a week, and the other 3 do the third day the other two weeks of the month. I have a feeling they’re going to eventually bump it up to 4 days a week in the office. So, I started looking for a new job. I have my second interview at a company tomorrow. However, someone on my team just announced that they are leaving effective next week. I know I shouldn’t care too much, but would it be bad if I ended up getting a different job and left? I don’t want to leave my co-workers on my team with piles of work, especially since another person is leaving. 

I also haven’t gotten any type of raise since I started, not even a cost of living raise. This is another reason why I’m looking to go somewhere else.

1e00axa,Any Advice?,"Hey everyone! I graduated in 2022 with a Bachelor's Degree in mathematics and a minor in business. Since then, I've been working in an office job dealing with US Customs, making about $35k a year. I don't enjoy the work, which involves a lot of customer service, and I feel very underpaid.

I took this job out of desperation after applying to numerous positions post-graduation a couple years ago and not hearing back from anybody. Initially, the remote work aspect was a plus, but a few months ago, they announced return to the office full time starting next week. The commute is about 45 minutes each way, which is not worth the low pay and stressful customer interactions.

I've been applying for local jobs since I'm unwilling to relocate at this time. If anyone has leads on remote jobs related to my degree that offer a livable salary, please let me know. I live in a low-cost-of-living area, but $35k is still far from enough, especially for a 45-minute commute to a job I dislike.

I'm also open to advice on industries I could transition into fairly easily with my degree. Teaching mathematics is something I'm considering, but after reading posts on r/teachers, I'm having second thoughts. I've applied to substitute teach this upcoming school year to try it out, and if I dislike it, I’m only committed for a day.

I work as a marketing manager at a company worth about 18 mil. I’ve been working here for 3 years, I’m 26 years old.

My starting pay was 19 p/h, and my pay just got bumped up 1.50 to 26$ p/hr, based on the rise of cost of living. Mind you, this is after a glowing review. 

I have been working her longer than anyone else in the marketing team, and have carried marketing efforts soley on my back at one time. I design their websites internally and for clients, manage social media posts, created and run multiple campaigns, even designed products, etc 

 Is this fair? If not how much should I be paid?

1dzyr19,Advice for Transitioning out of a Holdover Marketing Job? (24M),"What certifications/programs/things I should do to make my marketing resume stand out? I'm working a job that I thought I always wanted right out of school -- no pressure, lots of down time, nice coworkers, and pays decent. It's an in person social media marketing job at a local company, HOWEVER nearly a third of my pay check is spent on my daily 2 hour commute. I'm very grateful for the opportunity, especially given the current difficulties in finding a job, but I can't help but feel a bit useless and not living to my potential.

I'm 24 and a recent graduate with a BA in psychology at a top Canadian university. I have nearly 3 years of marketing and writing internship experience. Maybe I'm delusion but I just thought I would be working at a more prestigious role/company when I left school. All my friends seem to stressed and really be working hard but at least they are progressing their careers and feeling fulfilled. I'm thinking I'd even be willing to take a pay cut for a role offering more opportunities as there isn't really any upward mobility here or skills that I can develop to further myself with. I've only been here for a few months but I've occasionally applying to other position with no luck, even with references. I'm not even that committed to just marketing, I just want to be able to transition to a role that I could find some fulfilment and mobility in like consulting or PR. My family is telling me that I should be patient at this role and my friends are telling me to stick it out for a year so I have something to add to my resume but I feel like nothing I do here is significant enough to even be impression to a recruiter.

1dzyciy,Biggest mistake I’ve made,"Posted in  another sub regarding my situation.

I got offered a position in another company which they wanted me to start 4 weeks but my current company’s contract says I need to provide 12 weeks notice period. I tried to push the new offer as far back as I could but they only offered to extend it for a week.

I told my company and they’re very disappointed and told me they can’t do it as it will greatly impact the business and the operation + additional costs etc. My direct boss told me that I should I have told them in the first place before applying for another role but I really didn’t think much of it as I didn’t even know if I would get the job nor get an interview.  I’m about to have a meeting with the big boss on Friday and I expect to be shredded and ripped a new one for giving them a short notice etc and breaking the contract.

I’m not even the manager or a senior but being in a small team means I can’t just leave them without replacement. They’re nice people, work is chill but the new offer sounds like a good opportunity not to miss.

 I don’t know what to do or what else to expect. Would they reject my resignation? My last option, which I really dnt want to, is to back out of the new offer to save everyone the trouble and keep my resignation but extend it to however long they need to find a replacement. I’ve just been so down the whole week for bringing this to them and so disappointed in myself for putting myself in this corner. I want to help them and avoid bigger consequences but I don’t know how. I’ve even shared the job ad and trying to get people I know to apply for the role but even then it will take time.

1dzxaex,Need advice on leaving current job for a lower paying startup,"Feeling under-appreciated at my current job, I started looking for new opportunities. An acquaintance approached me about joining her startup on a consulting basis until I could be hired full-time. A few months in, she asked if I could work for sweat equity for six months, giving me shares in the company for my work. I agreed because I believe in the company's potential.

She has been transparent about setbacks and not being able to match my current salary when I'm brought on full-time. While initially hesitant, I felt good about the project and our working relationship. However, the start date was pushed back several months, leaving me feeling stuck.

Although the new start date is set, it's still months away. I've wanted to leave my current job for a while and now worry I'm wasting time waiting for a less secure job with lower pay. I'm torn because I believe in the company and am invested in its success, but I feel taken advantage of, having to work several more months before seeing my first paycheck. 

Is it normal to work for free before joining a startup? Should I ask for more equity, given I’ve already worked the six months for the shares I was given?

I've been taken advantage of at my current company because I’m a ‘yes’ person. I’m great at my job and know my worth, but I struggle with actually asking for it.

1dztnqu,How to go into a career with my qualification,"Hello everyone, I've been working in retail for a little over a year now and I am genuinely just sick and tired of being treated horrifically. So I've been wanting to use my qualification to do something. For context I'm from the UK, I have a Level 3 extended diploma in Health and Social care (DMM), and when I searched it up they all said I could work in a nursery or something similar. However, every time I try to apply to one, it wants an Early Years diploma, not a H&SC.  
University is off the table for now, as I just cannot find something I'm interested in. Would it be worth searching for an apprenticeship? Or do I just stick it out in a retail job that I hate.  
Another bit of context is that I have a really good relationship with the management team in my job now, so I'm hesitant to just leave unless there's a job lined up. I think I'm just torn and don't even know what my qualification can actually be used for.

Any help would be super appreciated. Thanks.",Big_Employee9295,1,1.0,0,1720611743,2024-07-10 11:42:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dztnqu/how_to_go_into_a_career_with_my_qualification/,7,2024
1dzt75o,To negotiate or pass on side gig,"Back story. I have worked as an independent contractor healthcare provider for  this government entity before to cover vacations 2 years ago. The pay was very good and work  easy. The person i was covering then put in 6 months notice. The employer reached out to me, we interviewed, nothing..3 months later got notice that the provider that was leaving has decided to stay..hmm..did i get used as leverage hmm, seemed shady and left a bad taste...

Fast forward, 2 months ago get a request for coverage in fall. . Gave some dates i could ""possibly"" cover. Response finally 2 days ago view email. ""We were hoping for more coverage but i think we can make those dates work, will sending over a contract for your review"". My question is should i ask for $ (assuming its the same)..the hourly is decent but  even to my current when comparing 1099 vs employed (ss, self-employed taxes etc). Without a provider the clinic will just sit empty generating nothing and staff get home. could they get some else, gonna say probably not.

The slow responses with almost a  ""we are doing you a favor"" context is typical government and kinda annoying. I feel for the techs at this place because they might have to burn pto if i dont come. I think i am going to ask for more and if they dont increase they going to pass, does that seem reasonable?",Delicious_Stand_6620,1,1.0,0,1720610174,2024-07-10 11:16:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dzt75o/to_negotiate_or_pass_on_side_gig/,7,2024
1dzt2z0,Next step in my software engineering career: what to do?,"Hey! 

I've been working in tech for the last \~6 years, most of the time freelancing. I got to a point where I'm managing multiple projects simultaneously, making more than enough to sustain myself.

  
However, I've been thinking that I'd like to continue growing in my career, and I'm concerned about not growing/learning enough as a freelancer.

I'd even consider moving to a non-remote, full-time job, but I know for sure that it must be either on another country (I'm from Uruguay) or must be a very good remote opportunity, because salaries here are not what I aim for, for the most part.

I've been thinking that a great opportunity could be applying for a job overseas (i.e in the US) and possibly moving there, or something like that. I know that the fact that I'm overseas is already a limitation when it comes to interviewing, etc, but could be an option.

  
Have you ever been in a situation like this? What would you do?

1dzsn0e,Am I an asshole for considering leaving my job,"I (f42) currently work for a tiny charity working for a very small population of people. It is in the middle of an important project but the team is in flux and I am not working with the person who hired me. It uses the skills of my experience but it is not my native field of knowledge and while I love the team, something came over me two weeks ago. 

I was not looking for a job, but one landed in my email that aligned my previous experience and would be much more exciting and diverse than the role I am in now. I built the cover letter and cv for it in my lunch break, instantly regretted sending it in, as I thought I would embarrass myself with errors through rushing, but no got called for interview, thought I bombed the interview as no time to prepare beyond rudimentaries, got offered the position the day after. I have a few variables to consider when making my decision. 

It's an exciting role, aligned with my field of knowledge with lots of diverse tasks. Whereas  I  am often frustrated in the role I am in. But it is not permanent and has a longer commute. They do intend for the role to be permanent but can't promise it at the moment. 

 I am permanent where I am but it is not challenging, so it's safe and it's also flexible around how I manage my schedule so I can get driving lessons. 

In my current role a big project is started which would require two to three days work from my end and it would stress the team if I left. 

They also want me to start in two weeks but there is no one to take my notice due to leave until later in the month, and then I have 3 weeks booked off (one for family, one for holiday and one for the care of the elderly)

Would i be an asshole if I take the role?

Can I negotiate starting times to be fair to my current employer? 

Why did I put myself in this position of a choice between an exciting role and loyalty to a good cause that is less rewarding but important for the team and people we serve?

1dzs8a6,How do I switch from IT Consulting to Brand or Product Management?,"I have 3 years of experience in an IT Consulting firm, primarily in the area of Strategy/Pre-Sales. Basically, it entailed bringing together the team to find ways to make existing accounts grow further, where I had the role of an organizer & mediator, similar to a project manager.   
  
However, after navigating through a few roles and working with different teams, I have realized that I am not finding this job fulfilling and see limited future growth. So I would like to transition to something different.

I am considering three options, but have limited insight on how to jump to these. I would really appreciate it if someone with the same/similar experience could share your story or advice on how to crack these. 

1. Brand/Marketing Management: I have always found this role to be a perfect blend of strategy, marketing & creativity. You also get to work with a brand and you contribute to it's direct growth. 
2. Product Management: I find equally interesting to Brand management but I do not have the technical skills, which is often demanded in Product management roles. 
3. Bonus: Private Equity - Investor Relations: I have a friend working here who can refer me, it's unlikely I will get selected but I am still going to try. I am interested in this role because of its defined career growth and great pay. Any advice on tackling questions on how to justify the switch would be appreciated.

I do not have any defined work experience in Marketing or working with a product as I am into IT services. What can I do to narrow the knowledge gap and become eligible for application into these roles?  
  
For upskilling, I am currently doing the Google Project Management Certification and will be doing the CAPM next and I am also considering Scrum Alliance-CSPO.

1dzs6pk,"Feeling completely lost in life, What would you suggest me to do?","**my\_qualifications**: I am a 24M who's born & brought up in Bangalore, secured 79.83% in 10th, 83.13% in 12th(PUC as in Karnataka) and 7.01 CGPA in Mechanical Engineering(Visvesvaraya Technological University - Non Autonomous) 2022 passed out. Scored significantly lower marks in engineering as I had been helping out my dad a lot during my college days in his business. My father wanted me to pursue CSE/ECE which I was always good in, but due to my love for machineries and automobiles and also wanting to setup a manufacturing industry of my own I choose mechanical. 

**The Past 2 years**: Upon Completion of engineering, as I wanted to gain experience in other companies and see how they work before jumping into business, I joined Toyota(Manufacturing Plant) in 2022 as a Graduate Apprantice Trainee in the Quality Engineering Division(total 2 years of trainee period plus 6 months of probationary before you become permanent employee), hated the work culture never got to learn much of anything as the senior employees didn't want to teach us anything other than things related to assissting them which frustrated me a lot (I happen to thrive on more work and learning new things). Still without loosing hope, seeked out good seniors who were willing to teach me in their free time, learnt as much was possible. Constant rotation shifts ruined my health, happiness and very low pay(21000p.m for a fresher + Overtime pay) got my parents involved in my career and they wanted me to call quits in the company to either pursue MBA/Masters or into preparing for UPSC. I have always been good at everything I have done, especially work, be it in my dad's business or working for someone else, if, I had stayed in the same workplace would have entered my probationary period as of today. Quit the company after working exactly for 1 year and 1 month to pursue UPSC Civil Services in 2023 August, since it was a childhood dream of mine to become a Civil Servant. Started preparation kind of loved it while volunteering on weekends for an NGO. Wrote KPSC Commercial Tax Inspector, **CAT(76%ile because didn't work on my Quants as I am very weak in it)**, **NMAT(92%ile) but got rejected from almost every college i applied to because of poor marks in graduation**, UPSC CSE Prelims(1st attempt and didn't clear) will be giving KPSC Gazetted Probationers exam for Group A&B this July21st. Upon preparing for and giving all these exams, I have realized that it is not something that I want to do my whole life(i.e. work for the govt). Although I may appear for UPSC CSE again(not yet made a decision on it) 

**Present Scenario**: Dad suffered huge losses in his business 2 years back and recovering from it now, though my parents have never pressured me to earn or study anything in particulareven once, every decision that I have taken in my life is completely mine. I am mentally in worse place than where I started one year before. 

I don't want to sit at home one more year attempting to write more exams which may lead me to nowhere in life and regret it post 2-3 years of wasting my life career wise. Hence, I am seeking out for options that I may have ahead of me. 

**Here's what I'm seeing:** 1. Go back into job in the Manufacturing sector but a different company and since my profile is fresh probably again as a Graduate Engineer Trainee(please help if you can refer me somewhere). 

2. Do a design software course from some good institute and try getting into Mechanical Design field. 

3. Do a IT related course on Coding(Not sure what course to do/ programming languages to learn, please guide me here) and get placed in a IT company. 

4. Do a Project management related course and find a job in that field

**Also open to suggestions if there is some other good options that I may not be considering or not aware off.**

**My End goal:** I still want to establish some sort of manufacturing industry or any other business of my own but not immediately as I don't know what to manufacture/ business to do, hence I want to work until I find something I may be interested in. 

The only reason that I'm considering a IT job(not that I've never been interested in Coding) is because, if life happens and I'm not able to start a business I atleast want to be paid well(which as I have seen only happens in IT, please correct me if i'm wrong here) and working in mechanical industries don't compensate well(again this is as I have seen in my 1 year experience please correct me if I'm wrong) 

Redditors I know seeking career advice on the internet may be bad, but, I'm completely lost here on what to do with life and talking to my parents(who says it is completely my choice as it is my life and only suggested me upon forcing them to do MBA) and friends.

1dzs18y,Brain dump: Nailed an interview for a job I thought I wanted - now hoping they don't make an offer.,"I just need someone to talk common sense to me, or tell me what I'm feeling has merit.

TLDR: I applied for a job I can do in my sleep at a business I wanted to work with. But after a successful interview I'm reflecting on what could be a couple of small red flags, and I now feel like I don't want the job but should focus on my studies for another six months.



The longer than TLDR version: 

I applied for a job at a local business I was interested in working with. The role is one I'm qualified for and have a lot of experience in (office management), and is in an industry I'm about to start studying for a career in (finance). I'd actually intended to approach this business directly at the end of this year once I had six months of my course under my wing, to see if they had any opportunities available. Instead, this role came up now and I applied. I had an interview today and nailed it, I knew the business, knew my skills, and was very enthusiastic, and they said I had fantastic experience and my studies were a bonus. All ego aside, the vibe I got is that there would be an offer made.

I feel like I could do the job standing on my head, but as soon as I walked out of the office I started to feel like it's come six months too early in my plan, and that I should be concentrating on my studies. Some of my concerns come from my perceptions of the manager/owner who interviewed me. He bought out the old owner two years ago and since then all of the old staff have also left. He barely made eye contact with me during the interview and didn't come across as confident - maybe he hasn't had much experience interviewing, but I can't imagine he comes across well to clients. When I asked about his plans for the business he was talking about taking things into the cloud, and didn't have plans to physically expand at all (i.e. no more bodies in chairs). There is no HR person in the business, it's just him and three others, all of them are financial advisers/planners. And of course, with such varied experience on my CV (social media management, systems management to name a couple), when he was talking through the role it was suddenly expanded to include these types of tasks as well 'if they were things I was interested in doing.'

I realise that interviewing for a role is as much about me interviewing the business as them interviewing me. I guess I just feel like an idiot because I thought this was going to be a great opportunity, and I sold myself so well at interview. At the moment I'm hoping they don't make an offer, when asked how many hours I was looking for I low-balled and said 15 per week (the ad just said permanent part-time, hours by neg, but at interview the owner said they were looking for around 30+). I have this weird gut feeling I'd be better for them than they would be for me. If it was fixed-term part-time I'd probably just suck it up, but even taking it and leaving after 12 months would feel dishonest.

Is it normal to feel this way - it's honestly been 15 years since I interviewed for a job (and I've been on a planned career break for 18 months).

I was part of the group to get laid off due to reorganization as they closed my group.. I am in NL and since I was not getting other offers I just accepted an internal position as we were expecting a kid soon..its been 3-4 months and I dont like the job as I am replacing 2 guys in the group retiring and I don't see much future in this role for longer time.. They closed this group 3-4 years ago and kept this guy for supporting work and no other person remains to do this job.
Its also a different domain of work where I have to start from scratch after 8-9 years of experience in another domain and since no collegues to ask questions after 2 months i fear everthing would be on my shoulders 

Now I have got another offer from a research institute which pays 10% lower after taxes than my current salary but in the same city and its not for profit organization which has not laid off people in history. .since its cuting edge tech research there are not much worries of job getting shipped to other countries in name of cost cutting too..  Also 6 weeks work from anywhere in the world

I am 35 now where I have started to value job security more than higher amount of income. I am in the Netherlands and thought where permanent contract meant they cant fire me easily but i now with business situation they can get rid of anybody when margins lower by paying severance which is now very low. .
Its been only 3 months in the role and I am not motivated to work as I dont see any support after few weeks and not much of a future in this role..i am thankful that the hiring manager gave me a job as an internal candidate but if its not motivating me to go to the office. 

How do I approach this if I am resigning the current job and comunicate this to the manager?

1dzqvnn,Got Fired at a Summer Job,"On an alt account for this.

Hello, some time ago I was fired at a summer camp. It really took me from surprise and the reason why makes me even more mad.

For context, I had done said camp before a year ago same company (by the way I’m not going to be doing any summer camps btw my own decision). 

They fired me for behavior stuff and “flirting” which I never intentionally flirted with anyone there and had not flirted purposefully for a long time. 

I’m super terrified that this will show up on my record and with that reason makes me think I’m done for, despite it going against everything I stand for.

 What can I do from here and when the next summer rolls around, apply for internships unrelated to my major (I’m in college). If a future employer does ask me about it what do I say? Will it even show up? Do I have to say anything about it? I’m lost on my future career and want to just leave this in the past.

1dzqjnm,Help on deciding if I should study law?,"Hey there! I will start this off by saying I am a first genation Latino, recent high school graduate that is going to a community college on a business administration pathway (CC didn’t provide Accounting) as I’ve always had a capacity for Mathematics and wants to become an Investment Banker or an Accountant and move up from there.

 (Please read everything before you judge me on this 😅) 

 However, recently I finished a show called “Suits” that consists of Law. Now I know it’s only a drama show and it definitely does not compare to what the real thing is. But, it fueled a thought I had for many years ago. When I was five years old I wanted to find a job that would help people and one of those was being a firefighter. That slowly died as I quickly gained more conciseness on how our economy was getting more expensive and getting told I wasn’t gonna earn enough as one.

 Four years ago my father was arrested because of a verbal argument that he had with his neighbor and she called the police and accused him of being a stalker. He was taken to jail and when being on court he was given a lawyer that didn’t do anything for him and he was there for one year (held for two as he kept getting delayed) and deported last year. It aggravated me the fact I couldn’t help him but it aggravated me even more the fact he wasn’t given a fair chance because of his inability to speak English. It sounds like there’s more to the story but that was it, they argued outside over music he was playing and her sister backed her story.

 Last year my ex father in law went through a divorce and his ex-wife was asking for a percentage of his earnings on his company, the house, all four cars, and a monthly allowance. He was agreeing to all the terms because he was threatened with going to court until he spoke to me about it and I told him he was being ridiculous for thinking he had to agree to this. He got a lawyer and I helped on translating the details. Long story short I helped on bringing up the documents, making points, and helped on getting him to keep everything but splitting the house since he put her name on the house deed. 
 
I know I played a small role on that but discussing with the lawyer and helping out truly felt like I was doing something good and ever since I wished that I could’ve been the one to represent my father since I would’ve been more passionate to help him. Sometimes I think of people that go through this and don’t have someone that represents them correctly and from watching the show it just elevated that spark in me that I might wanna be a lawyer even if it means not “earning as much”. 

I’m going to be honest, other than wanting to become a soccer player, I haven’t had something to be passionate about for the last 7 years. Going into the world of business was more a way of trying to never let my family struggle financially ever again and break that cycle. That may sound like a passionate thing but IB and Accounting isn’t something I find that can “help people”. I of course fancy wearing a suit for work and having a honest wage that can provide but I also wanna have those things and help. 

I would just like to know if;

* My reasons are a good direction towards going into law school after CC (planning on going to a four year university) or ask for a change to Criminal Justice Pathway during CC (I still have time)?

* What are things I can research that are an introduction to Law that will help me decide?

* What are more realistic examples on being a lawyer I can watch/read/see?

* What are things that I should first look into before making this sudden change?

* Is there anything I can do now for free that will give me a taste of Law school or Law itself? 

* And if there is anything you guys would like to add, an advice, a link towards more answers, videos, I truly will be thankful for that.

I just wanna know if this sounds like a good idea or if I should stick with the plan I originally had. Thank you!

1dzp6sr,Am I screwing my future self over right now? I’m terrified and anxious and so confused.,"I was laid off from my healthcare sales job in June of last year and began independent contracting almost directly afterward. My background is in Life Sciences, but I initially started selling vacations to make some quick money. As I became more profitable, I opened my own LLC and now sell medical devices, software, and vacations. I’ve only been in medical sales as an independent contractor for a few months but have been an independent contractor for a year will all of my contracts.

When I started with vacation sales, I joined an educational program for vacation sales my mentor bought for me June of last year and didn’t sign any 1099 contracts until I completed it in August. However, I was part of the sales process during onboarding. On my resume, I list my independent contracting work under my LLC as one year of work experience, but I only mention the relevant work which are the medical devices and software- I don’t say anything about the vacations so I only show my relevant skills. I guess my logic is that I started as a 1099 contractor which lead me to my LLC, so I just put it as 1yr of experience overall under my LLC (if that makes sense).

In interviews, I explain that I started as an independent contractor, scaled it into my own LLC, and am currently selling medical devices. I don’t specify that I’ve been doing medical sales for less than a year; I simply state that’s what I’m currently doing.

I’m worried that if I get a job offer, this could be used against me. I’ve been interviewing for healthcare sales positions with salaries over $200k/year, and I don’t want to burn bridges. The only reason I’m getting these interviews is because I show my LLC and discuss my independent contractor work in medical devices. Does this come off as misleading?

I know they make good money and I do think that stuff is kinda interesting. I know I need schooling for a few years though, getting that much debt like thousands of dollars doesn’t seem like a small thing. I have a degree in web and graphic design and it kinda hurts me to not  do art as a career but that stuff is very challenging I feel like to do as a career and I do like to do it as a hobby and it might kinda get destroyed for me if I do it not as a hobby.

 But I’ve wondered if I could do it on the side like still sell art and all. I’m not sure and when am I gonna have time to meet a guy and how will I juggle it all if I have kids? There is too many questions and I don’t want to give up on my hobbies. Is it worth getting any kinda degree in opticianary??? Currently I’m working in a bakery position at this retail store with hoped for doing cake decorating but I could do all that and school for becoming an optician too… I also am interested in psychology. I have like a million interests I don’t know how I’m supposed to decide.

1dzmed5,Guilt at planning to leave ,"Been at my role for about half a year. rocky from the start (bad communication from leadership paired with erratic or no direction provided but insisting on holding the reins- this leads to a lot of needless last minute scrambling and extra hours. confusion. My role isn’t quite as was described and I feel under implemented ). Have made in-roads with my team to create some stability despite this, but there’s low morale (and or/ defeatist mentality) and I feel like I’m on shifting sand all the time. But I love my immediate boss and most of my coworkers are really cool. and the overall goal of the work we do is important to me, and it pays well. I think I can offer a lot here but know it will come with frustration and unnecessary stress. 

Now a surprise  job lead has come up. Im 3 interviews in and think I have a chance. Pay would go up at least 75%. (!!!). It’s a larger more established org but I know there’s some team healing I’d need to do when I arrived- which I’m can do/ but is a factor.  But there’s also established process and protocols and collaborative mentality. It’s  also a place that does good work I believe in. 

It seems like a no brainer, but I’ve invested a lot in my team and my boss and believe in purpose of our org. I really care about my team and I feel guilty interviewing and thinking about leaving in less than a year. It’s like I would be abandoning them. I don’t imagine I’m indispensable or anything like that, I just don’t like to “give up.” I’ve never left a job so quickly. 

Thoughts? What’s your dealbreaker or rule of thumb to decide when to leave? Am I just investing emotion in something that should not be emotional?

1dzm9ud,Should I take this job offer?,"I received a job offer today at a hospital I frequent due to my father's injury. I visit about three times a week and have gotten to know some of the nurses and assistants. Today, one of the nursing assistants, who is around my age (early 20s), suggested I apply to work as an assistant in that specific suite at the hospital. He mentioned that taking an EMT course helped him get the job but said it wasn't necessary. He also noted that because they ""knew"" me, they would likely hire me, and one of the doctors seemed excited about the idea. They even said the hospital would cover any costs that grants wouldn't pay for. 

The offer sounds amazing, and I'm really interested in nursing and hospital work. However, I also want to travel and experience different things, and I don't like being tied down to one place. I'm curious if accepting this job could lead to opportunities where I could travel. I don't mind going back to school and learning about nursing, especially since it would be fully paid for, which is great since I'm a college dropout.

What do you all think about this job offer? Could it lead to a travel-focused career, like travel nursing? Let me know your thoughts. Thanks!",Goculator,1,1.0,2,1720583568,2024-07-10 03:52:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dzm9ud/should_i_take_this_job_offer/,7,2024

I have some experience with disabilities and a lot with childcare, and have spent the past seven months working as a cook because it was a passion of mine. I've found that professional cooking is a pretty toxic industry for women, and despite making $25 per hour- I get very few hours, not enough to survive, and yelled at every day. I am treated like complete crap. 

I've started applying to social work jobs since that seems to be my best starting point and landed an interview with a Geriatric Healthcare company with a salary of 50k per year. They offer 3 weeks PTO (but begin an 'unlimited' policy as of January 2025). 
That being said, they offer no medical, disability, or retirement plans. The job requires moderate travel - with a virtual clock in and treatment plan meeting every morning, then to see a roster of 60 clients throughout the month to assess behavioral health needs. These clients are in nursing homes, struggling with cognitive disabilities as well as depression and anxiety. The schedule in which you meet these clients is relatively independent- with you visiting x amount of clients per day and traveling between 2 or 3 nursing/rehab facilities. No mileage reimbursement, again a moderate concern. 

The interviewer was quite pleasant but I can tell she's been turned down before with lack of benefits, but I really need a job and experience. The job location is in Florida and I currently live at home with few expenses, but saving for the future and moving out is important to me. I know the job market is hell right now so I could use some advice and guidance.

1dzkyo9,"Working in entry-level marketing, how should I upskill to advance a career?","I just recently started an entry-level marketing job (marketing specialist I), but the work is very much sales support and operations support focused, with a sprinkle of content creation. I generally work on formatting and approving MSAs, SOWs, drafting proposals, pricing pages, etc. while dabbling a bit in working on RFPs, creative content like video scripts, or working on white papers and things like that. I also do other work in assisting and creating documents/signs for our client sites using programs like InDesign or doing minimal work in Photoshop. I don't mind the work and typically enjoy it, but even though I know this is an entry-level job, the pay is not super sustainable in my medium COL city at less than $20. I can pay rent with a roommate to split the cost, but I currently don't have a car and if I ever get one it's going to be a huge stressor on my finances because I'm still paying off medical debt.

What are some career paths from here that I have available to me that I can potentially shift my way into and ultimately have better pay? What skills should I focus on upskilling in and are there any programs or things I should start learning now so that I'm more qualified to jump into better paying roles after a year or two of experience?

I'm currently paid hourly and the company I'm at now has notoriously low wages in general, so even through promotions I would not be achieving any reasonable pay raises, much less anything that would match the rate of inflation. I currently make the same amount as the person in the marketing specialist II position because I negotiated a higher pay when starting because the pay was so low. If anyone has any insight or advice on how to make myself marketable for advancing a career trajectory from here, please let me know! Just to add, I really find myself comfortable working on the writing/content development parts of this job, and I have been wondering if proposal writing is something that may suit me. I'm open to anything really, though!

1dzjxv1,Just got fired from my new job after 1 month after being told I was overly eager,"I accepted a new recruiting job with a staffing agency in June. It was a salary cut, but I decided to go for it because I could make a good commission on top of the base salary. I was excited about the job when I first started. I got pulled into the office today (for what was called a ""30-Day Review"" on my Outlook Calendar) and was told I wasn't ""giving them room to teach me the steps"" and, long story short, told me the job wasn't a good fit for me. They called out two specific incidents where it could've been interpreted that I was going behind their backs to do suspicious stuff, but honestly, that wasn't my intention. I apologized and admitted I could've been better at communicating these situations to them. I told them I had been excited to get into the work and that I was eager to do the job, to which one of the managers said my ""over-eagerness did it"" for me. By the time I left the meeting, the admin assistant had already packed up my entire desk and had the box of stuff waiting for me at the front, and I had already been kicked out of my team's group chat.

I'd be writing an entire essay if I explained the incidents, but the point is that I take accountability for jumping into some of the work too fast- I can see how it could've looked like I wasn't following their directions. Honestly, all I intended to show that I understood things well and was ready to learn more. What I'm mainly just upset about is that 1. I never received any of this feedback (verbally or documented) before being fired, and 2. being ""too eager"" was a concern. I would've corrected myself if they had given me the feedback beforehand. I realize my employment is ""at-will,"" so they have the right to fire me without notice, but it still feels unprofessional. This company prides itself on being people-oriented, but I never felt more like a number to a company. 

I'm taking it as a sign that the job wasn't meant to be. In hindsight, I was starting to get a bad feeling about the role recently but couldn't figure out why. Oh well. I learned what I learned from it, accepted the feedback, and will be back to applying for jobs tomorrow.

1dzitvn,Started New Job and it Isn't a Good Fit,"Hello people of Reddit,

I could use some perspective. For context, at the end of June, I was let go from my first ""real job"" in sales after making too many mistakes on some big-ticket projects. I was really crushed and demoralized, and I felt depressed about being unemployed and having to accept unemployment benefits.

In hindsight, rather than processing my feelings, I started applying for jobs and hit the ground running. I applied for about 5-8 jobs, and after about a week and a half of unemployment, I got a new offer in a home/decor retail sales job and accepted it. At the time, it seemed like a good company with promises of growth opportunities. However, as I worked the job, I soon realized that it underemploys my skills and is really, really slow and boring. I'm now five days in, and I regret accepting the job in the first place. In hindsight it was a mistake to jump at the first offer I got.

I plan on applying to other jobs that will challenge me more, but I have a conundrum. I can either quit this job with no other job offer and dedicate all my time to finding a new job, or I can keep this job while searching for a better position. However, I am concerned about lying to my future employer and seeming like a job hopper. I'd appreciate any perspective from you all.

P.S. I live at home with my folks, and my only expenses are hobbies and student loans. I have a decent amount of money saved to cover these expenses, but it can't last forever.

University is off the table for now, as I just cannot find something I'm interested in. Would it be worth searching for an apprenticeship? Or do I just stick it out in a retail job that I hate.

1dzhysh,I want to do medicine but I'm scared I won't be able to do anything creative.,"I love biology and anatomy, genuinely, but medical school is so daunting especially since I have ADHD. My family and friends are all rooting for me though, and it terrified me that I might not be able to live up to their expectations. If I ""just"" went for nursing (respectable, but not in their eyes) I would feel like a waste of time and effort... Which sucks, because I genuinely admire nurses, surgical technologists, etc but to people who aren't well versed in various medical industry jobs might not think of them as ""good enough."" 

The thing is, I feel like my true passion has always been for the arts, specifically game development. I like to draw, I like game design, I like worldbuilding and I have some cs experience... I guess what I truly want is to make a cultural impact and create things that a lot of people will enjoy. But I think my personality isn't suited for it! I'm goals oriented and not progress oriented and I don't like to be uncertain; will people like it? Will this be good enough? Did I do the right thing with that revision? I get so jealous easily of othersz roo. I've truthfully been terrible at working on long term projects. I feel like in the end maybe that's not what I'm looking for, and what I truly want is just validation. I want people to tell me that what I make is good and know that I've inspired them, that they think about my works. It's horribly selfish. I don't know how I can get my fix of affirmation. 

I'm so scared of fucking something up, too, like I don't want to have to make such big decisions. I don't want someone's life on my shoulders. But I also want to save lives. It's so oxymoronic of me.

1dzgpcu,Masters in Engineering Management?,"Career Advice - Getting an MEM?

Hi, I am unsure of whether this is the right place to post this but:

In May I graduated undergrad from a top 50 or so university in Computer Science. I am now working as a software dev for a govt contractor. The job has been good so far and I am learning a lot. However, I have always found that my soft skills/leadership skills have outweighed my technical skills. I want to pursue a career in tech management and figured a good start would be obtaining a Master’s in Engineering Management. I have already applied to a couple of online programs in hopes that I can complete the degree while working at my current job, as my company would pay for much of it. I do recognize that I need to gain much more experience as a developer/engineer before moving into the management route. My question is: Is going for this degree now too early? Or is getting it out of the way early in my career a good move? Any and all advice on this is much appreciated.",OrangutanFett,1,1.0,0,1720567134,2024-07-09 23:18:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dzgpcu/masters_in_engineering_management/,7,2024

I reached out a couple of weeks before my promotion date asking to check in to prepare for the transition since it was fast approaching, but didn’t get a reply. The week before the new FY, promotions were being announced to the company, but I wasn’t included in the roll out. 1 day before my promotion was to go into effect, I received an email from the manager saying they “aren’t ready.”

1dzgbm0,Sharing my journey so far,"I've been programming since 2018. I didn't know English at that time, so I started learning English and programming simultaneously. 

I initially used Codecademy and freeCodeCamp to study front-end development, spending about two years learning HTML and CSS. Later, I discovered that I preferred back-end development. 

After studying for two years, I could create projects and write code, but when I tried to tackle more complex tasks like games, compilers, or distributed systems, I would get stuck because my foundational knowledge wasn't strong enough. I started using Codewars to practice small problems and improve my basics. After that, I took my first Coursera course and was impressed by how helpful university courses were. I had always heard that computer science degrees were useless, but it was a game changer for improving my skills. 

I followed all the advice for getting a jobᅳstudying computer science, practicing LeetCode, etc. However, it never worked for me because I don't want to lie on my CV, and without visible experience, I don't even get the chance to take a test. 

Most of the projects I work on are clones of real projects, which I keep private. I have about 300 repositories on my GitHub, most of which are private and incomplete. 

Now, I am becoming more confident in my English, reaching the C1 level, so I will try to apply for international jobs. I've tried everything you can imagine to get a job because I genuinely enjoy programming (I don't do it for money). I've even tried volunteering for free. 

Despite everything, I believe I have a good technical level in programming, at least at a mid-level. The problem is that I can't showcase my skills effectively. The projects I like working on in my spare time are complex and would take me a few years to complete. 

I can do web development, both back-end and, to a lesser extent, front-end. However, working on web projects by myself is boring, and I usually don't have any ideas. 

That's it, just sharing my journey with you. The last thing I will try is contributing to open source. I was creating a toy programming language for myself to learn more about this area. I think I will try to contribute to compilers and interpreters. This is my last attempt to get something.

I’m super conflicted about possibly getting an offer and leaving my current company (my gut says I’m going to get it).

Reason I’m looking is money. I know I’m underpaid in my current role, but otherwise it’s all pros where I’m at. Especially my director, I love working for them.

1dzfg5k,Who might hire me?,"Howdy gangstas. I apologize in advance for detailing my situation so verbosely but I'm looking for advice with regard to my search for a job that is both suitable to my needs and within the vicinity of what I may be qualified to do. Any and all input is welcome and appreciated.

TL;DR: I have a bachelor's in biochemistry, I've mostly waited tables since graduation, and I'm wondering how to approach my search for a job that provides more stability and upward mobility. Remote work with a weekly yield of at least $875 would be sweet but I'm open to other suggestions. Additionally, I'm not making enough with my current restaurant gig to sustain myself and I need a side job to supplement my income while I look for a better opportunity. I was going to drive for Uber but I don't think I'm able to due to my out-of-state license and registration.



I (27M) graduated with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry about 5 years ago but I didn't do particularly well with my studies (GPA was a 2.8) and I didn't do any internships during my college days to prepare any kind of transition to a career. I didn't enjoy the coursework but in retrospect, I just didn't enjoy schoolwork in general. I did well in high school while procrastinating to the fullest possible extent on probably 95% of my assignments and exam preparation. My biochemistry curriculum was a bit more rigorous than what I was used to an although my study habits (or lack thereof) didn't lend themselves to success the way they had previously, I failed to adapt and my grades suffered as a result. I'll also note that my first two years of undergraduate study was a bit overshadowed by certain external circumstances.

I started working in a restaurant after college until I saved enough money to move out of my mom's house. After the move, I decided to get into sales because a family member of mine whom I look up to quite a lot has has been very successful as a sales representative. Additionally, I didn't have a great concept of what I wanted to or realistically could pursue after college and entry level sales jobs were the only opportunities I could find that (seemingly) constituted the first step of a career path. I tried door-to-door solar sales, then cold-calling business owners selling merchant cash advances, then there was this whole global pandemic that lasted several years or whatever.

I tried getting back into the MCA job remotely a few months later but I eventually realized that cold-calling is thoroughly at odds with my sensibilities. As you can probably imagine, the recipients of these calls were very agitated and I had a lot of difficulty embodying the smooth-talking and pushy persona that the job demanded. I eventually parted ways with the world of sales and returned to the restaurant industry so I could still make ends meet.

I moved out of state to a major U.S. city about 6 months ago and I'm still waiting tables to this day. I've had a very comfortable nest egg up to this point and I've focused heavily on areas outside of work during this time (acclimating to the move, addressing certain personal matters related to mental/behavioral health, pursuing a passion project that may or may not yield some kind monetary return in the future).

These days, I feel like I have a much healthier grasp on my work ethic, maturity, professional outlook, and certain underlying psychiatric conditions that have impeded my success in the past. I think I'm better equipped to align my performance with my potential than I used to be and if I could redo my undergraduate studies, I think I'd be able to significantly improve upon my first attempt. I'm not sure how I'd do in sales these days but I don't plan on making a return to it any time soon.

I'm ready to get serious about my career but I'm still unsure of what opportunities would be available to someone with my degree and resume. I started looking into computer programming and I've spent a month or so learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I figured that was something I could become qualified for on my own merit and I could have a future with it so long as I put in the time and effort. The plan is to keep going with it as a sort of plan B but I won't be able to get a web development position without several more months of study.

  
My original plan was to continue working on coding while using my restaurant job and savings to sustain myself but that's no longer an option. I recently paid out of pocket to replace my car's transmission and I no longer have much of a financial cushion as a result. We're also in the midst of our ""dead season"" at the restaurant and I'm not making enough to break even on a month-to-month basis. I decided I wanted to get moving with my career shortly before these issues arose but I'm now looking to get myself set up with a more sustainable job as soon as possible. I plan on applying to become a technical writer because I think writing is one of my most marketable professional skills. That said, I'm largely fed up with the inconsistency and instability of the service industry and I'm approaching this with a pretty open mind.

I suppose this is the part where I open the floor to suggestions. I don't have a great sense of what I'm qualified for or the breadth of opportunities that are even out there, so any recommendations are much appreciated. Input on websites to check out, placement agencies, etc. is also more than welcome. I'll include that I'm living in Austin, Texas in case that information is of use. Ideally, I'd like to work remotely so I can visit my family in my home state with relative ease. I've also worked out that a weekly income of about $875 would allow me to reliably pay my bills with enough left over to add to my savings. I get that beggars can't be choosers and I accept that these wishes might not be met off the rip.

Lastly, I'm currently looking for a side job to help make ends meet while I proceed with the job search. My plan was to start driving for Uber because it seems immediately accessible and it's all on my own time so I can do it as much as I need to in order to fill in whatever gaps my restaurant tips may leave me with on a given week. However, I don't think I'll be able to because my license and registration are both out of state. I don't think this precludes delivery so I might end up doing Uber Eats instead. If there are any other ideas for side hustles that fit this sort of mold, please let me know.

I write to goddamn much. Thanks everyone.",LouKeamiya,0,0.5,0,1720563863,2024-07-09 22:24:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dzfg5k/who_might_hire_me/,7,2024
1dzf4va,Using job offer to Bargain with current employer," 

I have been with this company for around 3 years now. I'm well respected and acknowledged as a top performer. Many things however made me actively apply for new jobs. The pay is low, senior management is quite old school and not willing to implement significant changes, and the work life balance is non existent. 

Im going through interviews and I'm in a good standing to receive offers soon. The interviews I completed are for positions that pay upwards of 20% of my current salary.

There are some miles stones in my career that I can more easily hit with my current employer if I stay, credentials etc. but at the same time I'm sure wherever I go I'll get chances for that.

I'm looking for insight on how I can negotiate this with my current company for a possibility of a promotion or significant pay raise. Our team/department just hired 2 people, promoted 1 and 2 promotions are in the work and will be in effect in the next 6 months, I think it's a longshot that I get a promotion or a matching salary offer, but I'd still like to have this discussion with them, as I am quite established where I am now.

I am gonna start with a little bit about me, I completed my bachelor's back in 2020, after that my mother and I worked on a small online business (which still exists). Although she's the sole proprietor of it, that means I don't have my name on any legal documents, not was there a formal salary exchanged, so I am not sure if that counts as any type of experience or not. 
In 2022, I enrolled into an online MBA in HR (distant learning) and it has just been completed. Now, obviously, being online I don't have any hands on experience and it was basically just books and exams. 
Now, I want to start my career in HR. I'm planning to shift to UAE ,  so problem is I don't have job experience (any corporate jobs) that means I probably will not get a job. 
To counter this, I thought of starting with masters in HR in one of the university in UAE , but I got feedback where people say that it's just gonna make me overqualified and will hinder my chances even more to get a job. 
So now I am planning to go for aPHRi certificate and meanwhile start with CIPD level 5 alongside.

So I have to choose between the guaranteed job and the possible job that doesn't exist for sure but I would prefer to try again. I'm feeling stuck here.

1dzcwe5,Should I risk it and study medicine? ,"I NEED YOUR HELP! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Management Information Systems but I've come to realize that I don't like it and the career paths it opens up. Recently, I had the opportunity to attend an anatomy class, as well as visit a robotic surgery educational center and had the chance to perform a surgery and try robotic surgery simulations respectively. I really, really liked both and I think it has sparked a major interest in me. I've been in deep thoughts since then and strongly consider to pursue medicine studies. However, I come from a business academic background and, obviously, don't have the academic evidence of having studied or covered biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics curricula. This means that, in this case, I should dedicate 2 years to cover the necessary curricula for these courses so that to sit for an IB Diploma and then apply for a Bachelor's in Medicine in Europe (in a public university in the Netherlands, as I'm an EU student and the tuition for my case are extremely low). I'm in my late 20s, approaching early 30s, and I think that with this timeline (2 years preparation for IB Diploma, 3 years Bachelor's in Medicine, 3 years Master's in Medicine), I'll be in my mid-30s when I'll finish the studies and then early 40s when I'll finish residency. Given this, I'm contemplating whether I should risk it and go back to university to study medicine or stick to my current degree and just start working in whatever job I find (related to my current degree or not).

1dzcfk7,Should I take the job?,"Hi all. I am going into my senior year of college studying industrial and systems engineering.

I am currently at my 3rd summer internship, and I have been offered a position on a 2 year rotational leadership program at a major aerospace and defense company.  The program would move me through manufacturing, supply chain, and quality. And I would make roughly ~$60k my first year.

HOWEVER, this offer is very early in my year, and I still have much time to continue looking for jobs. I have a security clearance, 3.9 gpa, and 3 internships of experience. A part of me believes that I can make much more than $60k out of school… but I also don’t want to get greedy.

I don’t know exactly what I want to do, but if I turned down the rotational program offer, I would most likely look for systems/manufactuding engineering positions.

1dzcexp,BS in Mechanical Engineering getting MBA,"I graduated with my BSME about 5 years ago. Since then I’ve been in the sales field. Essentially designing engineering solutions for account managers to be presented and sold to customers. While doing this, I fell in love with the business side of things so I am currently looking into getting into account management or just management of teams whether it’s the sales team or the engineering team. Hence, my working towards the MBA (although not required, it definitely helps for either of those roles).

While I love those ideas, I want to get a feel for what else is out there for me. I’ve done a quick google search and that yields some options, but I wanted to get more real world options from people that have been in a similar situation as mine or know someone who has. What was your/their career trajectory and what did you learn?

As a side note, I am eligible to get a PE license. In my state I have sufficient experience, I just need to take and pass some the FE and PE test (which I know isn’t easy), but once completed I could have my PE in a matter of months. While it doesn’t interest too much, I’m wondering if my PE license along with the MBA could open other doors that I might be interested in.

1dzc658,I am lost. Is my potential Music degree a waste of time?,"I hope I don't make this too lengthy, but, I am about to enter my first year of college at my city's private university. I graduated from a dual credit high school which allowed me to complete an Associate's in liberal arts, therefore, I will be coming into university with 60 college credits.

My future career goal has been to become a child and adolescent psychiatrist for a while now. So, my major is psychology (B.A) and I have a concentration in neuroscience added to it. In addition, I had a minor in music as well added to my degree plan. I added a minor in music because music has always been a part of my life (I play the violin, piano, and acoustic guitar) yet I have had so many gaps in my musical career that I decided to not pursue it professionally since I didn't master each instrument entirely.

A couple of weeks ago I began thinking about if I would even use my music minor in the future. I had originally thought that I could be a side music teacher on the side or something but I started overthinking it because I didn't want to pour energy into a degree I didn't use. In addition, I would be studying a lot for the MCAT and trying to get amazing grades in my prereqs for Med School so I didn't know if I would have time to practice my instruments.

So then, I decided around a week ago I would dual major in both Psychology with the Neuroscience Concentration and also Music Therapy. I chose Music Therapy because I am also genuinely interested in it career-wise and it combines my music interest in addition to counseling and helping others. While my long-term goal is to be a psychiatrist and enter Med School, I had thought that the addition of my Music Therapy degree would:

1. Stand out to Med Schools because it's a dual degree and is still medicine-related
2. Give me a chance to start a Non-profit (which I had been wanting to do) with music therapy or something related
3. Combine both of my interests in counseling (which I wouldn't get in psychiatry since it is prescribing medications) and music which I love.

I emailed my college advisor but she mentioned that I would be completing more than 165 hours which exceeds the minimum amount with the dual degree plan + concentration + Med School prereqs. She told me to reevaluate my long-term goals. I also have my music audition at the end of the month.

I don't know what to do. Apart of me is wanting to just get rid of the music concept entirely but then how else am I supposed to keep it in my life when I haven't mastered each one? My mom said she won't pay for my violin lessons unless I pursue it in university because she doesn't see it as ""just a side hobby"" which I understand. Is keeping music in my degree plan a waste of time? Are there any suggestions about what I should do or alternative ways to keep it in my life?

2. One of these meetings was with other managers at the beinning of my second week and I got reprimanded for not being able to carry the conversation (no instructions were given before hand).
3. My boss asked me to pick up stuff from his house, something that is not in my job description. This was just a personal request which also made me be 15 minutes late for a meeting, which makes me look bad.

On one hand Im flexible and patient and can take a lot of shit before it actually bothers me. On the other hand I don't really need this job and these sort of things, due to my experience, tell me that the dynamics of the relationship with my superiors will stay the same or get worse.

Removing emotion, I have certain values that I guide myself through life with and so far its worked. I want to stand up to myself and quit, because I wasnt hired to be a secretary or a delivery guy. But before I made a final decision I wanted to ask for your input.

1dzb2vc,Masters advice,"Hello everyone,

So I'm doing my bachelors in biotechnology (with a minor in microbiology) at the moment, and I'm about to graduate in a year or so. I wanted some advice on mainly *2 aspects* of what to do in the future:

1. Do my masters right away **or** work for a year and then do my masters (I definitely want to get my masters degree, just don't know the timeline)

2. What subject / course I should do my masters in

I'm hoping someone can guide me regarding these two. For context, I don't see myself doing lab work for the rest of my life. Biotechnology is a very lab focused major and for my masters I want to steer away from the lab aspect of it. I know people that have done different combinations like biotech and law and gone into the patents aspect of science. I was initially considering doing my masters in Bioinformatics, but I have never done any coding in my life so I don't know if I want to do that. I really don't know what combination would suit a biotechnology degree so really asking for any and all input here. 

Secondly, my main purpose of doing a job before I do my masters was so I can get some experience (because I can't get good job opportunities if I don't have any experience). But some people have told me that once I start working, it's hard to get back into study - mode. I see both points as very valid so I definitely can't choose. But since time is running out I'm planning on applying to both and deciding based on my offers (right now the job market is also rough).

1dz8skq,The CEO of the company told me I could do something and now the vice president is trying to block what he said I could do while he is on vacation what do I do?,"So, to make a long story short I am the most senior person at my company I have been there 14 years. In the last 6 months we had gotten a new CEO. He met with each of us. Let me start by saying that my work is not client facing I am a back end developer and I don't ever talk to clients. My new CEO had agreed with me that there is absolutely no reason I need to work 9 to 5 that if there is an urgent project or issue then my manager can just text me or call me.

However, while he is gone on vacation my manager apparently talked to the vice president and she is trying to tell me to hold off until he gets back from vacation. 

1) No one knows what I do at the company better than I do because its my job.

2)Is it just me or is this totally inappropriate that both my manager and the vice president are trying to do this?

I do not feel like I should ""Hold off"" till he gets back. I had a 20 minute conversation about this with him and why I need the 9 to 5 hours.  I am literally always accessible if there is an emergency all they have to do is text or call me.

1dz7hkr,Job Hunt Curveball: How Do I Handle This?,"I applied for a job contracting for the government, but didnt get it after the interview. I kept applying to jobs and months later got contacted by a staffing company that wanted to hire me for that contracting position. I was confused, but being unemployed and struggling in this job market, I couldn't pass it up. This was going to be my ""foot in the door"" position into a new career field. I was completely misled by the length of the position. I was told it was essentially permanent in vague terms and after I signed the papers I was told the contract ends in 3 months, with maybe a chance to stay on. When I showed up the team of 5 was only 1 other, everyone else had quit in the last few months. No supervisor, no manager, no training, no computer. During this time I heard back from a company I was super excited for that I applied to before this job. I am now in the final round of interviews for them and the job is overall better in every way. I am now in the awkward position of figuring out how to disclose to them that I am currently employed and recently. 

My goal was to not tell them about the current position and then just quit the current job, but now I have to fill out an online ""application"" as a formality and it asks for my most recent job. I wasn't going to tell them, but I will not lie about it. This means I have no choice but to disclose. Should I call the recruiter after and explain why it is on there? It just doesn't look good going into a final interview when I had a job start on 7/1. I was told to bring a copy of my resume to the final interview for the new possible job. Do I put the current contracting job there? It won't match the resume they currently have as it was before all this. Do I leave it off? 

Although I know it is not a good look to quit so early on, I feel I was deceived by the job and haven't been given any resources to succeed in this role. Everyone quitting recently also scares me, especially when there is rumor the only other employee may quit, leaving me ""in charge"" (alone without any knowledge or training in the position). But I know long term, the possible new job is better for my career and more job satisfaction. I also want to say I know this could possibly burn a bridge in future, but this is not a branch of the government I ever want to work for again, it was purely due to the physical location of the office. 

The possible new job is also looking for someone to start asap so I worry I will hurt my chances if I stick out the 3 month term here and tell the new job I can't start for 3 more months. When originally applying to the new job I said I could start asap, but now that I technically have a job, I am not sure what to say and I think ""3 months from now"" is not the answer. ",Sensitive_Tiger1660,1,1.0,0,1720544297,2024-07-09 16:58:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dz7hkr/job_hunt_curveball_how_do_i_handle_this/,7,2024

1dz6nlo,Only way to escape my golden handcuffs is a major pay cut... anyone else run into this?,"2 years ago, I took my current engineering job as a fresh PhD grad. I work at a startup and the job is not what I expected. Instead of having the opportunity to wear many hats and collaborate with other teams, I work at an off-site lab as essentially a technician. The work is soul-crushingly boring and repetitive. I take as many opportunities as I can to work ""above my level"", drafting R&D plans and leading the occasional meeting, but in the end when I ask to work with person X on project Y I am told that I'm needed in the lab. I've discussed my career growth with the executives in our 1:1s, and all they do is say how excited they are for the company to grow, but that just doesn't mean much to me.

It's so frustrating to realize that the skills I have now are the same ones I had two years ago. It seems like my options are:

1. Find an equivalent technician-level job with more opportunities for growth - these require about a 20% pay cut.
2. Acquire some skills on my own time - working on this now as I'm attending grad school (again) part time, but this alone isn't enough to get a better job it seems like.

What are key components to include in an application from a sort of skills/want to improve stand point. These were done on the UK government website so it has the typical subheading questions of what would you like to improve and what do you believe to be your strengths etc.

For the interview is there anything I could do to stand out, I understand the need of research into the company but is there any questions or specific research to make me stand out or appear to have gone above and beyond the bare minimum.
I had questions in mind such as progression options, how the monitoring process will work, being trained, what I will do once the college course is complete.

Any help is appreciated, the company I got rejected by has the highest wage listed, not that it it's the sole thing I'm going for but their role fitted what I enjoyed and they have a tooling engineer one active now which is machine operation type tasks and I've had prior experience of it so I might be able to give that one a shot.

Recently I got a new fulltime job where I live, it seems like it’s a good job and I am Looking forward to it. 

The problem, however is that I really want to do a one year Cultural program contact with Disney. (I’ve done this twice before) 
The reason i want to is because my friends from previous programs Are doing it again, I really liked my time on my programs and I Even became a healthier person on the programs, and I really miss it. 

I start the new job in august and wouldn’t go to Disney until around march-may 2025. That would give me a few months to work my ass off in hopes that they would take me back when I return.

When they interviewed me they thought it was super cool that I had two programs on my back and didn’t seem concerned or ask if I would do another one. I still don’t want to seem like an employee  who can’t be trusted because they would leave that quickly into the new job. My old employers were super supportive about it and promised me a job when I came home. I still work for them and they even said to my new employer that if it doesn’t work out they want me back. Still supportive that I got that job tho. 


Still, I have no clue what to do. I feel like I should do things like that while I’m young. Live while I can, especially now with the state of things in the world. But I don’t want to risk fully losing this new job if it turns out I actually like it.  It’s not something I’ve ever considered working with before and I do want to work in tourism maybe eventually, but I do not want to throw away a good work opportunity for one year abroad.

1dz54sb,Is Alteryx or AWS Machine Learning a better option for a data analyst?,"Hi all,

I'm currently a data/business insight analyst in the UK with 2 YoE, using SQL for data querying and blending, IBM's SPSS for statistical analysis and Power BI for reporting and data visualisation. Occasionally I'll use python to do all 3 parts but that has been quite limited.

Have recently moved to a new company where they use Alteryx to train and run some automated models, but they're also moving their data onto AWS's cloud and are keen to use AWS's ML services ie SageMaker in the future. 

Thinking forward for the next 3 years when i plan to start potentially job search again, in terms of market demand and career potential in data and business intelligence, which would you recommend as the better option to train and familiarise myself with, ie Alteryx or AWS Machine Learning?

I understand that AWS and cloud computing in general is growing, but most jobs I've seen that require AWS's SageMaker are data scientist/enginner jobs while data analyst jobs only mention Alteryx most of the time. I'm also aware that AWS is alot more expensive than Alteryx, and so not alot of companies have it, so going down the AWS route instead of Alteryx might mean shutting myself off from more potential companies.

Would appreciate the wisdom of the career experts in this sub, thanks!

1dz3lin,The job market in 2024 from mine and others experience.,"Disclaimer, This is from talks with people in my network and not specific to a field. Some is also from my experience with searching job boards recently - which aligns with what’s being said. I have not personally been on interviews lately and am only casually looking. 

The first one from what I’ve noticed on job boards. We all know that entry level roles are asking for 3+ years related experience. Did you know some are stating “non internship” to that asked experience? I was taken aback by this. It was only one posting and at a big company (I don’t remember and am not gonna guess). 

The other one is some insights into asking for a huge list of software, a masters in that field, and some potentially unrelated work. There are two reasons for the masters ask specifically: the first is your boss having a masters, the second (and more likely) the person who worked the job before you had one. Same with the list of software and extra work done. So the company has that expectation of the next hire.

I’ll also add that networking and interviewing skills have proven to be as important as the experience you bring. I know someone who got the job over those with more experience on the bases of being the better interviewer. 

To talk further in networking, this is actually my experience trying to get volunteer work. The volunteer work came from a support group I used to attend. Not from job boards. The work I’m going there is related to my field, I am not the best candidate which I’ll admit, BUT I was there and they both know and like me. 

I’m posting this to start some discussion with others experiences in the 2024 market. If anyone has thoughts to what I stated please share them. Keep in mind as I said, this is our experiences - this is not to say all companies do these practices or agree with them.

1dz1xx0,Should I leave Permanent Job for Temp Job at company I want to work for. ,"So I’ve been working in the same niche industry for around 10 years, the company I’m at I’ve been with for going on 4. I drive almost an hour to work everyday and am paid $22 an hour, forced to work 6 (48 hours) days for half the year and 4 (40 hours) days the other half of the year. The half of the year I’m working 6 days kills me and the drive sucks. I saw an ad for a temp job for a company that is 5 minutes from my house that pays $25 an hour. It’s sort of the same industry, but a bit different. They offered me a contract that would be for 90 days and according to the temp agency if all goes well I would be hired on with the company of choice with a pay increase. The only problem is that while I’m working for the temp industry I could work a schedule of my choosing (day shift) and if I got hired on they could potentially switch me to night shift. I have not yet reached out to the actually company to hear their side of things yet. I’m just wondering if this is a stupid gamble or worth shooting my shot? If I needed to ask for my job back, my boss would likely hire me- but at a lower rate of pay.

1dz16qu,Lost PhD student,"Hello! I am currently a full-time PhD student in Tokyo. When I started my PhD, I was quite motivated and thought it would help me advance in my career, as not everyone gets such an opportunity. When I was invited to do a PhD in Tokyo, I thought highly of myself deep inside. I never considered myself intelligent or particularly skilled. To be honest, I always thought a PhD was something only really smart people could aspire to.



Anyway, being invited to do a PhD in Tokyo, I thought to myself, ""Well, maybe I am not as bad as I thought. Maybe what I do is worth it.""



I grabbed my things and decided to embark on this adventure. I must add that my parents were not particularly convinced it was the best for me. Of course, they supported me in the end, but they were never fully convinced. In fact, I think I will always remember what my dad told me one night: ""Why do you want a PhD? You are going to waste your working years getting a PhD. You will be lonely, and no girl is going to want to be with you.""



To this day, my dad's words keep resounding in my head, as I am indeed extremely lonely in Tokyo. Not by choice, I have no friends here, and I feel like all I am doing is a waste. I see how some of my classmates from my undergraduate years are doing better than me. They stayed in the country and are working for good companies. In short, I think they are successful professionals.



I studied Mechatronics and got a Master's degree right after, as I got a scholarship. My initial career plan was to get a PhD and work for a good company in R&D. I wanted to work in the field of robotics/soft robotics.



I digress. As soon as I arrived in Tokyo, everything seemed amazing, but I started having trouble with all the bureaucracy. I managed to solve everything from getting a bank account to getting water, electricity, etc., in my apartment.



At first, I was invested in learning Japanese and all. However, as time passed and I experienced how Japanese students acted with me and other foreign students in our lab, I got discouraged. This was not the only thing that pushed me away from learning more Japanese, but it was one of the reasons.



I continued my studies up until now. I have been accepted for conferences nationally and internationally. However, I think academic conferences are a fraud. The organizers get money from you, and accepting the work you sent them might not mean your work is meaningful at all.



After two years of PhD in Tokyo, I feel like all I have been doing is a waste. I also believe I do not have the right advisors as their areas of expertise are quite different from mine. I work with soft robots and compliant mechanisms, while they work with control theory applied to space-related topics.



I think I should also add that I do not get valuable feedback from my advisors and pretty much rely on myself for everything, as they do not have much expertise in my area. Therefore, it is quite easy to get lost.



At this point, I am mentally tired. I have no willpower to get out of bed. No matter how much I sleep, I am always tired and cannot focus on anything. I also feel homesick and useless. I am even tired of the food and get irritated easily.



To add to my problems, I recently got a paper rejected from a Q1 journal of Elsevier. One reviewer went as far as saying the methods were ""rudimentary"" (although there have been similar math methods used in papers published by the same journal), and the other commented that he was confused as to why space was mentioned if it is soft robotics.



I have come to the conclusion that academia is not for me. One of my supervisors suggested they cannot really help me much as my research is out of their scope. He suggested I should go somewhere else. However, the Japanese sensei is adamant about it.



I am no longer sure I want to be outside of my country anymore. What I have experienced in Japan has been enough to dismiss the idea of working or living abroad.



My question to you all is: Do you think it is healthy to continue the PhD? I just want to continue so as not to upset my PhD advisors and because maybe I would be in debt if I decided to leave. In addition, my dad's words keep resounding in me. I want to prove him wrong.



Should I seek help? I think I am about to collapse. However, seeking mental attention here in Tokyo... I do not know.",Past-Fill549,4,1.0,3,1720528229,2024-07-09 12:30:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dz16qu/lost_phd_student/,7,2024

My competency is basically program and events organization. I want to be able to transfer these skills to a new job position if possible. 

As background: 
I have a BA in Humanities and an MA in Asian Studies. I loved studying these and my heart gravitates toward learning more about people, cultures, and also languages. But I realized I have no patience in research and teaching so I ended up not being able to get a job aligned to those courses.

Later on I got promoted to Program Officer for a Business Economics course targeted towards company executives going back to school for some business insights and also networking.

I desperately need more hours and consistency, and my partner has said if I can land a full-time job we might be able to look into purchasing a home since they have an excellent full-time job. 

Two and a half years ago I had a full-time position as a qualified Assistant in Nursing at an aged care facility for four years, but that job was horrific and traumatising and I won't work in another facility. 

My other jobs have mostly been casual and unrelated - a bakery cleaner, kitchen hand, call centres, and now a deli assistant. I don't drive, which seriously limits me but public transport is decent and I'm happy to walk. 

I've been doing the usual job search with no real luck, but I find myself feeling the exact same way I did when I was 20, no idea what to do or where to go, in an unstable job and relying on my partner for financial support (11 years together), throwing resume after resume into the void and desperately hoping someone picks me. 

What are some good, accessible, evergreen careers that I might be able to commit myself to doing? I'm happy to study for it but it needs to be affordable and reasonably fast to complete.

This is a coordinator position and the hours will be varied. Usually shifts 7-3:30 or 2-11.

I am torn about the 2 as the finance job has the hours I always dreamed of but the coordinator position is for a company that pays sick pay and maternity which are the main perks I would not get in the finance position. The coordinator position also pays about £10000 more a year.

All feedback I’ve received has been very positive. I am one of the few women in a very male dominated workforce, so although I don’t really ‘fit in’ with all of my colleagues, I am polite, professional and friendly, and have never been involved in any sort of conflict. 


Around 5 months ago, my manager advised me of an internal restructure, where my department and another would be merged, but that my role and team would be unaffected, and I’d just report into a newly promoted internal line manager (who would head up both teams). I was a little confused at the reasoning behind this decision (the two departments have very little crossover and are pretty much independent of each other), but he dismissed my questions and avoided giving me any straight answers.


Since then, it is like my role no longer exists. I am still the department manager in name, but that is all (the new manager was given a  slightly different job title to me). The senior management team now liaise directly with him and not me, and I am excluded from meetings and business decisions that I would usually be consulted on. The new Manager lacks my experience and I am just expected to assist him where there is a need for my technical expertise (which is fairly often). Personally, he seems nice enough - I get the impression he has been put in an awkward position by the senior management team, and he has no idea how to deal with me.

I’ve spoken with him directly and asked for a clear definition of each of our roles, but it’s impossible to draw a distinction - he has been given my job.


I feel that I am being managed out (via restructure) and am basically training up my replacement, but cannot see what I can do to avoid this. There is nothing to make me believe they are gearing up to give me a new opportunity or other responsibilities.


I know it would be sensible at this point to start working on my CV and applying for other jobs immediately, but I am not in a position to consider that currently. My partner and I are trying for our first baby (12 months trying), and my current employer offers a fairly good maternity scheme. At 37 I am too old to put trying on hold whilst I move jobs and then wait to become eligible for maternity pay. 


I have not shared the fact that I am trying to start a family with anyone at work, but I cannot help but wonder if this plays a factor in their decision to cut me out.


Are there any sensible steps I can take to protect myself and my role whilst I try to ride this out (ideally until I fall pregnant and can claim my maternity leave)? I am trying to stay positive and just get on with delivering my work to a high standard, but this, along with the pain of ongoing fertility struggles, is really starting to take a toll. I’ve always previously felt valued and believed myself to be well thought of at work, but this has left me hurt, angry and sad. 


Any advice appreciated, thank you.",Angustine,1,1.0,2,1720514568,2024-07-09 08:42:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dyxh5o/ive_been_replaced/,7,2024
1dyx232,New role: overload and underpaid (possibly) ,"Hi. Please let me know if this is the wrong sub and where I should post this. 

I've recently moved into Project management from business analysis. I'm a junior project manager at the moment supporting several projects and project managers, who are paid at least 25-30k more than me. I've got good transferable skills from my previous role, which they find useful (deliberately trying to be vague here but think power BI).

Some of the project managers have 2-3 projects, whilst I have 10 on the go. One of the Project managers have gone on long term sick now (no return date in site) so I've stepped up to cover her absence, leading her projects. Those are going well to be fair and I'm getting lots of praise but the one of the other project managers are still demanding I spent 2+ days a week on their projects. I'm tired. I spoke to my manager who insisted in drop 2 of these supporting projects, but they are fighting back and just calling me non-stop to get the work. They are not even thankful when I complete it so I just feel taken advantage of. They consult me for everything at the moment which is exhausting and I don't know how much work they are actually doing because it's my work he presents in meeting and stamps his name on.

I really like this job, it's a good company but HR is dis- empowered so I'm not sure who I can speak to. To be honest I wouldn't mind doing it all but not when people are being paid so much more than me. Can you give any advice?

1dyw66o,Software Engineering - burnout / career restart ,"Hi all,

I'm in the process of recovering from severe depression and burnout that lasted for years. I lost my former job a year ago because of this. It was my first job out of university. 

I would like to get back into programming, but I've lost all my confidence. I failed miserably at this junior role, and I feel ashamed and scared to go back into the industry. I'm even struggling to reactivate my LinkedIn profile because of what people may say and how my reputation may have been impacted.

I used to be passionate and extremely hard-working, but I had a very difficult personal life which led to my burnout. 

I was thinking of starting with small personal projects and networking, but it's been very challenging to trust myself again.

For those who have been in a similar situation, how did you regain your willpower and confidence?

1dyw5wa,Do I call them or do I just wait it out? ,"So, a few weeks ago I had a phone call with this recruiter that was hiring for a specific hospital in my area for a job I really wanted. Great pay, great benefits, a sit down job, etc. The phone call went super great, everything sounded fantastic and the recruiter was really nice and everything. He even allowed me time to talk it over with my family due to how there was some logistics I needed to go over with them since this job was about 35 minutes away from me, I currently don’t hold a license so my family has to drive me, as well as my schedule would’ve been 3pm-12:00am and so I definitely needed to talk it over with my family first before I gave him the go ahead to get the ball rolling for me. 

Well, the same day, I talked it over with my family and they gave me the go ahead to talk with the recruiter about how I’m willing to take the job if there is an offer on the table. I called the recruiter back just a few hours later and again, phone call went great and he said he will contact me the next day about next steps if the hospital sends an offer and whatnot. He seemed really optimistic and used a lot of language like he was sure I was already hired there, as well as really hopeful that they would give me an offer since I had a boat load of experience. 

Unfortunately the day passed and no calls. I tried calling him but it would ring for a few seconds and then hang up. Which I thought was strange. I emailed him though asking what was going on and if he heard anything back from the hospital regarding my position. I received a text a day after and he told me that the hospital had “put a hold on offers” and he didn’t know if it’d pick up after the 4th of July holiday or not and he’d let me know if he hears anything from HR.

Kind of depressed over it. But the whole point of this post is, do I contact the guy in the next week or two to see if anything has opened? I don’t want to seem pushy or like a bother but I REALLY want the job. It seems like such a good fit for me. Or do I just wait the entirety of this month to see if he’ll contact me about another job offer?

1dyvztl,X- post r/findapath,"Advice on hard career shift

TL;DR: Behaviorist trying to go toward performance or project work. 

I've recently had several breakdowns and just gotten deep into burnout. I'm done in my field. Unfortunately I don't have my bachelor's completed (that's a different path post, and it's gonna take a lot of time), but most of it isn't anything I wanna do anyway, almost all of it is phyaocs and psychology It took me several years of adulthood to figure out why I'm not happy, and what *might* make me happier. Below is a list of things I've realized I like/think would be a good career: 

I like when my work and effort culminates into a creation. 
I like making things that make people feel good
I like feeling like I belong, have a place
I like creating experiences for people. 
I like creating ephemeral moments
I like designing
I want to act
I want to perform
I like having a place on the team 
I like pouring my emotions into my work
I like collaborating on a project with others.

It feels infantile, but this is huge for me to understand. This has led me to look more into things like project management, event planning/coprdination, venue work, theater work, concert work, mc'ing.  Hell even bartending. 

I'm currently a Registered Behavior Technician. It's a lisenced with a field that almost always gets me a job, but I know I can get back in whenever I feel like if everything fails. But it gives absolutely zero dopamine, and is so burnout inducing, so I gotta go. Unfortunately, the skills are almost entirely non-transferable to anything aside from the profesional decorum, and experience working with kids. 

I honestly just don't know how to get there, I'm happy to bide my time and save for things like online certifications or even associates level Community college classes, but wouldn't know which ones. 

I live in the Inland Empire of California, for reference.

So question for the group: 

-What other fields/jobs ring a bell by personal experience or otherwise as fitting my likes? Maybe there's something I don't know I don't know. Even entry level foot in the door stuff. 

-How do I get to that?   

Thank you all in advance. ",Top-Crab842,2,1.0,0,1720508404,2024-07-09 07:00:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dyvztl/x_post_rfindapath/,7,2024
1dyvjms,Can I give my two weeks to the boss I trust or the director manager?,"Hello, I(26F) am handing in my two weeks tomorrow to my company of almost 3 years to move on to a better opportunity. My delima is I worked with my team lead, in person, for over a year directly and built a mentor/mentee relationship with an immense amount of trust and respect. I wouldn’t have this new opportunity with out him taking a chance on me and teaching me so much. However, a couple months ago he appointed a manger over me and a new hire for a section of our team. This virtual manager, call him Jeff, has made it clear he doesn’t like me and is so fake in our one on ones. Jeff even told me I was deficient in a novice skill I’ve been teaching myself that WWE had agreed would be apart of my goals. I agree I need more experience, but I never claimed to be good at something I’m not, deficient felt very degrading considering he had only been my manager for a couple weeks. I’m pretty sure the team lead didn’t agree with the verbiage because he has never spoke to any of our coworkers that way, but didn’t say anything (at least in front of me) considering Jeff is his appointed manager. Trust me, the vibes are completely off even when we’re both smiling and making jokes/talking life stuff. I’m really good at reading people. I’ve basically been working as though I have two managers due to the team lead still using me as before and reporting to Jeff who has no clue what I’m doing. Side note, I don’t plan on voicing my concerns about Jeff’s leadership skills due to having found out his family is adjusting to a member being ill, I don’t want to cause problems even if I’ve noticed he also has had a number of “confrontations/annoyances” with other women on our team…that I don’t find to be a coincidence at all.

My question stands, can I tell my team lead first? I feel I owe him more and want to express my appreciation genuinely without having Jeff stain a happy moment. My team lead will be happy for me- that much I do know- I’m just already anxious and guilty as I’ve never quit a job before and love this team sans Jeff. After all I don’t think Jeff will be too broken up about replacing someone who is…deficient.


Also,

Would I be an asshole for mentioning to my team lead that being called deficient is a small reason as to why I took on this new role? I don’t want to cause a stir but it really took the confidence I built up in my career for the year I worked for my team lead and drained it. I was honestly shocked this new company wanted me so bad even though I expressed I’m a self taught beginner at these skills - but they appreciated my personality and solid skills, they found a place for me and created a role. I won’t lie a piece of me wants to throw him under the bus for making me feel so small when there’s a company willing to increase my current salary by almost 50% (I was underpaid, I know…but gotta start somewhere and the job market was and still is awful!)",certifiedhotmess1,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1720506675,2024-07-09 06:31:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dyvjms/can_i_give_my_two_weeks_to_the_boss_i_trust_or/,7,2024
1dyvho3,How can you believe in yourself that you are good at your job?,"How can you believe in yourself that you are good at your job?

Sorry if this post is a rambling mess. 

Throughout my career, I always had imposter syndrome, and I am so sick of feeling inadequate.

I feel like my feeling of self-worth is so tied to my job because I love what I do, I want to do a good job, but I also want to get away from it.
It also often makes me moody and stressed about work even when there is no reason to.
I have been in my industry for 8 years, and it feels silly that I still struggle with this.
I thought if I worked in my industry longer, I would be able to believe that I was good enough, but after 8 years I still feel this way.
At one point, I embraced this feeling of inadequacy knowing it pushed me to work harder and try to get better wishing one day I feel good enough, but I feel like I am not good enough after all these years.

I always feel like someone will see me through and know that I am not good at what I do and that I am just faking it.
It makes me anxious to meet new co-workers who might see me for what I truly am, analyze how people react to my presentations and replay small inquencequent mistakes that people probably didn't even notice or remember until I felt defeated.
I also struggle with feeling that I am not giving my 100% and that I am not needed when I am not super busy at work, and this feeling makes me anxious.

It’s especially maddening because I know it’s all in my head.
My peer and manager reviews have always been great.
I jump from one company to the other after a few years because often my old colleagues recruit me to their new company with a raise.
I know I am good at what I do, but it’s hard for me to believe that somehow.

My mentor, friends and even career websites tell me that I need to believe in myself more.
It's so easy to say, but how does one do that?
Do I tell myself that I am good enough in front of a mirror?
Do I write that on a sticky note and put it on my laptop? 
Should I hang up some inspirational posters?

I jest, but I am sure there are people out there who overcome this feeling of inadequacy in their careers. 
It would be great if you can share how you have done it.

1dyvgdn,Post college path?,"What to do after college

With all these, it's hard to put on a happy and confident face once I'm in front of the interviewer. I'm also terribly scared of rejection.

Job “A” is my current job I have had for the past four years, has ups and downs.. not exactly what I envisioned myself doing but it’s a job, made some friends along the way and have been promoted a bit. I feel stuck though, because all my promotions happened in 1.5 years…. And I have nowhere else to grow into, and actively get turned about when trying to pursue possible opportunities within said “A” company.

Job “B” is an internship I just started that is at another workplace… technically I don’t think job “A” should have let me do this, but my boss made a bunch of assumptions and didn’t take much interest when I told him about it (not sure why) basically shoved me off and said he’s cool with me taking three weeks to do this.. which was a surprise to me. Internship is a related field, possibly better work-life balance all that… except internships aren’t a full time garuntee haha, but it does have the possibility of producing an offer in three weeks.

Job “C” is a former boss, same job as “A” really, but with a much higher income. Some more freedoms also, but the drawback is that I would be traveling out of state mostly for work, which might not be the worst… but idk feels like a big downside.


The extra carrot here is that I am trying to juggle all three right now… job “A” I am off three weeks “vacation” for internship “B” . Job “C” thinks I will no questions start soon(after the internship ends)

Looking at transitioning into higher level government or private management roles via completing a master's. I am not adverse to leaving the profession entirely.

I've looked at a wide variety of online courses (must be online as I will continue to work full time) and have narrowed down a few potential options, keen to hear your thoughts if you have any:

Masters business/masters financial management (possibly good for director roles in Aus government? Versatile if working private?) university of Wollongong. CSP (discounted) course. 

Masters public health/masters health administration (possibly good for leadership in Hospitals and care settings). La Trobe uni. CSP (discounted) course.

Masters health economics, masters health policy 
(Good for government consultancy work?). Deakin uni. Full fee course approx 40-50k AUD. 

Any other suggestions?

1dyouzs,"CPA Foundations, Bachelor’s Degree, or Master’s for CPA Program Entry?","Hi all,
 I’m in need of some career advice and would really appreciate your input. Recently, my boss approached me about my career development, and I’m trying to figure out the best path forward.
 A bit about me: I’m a business management graduate from a state Uni from PH with 11 years of experience in AP, AR, Treasury and intercompany, majority of it are transactional. I am dumb as instead of further study and working towards a CPA qualification, I travelled instead. I’m currently living in NZ as a PR and working for a multinational company in the energy sector. My role involves managing AR, credit management, and AP for both AU NZ, with support from a shared services team in India.
I’m interested in becoming a CPA in the future, but I’m not sure where to start. Here are a few questions I have:
Can I go directly to CPA Australia and take the foundation exams, even if none of my previous qualifications are recognized? Does a business degree count towards the program or I need to take bachelor degree.
Does CPA Australia or CA ANZ offer any lecture options while taking the exams, or is it all self-study?
My boss suggested I take a bachelor’s degree in accounting, but would it be better to pursue a master’s in professional accounting since it has fewer papers?
If I take a bachelor’s or master’s degree from an accredited university, do all the units count towards the CPA, or will I only need to take certain units required by CPA?
How long does it typically take to complete an accounting degree in NZ, and will my previous certifications (certified bookkeeping in the UK, ) be acknowledged?
 
I’ve narrowed down my options for a bachelor’s degree to Open Polytechnic and Massey University for distance learning. Any reviews or experiences with these schools? For a master’s degree, I’m considering Massey and Lincoln University. Are there any other options I should look into?
 
Also, worth noting, my studies will be funded by the company, so I want to make sure I choose the most efficient and beneficial path.
 
I’m feeling a bit confused about the best route to take and would love to hear from anyone who’s been through this process or has some insights to share.

1dyotzf,Looking for a career in women's health,"HI! I'm a rising senior in high school that's trying to decide what field I'm going into in college. I'm really interested in working in women's health. I know a lot of women that have personally experienced a lot of issues concerning feeling heard in hospitals, ERs, etc. I guess it's the kind of thing where I want to do what I can to help out with the issue. When I say this, many people's first thought it that I should be an OBGYN. My issue with that is the amount of school. I know I will not end up finishing those 12+ years of school no matter how hard I try😭. Even now as I finish my junior year I'm noticing that I'm not really wired to be in school for many many many years at a time. All that to say, I'm looking for a career that makes a decent amount of money where I can live comfortably, concerns women's health/medicine, and doesn't require an excessive amount of schooling (I would do max about 5-6 years). To me, the perfect job would be working in a place like a women's center where I get to help and interact with women everyday, but I really have no idea what I could even work there as that won't take a toll on my mental health or personal life (in other words I don't want to work crazy hours all the time where work in basically my entire life). I also want to add that Ive kind of already thrown myself into a lot of healthcare related summer internships, have taken AP Psych, and plan to take AP Bio so hopefully all those things combined will help me decide if I really would like to go into the healthcare field. If I realize it's not for me I honestly have no idea what I would do so I'm hoping for the best this summer and next school year🤞

I know Im kind of asking for a lot here so Im sorry for that😭There might not be that ""perfect"" profession out there for me, but I appreciate any help I can get!! I'm still very young and I know my desires for my career might change as I get older, so I'm open to ideas that may not meet all of the criteria I mentioned.

1dylg21,"My Role Change Did Not Come With The Promised Promotion, What should I do?","Looking for some strangers advice for my partner as I am self employed and don't have to go through this BS.

My partner used to work in HR for this company and received a role change/promotion to the business management side. This transition was supposed to come with a significant pay raise to reflect the change. 6 months go by and the only pay change that occurs is a small pay increase as if they were receiving a year over year raise in the HR role (this alone was painful to get out of the company hence the 6 month timeline). Bonus' and everything since have all been as if they never moved out of the HR role although the workload and responsibility have drastically shifted. In the company systems, it still show they are the same level as their previous HR role as well. Every time it is brought up with team leads, they all agree the pay is under what is needed, they agree they will schedule a call with whoever needs to be help fix it, a few weeks go by the issue is brought up again and the team leads begin the process over again like no meeting ever happened.

From my prospective there seems to be no real intent for any pay raise to occur and they are stringing everyone along. Here we are a year later with no change. There is always someone more ""important"" who needs a pay correction and yours will be taken care of next.

Since my partner was on the HR side, they know salaries for each position and know they are underpaid by at least 30k (as of the 3 year old pay scale they had). Can one assume with inflation that this scale would be higher as of today? Are they crazy to ask for some sort of back pay in this job market?

1dyknt1,What Career Paths Should I Consider for Supporting Young Carers?,"Hello everyone,

I grew up as a young carer and recently discovered my passion for supporting others who are in similar situations. I’m eager to deepen my understanding and pursue further studies in this area at university.

Here’s a bit about me: I completed 90 credits towards a general science degree in Canada, but my GPA was only around 2.5. I’m now 27 years old, self-employed (with some success), and have been involved in coaching projects to support children in need. I also work as a digital marketer.

Given my background and interests, I’m unsure which field or degree would be best to pursue. What career paths should I consider? Any advice on further education or roles that would allow me to support young carers would be incredibly helpful.

The other thing is that he is working from home this week, and I am going on vacation Thursday thru Tuesday 🤦🏼‍♀️ So I have no idea how to turn in my resignation letter!

1dyian1,Career Options,"I am torn

I am currently a manager. I make 145k a year with OT and bonus I make around 190k. This spot also has a take home work vehicle. Downfall is I manage 100 union employees and everything that comes with that. Everything else is perfect.

I have 2 options for advancement coming up for me. One gives me a 10k raise (155k) with bonus 180k, will still have OT, just not sure how much and still a take home work truck and less stress. There is a possibility of being away from home for a couple days at a time. Not managing internal employees only contractors. If the position goes as planned it’s an amazing notch in my resume. Not a very known position until the job is completed. 

Option 2 is a 35k raise 180k+ Bonuses = 210k so I won’t need to work OT. no take home truck and no OT. Manage less employees(about 50). Better direction in the company. Not sure I want to work for this boss. I would have to implement a lot of changes that might not go over well. Kind of a department that’s struggling. If I get things turned around it’s also great for me. Position is a very visible spot in the company.

Option 2 I won’t have to work OT to get to the money I would like to be at. I will lose a company truck and it’s not my ideal job. Not the most flexible schedule. 

Option 1 I will need to work OT but I still get a company truck and be in a happier position but possibly not the best career path. Career path is a gamble with this one. Could go great.

I'm looking at going into electrical engineering in robotics/automation and I've seen a 12mo L2 Engineering Operative Apprenticeship where I'd be working to install and maintain machines for an assembly line. The duties (as listed on the site) are below:

* Assist in the assembly of machines and attachments
* Investigate problems and repair faults 
* Run effective testing and diagnostics to improve products
* Assemble machine parts as per design drawings
* Work with micro controllers and motor drive systems
* Utilise electronics in a production environment
* Conduct fault-finding to component level
* Understand and use circuit diagrams
* Build and test PCB assemblies
* Perform fault finding and investigation of electronics hardware
* Build electronic components and circuits for lifting machines

I'd just like to know if you guys think it's a good idea to take. Also, should I take this over a 4 year L3 Electrical Fitter apprenticeship (which doesn't specialise in automation) with better pay?

My employer (publicly funded and notoriously does not negotiate pay) has a pay grid system that has bands and then 10 steps within each band that go up incrementally in pay.  Within a job, you band does not change, it is just your step that increases each year. Bands only change with job changes to a more senior/manager role. It is complicated and hard to navigate so I will explain as best I can. All bands and pay steps are increased each July 1 by 2% for inflation (lol I know). Your pay increases on the anniversary date of your role. I am a currently a band 12 in a step 4 which is 92,546 with an anniversary date of August 12. I applied for a 12 month secondement and received an offer to a 12 month position that is pay band 13 (manager role and more responsibility). They offered me originally step 3 which was $95,404. Per our union guidelines they are only obligated to provide a 3% min increase when moving up a band (12 to 13 in my case) from the date of the contract (does not matter that I go up in 4 weeks). I pointed out that I am going up to that amount in my current role in a few weeks, so they upped to step 4 in band 13 for $98,267. However, if I take this contract now, in 2025 when I go back to my original role  I ""loose"" my pay band 12 step increase because I was technically in a different role for a year. I go back to step 4 July 25 2025, which will be $94,212, and then step 5 on my anniversary date of Aug 12. 2025 of $97,036. If I stayed in my current role and refused this offer, I would go up to band 12 step 5 at $95,320 Aug 12 2024, and then step 6 Aug 12, 2025 at $99,948.

1dyee2e,What would you do in this situation?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a twenty-year-old entrepreneur, and after 4 years of hard work, my business is finally picking up. A client, who had a four hundred pound budget for a full website, now wants to offer me a job. The role would involve acting as their IT specialist, web and graphic designer, digital marketer, and handling all related tasks.

I really like this client and don't want to blow the deal by asking for too much, but I also don't want to feel robbed as I'll be doing alot. I was thinking of asking for around two hundred pound a week. Is this a reasonable amount or is it too high/low? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Current goal: I'd like to purchase a Dodge charger redeye before I'm twenty four.

1dydd7a,Should I cancel upcoming job interview after receiving conditional job offer from same department,"So, I got a conditional job offer from NHS but also an upcoming interview with the same NHS department. Both roles are pretty similar, but I kind of want to see if I am successful at the interview and then choose between the two options. I have really been struggling to get interviews so cancelling one feels so wrong to me. Last Friday I received a call from management asking me if I was still intending to interview for the second post as I already had received a conditional offer for the other post. This was through voicemail as I wasn't able to take the call. I haven't called back yet because I am unsure as to what to do. At the bottom of the conditional offer reads: ""If you have recently applied for other roles within NHS XXX then, you may wish to withdraw your applications via the candidate portal."" Does this mean they expect me to withdraw my other applications/interviews? or is it an optional thing? and if I don't cancel the interview would this be seen as me not being interested in the provisional offer I already have?

1dyd9k1,I think i am going to get fired,"I think i am going to get fired

I’m a 23 year old working at a CPA firm in the US.  

I started in January, went through a grueling tax season (60 hour weeks for months)

Felt like i worked very hard and tried my best

However, my manager’s semi retired husband in a way “snitched” on me for being on my phone.  Contextually, after i spent 2 hours on a return id just get up, grab some water, and reply to a couple texts before i dove into another return. 

I then had a meeting with my supervisor and she said she wants to see me succeed and all that stuff, but i need to really get focused and do this and that and the other thing.  And she said “i don’t want to have to go through training another new hire”.  Obviously letting me go was on the table.  This was months ago, though.

Now, In no way was a slacking or lazing off.  I’m not making excuses for myself. I understand that they don’t care about that at all.  It just sucks because i can work very very hard, take a 5 minute break every once in a while, and now my reputation is that i am lazy.  But i do understand that i am technically in the wrong and they have every right to be upset with me.

Now that tax season is over, there is very, VERY little work to do.  I am not going to meet my charge hour budget but several hundred hours.  It’s impossible.  I send out emails looking for work often and get no responses.  

Normally, I’d just say “well this isn’t my fault so they can’t scold me for it”.  But the fact that they view me as lazy and not a hard worker already leads me to believe that they will not take that very much into consideration.

The firm had compensation meetings a few weeks ago.  Mine went very poorly.  They said i do not show that i want to be here.  They said i am not improving at the same rate that everyone else is.  And looking back, yeah, they’re right.  I have done a piss poor job of showing that i want to work there.  I’ve been late for meetings a couple times, I’ve forgotten to update my update template for staff meetings a couple times.  I also take very long on projects and engagements.  Not due to lack of effort, but because frankly i am a slow learner.   I can tell i am looked at as an awkward, lazy employee.  Sometimes i am shocked that i am even still employed.  

Now, once i was hit with this realization that this is the situation i am in, i have changed everything.  I have been getting to work extremely early, working hard when i have work to do, being on time to meetings, and just doing what i have to do.  

However, i just think it’s kinda too late.  My reputation is in the gutter.  

The only good thing is that we are in such a slow time at the company, so i figure they would have done it by now if they planned on it.  But i really don’t know

Should i expect the worst, cut my losses, and start looking for another job?


Tl:dr- i think i am goin to get laid off for being “lazy” but i can’t be sure.  Should i start looking for new jobs?

1dyd7cw,"Trouble tolerating jobs, any advice?","Hi, I struggle with a big problem that nobody seems to understand.

Right now, I don’t have a job because I keep getting bored of them very quickly and quitting. I absolutely hate structure, routine, and being controlled. I can’t handle being in one location too long or too often. I get very antsy and want to leave as soon as possible. I’m not lazy at all, I don’t have any problem doing job tasks and can be quite a workaholic under certain circumstances, but not when I have to go to the same place every single day and be there a long time. Right now, I just get money from Social Security income, which I’m embarrassed to say.

I’ve had jobs mostly working at animal shelters and pet stores, since I like animals, and my last job was at a school as a classroom aide. I worked hard at these jobs and completed the job tasks with no difficulty (all my bosses said I was a great worker), but I got very bored of going to the same place every day and couldn’t hold on to the routine any longer.

This isn’t anything new, I had the same issue in school and had horrible attendance (I nearly got held back in elementary school, and did get held back in high school due to poor attendance). I worked hard, got good grades, and was very well-behaved, but I got antsy being in one place all the time and wanted out.

Outside of my academic and career life, I spend my free time traveling and exploring places (usually in my own city, but also other states and countries when I can afford it). Traveling and exploring the world is my #1 most favorite thing to do in life, and would do it full time if I could. I don’t watch TV, play video games, or spend much time on social media like most people do (I’m way too restless for those things). I need to be physically active and move from place to place. Other activities I would do if money weren’t an issue include skydiving, horseback riding, bungee jumping, whitewater rafting, and so on (I love doing adventurous things).

If you’re wondering what my skills and talents are like, I’m naturally good at cleaning and organizing things, giving directions (telling people where to go), photography, videography, creating art (though I’m not a “professional” artist), writing, singing, and acting.

Any advice for me?",TiminAction,0,0.4000000059604645,7,1720456108,2024-07-08 16:28:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dyd7cw/trouble_tolerating_jobs_any_advice/,7,2024

1dybs31,Is imposter syndrome normal ? ,"Good morning, I’ve been following this subreddit for a while and have been lurking in the shadows. I’ve wanted to post this for a while but always feel stupid for trying to reach out and read the room. I’m a 25 (m) and work at a bank making 90k a year and am absolutely miserable. I’ve been in banking for about 5 years. I started as a teller with the intent of going to college and when my employer offered me better positions and in conjunction of helping put my wife through college I continued to accept and move up. Now I’m in this manager role with no degree and the feelings of imposter syndrome seem to hit harder everyday. I don’t feel like I understand my position at all and even feel like the reason I’ve been promoted was due to my peers liking me rather than my actual proficiency. This has caused me to feel like a failure. Like I’ll never be good at anything and as if my entire existence is a lie. I’m constant in fear that my employer will realize I’m An imposter and will fire me. I’m always fearful they are catching on even when I’m doing nothing wrong or have no clear evidence they are. Even when my boss praises me I don’t believe it. Has anyone else experienced this before ? How do I get out of it ?

With all of that, I currently make $57,000 (just got a 5% raise) and I’ve been in the education field for 7 years. This brings me to why I’m posting. My cousin works at a college and brought up me going to get an MBA. At first I scoffed at the idea because I never really had an interest in business, but the more I’ve thought about it, the more I’ve been open to the idea. I’ve been talking about it with my fiancé and she’s opened to the idea but her and I came to the same conclusion that I don’t know what I would do with it. I wanted to come here and see if I could get some help or some ideas on what fields I could get into. My interests include sports (big baseball fan), video games, trying new places (food wise). I know that the transition from education to business would be a huge change, but I would love to find something the goes along with my interests and gives me more of an opportunity for a better future financially and also gives me a chance to learn proper budgeting skills and continuing to grow my organizational skills.

1dyajlb,Remote Management Advancement Questions,"Hi everyone. I currently have a remote woking job that gives me a fair amount of flexibility but I'm starting to realize that the skills I have learned in this job are extremely specialized and would be nearly impossible to translate to a different position. Long story short, I'm a jack of all trades but a master of none. My job is stable for now, but I would like to set myself up for a higher paying position that also offers more benefits than I currently receive. Someone I know recommended getting certified with ServiceNow, and it seems to be in my general skill. I looked up ServiceNow related jobs and the market doesn't seem to be short on them. I was thinking of going down the Technical Project Manager career journey. I also did notice that there are several other certifications that hiring companies would like on top of ServiceNow such as PMP, ITIL, Scrum Master, etc. I tried doing some research but a lot of it seems confusing and there are several different websites that can provide these certifications at different prices. It feels like it would add up to a large expense and I wouldn't want to be scammed in some way. Has anyone taken this path before and could share some advice? Is it really worth it? Are these jobs relatively easy to acquire if I put in the time/money to get certified?

1dya9j5,28M Career Hopper ,"I've career hopped from bookkeeper to middle school teacher to pharmacy tech to almost Chemist & LPN. I have 2 degrees: one in political science/history and one in chemistry. I enjoyed studying chemistry and even wanted to go for my PhD at one point, but being trapped in the lab doing the same thing all the time and having almost no human interaction bored the hell out of me. Also, I don't want to be stuck in the PhD life of constantly publishing bs papers to hopefully get a stable job and continue the rat race. Not to mention, most college students don't care about learning anymore. Recently dropped out of an LPN technical program because the stress of keeping the patients alive was too much for me, the lack of autonomy, and it is really hard work. I enjoyed the medical side much more than the nursing side. Pharmacy tech was just being an assembly line worker who gives people their meds.

I really enjoy using my mind and learning, but I also want to interact with ppl lol. I need human interaction at work, but I find that a lot of jobs that require human interaction don't want you to use your brain to the fullest. I love history and most science subjects. I've considered tour guide or museum guide but I want to be able to eat and get paid a liveable wage lol. I'm getting older and want a job that pays at least 40k so that I don't have to worry about money as much anymore lol. My current plan is to get certified as a medical assistant and then go back to school for 2 years to become a radiation therapist (they make 90k).

Any ideas of careers that might match what I want? Any ideas are appreciated! I'm really getting tired of changing and want to settle in a career. Thank you!

1dy7enn,Thoughts on connecting with the hiring manager on LinkedIN after sending resume?,"I am not sure if this is the right forum. I am an applicant in job search mode. Often times on LinkedIN they show the recruiter or hiring manager within the company who posted the job as well. I will usually request to connect after I send in a resume because, in my mind, it is putting a face to a piece of paper.

Thoughts on this, helping or hurting my chances or neutral. i.e. it goes both ways?

Also thoughts on actually messaging the recruiter after connecting? (I have not done this yet, but am considering based on people's responses) Messages like:

-I just applied for XYZ, I would be really excited to work there, please let me know if you have further questions

-I have been applying to XYZ with no luck, please let me know of any other positions that you think I would be a good fit...

-I have applied for XYZ and I am very well qualified, please let me know what I can do to make sure my application gets noticed.

Are these types of follow ups warranted, helpful, or a total no-no? As you can probably guess, I am not getting many callbacks. And I know for a fact that I am overqualified for a position because a previous coworker with similar qualificiations is at the new company I want to work for. And he is trying to get my resume noticed as well. I even hired a professional resume writer to rewrite my resume with all the fancy buzzwords to get you past the AI screeners. I know market conditions have changed since when he was hired, and the whole concept of tricking AI screeeners is b.s. but that is another tangent.

My company has offered me a maternity procedure. They're willing to give me 90% pay including SMP for the first 6 wks and 50% pay for the remaining 39 weeks and l can take up to 52weeks maternity leave whiles accruing my holidays too. I work fulltime and currently earn £38.5k per year at the moment and l do pay both my undergrad, postgraduate loan, salary sacrifice for pension, tax and NI. In the end l take home about £2300 a month. They're main reason was they're contributing over £6k to my pay, which is double the SMP. My boss kept on emphasing SMP is very mean and they're doing they're best to meet my pay halfway. I'm really worried cause soon l will be getting a mortgage for my new house and l'm doing this pregnancy alone without the help of my bf because he ended the relationship as he wanted an abortion and l wanted to keep the baby. I was going to ask my company to increase the 50% to at least 70% of my full pay for 39 weeks but not sure if that will be a decent request. However, there's also this issue l've been carrying for a while where l'm not happy with my pay at the moment with the amount of work l do. They had initially offered me £45k in the begging but dropped it down to £35k and with split 10% rise after 6 months probation increasing it to £38.5 which was part of the contract and agreed terms in the beginning. The reason why the didn't do the £45k was because they took on someone with more experience than me and earning £60k but we pretty much do similar jobs sometimes and he even comes to me asking questions on other things cause l'm always up to date with stuff around the plant and always willing to do more. However, this guy is leaving in September for a better opportunity elsewhere. My MD mentioned in the beginning that my pay is most likely to increase to £45k+ after a year experience. Therefore, been wondering as well, do l keep the 50% and ask for salary review with increase after my 1yr in September or do l try and attempt the 70% maternity pay from my full wage including SMP as the company commitment to me. I'm really stuck and don't know what to do.

He said he'd phone me back in a couple of weeks to see if I had made my decision. I have made the decision now and I will not be staying on. This was my first job so I have absolutely no idea how to tell him I'm not staying on. Any advice on how I can still seem appreciative about the opportunity but still quit and not seem rude? This whole situation is very stressful for me and idk how to approach it.

1dy3z75,Career Advice: Accounting vs IT?,"Hi everyone,

I could use some advice on a major career decision. I’m an currently an ACCA-qualified accountant with eight years of experience in the UK financial industry. Recently, I’ve been signed off work for the past three and a half months due to work-related stress and my time off allowed me the time to consider my career future. The job culture at my current company is intense, requiring me to check emails constantly, even during meals and holidays.

Now, I have two job offers on the table:

1. **Accounting Job**: This aligns with my qualifications and offers £60,000 annually. It promises fewer hours and less responsibility than my current role.
2. **Entry-level IT Helpdesk Job**: This role pays £26,000 annually. I’ve always had an interest in IT but never pursued it as a career. The end goal would be to transition into cyber security, potentially as a red team member, or a SOC analyst (currently undecided but working towards my security + cert) This path would require me to gain new qualifications and experience.

I’m torn because:

- The accounting job offers financial stability and utilises my existing skills, but I’m unsure if the stress I experienced was due to the field itself or my previous company’s culture.
- The IT helpdesk job is a significant pay cut but could lead to a fulfilling career in cyber security, which I find intriguing. However, the financial strain and the need to invest time in gaining qualifications could be stressful.

Additionally, with the IT job, I would need to work a second job amounting to about 20 hours a week to make ends meet financially. This would cut into time for friends, family, myself, and any other pursuits, totaling 60 to 65 hours a week. The accounting job is contracted for 35 hours a week, allowing me time to do both the certifications, my job, and maintain a work-life balance.

I’m not sure if I dislike accounting itself, as it’s hard to judge after being away from it for a few months. I also worry about having less time and money to spend with family and friends if I pursue IT.

I would appreciate insights from anyone who has been in a similar situation or has experience in either field. Is it worth taking a risk on a new career path in IT, or should I stick with accounting and explore IT certifications on the side?

**TL;DR:** Deciding between a high-paying accounting job with better work-life balance and an entry-level IT helpdesk job requiring a second job to make ends meet but with potential for a fulfilling career in cyber security.

Thanks in advance for your advice!

I spend a lot time applying to different vacancies in my region and abroad. I feel like I competitive already and know enough to start career.   


After about a month of applying, it always like only people with experience required (feels like only Seniors required). And if you find one Junior vacancy there will be 300+ candidates already applied. 

I feel lost from now. I feel like I loosing my way. I have spent last 2 years working on myself in that direction, and I simply can't get a job.

It would be really helpful if somebody direct me somewhere, maybe someone has startup where I can work and gain experience for my resume , maybe somebody work in company with open positions and can help.   
I will be really glad if someone older will lend a shoulder or at least give me some advice.

A combination of injuries that didn't heal 100% combined with still working long hard hours in the UK telecoms sector. 

The last 5 months in particular the intensity has taken a step up. I'm self employed so no work = no money. When I take time off to rest it, within a wee back it will flair up, often to the point of needing to take more time off. I seen physios, osteopathic, doctors etc but nothing seems to be getting to the bottom of it to be honest.

Anyway the writings is on the wall for me I feel at 27 that I need to move into something where I'm not just payed for what I do, but would like to start to learn an in demand skill thats not so hands on as such?

The regular answer is coding/programming but that's really not suitable for me personality wise. I forced myself through a CCNA and wanted to headbutt a knife by the time i was done. 

Sales maybe an option but I hear mixed things on what it's actually like to work in sales in the UK? 

I consider myself a big hitter at any job I've done, just in my nature that I like to turn up and go above and beyond  as apposed to drifting through a day.

But looking for some inputs as to which direction to steer my energy into now.

Currently, I work for my stepdad‘s waterproofing and remodeling company. This is a great business. I never knew how much money was in this type of service business  in my area which is the Midwest. He has all the tools that you can think of to get any sort of job done and even started my own handyman business for side money bc You can actually make a shit ton of money doing this, but advertising is the name of the game as with any business.

We are small business, but you manage to get by and there are some months where he can make really great money upwards of $50-$60,000 a month and then there are some months that aren’t so good usually 8 to 10 K. I know you’re thinking this is great , I don’t see a problem

But are bills are equally as high and my parents do spend a lot of money but besides that It is very hard to get workers to do this line of business and not saying you always need a ton of workers cause there are some jobs like crack jobs that pay really well usually between 500 to 1500 per job and can do it by myself however there are also other jobs where you do need workers and so far, we’ve just been hiring Mexicans from Home Depot 

Long story short there will come a day where my stepdad doesn’t want to do this business anymore and I feel like it’s coming soon. I do like the business and it is very interesting and I’m very thankful for everything. I’ve learned remodeling and waterproofing wise. Bite before I joined I spent two years in college before hand, and got nothing out of it, and I have a chance to go and finish for my associates and certifications in the tech industry before he either goes into another business or something bc he’s a felon and can’t get a normal job.  So he has to do that bc he’s getting old and can’t keep up with the work.  

I do love the business and was fully committed to getting us work and we became a 5 star rating company on Google (34 Reviews all 5 stars) but I’m starting to think maybe I should go into the tech field bc I love technology and have a keen mind for it and tbh I don’t want to keep working with my hands.  However I’m set up to do this through his business and his tool he has.  

But the dilemma comes bc Ik the state of our economy and the state of ai and automation jobs and service industry like ours has a very strong resistance to recessions but I also want to go into tech and build a career bc with the right job I feel that can be recession proof as well.  

Idk on one hand the business makes a lot of money and is recession proof so there’s piece of mind with that 
But on the other 
I love technology and Ik I can make a strong portfolio finish college and get a strong career with great pay too 

But I just don’t know what to do but I’m running out of time I hate being so indecisive and I’m not getting any younger 

Sorry for keeping this so long I just want to know what you guys think

1dxzltj,Should I remove my first job that I took out of desperation from my resume?,"For context it was my first job out of undergrad, and the company is one that rhymes with Babylon and the role was as an Operations Area Manager. This is a job I took right after graduation during peak Covid. While most people I know were fortunate enough to get remote jobs or solid job offers to jump start their careers I was not so lucky.

This job was absolutely miserable, and I am surprised I worked there for as long as I did (1 year). I was essentially an adult babysitter and I think other than people management skills (which is not what I'm looking to do currently in my career), I did not learn anything marketable or technical.

Out of desperation to leave that job I took the first job I could get that wasn't a huge pay cut (I was constantly applying throughout the year). This lead me to a role as a Loan Operations Analyst. I actually really enjoyed this job but it was a small company and there was no projected growth which lead me to my current role as a Regulatory Analyst with a larger company.

I recently finished my MBA with a concentration in Finance, and despite that I have been struggling with getting looks in my applications. My theory is having my first job on my resume is hurting my overall appearance as an applicant because in my short career span (4 years) it makes it look like I job hop a lot, am unsure of my career direction, have been unable to move up (if anything move backwards coming from a management role), and have little to no STAR stories that come from that role.

I think taking this off would alleviate these issues as well as create more intentional space on my resume. My only concern is if I would get questions on the one year gap in my resume?

Nearly all of this is contract work, and instead of hiring local people to do the work, they are hiring out of state people or migrants and paying them per diem to do the work, while the people that live here are unemployed. This insanity has continued to get worse, to the point that the only way local contract workers can stay working is through nepotism/cronyism. Everyone else is migrants. I don't know what the corporations reasoning is for doing this. They won't even allow people inside the personell office anymore without a referal. Knowledge or experience doesn't make any difference. I often think that supervision would prefer people with less experience than them, so they don't make them look dumb. I'm having much more difficulty finding work today than when I was in my 20's. The culture and people seem to have changed. I'm taking orders from people much younger than me and little experiance compaired to mine, and the working conditions have deteriorated. To make it worse, there is virtually no union to represent workers. Unions have no power in my state, and the politicans have given petro/chemical plants the authority to do as they choose, unregulated. If you contact your local politician and tell them about what is happening, they seem to think this is free enterprise capitalism, and they have the right to do as they choose. I might agree with this if the government wasn't sending all of our jobs overseas to China. I could just go find me a different job, but this ""free enterprise capitalism"" is manipulating the government and economy.",CowboyJack1,1,1.0,0,1720408715,2024-07-08 03:18:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxyr4u/how_to_change_careers_welding_in_the/,7,2024

1dxxh2u,Over 20 years experience and feel stuck,"I have worked in an industry for over 24 years now moving up the ranks steady with higher position, salary, responsibilities. During my career I have noticed I have some strengths but also have defficinces and weaknesses. When I utilize my strengths and build upon them, I feel most confident and generally get good feedback. When I have to get out of my comfort zone and push myself and try to figure out new things or things i lack at, I sometimes lose motivation or give up or become lazy; in these cases my manager (usually the one who hired me) encourages me to continue and provides positive feedback. After struggling for some time, I usually feel good about myself and what I was able to accomplish, and the skill I lacked I become better at.

I noticed that generally when managers interview me they likely have a certain perception of me and my skills but later they realize I lack in certain areas and most of the time they ""deal"" with it by supporting, encouraging and being positive but I know they may feel a bit disappointed. I usually feel a need to find another job when work becomes too difficult or my boss is ""tired"" of helping me.

On this last job, my manager decided to put me on PIP saying that I should know how to do this and that he cannot do the work for me and generally being negative during PIP which further puts me into ""giving up"" attitude and no motivation to continue this. I did indeed overstayed at this job and should have left as soon as I saw the ""signs"".

I think my main problem now in my career that my experience and knowledge in the industry comes from doing the work, asking questions, trying and trying - basically street smarts. The further I am now in my career the more I see a need for theoretical knowledge including things like communication skills, project management, negotiations and working as a team etc etc, and the need for some kind of career guidance or special classes. It doesn't help when english is not my native language plus me being introvert, so me trying to communicate often creates ""confusion"". 

Oftentimes when I am in the meeting I feel self conscious and shy to speak up because I feel like I have hard time expressing myself and people have to ask me to clarify.

Do I just simply realize that I cannot do certain jobs that require special skills and focus being IC and easy tasks? Or do I try to get coach or mentor or take classes? I have a feeling that most of my mentors would not want to work with me because I ""lack"" understanding and not ""quick witted"" etc. I consider myself average or a little above average on intelligence side. Most of the bosses I worked for, I have hard time seeing myself doing the work they do if I had their position.",FiguringOutLife7,1,1.0,0,1720404758,2024-07-08 02:12:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxxh2u/over_20_years_experience_and_feel_stuck/,7,2024

1dxwjp9,Should I quit my internship?,"So I am a mechanical engineer who is set to graduate in December of 2025. I was hired for an internship that started late this spring, and I'm only 1/4 through. 

It is at a GM factory, where they make several parts for the car. The internship was specifically listed for engineers in mechanical, manufacturing, and electrical. When I initially applied they told me I would be working with, and shadowing other engineers to see what there day to day life was and help out on projects in the factory. After I was offered the job, before I accepted they told me I would bounce around departments and work with engineers all over the plant to see what they do. 

Once I started working there, this turned out to not be the case. I am not working with any engineers, and I was stuck in Global Supply Chain (GSC) where my job the entire summer is to re-label the factory. Literally all I am doing is printing out labels that are half the size of an index card, laminating, and cutting them. Then I swap the new ones out for the old ones and repeat. I am doing nothing with engineers and getting absolutely no experience with anything in my field.

I hate going to this job everyday and want to quit so bad. Some people say I should stick it out, while others think I should drop them. Also, the pay is ok but only a little over minimum wage.

\*Note: I will be able to get another internship somewhere else next year, because I don't graduate until the winter of 2025\*",ReviewApprehensive83,0,0.33000001311302185,14,1720401883,2024-07-08 01:24:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxwjp9/should_i_quit_my_internship/,7,2024
1dxwfti,How do you organize your tasks at work? ,"Not sure if this is the right spot to put this, but I’m struggling at my corporate job. I feel like I’m not staying on top of my work. More work comes along and I then just get overwhelmed. My company has a huge network of front and back facing links that we use and can be hard to find each time you want to dive back into a project. Every time I start a project I just want to finish it before I leave for the day so I don’t lose the same mental track that I was on and also all the weirdly specific company links that are associated with the project. For the past few weeks I’ve been experimenting with different organizational methods.

 I tried handwriting each project and all of the “sub tasks” that go with them with Google tab groups for each project, but the tabs end up closing out and going back to the company home page by the next day so that didn’t work too well. The hand written part was awesome to get to see everything in front of me, but I would have to rewrite it every day which takes far too long. 

I tried Monday, Smartsheet, and looked into using a few other Microsoft office compatable applications but I’m honestly at a loss. 

My team can tell that I’m overwhelmed by the amount of work I have and they’re trying to help, but the only solution that I can imagine making the overwhelming feeling go away is to find a way to get all of this shit organized. 

What have you all found useful in organizing your projects? I’m also curious as to how other people budget their time for smaller project tasks throughout the workday/week. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1dxvtfc,Lost and Need Guidance,"Earlier this year, I accepted an offer at a firm with a September start date. Unfortunately, the firm does not have a stellar reputation in the industry and I am not excited about joining. For those wondering why I accepted in the first place, I thought having something in this job market was better than having nothing. Since then, my goal has been to apply and network to get a better offer and eventually renege on them.
Unfortunately, I have not had much luck yet in this competitive job market.

While my search has been primarily centered around the NYC area, I decided to randomly apply to a better role in Boston at the start of June. The Boston firm reached out to begin the interview process, which is expected to take the entire month of July and offers will be made at the end of the month. There are a few issues that I am facing that I will outline below:

Option #1: Gamble with the Boston firm... One of the main issues with this option is that there is no guarantee that I am going to receive the offer. If I don't receive an offer, I will be without an apartment since my current NYC apartment lease will expire in mid-August. At that point, it will very difficult for me to get one in such a short period of time. I asked my current landlord for a short term extension, but the shortest arrangemen* would be to renew for an additional seven months. I would need to decide about the apartment renewal before the Boston offer is released. In the chance that I do receive an offer, I am hesitant to move all the way to Boston since all of my family and friends are based around the NYC area. In addition, the firm is relatively small (less than $500M in total revenue), so I don't know how the experience will translate across the industry. The counterpoint to these concerns is that the role is exactly what I am looking for and the team that I would join have very impressive backgrounds.

Option #2: Renew and continue looking for another opportunity in NYC... In this strategy, I would eventually put this Boston opportunity to rest and continue looking for opportunities in the nyc area. My main concern is that there are no guarantees that I will be able to find a comparable replacement opportunity before the start date of the initial company. I can already sense how I will feel if I am forced to begin at the initial firm.

I've already asked multiple professionals and their thinking has been pretty split down the road…some arguing that there will always be others jobs and others arguing that there will always be other apartments.",Epic_Finance,1,1.0,0,1720399656,2024-07-08 00:47:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxvtfc/lost_and_need_guidance/,7,2024
1dxvpm9,Should I quit corporate?,"I probably sound like a lot of other folks on here right now but I just keep going back and forth on the whole topic and need some advice. 
I (25F) have a BA in art and MA in entrepreneurship. I got a job at a consulting firm as essentially the person who physically sets up meetings(putting out meals for meetings, setting up supplies, cleaning up etc.) and was promoted to the person who digitally sets up those meetings(talks to meeting contacts, orders the food, orders supplies, makes schedules etc.) which is a lot less physical and I’m at my desk all day. I have been working there just under two years. I have not been enjoying it all that much but the benefits and pay are pretty darn good. I’m looking to quit and start my own business in the next year or so (like an art/gift/occult/plant/coffee store type of place) and I’m wondering if quitting this job for another one that has a similar style might be smart. What I do now has NOTHING to do with I want to do. I’m not learning anything (other than maybe time management and how to deal with people I don’t like) and it’s not helping me progress at all. It’s helping me to get money for my future but that is literally it. Should I quit this corporate job and try to find a local plant store or occult shop to work in instead? Maybe I could learn a thing or two before starting my own place? 
I just get so nervous with this job market, like I shouldn’t leave in case the world falls about. It’s so scary to think about. But also I don’t want to work corporate anymore because it sucks away SO MUCH of my life and time.

1dxurtc,Sales job is affecting my every day sanity ,"Help please. I have a nice sounding corporate account manager (sales) job. However I am beyond sick and stressed because customers are LAZY and they expect me to do everything for them... Things that are beyond my control. When it doesn't happen, even though I set the expectations for them well in advance and my company supports me, they still lash out on me in awful ways. Long ass Whatsapp voice recordings on how much we suck and how much I have failed them. Even though behind the scenes I know we literally go above and beyond what any other company would do. Seriously I'm answering calls at 9-10 pm on Saturday and Sunday for a job that pays me in average $4000 USD a month! Leaving family dinners and working Sundays and Saturdays to solve customer issues.

 My director and General Manager make it a point on every performance review that I'm good but I have sooooo many areas of improvement. Never good enough. Oh, you did amazing in the most looked out metric? New business acquisition? Who cares. Your number of calls per day still suck. I always feel like I'm gonna get fired. Every time I speak with them, they tell me all the things I could be doing better. I was a person that used to ask for feedback, but now I avoid it at all costs because it's always so passive aggressive and always makes me feel like they don't want me at this company and I can be replaced any minute. I have been buying cocaine just to keep with the workload. Even though I hate how it makes me feel. My health is out the window. My relationship just ended because of all this stress. It's Sunday and between pressures from my customers and my bosses, I feel like I want to jump from my balcony. I'm never good enough even though I work from 7 am to 7 pm. Some customers (including my largest revenue builder) say I'm amazing and the best account manager they've ever had. So that's literally the only pat in the back I get. Other than that, I feel like I'm just a horrible human and worker. I know this is not the case. I'm a good person and a damn hard worker. I have been in the workforce since I was 14 and I always showed up and I have always been praised on my work ethic. I work so damn hard. I dream about work. I even work a serving job on the side to make ends meet because times are so rough, everything is so expensive and here (restaurant job) I get told I'm great every day and praised for how hard I work. I clean the smallest water spots on all glasses, I come in 20 min early, I remember customers drinks etc. my sales job I try to do the same but in my experience customers and managers just want to push you to the point of depression always making sure you know you suck. That's fine, honestly I have developed a thick skin, but I know one person who attempted suici** bc of this job and many who are in therapy. I need the money desperately. I can't quit. And on most days I love the people I can help with in my job and I love the difference I make for the companies I help. But the problem is when people get a costumed to me doing everything for them, literally I almost become like their personal secretary just for running one of their products, and I can't take it. I don't have enough hours in the day. It's Sunday and I would rather walk in front of a car than show up tomorrow and being told how stupid and awful I am. Just feel completely trapped because I can't leave this job. Idk what to do. I really don't need constant words of affirmation but I'm beyond over the constant ""you can do better"" and ""it's not enough"". At this point, what is the point of I'm doing my best and it's still not enough? Should I just unalive myself?? Would that make everyone happy ??? The amount of stress is unreal.

 I wish customers would take accountability for their lack of attention to detail to their own business and lack of organization (i.e: they forgot to pay a bill, they forgot to ask me for the necessary permissions to implement a new product on their app and now they got charged extra etc) AND I wish management would just hop off my eggplant. How about ""Good job. You did great. Keep it up. This is what we like"" vs ""hmm yeah I guess that was good but you could do better"".

I don't want to wake up anymore to this nightmare. It's affecting everything in my life. I can't breathe. I drink way too much to cope. My hair is falling out. How can some people just be born pretty and because they have 10,000 followers being naked be rich and people with degrees working 2 jobs can barely make it and they receive constant abuse? I hate the world. ",QueMierdisWey,3,1.0,3,1720396599,2024-07-07 23:56:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxurtc/sales_job_is_affecting_my_every_day_sanity/,7,2024

Im looking for some advice on my current work situation.

I took a Product Owner role after 17 + years of doing IT (Sys Admin, Development and later full stack engineering) and i feel it might have been the worst career decision i’ve made. 

I was told that although this was a PO role in the full Agile sense, there was a need for work in infrastructure and development and thus i decided to take the chance, thinking id keep expanding my Dev and IaC skills but so far its been paper pushing and writing spec documents which isn’t my cup of tea.

I like the company i work for and my current level is where i feel i should be but the company has a strict 1 Year cooldown time before applying to a new role, unless your manager approves your early leave. Here is where another issue comes into play, my Mgr is one of the reasons the work feels so miserable and i find it extremely hard to have the conversation about applying to another team.

The obvious choice would be to apply externally to other companies but I feel the job security and pay here(aerospace) is a notch above that of other big companies. 

P.S the other job im really wanting to apply for is doing DevSecOps which I have done all my career and quite enjoy. ",Airslashfury,1,1.0,9,1720395409,2024-07-07 23:36:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxucxa/need_some_career_advice/,7,2024

1dxrig3,Going Back to School Full Time,"Hey gang!

So a little backstory, I am currently a 22 year old guy who has a full-time, salaried job in IT. I graduated high school in 2020 and immediately started going to school for music education. Now, I don’t want to blame external factors for the decisions I made, but everyone reacts differently to external factors, so I’m blaming my reactions to external factors. First off, graduating and going off to my freshman year of college during Covid did a number on my mental health. I went from a pretty strong friend group in high school to having no one in college since there was no one really around, and those who were around were wary to be social. Secondly, I went through a pretty bad breakup, which messed my mind up even more, and I ended up switching my major a few times and eventually just leaving university to attend community college for IT. I’ve just completed my first year in that program, and I’ve landed a full-time, salaried job at a very good company. Every time I go into work, though, I have a feeling of dread and depression. I just feel like I’m not where I should be. I’ve been to a therapist for a couple years now and recently got on meds for ADHD which are like little miracle workers for my attention span and commitment to things. I also have the resources to be able to go back to school full-time.

I am in a relationship and she’s a bit wary of it, and I know my parents would throw an absolute fit if they knew I was planning on going back. That being said, I feel like life is too short to have regrets like this. I had wanted to be a music educator for several years and it doesn’t sit right with me that I’m just leaving all that behind. Just my thoughts.

I worked in pool maintenence  getting paid minimum  wage, to quitting to try and complete a quick 2-month server gig kn a cruise ship to poland; I quit after 3 weeks, I went on to work at a local restaurant.. got into this horrible altercation with the boss, almost went legal, then I worked in watch and jewelry repair... which I quit after 3 week... it's been like this my whole life... keeping a job seems really hard for me.

The only job that really went the distance was a dj on cruise ship for one company for arouns 5 years. I'm teying to run by dj business but it's really overwhelming and I don't have the funding to really launch anything...

I love the spotlight, I have a strong personality, passionate, at times I can be combative sure. But I am really good at anything entertainment djing related...

Im not sure what to do.. every time I think I want to go back to school I say to myself ""well what if I get another contract on board?"", or ""Oh... I'm not even sure I'll be staying here""... fast forward.. 3 years essentially have went by going absolutely nowhere in my career...

I don't want to continue living year after year like this... I've considered living in LA or Italy but I end up getting so oberwhelmed by the thought that I don't actually do anything... and bang.. it's 3 years later.

Any advice is appreciated.. thank you :)",ScholarRoutine2285,1,0.5600000023841858,5,1720387094,2024-07-07 21:18:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxr8mu/ive_spent_my_20s_as_a_cruise_ship_dj_and_now_am/,7,2024

1dxoush,Midlife crisis career advice,"39F, hitting my midlife crisis. I work as a travel nurse, making more money than a staff nurse, which has helped me to save quite a bit. However, I don’t know if I want to keep doing the same thing for the next 20 years. I didn’t really want to be a nurse initially, but coming from an immigrant family, having a career that makes good money is seen as the top priority. Sure, the job pays well, and we have job security, but dealing with rude patients and rude doctors just sometimes isn’t worth it. Also, there isn’t much upward mobility other than manager (which I don’t really want to do). I’ve come to realize that nursing has made me more of an introvert (dealing with people at their worst every time I come to work just makes me want to avoid people outside of work).

But now, I’m stuck on what my next move will be. I’ve always liked creative projects, I enjoy photography and drawing as hobbies. I’ve tried getting into those fields as a side hustle with mixed results. No real success and the income just isn’t the same as my nursing job. 

Debating going back to school, to see if I can at least increase my income so I can hit FIRE faster. But my options right now are become a Nurse Practitioner (more school, debt), get my MSN in Nursing informatics (more school, debt, pay is about the same as travel nurse…I’ve also heard AI is taking over some of these jobs), swtich into a different specialty, or do something radically different. I’ve even looked into going into flight school to become a pilot (I do like to travel, pay is good, but also debt to get into school). 

I don't completely hate travel nursing, I don't have to stay at a job I hate if I don't like it (since its contract based); I dont have kids or a partner, so I don't have to worry about accomodating them; I've taken month-long vacations in between contracts- but the pay rate now has plateaued, and there are times where I can't find a contract that suits my specialty. 

So I’m deciding to I 1) suck it up and just get my FNP, make more money and retire faster but still hate my job, 2) keep on trucking being a travel nurse, go the slow and steady route and just save diligently until I hit my FI number 3) just go into a different field completely

1dxnm20,I need something to do,"Hi,



I’ve had a long-standing problem: I lack passion and a clear goal in life. I’m sure you’ve heard this many times before, but it’s true for me too. The thing is, I have the capability to accomplish things.



For example, I am a web developer, and I have been developing a browser-based game for years. I decided to start the project on a whim and completed the first playable version in just two days. I mention this because when I find something to do, I give it my all.



My friend faced a similar lack of direction. He tried e-commerce and failed, attempted other ventures and failed, and even left several universities halfway through. Eventually, by sheer chance, he enrolled in a university program studying an uncommon foreign language. He became passionate about it, studying day and night, writing pages of words, translating them, and using flashcard apps on his phone. He became so focused that he skipped social gatherings to dedicate himself to his studies. Now, he’s a professional translator, earning well and living on a sunny beach, loving his job.



If I were to find a passion like that, I would be the same. I am hungry to dedicate myself to something. I want to spend hours working, studying, and building. Instead, I end up wasting my energy refreshing websites and watching videos. I have the drive to work hard but no passion to direct it toward.



I worked as a frontend developer, but I don’t see it as a good long-term investment. I’ve been in the industry long enough to know that AI will likely take over many aspects of development. Many senior developers advise focusing on AI-related jobs or practical, real-world jobs like construction. Even without the AI issue, the development field is so open-ended that there’s no clear point where you can say, “I’m good at this now.” There are thousands of languages, libraries, and frameworks that are constantly evolving. It’s a never-ending chase, and I don’t want to waste my time on a race without a clear finish line.



In contrast, my friend, as a linguist, has a defined path with visible structures. He can still learn new things and improve, but there is a point where he can confidently say he has mastered his field. If I had a similar passion, I would be equally motivated, but I don’t have anything like that.



I’m 25 now, and while that might seem young, in my country and family, I’ve exhausted my chances. I don’t want to go back to university to study something new, and there’s no guarantee it would be the perfect fit this time.



I need something that is not open-ended, where I can invest my hours and become a professional. Ideally, it should not require physical labor. What can I do, or how can I find my passion?



Thanks.",mobaisland,1,1.0,0,1720377822,2024-07-07 18:43:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxnm20/i_need_something_to_do/,7,2024
1dxnjfb,Should I disclose benefit details in salary negotiation?,"I received an offer for a position that would be a lateral move for me. I have been considering leaving my current position due to poor management and a lengthy commute (\~15 hrs/week). The position I was offered is hybrid, 3 days in the office and 2 days remote per week and the office is 15 minutes away. The salary I was offered is pretty comparable to what I am currently making on paper, but in reality would end up being a small pay cut (offered $50,000. Current salary on payroll is $48,000 but shift differential ultimately puts me closer to $54,000). Catch is, my current position has government benefits that are far superior to what I am being offered. I’m going to negotiate the offer as I really can’t justify leaving with all of that considered, though ditching the commute sounds heavenly! Question is, when I do, should I outline the differences in benefits in detail to the recruiter or should I only give them if asked?

 

Details if anyone cares -

New health insurance would be low premium/deductible, but current plan is *no* premium/deductible. Coverage is about the same otherwise. Similar story for life insurance, same coverage but I would pay a low premium vs getting it for free now. As far as retirement, current employer matches 8.25% into a 401(a). New employer would put a max of 3.5% if I contribute 6% into a 401(k). Lastly, I get 168 hrs of PTO with my current employer vs 80 (ouch) offered with the new one.",Ammy4Smash,1,0.9900000095367432,1,1720377624,2024-07-07 18:40:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxnjfb/should_i_disclose_benefit_details_in_salary/,7,2024
1dxnixm,“3 foreigners for the price of 1 American”,"I am stuck at my job going on 5yrs now. My last “raise” was 4 years ago & nothing since. For reference, when I applied for this position it said $18-20hr…I don’t even make the $20 5yrs in.
I work for a small company- the one I’m stuck at- which has less than 10 employees. My boss has started hiring techs from abroad & I’m only safe because I do the financials & he’s too worried to trust anyone abroad to handle accounts. Not only was this not the job description I signed up for, the amount of work is now that I’m doing 3-4 different roles making 1 low salary. And he says all the time, I can hire 3 foreigners for the price of 1 American! It makes me feel like shit, he’s so cheap.

Last week, I reached a boiling point when the overseas people he hired staged a strike & all threatened to quit at the same time unless they got the raise they wanted, even though the amount their making in their currency is more than what I make in our currency. They said they wanted to buy a house & said it’s not fair Americans have houses: I live in an apartment, I can’t afford the housing prices here in the US! He gave in…& I’m pissed. 

They’ve been here 1 year, & were rewarded for their immoral job hostage act. I have been here 5 yrs & kept thinking as the business grows & I take on more work I’ll be rewarded, I know I will. But it hasn’t happened, & I see that it now won’t unless I threaten to blow up his life I guess! 

Over the years I’ve applied to several jobs that I’m well qualified for, but never hear back because employers get sooo many applications that if you’re not in the first handful, you never had a chance. With the job climate, automation, exporting of jobs, & other life situations, I feel extremely stuck.

1. We have automatic content filters for things like harassment, insults, and spam

2. We have set up filters so the same link can only be posted once per day in an attempt to avoid spammers.

3. Automod will not allow people suspected of evading bans to post

4. Automod will filter certain words such as insults, racism, bigotry, etc. 

5. Higher quality spam filters are now in place

6. Text is required in the body of the post. If you are posting, we need to know details about the issue or question you have. 

7. New rules - this is basic stuff like don't spam and don't be a jerk

8. New post removal reasons - we have added additional reasons such as Spam or selling. 

9. We don't allow people to advertise without mods approval. I am sure your ebook, online course, MLM, recruiting agency is great but we want to vet it first. There is a lot of legit services out there and also a lot of people taking advantage of others. 

  
Additionally, we are looking to develop a wiki and website to go along with this subreddit to offer more help.

1dxlugy,Need advice on my post-grad career in STEM,"I will be starting my final year of undergrad next month and will graduate with double majors in chemistry (BA) and neuroscience (BS) from a relatively competitive university (US). I'd always intended to pursue research as a PhD, but over my experience working in two academic research labs, I've realized that research just isn't for me and I don't have the passion for it that I originally did (primarily interested in neuroscience research). Now, I really feel that I'm at a dead end with my only feasible option being finding an entry-level technician job in either chemistry or neuroscience in industry. I know that it's a matter of perspective given that this is my reality, but I honestly dread that this is my future and don't see it being rewarding. I would love to pivot to some other field that at least pays better for how much work is put in, but there's nothing else I really have an outstanding interest in either. My father (PhD in chem) has worked in industry his entire professional career and believes that going into an entry-level technician job is my best option, and that I can slowly work my way up the ladder. He also advised that I stay in the US, though I have considered pursuing a career elsewhere (Germany and Taiwan because I have studied and am proficient in the respective languages) or going into masters for neuroscience (which he also advised against, as it is apparently relatively useless). 

Anyways, any insight or advice on this matter would be very appreciated, whether or not you agree or disagree with my father's advice, whether I should go into entry-level technician work or consider pursuing something else, etc!",OkRecommendation4830,1,1.0,2,1720373261,2024-07-07 17:27:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxlugy/need_advice_on_my_postgrad_career_in_stem/,7,2024

**Digital Marketing MA**

**Digital Transformation MA**

**Strategic Management Msc.**

**Supply Chain Management Msc.**

# WHAT?:

My dream actually creating a company. And managing this company online. Company should be digital company or a production company. But Sure thing is I want to be my own master and creating things and solutions. I want to make huge amount of money with it. But still I have to find a lots of time for my family and my drumming dream.

But it’s kind of hard and risky so I need backup too. So I need a job which help me chase my dream as company creator but If I want get a stable job too. If im tired of chasing the dream of creating company. The job should bring me 45K annually at entry level and have a bright future. Maybe in the future  that stable career can force me to create a company.

I worked a lot for the past 3 years and have a career in production, organisation I don’t want to start from 0 but if I have better solutions than keeping that career I should leave that career and start again.

My qualities:

A)I am social but I want to get social when I wanted I don’t want to be forced to be social every time like being in a marketing team and trying to sell my idea and myself. 

B)Creative: I like to be alone and work on something from 0. I like creating from scratch it can be a music, film, script, operation, a business, a supply chain it doesn’t matter I like being the main person and creating that thing slowly like I am creating a wooden shelf.

C)I really like examine people psychology, I like direct them and understand them. But I don’t like acting according to that I like being myself all the time I just like understanding how this person feels and their psychoanalysis.

C)I like to take care of people, I like to help them, I like being like the doctor I like to show them the way while they respect me like a teacher or a doctor.

D)I like being a show person like when I am drumming I need to be on the stage not coding in the background.

E)I want to travel the world with my job or have a stable life. I need decent job for example I get breakfast and go to job in 6 but job should finish when Im done with it it shouldn’t effect my personal life and I need to have a big empty place in my life for myself, my Childs, my wife. I like to spent time with my family whenever I want.

F)I hate social media, I hate understanding mass populations needs I hate mass population. I like being in my own circle. 

G)I hate doing tiny jobs like creating easy content each day every time. I love spending time in one huge and hard thing and find and create meaning for it.

*So it really not matters the company or the things I do It just need it to align with my purposes in life and getting me happiness.*

1dxl8xh,I really need some advice,"God knows how many times I have posted something on this subreddit. But it has come to the point where I am genuinely lost and have no idea how to move on. I have been working in the same position since 2015. I am a technician for a traffic signals engineering team within the transportation sector of a civil infrastructure company. My role is assisting with the day-to-day tasks of senior engineers and also doing the initial start-up of most projects, basically doing the shit work. I primarily deal with initial design and site commissioning. 

Since working in this position, I have been fortunate enough to attend a university to gain my foundation degree (Higher National Diploma) and a BEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. It was not easy gaining these certifications, to the point where I was really lacking in the quality of the work I was producing. As such, I was placed on a PIP (personal improvement plan) during my last year at university at the height of COVID, which has affected my mental well-being. Moving forward, I was able to pass my PIP with flying colours and also graduated (3 years ago) with a 1st full honours in my degree. 

Towards the latter end of my degree, I had the chance to work with teams like the street lighting team or ITS (intelligent transportation systems) team, exposing me to more of the electrical/electronic side of the industry. Unfortunately, those have been nothing more than empty words. I stand before you with more or less fuck all experience in electrical & electronic engineering but a full-fledged degree that with each passing day is becoming more useless as I forget what I have learnt at university.

The best course of action is simple: finding another job. The issue is that I don’t want to be part of the civil world anymore, which has proven my job hunting to be harder than I initially thought. Just rejections after rejections for over more than a year. Just last week, I thought I had one in the bag with UK Power Networks as a trainee electrical design engineer, with the initial interview going smoothly. But even that trainee role rejected me.

Long story short, I am a 30-year-old man stuck in a meaningless job in civil engineering with no prospects of going up or getting paid more, still living with my parents with nothing meaningful going on in my life. Just nothing, no goals, just nothing.

This is no sob story; I want advice, genuine advice. I don’t think I have it in me anymore to get back into engineering. I have been playing around with the idea of learning Python and getting into AI or machine learning (I have started to learn using Linux). But is there more for me to do? Are there places or industries to pursue? Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.",msaglam888,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1720371715,2024-07-07 17:01:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxl8xh/i_really_need_some_advice/,7,2024
1dxkne7,I'm completely unfulfilled by my job and don't know what to do about it.,"Over the last couple years I've (34 M) gone on a bit of a personal journey. I've found a new hobby that I LOVE and it has done incredible things for my physical and mental well being. As a part of that growth I've come to accept the fact that I am simply not passionate about my job, and that's perfectly fine by me. I don't think it's reasonable to expect everyone to make a living with whatever their passion is. Until recently my job has been interesting enough, I'm good at it, and it pays well. That was good enough for me since it enabled me to spend time with my wife and do the other things that fulfill me.

The problem is though, as more time goes on not only am I not passionate about my work...I just don't fucking care about it. Like I'm REALLY trying but I'm having memory and focus issues because I'm not engaged and I feel like I'm just putting up a facade of competence and productivity every day. It's getting to the point I'm afraid it's going to start affecting my performance soon enough. I really feel like I need to make a big pivot and find something entirely different, but I have NO IDEA what that thing would be or how I would figure it out. I don't have golden handcuffs or anything, but it doesn't help that my job pays so well so the thought of taking a large pay cut to move to a new career is pretty daunting.

I'm really just kind of at a loss at this point. Do I take a big chance and just try something wildly different that I THINK I may enjoy more? How would I even approach figuring out what that different thing would be? Or is there a way to rediscover the enjoyment for my current career?",MCsmalldick12,10,0.8199999928474426,13,1720370132,2024-07-07 16:35:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxkne7/im_completely_unfulfilled_by_my_job_and_dont_know/,7,2024
1dxkc98,"I'm self employed and I hate it, looking to get back into the regular workforce and could use some advice.","This past June marks eight years of me being self employed as a small business owner. I've had my ups and down with it but since last autumn it's been mostly downs, I've been feeling burnt out by it for a few years now but worse I'm just not making the same income that I used to and I don't have a good feeling that I ever will see that level of income again.  It's been getting so bad that I had to get a part time retail job that seems to be going nowhere. I don't exactly want to give up being my own boss but for my mental and financial health I think it's for the best.

So I'm searching for some advice as to what to add to my resume as a self employed person to make myself more desirable for employers. I've never really had a dream job (I don't dream of labor) and never finished my college degree and my past jobs have all been entry level, low skill kind of stuff so other than being a small business owner I really don't have much qualifications to get me into a decently paid job in my area.

I'm also looking for some kind of support group type advice from people in a similar situation to me. Like how was your transition back into the general workforce? Do you regret it? What line of work did you get into? Etc. 

Thanks for reading.",e_traw,4,1.0,0,1720369304,2024-07-07 16:21:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxkc98/im_self_employed_and_i_hate_it_looking_to_get/,7,2024
1dxkc8r,Career change ,"Hey All, I would need some kind of career advice as I feel stuck a bit here. 

I am 34, 3D Animation Lead (film) in Europe. I just had my son birth and I have a wife. The current situation in the industry and the tax incentives generated Vicious Circle just makes me super pessimistic that this job offers a peaceful life. On the contrary, you have to chase the stupid studios once in Canada after that in India, after that in Australia and so on…

So because of all these feelings I did an Economist in Management and Leadership masters diploma. So my question is that what field could I transfer where I could use my 10 years of experience in animation, VFX and my studies (MSc) with the smallest harm (meaning that I have to start an entry level position at the year of ~35. 

Thanks for the advises! ",Bzsombor1990,1,1.0,0,1720369303,2024-07-07 16:21:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxkc8r/career_change/,7,2024
1dxjqxq,Stay or go?,"I work a high stress job and am rushing to hit my deadlines and finish my tasks on time most days. I commute an hour each way five days a week. I make good money and accrue 6 weeks of annual leave each year. I have saved 4.25 months of sick leave over the years. I like the security of knowing I could stay take time off work and get treatment while getting paid if something major happened. Or I could take off time to care for a family member if need be. But this job is high stress. High stress and high reward. I can retire in ten years (50 yrs old) and get law enforcement pension after that. 

The stress gets to me at times. I am looking at a job where I’d make $20k less per year. It would likely be significantly less stress but I would only get two weeks off a year plus federal holidays. No sick leave. No pension. They offer a 401k but it’s a major pay cut and I would likely have a much harder time taking time off on short notice and just a lot less time off in general. The commute is only 20 mins each way. 

So many pros and cons to staying at my current job. And way lower stress if I accept the new job. 

Any advice on this is much appreciated. ",TallComment427,1,1.0,0,1720367770,2024-07-07 15:56:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxjqxq/stay_or_go/,7,2024
1dxjhhi,On track but unsure of my next move,"I (25F) am comfortably making 75K a year working as an operations manager for a very small construction company. It is basically a one man show + myself, one other in the office, and one project manager in the field. The rest are general laborers and subcontractors. 

We are on track to gross 5MM this year and the business has almost tripled since I started working as his first and only administrative personnel in 2022. I was hired on referral from a real estate agent I was working for at the time who knew my boss personally and thought I would be a great fit. I have a degree in marketing, a real estate license and am a notary. At the time I had been through several jobs and internships in marketing and found that I did not like the corporate environment and wanted to go in a different direction. Since I had done such a great job at helping to run her real estate business, I saw this as the next step in transitioning to a full time business administration role in real estate and construction, a field I had always been highly interested in. The job was also hybrid remote and had a start up vibe which was exactly what I was looking for at the time. 

I helped him set up his quickbooks account, run his accounts payable and receivable system, track all incoming expenses by job site, generate regular financial reports, keep all his business licenses updated and apply for new ones in surrounding areas, manage the permitting process for all jobs, and assist with the material estimating, contract administration, and material ordering processes. I also created his website and his social media channels which we now have marketing agencies updating and managing. 

2.5 years later, I am feeling stuck in this position for a number of reasons. First, my boss is extremely hands off and unavailable, leaving myself and the other office worker in the dark and unable to complete tasks that require his direction and approval. He is so busy in the field that I will go full weeks without hearing from him despite sending several calls, texts and emails. He has not responded to my requests for better communication with the office. I am the point of contact for both customers and other businesses and feel frustrated when he deliberately ghosts customers or uses me as an excuse for why he has not gotten back to them with the information they requested. I would ideally like to be able to run things on my own but lack the skills, experience, and knowledge about the construction industry to be able to do this. While he was encouraging and supportive at the beginning, he now has no time to continue to train me in these areas. 

Since I work for such a small business, we do not follow standard business practices of larger construction companies and I am not qualified for any of their construction management roles. I am also having trouble justifying leaving as similar job listings for construction office managers are no where near as lucrative or flexible with hybrid remote work.

Though I have some experience in many areas, I have become the classic jack of all trades and master of none. I have a serious interest in business management, real estate development, construction management, urban planning, and law related to these areas. I want to improve my skills and further my education but am unsure of my next move. I am also fortunate enough to live with my mom who would would be financially helpful for any additional schooling required to advance my career (within reason, I would ideally like to stay out of debt by attending a New York state school or online program).

What are my options? Has anyone had a similar experience? What would you recommend I do? ",karsmashian,3,1.0,0,1720367079,2024-07-07 15:44:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxjhhi/on_track_but_unsure_of_my_next_move/,7,2024
1dxjgq4,Should I quit my job? ,"So, I’ve been working with the same company since January 2018. I’ve always worked very hard and took pride in my work ethic. I’ve been on medical leave for burn out/severe anxiety/depression since April of this year and everybody (doctor, psychologist, friends, family, etc.) tell me I should just quit and find something else. The problem is that I am paid very well for what I do (I make 68k/year and can earn more because part of my salary is commissions, people with my job title make between 40k-55k). 

I know that when (if) I’ll be back , the conditions will not really change. They did hire someone to replace me in the meanwhile, but they legally have to take me back with the same conditions. The big difference is that while I will have less work, it might also mean less money. I would like to find another job and I am fully aware that it would probably pay less, but I know my mental health is more important than money. 

My goal would be to find a work from home job so I can move further away from a big city to pay less in rent and have a better quality of life, but I also don’t want to leave a job that financially allows me to be comfortable and do what I want and especially, lose everything I acquired in the last 6 and a half year.  I don’t know what to do. Every fiber in my body is telling me to quit, even before my medical leave , but I really worry about how a salary decrease would affect my financial freedom and security. I might be able to find something close to my salary, or maybe not. I don’t want to have to live paycheck to paycheck. My BF makes about 4K after taxes a month and say that we would be more than ok even if I make less, but in the event something was to happen to him, I need to be ok to pay everything by myself as I was before he moved in with me.  

Would you quit your job if you were me? ",BigBadBiche,1,1.0,1,1720367023,2024-07-07 15:43:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxjgq4/should_i_quit_my_job/,7,2024

1dxhv3s,Should I quit my job?,"Hi! A little background Im a recent graduate (2023) and started my job last feb this year. Its a Job order type. I am also program based so when the program ends wont have a role anymore. So, the program was supposed to start on the 2nd quarter but was again delayed. Since it hasnt started yet I was always going to the office almost not doing anything related to my program and since i was in communication i needed to explain to the beneficiaries why it was delayed (always). I do random jobs for the office. The office also has a very toxic boss. The rest were all kind. The boss was micromanaging us, especially my senior who was always treated like an assistant. I try to of course in the best way I can. Its only been 5 months and i think im losing my drive. And desperately wanted to thrive. I accepted the job thinking of great experiences but things are just not the way we expected i guess. 

The pay was nice (for a single perskn still living under their parents roof). But it didnt matter when everytime I go to work. I feel like a zombie. 

Im afraid that if I quit now, I might have a hard time looking for other jobs because I only stayed on this for six months (since resigning needs 30 days notice). I have recommendations from people I know. I wanted to grab opportunities but inside get shy and i dont know how to confront my boss about quitting. I hate this. I feel stuck.

The issue is that my director fired 2 previous managers within 3 months of each other, with a total of only 4 managers reporting to her at any time. People say she is ambitious and will fire you to cover mistakes. It makes me want to find a new job, as I don’t want her to fire me when I make a mistake because I am a novice.

I look at the situation and go if the other two don’t pan out at least I have the first to get me out of my current situation and I can continue to look for others.

1dxe58m,Can I go back to international relations when I'm almost 30?,"Hello everyone,  
I'm 29, and after completing a successful course of studies (top grades, interesting experiences), I've been working at an IT consultancy company for the last four years. Even though I have a stable, decent income, I feel really frustrated and want to get back to my original path, finding a job in international relations with agencies, NGOs, or European institutions.

I know it might be tough since I've been a project manager in IT for the past four years, and I worry my profile might not interest those organizations.

1dxds96,Stuck between two offers in important career/life decision.,"Hi, I've been lucky enough to get 2 offers recently after being unemployed for many months following my graduation and am struggling to decide which one to take. Would love to hear some thoughts and what you would do in my position.

The first role is quite literally my dream job, a junior position conducting research within the games industry. As an avid gamer for my whole life, working with games everyday is something that I was looking forward to ever since I knew this position existed and would work well with my background (psychology/HCI). It's also at a big company and I really like the people that I've spoken to so far throughout the hiring process. The main issue is this: it would require me to move to Manchester and leave behind my life in London. I know Manchester is a great city but obviously London is THE city that people are trying to move to in the UK, and I'm lucky enough that I can live here rent-free with my parents. The salary is a bit higher for this role but obviously relocation costs, food, transport back to London to visit my friends/family/partner would mean that I wouldn't be saving up much money.

The second role is a grad role that would involve conducting research within the medical/pharma industry. I really wouldn't mind doing this and the company itself seems amazing. The office is one of the best I've ever been to in-person and it starts off with 3 days in-person, moving down to 2 after the probation period. The salary is slightly lower but as mentioned, I would be able to save every penny that I make. If I do choose this option, I am planning to stay at my partner's place during the on-site days and cycle to work as she lives much closer to the office than I do and this would give us the opportunity to spend more time together.

My parents are obviously biased towards the second role as they love the idea of me working within the medical/pharma industry, as well as being able to keep their baby at home for a bit longer. I imagine my partner also prefers me to take the second role for obvious reasons, although she is trying not to influence my decision too much.

Obviously, the opportunity to work in your dream job doesn't come around often - especially with the current state of the videogames industry. At the same time, I am worried that I would be sacrificing too many other aspects of my life for my career alone. For all I know, the job isn't what I expect (or worst case scenario, laid off) and I'm stuck in Manchester alone, having saved up very little money, and full of regret. It is obviously the high-risk, high-reward choice.

I am leaning towards taking the role in London and postponing my dream of working in the games industry until a position opens up in London. Hopefully by then, I'd have some more corporate experience and I can even potentially apply for research roles above the junior position - but obviously there are some industry-specific skills that I would be missing compared to other candidates that have already been working in the industry.

1dxbcud,Grafico/Redattore tecnico in cerca di smart working ,"Ciao a tutti! Sono una ragazza di 30 anni e sono laureata in belle arti: ho la triennale in ""grafica d'arte"" e la magistrale in ""decorazione per l'architettura"". Post magistrale ho seguito un corso di formazione per grafico manualista/redattore tecnico. 
Attualmente lavoro da 7 mesi come redattrice tecnica/grafica presso uno studio che si occupa di manuali d'uso e manutenzione nel settore della meccanica, macchine automatiche per il packaging alimentare, farmaceutico e cosmetico. 
È un lavoro che si potrebbe fare benissimo in smart working ma il mio capo non è molto propenso al lavoro da remoto, io però in questo momento della mia vita ne ho bisogno per varie necessità e non so come fare. Sto inviando molti CV in giro ma non trovo nulla, soprattutto nel settore grafico. Mi sento in un loop da cui non riesco ad uscire, e quindi mi sono chiesta sono io che non trovo annunci di lavoro del genere oppure non esistono di fatto? 

La suite Adobe la conosco perfettamente (illustator, Photoshop e inDesign) e negli ultimi anni mi sto specializzando nella grafica 3D (Maya, Solid Edge, Creo, Sap Vea) apprendo molto velocemente quindi potrei anche approfondire molti altri programmi.

Sarei disposta anche ad abbandonare la grafica per il momento per un lavoro da remoto.

1dxakao,"Moving teams within same company, what's the best way?","I just moved to a different team after 4 years in my previous team being overworked with no pay raise during my entire tenure. I recommended an acquaintance to replace me and my boss hired them. I call them acquaintance because we have moved around the same circles for years without building a strong connection or a friendship, but they always used to complain about their job not paying enough. They are the sole breadwinner of a family of 4 so the new job would definitely help. I had 3 weeks to handover but the first week they were still busy doing work for the company they left. We tried to make the most of the remaining 2 weeks then I moved. I wouldn't say they know everything in the job but I left very detailed handover notes and gave a good training to start with.
Now, they keep on texting me to ask questions about how to do the job and am just getting tired of it. I already advised them to reach out to their teammates who have similar competencies as me as I myself am busy getting started with my new job. I am also busy learning on my job. So I stopped answering texts because they took all my time and focus. 
They started complaining that I am trying to sabotage them and their family's wellbeing because they are still on probation and need to perform. But so am I. I feel like I have given enough training to kickstart on the job and that it was on them now to make good use of it and try to earn their place in the team.
We are not on very good terms now because of that. 
On the other hand, it seems like there is still an expectation from my former bosses that I would still help them for a while, since they have not yet removed my rights in the systems. They have a deadline to complete a project in the next 2 months, on which I used to contribute a lot when I was within the team. My former teammates know how to do the job but it would take longer than if I handled it myself.
I don't want to give the impression that I remain at their disposal even after leaving the team because I know that in the long term, it will only give me frustration, since that was the reason I left in the first place. I just want to move on. But at the same time, since I still work in the same organisation, I don't want to be in bad terms with my old team to avoid it backfiring on my career there.
What is the best way to handle this situation in my favor?
Please don't give advice on offering a consultanvy because that is off the table. Haha.",No_Excuse_4713,1,1.0,0,1720335998,2024-07-07 07:06:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dxakao/moving_teams_within_same_company_whats_the_best/,7,2024

I am not really worried about technical qualifications, as the original interviewer said that he thought I may have been overqualified for the position. I have thought and maybe over thought my next answers to common interview questions, and really just want to make sure I don't fuck anything up. I also have a list of cultural questions that I have prepared for when they come up naturally in the conversation.

For example, I was wondering if it looks too desperate to ask ""Could I send you all a thank you note?"" at the end of an interview. Is this an accepted thing, or is it not?

1dx8tz2,In a serious need of guidance.,"Sorry in advance if my English is broken as I 'm not in a mental condition to comprehend what I'm about to write.

**My Background:** I'm a graduate student from a level 3 college from Asia majoring from computer science. 

I've been pretty much interested in physics from my middle school. Used to feed myself with a lot of simple topics from science and I was very much interested in learning those topics. Many times I used to wonder about the fundamentalism of the universe and what goes beyond our observations. **Fast forward to 2017,** when I was in my senior high school grade, I was about to give my engineering exam for a good physics bachelor's in a reputed university around my country. A little background note I'm a diabetic. Stress and trauma in my yesteryears made extremely hard to cope up with the competition with the amount of stress I was having combined with the health complications. I used to feel anxiety, panic attacks which obviously resulted in me scoring poor in the national engineering examinations. It made my parents to pressure me in joining into \*this\* university which had a below par computer science course with a 5 year graduate course. I was uninterested in what I was learning. I became depressed. Then COVID came along and all of us were confined to our homes. The time which I would've used to better myself by learning what I wanted, I was seething my regrets and depression. I used to lock myself in my room for entire day without caring about any consequences. **THIS WAS SOLELY MY MISTAKE** and, did I mention about the percentile scoring at my university? It was hell. many students were scoring 90%+ and even a single mark would mean I've lost an entire grade. This plummeted my grades which I built up in my first year and made me entirely uninterested in doing anything. I eventually started forgetting my high school mathematics , physics and chemistry concepts, while I wasn't even caring about a single bit about computer science. But yeah, my college had a coursera sponsorship and I did a machine learning specialisation course and made two projects out of those fundamentals. **Fast forward to my fourth year,** I made myself motivated to reignite my interest in physics and maths , but it was shortlived as I was fearing it would lead me to nowhere. 

Now, I am at the end of my graduation, with a pretty much middling gpa ( Ive tried to cover up the lost gpa in my last two years) , Unable to find out how, with my computer science degree, I would shift myself into studying physics major. **No one, Literally no one** including from my university professors are guiding me on what to do and here My parents are planning to send me abroad for my double masters and have to pay the fees. The time is ticking very fast. Before I would think, I would be in the same scenario, but set in abroad.

Please suggest me what should I do and how should I proceed. It is looking very bleak with my sub-par high school \*science\* knowledge and no guidance and planning.

This is a leadership position they created just for me because I was such a perfect candidate, they love me. BUT WHAT AM I WORTH 

I’ve heard $30CAD/hr to $50CAD/hr ($21USD to $36USD) but I actually have no clue if that’s accurate at all. 

Please let me know your opinion i’m dying out here

I took a few semesters of computer science and I also got a web design/web development certificate from an online vocational school. However, I feel like it seems like a difficult field to get into.

I applied to the company in May. Two weeks later, they asked for a time for the first interview with a recruiter. Then, I had my first interview with the hiring manager, who was selling me on the job. The second interview was with his colleague, and that also went well.

After that, they took three weeks to respond. I contacted them every week for an update, and they kept telling me they would update me soon. After three weeks, they told me I had to meet with one more person. That interview also went okay.

Then, they said I had to complete a technical take-home assessment project and gave me just a weekend to do it. I completed the assessment and sent it in. They emailed me saying they would get back to me after reviewing it. It’s been a week since then, and I still haven’t heard anything.

1dx0axl,27 Started a new career; claims adjusting ,"POV: I’m [documenting my journey](https://youtu.be/27mtG24Vqsc?si=1C0bQWptyQqdAG5V) 

Formerly & Coca-Cola. Here about this career and want to share what I didn’t know. 

Most ppl don’t know what claims adjusting is. But, they hear about the pay. 

According to the [BLS.GOV](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/claims-adjusters-appraisers-examiners-and-investigators.htm) 

The median annual wage for claims adjusters, examiners, and investigators was $75,050 in May 2023. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $47,390, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $105,440.

The BLS also covers their work duties. 

TLDR; Claims adjusters inspect property damage to determine how much the company should pay for the loss.

Apparently AUTO ADJUSTERS is as much work so Auto Claims adjusters make less. 

Either way, adjusters much get licensed. 


HOW TO GET LICENSED as A CLAIMS ADJUSTER 
🚩Super important to note licensing is different in every state. 

🚩A license does not guarantee work. My research indicates you will need:
1. Experience
2. Prayers for a hurricane 

🌀 If you’re licensed at the time a hurricane strikes 🪧 you’ll find immediate work. Actually that’s 1/2 true. Some carriers require other certifications you can pay to get in a weekend. 

The tricky part is getting an invitation from a 3rd party company to take the class. 

If you’re truly invested you’ll know theses companies when the time is right. 

My research also shows you can find work at any time… and it pays well
Here are some of the steps I’ve taken

1dwx1ib,Pursuing a Job vs. Masters,"So here is my current situation. I\`ve graduated from University this March in Political Science (Germany) and I\`ve been doing a gap year internship between Bachelors and Masters in Public Sector Consulting (Big 4) ever since. I have previous experience with a small consultancy (3 Month Internship) and an internship in the office of a member of parliament. 

  
I was determined on starting my Masters in Political Science next term. I enjoyed my studies quite a lot and I am keen on further developing my skills and knowledge in the political sphere. But I was also looking forward to meeting new people and especially on doing an exchange term abroad since I wasn\`t able to do so during my Bachelors (Due to Covid). My Plan was to keep working in Public Sector Consulting for just a bit more as a working student- just to ensure a smooth transition before I looking for something else just to gain a bit more experience in other fields such as public Affairs or corporate communications. 

  
Not to the main part: A few days ago a recruiter on LinkedIn reached out to me. Normallly i wouldn\`t bother and just tell them that I am not interested but not this time. The Recruiter wasn\`t just from any firm, she was from one of the MBB (McKinsey, BCG, Bain). I couldn\`t quite believe my eyes to be frank. She told me that my profile looks quite interesting and was asking whether I was interested in a quick call to talk about a entry position within their public sector consultancy. I couldn\`t decline so I said yes and we talked on Friday. And it matched quite well. The Position sound super interesting and obviouly working for an MBB is something that i would have never even imagined in my wildest dreams but here I am. 

But obviously now I am torn between starting my Masters or applying for an entry Position. I would still have to survive four interviews but knowing the process from working at Big4 atm I am quite confident that I have a fair shot. It seems like a rare opportunity that I would regret not taking but the thought of commiting to a working life and not being able to enjoy two more years of studying, gaining new friends and experiences also seems daunting.

1dwwcor,Advice: Two Options?,"Earlier this year, I accepted an offer at a firm with a September start date. Unfortunately, the firm does not have a stellar reputation in the industry and I am not excited about joining. For those wondering why I accepted in the first place, I thought having something in this job market was better than having nothing. Since then, my goal has been to apply and network to get a better offer and eventually renege on them. Unfortunately, I have not had much luck yet in this competitive job market.

While my search has been primarily centered around the NYC area, I decided to randomly apply to a better role in Boston at the start of June. The Boston firm reached out to begin the interview process, which is expected to take the entire month of July and offers will be made at the end of the month. There are a few issues that I am facing that I will outline below:

Option #1: Gamble with the Boston firm One of the main issues with this option is that there is no guarantee that I am going to receive the offer. If I don't receive an offer, I will be without an apartment since my current NYC apartment lease Will expire in mid-August. At that point, it will very difficult for me to get one in such a shor. period of time. I asked my current landlord for a short term extension, but the shortest arrangement would be to renew for an additional seven months. I would need to decide about the apartment renewal before the Boston offer is released. In the chance that I do receive an offer, I am hesitant to move all the way to Boston since all of my family and friends are based around the NYC area. In addition, the firm is relatively small (less than $500M in total revenue), so I don't know how the experience will translate across the industry. The counterpoint to these concerns is that the role is exactly what I am looking for and the team that I would join have very impressive backgrounds.

Option #2: Renew and continue looking for another opportunity in NYC In this strategy, l would eventually put this Boston opportunity to rest and continue looking for opportunities in the nyc area. My main concern is that there are no guarantees that I will be able to find a comparable replacement opportunity before the start date of the initial company. I can already sense how I will feel if I am forced to begin at the initial firm.

I've already asked multiple professionals and their thinking has been pretty split down the road, so now l am seeking advice from Reddit.",Epic_Finance,1,1.0,0,1720291030,2024-07-06 18:37:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dwwcor/advice_two_options/,7,2024

It wasn’t the type of work that I was most interested in but I thought maybe it would offer more security and that there was more of a job market. 10 years later and I still haven’t been able to keep a job for more than a couple of years before being hit by layoffs. I’ve gained a lot of experience and skills but I haven’t been able to advance to a management position because every 12-24 months I’m starting over at a new company.
 Now it’s been over a year since my last FT role. I’m about to turn 46 and working as a waiter to make ends meet. The market for artists in gaming is very small right now and even if I did get something there’s no guarantee it would last more than a year or two before I was back to waiting tables. I need a whole new direction but I’m struggling with what to pursue.
Any other art related jobs would require a complete overhaul of my portfolio. Hiring managers want to see examples of exactly what they are looking for, just being good at design and Adobe software isn’t enough. I’d have to pick a whole new discipline, create a body of polished work and then hope it offers more opportunities and security.
I’ve started exploring a career in Social Media/Digital Marketing since I have a large amount of experience in creating adsand a general understanding of how to sell a product online. I might need to get some certifications and start at an entry level but I could keep waiting tables in the evenings to make up for the loss in salary. My concern there is that I’d be competing against a bunch of people in their 20s and prospective employers/clients would consider me too old. 
I’m also open to something more traditional or in the public sector. Something outside of tech that offers a good stable salary and isn’t flooded kids straight out of college. Maybe something in sales, education, government works? I have no idea what is realistic at my age though.

I feel stuck and hopeless, all I know is I can’t keep waiting tables forever but I have no idea where to go from here. Any advice would greatly appreciated.

1dwuofc,What to do when your applications are trashed before anyone sees them,"I'm 18, dropped out of high school due to some personal happenings at the time and I cannot currently afford to get my GED. I have 6 months food service experience but was forced to quit my prior job because I couldn't make the schedule and am now looking for a job that is in the state where I actually live so that I won't have transportation issues. Thing is, nobody in my town seems to look at applications. I know people with substantially more experience than me who've applied for a large number of jobs and never heard a thing. Every interview you get around here is scheduled by a chatbot and when you show up there's no hiring manager available. If you do get in with a person you're likely to be told they're not hiring despite being them having brought you in for an interview. I know multiple people who've been ""hired"" for jobs only to be ghosted by the employer. Given my unimpressive resume I'm pretty certain every online application I've ever put in got filtered out before anyone even saw it and if not they had better applicants to choose from. It took me a long time to get my first job and I'm pretty certain it was some act of charity from the manager who quit weeks later. I tried applying in person the last time I was job hunting, only to repeatedly be told to apply online. 
What do I do? How am I possibly expected to survive when nobody will hire me? My household can't afford the number of people relative to the number of working people, my partner is also desperately seeking a job (he's got a diploma at least, but he was fired from his last two jobs which looks awful on a resume) and ultimately if he doesn't get one he'll be homeless within months. I've debated trying some seriously questionable methods of making money and the only reason I haven't is because I don't think it would work. Do I just start lying on resumes? Do I walk into a store and insist on speaking directly with a hiring manager? Am I really going to be reduced to begging someone to ""please just take a look at my resume I know you won't see my application online""?

1dwucbg,Job recommendations outside of marketing for a graphic designer,"I've been a graphic and website designer for 6 years now, and I'm burnt out. I've realized that I don't like the pressure of designing things to sell or attract customers. I don't like that social media presence is a major facet of finding a new gig and being a successful designer.

I've realized that I should change careers, but I'm not really in a spot financially where I could go back to school. However, I could see myself earning a certification to get me in the door for a new career. 

I'm great on both Mac and PC computers. I'm a pretty fast typer, I'm good at editing and proofreading written pieces, and I'm proficient in Microsoft Office. I know how to build and edit PDFs, and of course I'm very proficient in Adobe software for graphic design. 

I enjoy planning projects and events. I've planned parties, vacations, and my wedding. I also enjoy the outdoors and love animals. I'm not afraid of getting my hands dirty, either. I'm very organized and meticulous about my work, and I have a strong work ethic.

1dwtmey,Physics-adjacent Careers in Europe?,"Dear Redditers,

I am a 40-year-old male, I have a PhD in condensed matter theory, I did 2 postdocs after my PhD (both in Europe), published between 20 and 30 papers, about half first author. At the end of my second postdoc I took a permanent job working at a national lab in the US doing computational physics with relevance to national security, where I've now been for about 5 years. However, my wife and I are questioning whether we want to raise our children in the US, we both would rather live in a walkable European city with European health/childcare and a more European lifestyle. 

My question is: what kinds of careers should I be considering? I have some experience with programming, mostly Python and Fortran, some Matlab. My published research was mostly pen and paper theory, while my work since leaving academia has been mostly running multiphysics codes and post-processing output using Python. I don't have any experience with machine learning or finance, but I would be open to exploring those options if those communities are still looking to recruit from outside.

1dwt96q,Possible move from ~90k to ~150k salary. What do I do when my current job counters?,"In the process of interviewing for a role at a different company that would pay \~150k which is certainly a lot more than my current salary of 85k (\~90k with company stock). 

If I do get an offer, I'd love to leverage it to at least get matched by my current employer. I'd love to stay at my job but am not entirely against moving. What's the best way to approach this? 

I've mentioned a few times that I feel under-compensated to my manager and he's assured me that he's planning to go to bat for me to get me a raise - which I do believe. If I were to bring up the offer, I'm confident that my current employer would counter as I'm a very valuable part of our team and have been there for 4-5 years. 

But, I've also heard many people say things like ""never take the counter, they're just going to fire you anyway after you bring it up"". Truth is, I highly doubt they'd fire me. I know they want to retain me... so I think I arguably already have a bit of leverage?

Essentially without any real job before I got picked up and dropped into the corporate world. 

I’ve been there for two years now and I still feel out of my league. I don’t believe I provide any value and my insecurity is why I wished I got fired for so long. 

It is an analyst position and my major at my community college, wasn’t related to that at all. 

My teammate really does the bulk of the work especially when I flounder on a given project. Which happens a lot. 

My position and benefits from this job is incredibly undeserved and it’s a testament to things going how they do for me. 

Just straight dumb luck even though my own personal qualms with life, makes me feel the money or any money isn’t worth it. That’s just how stubborn I am.

1dwp7gm,Career advice on team restructure,"Hello everyone,

I just needed some advice on all possible outcomes for a recent plan to restructure the team. Due to an external team not performing and a newly hired manager in the last quarter not performing, I’ve been asked to provide suggestions and opinions on what went wrong and what we could do better so that a company wouldn’t be in a precarious position as it did before. 

To give you more backdrop to this,

1. We are very small team with me at the bottom as an exec, a marketing manager (MM), content writer and Director of marketing (DM) and everything has been extremely smooth, for the past few years. Never had a problem, never a sad day, I’d be excited to achieve new strategic goals everyday until my old MM went part time and we had a new MM in the last quarter. 

2. We were given tight deadlines to turnaround a business in the last quarter. There was no direction from anyone and our new MM constantly cried about how he had inherited bad processes.

3. During this time when we hired a new manager (internally). Although he is very good at his job and better off as an employee, he is an inefficient manager. He gave us no clear direction and changed goals and expectations every single day. I was not made aware of what the new expectations were, what the new goals and what conversations have been had at a senior level to contribute to those goals. 

4. He further had his own plans on where he wanted to take the company but never opened his mouth when confronted by the CEO’s vision and plan. I told him he’s better off giving what the company wants as it is not his company but the CEOs.

5. He further said he can’t work like this. He can’t contribute to a company that doesn’t understand his vision. There were many days during this crucial business turnaround time he was not available as there was more drama in his personal life. He’s had a many mental breakdowns in the absence of the DM and driven us to a life of scare, uncertainty and depression.

6. My personal career goals to further expand my expertise were completely shit on and scrapped with new meaningless goals that the DM nor the HR are aware of.

7. We would plan our weekly schedule at the beginning of the week on goals and schedules only for them to be changed in a few hours because higher management wanted different things.

8. I have been underutilised, under appreciated and overworked these past few months but I’ve never had anything like this for a few years that I have worked here. And just in the last quarter the team has become very toxic. I’ve been on the verge of breakdowns because I have felt worthless and I can’t understand why we are not performing efficiently. I also held myself together as everyone else was having breakdown so someone has to see our goals through the finish line. 

9. The MM also loves drama and creating a Cold War situation between employees and senior managers which I don’t know if the DM is aware of. To further add to this the MM has and many breakdowns which has resulted in the loss of work hours and several productive days which could have been used better. To further add to this he almost takes a days worth (6hour) of therapy during work hours every week. He basically used to shit on the team during the day and get in touch personally later in the day saying “I’m sorry, I don’t think I’ve been efficient!”

10. I think I can straighten things out if the DM got in touch with me in a transparent way about everything that has happened. But instead I was pulled by him into a surprise meeting with the HR which shocked me to my core.  

11. Bottom line, I don’t like drama, there has never been any until this man joined. I just want to do my job, get my career better and contribute to overall growth of the company and leave on a high note eventually. 

I can prove my worth and my contributions but it is a bit depresssing that it’s come to this and there are a few people to blame but I fail to understand how they can be oblivious about this and target people who had nothing to do with failures at the top level.

Thank you in advance for any help offered. I’m a chronic overthinker so I’m feeling very anxious as I lack a strong support group to guide me through this.

1dwk472,confused between a comsci or nursing degree,"it’s a week away before enrollment and i’m using most of my brain cells these days trying to figure out what course i should really get. i’ve already had my interview for the CS degree but i’ve been having second thoughts these days (i’ve been confused on what program to take since senior high school). i’ve been told that i should get nursing because it guarantees me a job and i’ll be able to travel everywhere whereas i chose cs back then because it has a stable schedule at work (afaik), i liked the idea of creating apps and websites and make new updates for applications, and can work remote although it doesn’t guarantee a job instantly (i’m not a huge fan of mathematics btw).

maybe you could help me pick one among these two.

things about me that might help:
- aims to have a job as soon as i graduate
- ambitious (plans to have enough money to travel country to country)
- failed basic calculus in 12th grade (not something i’m proud of)
- has various hobbies (singing, watching movies, playing games) if that helps
- more of a visual learner 
- leans more on introvert side but can manage interactions 
- right-brained
- is living in the philippines (if it’s ever relevant)

thank you in advance to anyone who’s going to answer this properly!

B.Sc which was to be completed in 2021 got completed in 2022. After that I started preparing for the government exam UPSC civil services but did not pass the pre and now seeing the unpredictability of the exam I feel that if I do not clear the exam then what will I do next. Because I am not going to get any job even on B.Sc degree. Now I am thinking of taking admission in some course after doing which I can get a job and along with that I will prepare for the government exam. Now the question arises what to do - first I thought of doing M.Sc in Mathematics but I am not going to get a job even from that.

Tell me some such course which I can do online and after that I can get a job or there is some masters course after which it will be easy to get a job.

1dwi6k3,Quitting a job/ending relationship for mental health,"25F, I’ve been having panic attacks at work and dreading going to the office for many months now due to various reasons. On paper, it’s a great job at a prestigious company with a really great salary. I’m proud of myself for getting to where I am. However, I’m deteriorating inside with anxiety and depression. It doesn’t help that I’m living in a huge city where I don’t have a support system (no family, not many close friends) - i’ve been here 3 years now. I have a partner and we’ve been together for two years, and he’s truly the best, but I’m starting to find myself relying on him for my happiness and it’s really straining our relationship. I am frequently experiencing depressive episodes where I contemplate just ending it all.

I’m starting to miss my home country (I’ve been away for 7 years now) and the sense of support, community, as my family and closest friends are there. I miss the culture, the food, the quality of life, etc. but the catch is - if I move back, I’ll be taking a huge pay cut and my country is also known for not having the best work life balance or career growth prospects (though there is the argument that it depends on the company, industry, etc.) Additionally, my partner and I agreed that we would end our relationship if I moved back, as LDR just wouldn’t work.

I guess what I’m seeking here is, if anyone else has quit a good job and/or ended a great relationship to prioritize their mental health, and how your experience has been so far. Do you regret it? Where are you at in life now?

1dwgqjd,How do you get into IB/finance?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a college student majoring in finance(going into my 4th year), and I’m struggling to understand how some people seem to know so much about finance and investment banking without having any experience. I see so many students, getting internships at big banks left and right. Meanwhile, I’ve interviewed for positions at places like Goldman Sachs and a few other major banks, but I never get an offer. 

It feels almost impossible to break into this field. It’s frustrating when it seems like no one is giving me a chance. I feel like time is passing by, and I’m scared I’ll never get a position in finance. I’m really losing hope. 

How do people become so knowledgeable about finance and investment banking before they even start working in the industry? How do I gain experience without having an internship? What can I do to improve my chances of landing a finance internship? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

1dwgppc,Recent college graduate - Regretting my degree and struggling to find my path,"Hey everyone, I am a 23M who just graduated with a Finance degree from a small college and am struggling to find an entry level job. I'm starting to regret choosing this path and have realized I didn't do enough research before choosing to do Finance. I'm now realizing how competitive and saturated the Finance field really is. The majority of jobs I was aiming for are seeking graduates from the prestigious schools that I could not afford and are requiring many years of experience. The only job that I've successfully secured an interview for is an hourly bank teller position.

I've realized Finance isn't really my passion and I'm starting to wish I pursued fields like Computer Science, Engineering, Accounting, Mathematics, etc. I am also naturally an introvert which probably doesn't align well with the demands of the finance industry, although I can be an extrovert in some cases.

I was never able to land an internship while in college after applying to numerous positions which has really hurt my job search. My interview skills needed work at the time and I lacked motivation to apply myself because I didn't understand the true importance of an internship until it was too late. My school didn't require an internship like most prestigious ones do.

I also faced significant challenges with gambling and marijuana addiction during college. This greatly hindered my motivation to pursue the right career path and secure internships. On top of that, I got a DUI while in school which will be on my record for 10 years. Very stupid mistake that I'll never do again. This will affect my job prospects for the next decade. I've finally decided to get my shit together and have been clean from the weed and gambling for 3 months now. Ever since I've stopped, I've become obsessed with self improvement and finding out what career I want to pursue.

I'm seeking insights into alternative career paths and advice on whether I should even pursue a different career after dedicating four years to studying finance. I'm considering pursuing a masters in a different field. For some context, I'm quite good at math and Excel, have a strong interest in AI and tech, am adept with computer systems, have a pretty high IQ, and am a fast learner. I also have aspirations of possibly starting a business down the road. I know I have potential, I just need some direction in my life.

The expectations of my bosses also don’t make sense . I’ve received a lot other feedback . They often put me on the spot, I’ll say I don’t know and they get upset and say im supposed to know by now. They talk in their own lingo that is new to me because I’ve only been there 5 weeks. Now im approaching the final weeks and the feedback I have received is harsh. I’ve been told to not look around for “help”. That no one is going to give me the answers and I have to figure it out. I need to pay attention and that they’re not going to treat me like an intern. They often put me on the spot and it’s embarrassing. They’re not the best teachers and it’s hard to learn.

1dwcc45,Degree but no direction or experience,"If you take the time to read this and offer any advice or insight I would really appreciate it :) 
I graduated with my bachelors last May. I went to a university with a pretty good reputation and majored in comprehensive science and minored in psychology. I always liked math and science so that was how i chose my major, and i really enjoyed a few intro psych classes so that made me choose the minor. 
I’ve never really known what I wanted to do with my life, just that I want to do something that helps people in some way. 

Over the past year, I’ve had a lot happen medically and in my family, so ive been working at a grocery store part time and haven’t sought out any careers. 

Now I am completely overwhelmed and lack any direction. I feel like in choosing a career I’m giving up a shot at all the others and don’t like to make decisions unless I am confident in them. I thought I wanted to do something in the medical field, but I’m not sure what specifically. I didn’t take a lot of the prerequisite courses required for many medical programs (never took organic chem, anatomy, microbiology). I’ve considered becoming a registered dietitian, but know you now need a masters for this as well (which have many of the same premed prerequisites). I’ve thought about teaching math or science and like kids, but I’m not sure I’m outgoing enough. 
My other thoughts were something like research and development or a lab technician (however, I also don’t have lab research experience),  biostatistics, data analytics, physical therapy, occupational therapy, or medical technician. 
I’ve even been looking into more corporate roles but am really unsure that I would do well in a standard 9-5 job. 

Some of my strengths: very organized & hardworking, proactive, writing

Some of my weaknesses: no internship/ research experience,  public speaking in some cases (kind of introverted & have social anxiety)

What I really would like in a career is:
-something where I can make a sustainable salary (lot of lab jobs only make 30k & I live in NY)
-decent work life balance (really would love to have time for family and travel eventually)

Current job: IT Systems Analyst for large east coast non-profit healthcare company, 12 hospitals, 30k employees. Working on (and feel close to) a promotion to Senior Analyst.

Pros: Love the work (this is super important to me), Love the company and have been with them since I was 21, 15 years!! Vested in a real live pension. If I retire at 65, I’ll receive a $600k payout or $3k-4k a month per the calculator, just for the pension. I also have a 403b, 50% matching up to 6%. It’s also hella secure, no lay offs, community strong, will be here until pension payout time. Not to mention, because I worked for them for 10 years, my student loans were paid off (PSLF). Discounts on healthcare also, plan to have a baby soon. 

Cons:
-On-call shifts and a $67,000 salary

Possible new job: Implementation Specialist for small private healthcare product company, 5k employees.

Pros: Sounds like I’ll like the work, but maybe a little less. Same 401k 50% matching up to 6% , $90,000 salary!!!!!!

Cons: Feels less secure? I’m sole earner for my family. My Pension is kept but stops growing. Might not like the work as much. 

Both are WFH, promote Work/life balance, offer good healthcare, don’t micromanage 

I’m definitely securing the offer letter from possible new job to show current job, but there’s no way they will match, as the cap for my role is $82,000. 

If current job promotes me to justify the bump, I’ll end up stuck at the low end of the new roles’s pay scale. 

If the current company offers me 10%, 20%, do I take it to keep that pension rising? Is my pension worth as much as I’m thinking it is? 

$90,000 would change my life.

1dwba87,Is there a real way of balancing Creativity and Financial Stability?,"Hi FindaPath!

I'm at a bit of a crossroads and could really use some guidance. As a kid, I was really into origami and grew to love illustration and electronics. This passion led me to pursue a bachelor's and master's in architecture because it seemed like the perfect way to merge the practical and experiential—building something people can use and that has a communal aspect. I've always enjoyed creating things that are not just visually appealing but also solve real problems.

After graduating, I worked at a few architecture firms, hoping to dive into innovative projects. However, I found the environment to be quite rigid, with a lot of focus on traditional methods and slow to embrace new ideas. Discussions often revolved around abstract concepts without substance, which felt disconnected from the practical, impactful work I wanted to do. This experience left me feeling uncertain about my future direction and how I can truly leverage my skills in a meaningful way. I do still feel a strong passion for architecture, but I want to see if there is something more that I can learn and do while I am still young.

Financially, I'm feeling the pressure too. I need to make enough to sustain myself in a high cost of living area. I’ve been exploring how to blend my love for industrial design, electronics, and architecture into a rewarding career that pays well (for the sake of survival, I put financial stability over creativity but I wish for both even if I have to work for it). I’m particularly drawn to projects that mix creativity with functionality and make a real impact. I have a bubbly, ADHD-type personality and thrive on brainstorming and coming up with unconventional solutions. If anyone has experience or ideas on how to navigate this interdisciplinary path and achieve financial stability, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Plus I know companies dont always make sense but for a well established company to hire three new employees knowing layoffs might be imminent seems off for me, unless they were laying off other employees and kind of ""replacing"" them with us new hires. Hopefully thats not the case either way. 



My dilemma: Should I stay at my stable but challenging job with capped pay, or take the new opportunity with higher earnings but potential risk? Also, if I leave, should I give a two-week notice to maintain good relations for future references in our small industry? Only reason I would'nt give a two-weeks notice is that they are hiring another tech alongside me and they would start a few weeks before me and they would potentially get a head start on me, plus it's easier to start a new position if your also coming in with someone.

This is my former college roommate’s family’s business (small business but established and very profitable. Her dad started the company and she is set to take it over eventually). We’re friendly for sure but not close. It’s what made us good roommates : ). Do you think it’s a bad idea to go work for her dad’s company? I’d essentially be working under her.

1dwa7ef,US citizen looking into a Master's program in the EU—job prospects in the US?,"Hi all,

So, basically I am a US citizen, born and raised here, and am about to graduate from college with my Bachelors degree. I am debating pursuing a Master's program in Europe—I studied abroad and absolutely loved it, and am looking for an opportunity to spend more time there without sacrificing my career/life path. So, a Master's there seems like the best of both worlds. However, I'm wondering how an EU masters would be perceived by American companies when I finish my studies and pursue employment back home. Are EU degrees still respected by employers, or would I be at a disadvantage to those who got Masters in the US? Is there a competitive benefit to experiencing education/ideas from other countries, or would I just seem behind?

I (23M) am a CS Student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science while working part time as a data engineer in a mid-sized central-European country. I feel as if I'm not really advancing in my field in with that job position, as it is somewhat of a junior/intern position. The thing is, I have no seniors that could ""show me the ropes"". Usually I just do everything by myself with the help of Google and ChatGPT, which is okay but I fear that I'm picking up a lot of bad habits that will later bite me in the a\*\*. On top I came to the realisation that data engineering isn't really what I want to do later in my career...

The reason I'm having such a hard time deciding whether to find another job or not is because of the benefits: Flexible Working hours, paid time off during exam phase (the missed hours do not count as holidays but I have to work a little more during my semester holidays), work from home whenever I want to, etc. Do many other companies offer these kind of benefits to part time students, or did I hit a gem with this position when it comes to conditions like these?",WalkingBukket,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1720214534,2024-07-05 21:22:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dw8urs/young_data_engineer_in_unfulfilling_job_position/,7,2024
1dw7zu4,How to navigate manager sabotage,"I work for a mid- size company, that is merging 4 office locations into one. The person in my position at another location quit 2 months ago, and I was asked by the manager of that location to take over some of his responsibilities. I did so willingly, and he said his hope (and that of the district manager) would be to promote me officially to director of my department at both locations at the start of the fiscal year. Things were going well, as many of the tasks could easily be replicated for the other location, and I was building rapport with the staff there, etc. Nothing was slipping at my primary location either. 

At the start of the fiscal year, however, my direct manager and one of his manager buddies met with the VP and the manager of the second location to discuss the situation. They didn't like the idea of sharing a staff member with the 2nd location, and raised concerns about it, such as worries something would slip, and  that it was ""unfair"" for the primary location to have to share me. They talked the 2nd location manager and the VP into hiring a part-time person to assume the responsibilities at that location. Which would be fine, but given the history of dealing with these 2, I am worried the move was more political in nature, and that they bad-mouthed me to the VP and other manager. 

I had a meeting with the 2 people from my primary location last Friday, where they told me the results of their meeting, and that the promotion is off the table for now, and they listed some ""concerns"" that were minor, untrue and not related to the work I'd been doing for the other location at all. I am frustrated and feeling disrespected. Should I approach the manager of that 2nd location (or even the VP) to attempt to clear my name, just let things ride and hope for the eventual promotion, or walk away and find something new? I've been here for almost 10 years, and never had any negative interactions with coworkers or anything, other than my direct boss and his friend.

As part of this training period, I shadow a more experienced member of staff. But for the last month, I have been operating at a standard that doesn’t require me to be kept under observation.

1dw5721,Leaving Costco after several bad injuries. ,"     Started as a part time student back in 2013. I worked in the food court for 3 years. Then the front end for a couple years on carts. During this time i earned about 60 credit hours toward a business degree. 
     The mileage from carts was wearing on me so I applied for major sales. After doing well and proving myself in the department I was placed on morning merch. In early 2018 i assisted 4 of my managers with what i can only describe as a poorly thought out lift. Under their direction I tried to assist in flipping a large 300lb table mid air. One of the managers lost his grip and the weight suddenly transferred onto my right arm while parallel to the ground. I sustained a 95% tear of my distal biceps tendon and opted for surgery. This put me in a tough spot financially and I decided to pause school and go full time after my recovery. 
      I did really well as morning merch and became a key team member for setting up and implementing changes in the department. COVID hit shortly after and I fell into a state of depression using work as an excuse for drinking and not pursuing things I care about. I didnt have any career goals it was just survival one day at a time. 
      2021 rolls around and the constant lifting took its toll again. Toward the end of a particularly heavy morning I was told to organize about 12 pallets of 12 ft rugs by color. This involved taking out and lifting into position almost 100 units. The upright metal cages require an awkward hook and lift motion as they are merched on the floor upright. I was frustrated with the task considering how tired I was but pushed on until I felt something pop in my hip. This ended up being a tear in my psoas major which led to me needing pt to be able to raise my right leg. Time and resistance training has helped but I still deal with chronic hip pain and pain in my right arm. 
        I decided I needed a change and applied for bakery Supervisor. I came into a department that had no manager for 6 months and was trained by the previous supervisor for 2 days before they left. The learning curve and demand on my time due to shortages in labor threw my life into chaos. I worked 6 months with no official manager and had to skip my work training due to our production always falling short. Managers would ask me to stay For OT to “fill the table” then complain when D&D was high. Quickly realized that I did not see a future where I was happy in the bakery. I stepped down and moved back to my old duties. I then took advantage of the new work from home position for costco.com. Its a hybrid position where we work 3 weeks in the warehouse  and one week from home every month. 
       The one week off from lifting was a god send but created a back log of work in the department. The work I was responsible for while there, was not being done. So every rotation I would come back to a department in shambles. I would bust my ass to get things up to speed just in time for my next rotation working from home. Unfortunately the 3 weeks in the warehouse resulted in the same rush to catch up as protocol and the software we were using changed constantly. Combined with the nature of at home customer service work I started getting panic attacks about this phone job. I stuck out working online to avoid the 3 hour daily commute. 
          Fast forward to 2024 and my body is upset about the constant stress shifting from 2 am to 2pm work days into 8am-5pm work days. This had a huge impact on my sleep quality. I contracted a flu but decided the needs of my department were too great and pushed on. I told my manager how I was feeling and asked to leave after opening. That morning I stocked the fence, handled rebuilding 5 blocks of merch in front of majors , and reset most of our tvs to be ordered by price point/ size with the correct displays above and connected to our tv feed. 6 hours in dehydrated and physically burnt without having had lunch or a break I went to lift the last pallet of queen beds in a box onto the other merch. A lift I’ve done countless times before, this time my left distal biceps tendon tore as the weight shifted slightly in the box. I knew as it was happening what was happening. I made no sound just fell to the ground clutching my arm. I snapped and let out a rage filled yell before I started laughing while crying. I took a moment and no one came to check on me, then I realized no one had done so at all that morning in spite of me sounding very sick. I got the surgery again with the same doctor and am recovering again. I dont think I have the emotional fortitude or willpower to go back to that same environment. I am working with an injuy attorney as I feel that sustaining that many injuries in 6 years before i turned 33 is very much outside the norm. 
     I know this post is long but its hard to talk with friends about it and my parents are in no position to offer advice. I am looking for clarity of purpose. I want to go back to school or learn a trade to start over. Is there any advice or life lesson you think might be relevant? 
I feel shame for seeking legal help and anxiety over leaving what is in most peoples opinion a “good” job and a great company. I am very fortunate to have a loving wife and she has been a tremendous support. So i want to make the right decision not only for my sake but hers as well. I took an aptitude test from my local university and it recommended something in the engineering field. I have also considered becoming an electrician and have aspirations of owning my own business. If you read this far thank you for taking the time to. 
 Am I wrong for wanting to leave? is pursuing a degree at 33 a waste of time? Is it wise to go into a trade? Was it a mistake to involve lawyer? Am i failing to remain objective?  Your opinions would be valued. Cheers!

I have 2 years marketing experience overall, 3.5 months SEO content writing, and the rest is social media (scheduling, design in Canva Photoshop, Lightroom). I haven't done much photography or videography during my PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, however I have done this for YEARS in self-projects & during my 3 month internship.

My social experience has been but more so growing followers & engagement, scheduling, photoshop & canva design, editing & analytics.

1 year of my social media experience was a joint recruitment/social media position creating graphics & posts for LinkedIn.

I also have a related undergraduate degree and a less related MA degree in a creative subject.

1dw4o6z,Career in VC (advice),"Career in VC

Hi,

I have about 4+ YOE in Supply chain and procurement consulting. I have a masters in Industrial Engg. A few months ago, I moved from a consulting company to a tech company (still in supply chain). Tbh, I haven’t been enjoying this career that I chose for myself for a while and I am looking to change fields. I have been interested in the VC space for a while, I have spent some time understanding the basics. I want to learn more about this space and look for job opportunities. If anyone has any recommendations for resources that I can use to learn and maybe some tips on how I can break into this space.. I would love to hear.

Thank you!

1dw3uw6,Degree Completion Program?,"I never completed my college degree in Computer Science and left school to start working as an engineer almost 20 years ago.  Fast forward to today, I've held various roles and grown at organizations which eventually found me in engineering leadership positions.  With the current market being so difficult, I, like so many others, am I'm finding it really challenging to find my next leadership role.

I got an email today from the university where I attended the CS program talking about a ""Degree Completion Program"" which is offered virutally and at a campus local to me.  The program considers your industry experience and can provide some credit based on your work and will work with students to tailor the program based on what existing credits they have. The successful outcome for the program would be either a BA in University Studies or a BS in Leadership Studies.  

For over 20 years, I never felt my degree was an impediment to landing my next role.  The current employment climate COMBINED with my ideal role being mid/senior leadership has left me questioning that.  If I had aspirations to go pursue an advanced degree, I would probably be more sold on the program, but I'm not certain I want to make that investment quite yet.  

Would doing this program be a waste of time?  As someone in engineering/leadership, is it better to have no degree or a University Studies BA?  ",digitalburro,1,1.0,0,1720201573,2024-07-05 17:46:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dw3uw6/degree_completion_program/,7,2024

In autumn i started a job search in Social Media / Digital Marketing. I’ve put out nearly 200 apps and I can only manage a few interviews

I struggled really bad with panic attacks and mental health in my undergrad. This caused my overall GPA to be 2.8

I’ve grown a lot and I’m totally different person now. I have overcome my mental disorder and I know how to be disciplined now. 

Is it even possible for me to get my masters with my GPA? Would it be a good idea? I would be looking to get my masters in a more in demand field. I’ve thought about getting into Software Development or Marketing Research Specialist.

I just don’t see myself being able to change my career, boost my resume and gain new network connections without going back to school.

A lot of people tell me “you can change your career other ways” or “just get an employer to pay for it”

but those I can’t even get a job in the first place to pay for a masters. and it’s nearly impossible to even get an interview for an entry level position in 2024 for a job that isn’t 100% in your field

This decision could profoundly impact my short-term well-being and long-term satisfaction.
One option is to prioritize financial stability by taking a job that may not be my ideal choice but offers a steady income. Alternatively, focusing on training and education for a new career could lead to greater long-term fulfillment and financial rewards.

1dw2eg8,Condescending colleague or I am the crazy one?,"Hi. I am working in IT Industry. We are 10 people woth the same role, and my concern is related to the one who was the longest on the project.

I am the type of person that is cheerful and tries to help everyone, with an idea, a solution, anything.

Well, this lady always complains that the way I am doing things is not ""how we do the things here"", but I am the only one actually caring and trying to follow the rules that the client said we should follow.

Usually after I give her a detailed explanation on why I did a thing the way I did, her tone changes and tries to put everything under the rug.
I have been patient and trying (and still am) to talk, teach her stuff, explain why I do this and that, but she either gets a phone call, the door bell rings, she is talking with someone else or completely ignores me, or goes bananas to other random topics, when she was the one asking for these meetings. 
Then at the end thanks me and bye, just a waste of time for me..

She tries to put me under a bad light for tasks that were not even mine, always complains about people from certain regions or that are juniors, and never tries to be understanding and guide them, cause we are not born seniors.. we all start somewhere and grow with help from others.

She leaves the meetings saying she got conflicts (but apparently this finally raised a flag to the managers) because these conflicts seems not to exist; rather than working on tasks she spends time on training.. Am I just being jealous here? *tear falling down*

Recently, I got praised for my good work, and she kept repeating in all channels that I should share what I did, when we were in the same room..
In a meeting that I was late for a few minutes, same story, screaming, demanding answers and when I joined and gave a demo.. ""very nice"".

1dw26m4,Should I give up on wanting to move to the US?,"Not sure if this post is going to come off as cynical, but basically, as of writing this, I have developed a strong liking to the United States, to such a degree that I'm considering moving there, however, actually finding a profession to live a comfortable life seemingly throws a wrench in my plans. The problem is that I'm deadset on living in a rural area (I've looked around zillow and you can buy a medium sized house alongside a small plot of land for roughly the same of even less than a reasonably priced suburban home), preferably not to far from a sizeable (at least 50,000ish) population centre: from my understanding, much of the US is somewhat sparsely populated, at least compared to developed countries in Europe, which is actually one of my main reasons for wanting to move there... but predictably, rural areas don't have a lot in the way of employment opportunities.

More specifically, here are the states I wish I could move to (top to bottom from favourite to least favourite).

* West Virginia
* Iowa
* South Carolina
* North Carolina

At first I thought I could get around this problem by being hired remotely, but from my understanding companies will only let you work from home if you have experience of some skill that makes you desirable enough to them, which is not going to be case fresh out of university.

Also, as of writing this I'm still in high school and haven't figured what I want to do for a living yet... sort of: If I didn't want to move to the US, I'd just become a truck driver and be happy with that (I'm not a bad student or anything, It's just something I'm interested in), but, from what I've gathered, truckers in the US are generally worse off than in most european countries so I don't see this line of work as a viable option for me. I'm open to all suggestions, especially in the following fields (in no particular order this time:

* Automotive: Ford and GM are both based in Michigan, which seems fairly rural even just outside of Detroit.
* Firearms: there are a bunch of gun companies based in mostly rural states (like Palmetto State Armory in South Carolina).
* Finance: It's a field I've recently become interested in and maybe it's more lenient towards remote work?

Another possible option may be jobs where you are away from home most of the year but allow you to buy a house pretty much everywhere you want: I remember seeing a guy on this sub who mentioned being some kind of cargo ship worker: he's all over the globe for 9 months but for the remaining 3 he can stay home and pretty much live like a retiree. I'd imagine it's a tough job though.

Lastly, another big concern for me is work benefits... or lack thereof. From my understanding, labour protections as a whole are fairly weak and benefits (paid leave, holidays, health insurance coverage etc...) are mostly left up to the employer.

In short, employment opportunities in the rural places I'd like to move to in all likelyhood aren't great, meaning I'd have to either move somewhere with better employment opportunities but more expansive living costs/housing or attempt to be hired remotely. Moreover, I'm still figuring out what I might like to do for a living.",88-81,1,0.5600000023841858,38,1720197300,2024-07-05 16:35:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dw26m4/should_i_give_up_on_wanting_to_move_to_the_us/,7,2024

I currently hold a doctor of physical therapy and an MBA with an undergrad in biology. I work in med tech and am curious to hear the communities thoughts around pursuing a bachelor of electrical engineering (company would fully sponsor). The space I work in is at the intersection of digital/a.i and robotics and I could see electrical engineering be a great balance. My ultimate career goal is to be a general manager. While I do not see myself working in r&d or a pure engineer role, I could see the degree giving me a strong technical understanding and credibility while collaborating with these teams.

That being said, at this stage of my career, is it worth the time/energy for the additional degree or am I better off taking stretch assignments and getting direct continuing education that will immediately help me in my current role (strategy).

Pension: employer pays 7% i pay 3% (this year was €7k total for both). I work 4d remote & 1 day in office as i live 110miles/170km away from Dublin.

* **Contract offering:** €65 per hour, 12 month contract for a consultancy on a pharma client. I would probably go a LTD company if allowed? Have looked at Fenero/Icon etc. Decent reputation global consultancy. Would prob have to do 2 days in Dublin area so 1 night accom involved to pay for, other 3 WFH.

*  **Circumstances:** Male31, just married, 13 years experience, mortgage on own home, wife & I hoping to start a family next year. Never been contract before but sickens me to lose €3k tax per month at present. Employer also looking me back to office 3 days, which would be a 4-4.5hr round trip driving daily, or pay accom and stay over, none covered by employer. Not sure how will work out maybe nothing will happen, but contract states normal place of work as Dublin office (started 2022 end of covid).

* **Question:** Is €65 p/h enough? advertised rate through agency is €55-75, i know the firm also has the position advertised to apply directly with them but i have held back on this as afraid they wouldn't offer contract and money a lot less. Or should I just stay put and hold on to my cosy number. Not much stress at all but lot of corporate/red tape crap and social events/pressure to attend office.

I researched the job opportunities and salary range of this major, and I concluded that Business Economics is better. In case my first plan (to create a business) fails, my second option is to be an investment banker. And I think having Business Economics is an advantage compared to the other Managements. And since Business Economics as a major is not offered that much in other colleges in my area, I think it would be ""less saturated"" than the other Managements and gives me an edge (atleast).

1dvzp44,Rude remarks by colleagues when I make a mistake,"First time working in a hotel, no prior experience nor training.  
I was hired and immediately put to work, learning things ""on the go"".  
My shift coworker is more experienced than me and is there to guide me / answer my questions.  
At my workplace we don't have anything like a written handbook with all the correct procedures to follow, save for a Word file made by an ex coworker years ago (that is not even complete nor updated).

Needless to say,  I have been making a lot of mistakes lately, some very minor but others quite serious.  In all cases I have been scolded by my boss, who also added some pretty disrespectful remarks such as ""you're like a child, you can't be left alone or else you fuck up"", and by my coworker. 

My coworker feels personally attacked by my mistakes, because he claims it looks like he hasn't been teaching me anything at all, so the boss scolds him too. Everytime I am scolded by the boss, my coworker scolds me in private too because ""I am making him look like a fool"" in front of the boss. 

Now, I am always ready to own up to my mistakes, learn from them and move on.  

But I am tired of these constant direspectful remarks and passive-aggressive jokes (believe me, I hear them everyday). Moreover, is it wrong for me to think my colleague shouldn't get mad at me for MY mistakes? After all, it's me who's making them.

I could possibly continue to do the old employer's project work as it's remote, and keep both but I want to hear your advice, and have a laugh. 

The short of it is: I was working for this company for about 3 years. It's a new company. We make learning materials for health professionals. It was going great for the first 1-2 years. I had red flags from day 1, when I got hired their site had bios of all these people, but when I showed up day 1 (remotely) I learned I am actually just one of 3 people (not 20) still with the company. There is massive turnover. Mostly because there is little work. I was doing this part time with 2 other jobs - only did it because for other reasons I wanted to be home a couple days a week to work remote. 

The past year has been SLOW. Nobody is interested in the product. I personally don't love the product. We have worked hard to improve it but it's not up to par to some competitors. Don't love the mission or the leadership either. 

It was working fine because my other 2 jobs I can just tack on more work, so I kept this one doing like 1-2 hours/week the last 3 months just to keep it. 

Finally, enough is enough, I'm going to go more permanent with one of my other jobs. I told them I'm done, here's my 2 weeks.   
2 days later CEO (who never really reaches out) calls me. Says we have a big project lined up, I can sign a contract for extra pay that would be guaranteed for part-time hours until Jan 2027. That I'm a ""fantastic employee"" (probably their longest employee LOL) and they have spent time to budget this out for me and give me this package. 

I'm thinking if I'm such a good employee (and I am) then why did you not contact me in the last 6 months when I have been working less than 5 hours/week to give me this new contract and new project and raise, in order to get me working more and retain me? 

I just think companies are hilarious. They probably thought I was some moron who just hung around and would do whatever for little pay. Honestly.

1dvycb4,Could use some advice as a current contractor,"Hey y’all..

I’m a contractor working for a pretty good company and I’m hoping to become permanent after my contract ends in October. I’ve already spoken to the director (who was my manager when he interviewed and hired me), and he’s told me explicitly that he has plans to keep me on board and give me a permanent position.

I don’t have any reason to not believe him, as I’ve worked with several teams within the company and feel like I’ve put in good work. I haven’t had any issues so far, but I feel anxious that this is not exactly set in stone. There’s nothing on writing that suggests I’ll have a job after October.

That being said, my anxiety is being fueled even more by my other coworkers who now suddenly are flooding me with open job positions.

Would it be dumb of me to not apply for these positions? My thinking is that if I apply, that would mess up my chances of getting a job with my Director. Now that I’m typing this, this does seem a little dumb of me. But still, I’d like some advice on this. Should I speak to my director again about my concerns? Should I be applying to these internal positions? Or should I be patient and go with what my director says?

Just to be clear; he was very transparent during our conversation and I felt confident that I’d have a job with the company afterwards. But in my mind, nothing is 100% until it’s in writing, and even then… this is corporate.

1dvy7v5,Getting out of an endless job loop…?,"Since being in my sales position, I have consistently made 3rd place in the district of the company. (It varies in the top 5, but it’s usually third or second). I’m aware it’s something I’m good at, but my god, I do not like sales.  Especially since it’s in a retail environment. Due to my need to perfect and impress, that’s how I ended out performing the others and now I’m one of the assistant managers and sales lead of this store. 
Despite all of this, it’s getting to a point where I’m starting to get into deep with this company where I’m in a position where I’m on a path to own my own tore. This is all good things, however, I would have to completely de-root my self from the city where I am and would have to move somewhere where I would be working roughly twice as much as I already do. My partner and I have started the process of buying a house here. 
My point to this, I want to get some advice about my next move. Ideally, I want something more stable. Commission pay is great, until it’s not. And in order to receive out pay, you have to make high enough percentages in areas of your sales. I’ve grown to not enjoy this environment, but it seems that I can’t find any jobs that’s isn’t in sales, physical labor, or the medical field in this town. I feel so trapped. Other than Indeed, I have no idea on how to find what I’m looking for. As a side note, I want to find the time to go back to college and finish my degree. But due how niche it is on what I want to do, I’m scared I would make a wrong move being thousands of dollars in dept for a degree I could potentially not even use (biology with a zoology focus. Was going for behavior ecology). 
I do apologize about my rant. But would anyone have any feedback on what I could do that would provide something stable as far as income, days to work, and something that is not in sales?

1dvxveg,Feeling unvalued and underutilised,"Hi

I hail from India (North) working for a big IT company based in India(south).

In 2023 I was fresh out of MBA put into Business Development and Lead Generation. Even during onboarding the work felt quite not upto the mark. My job revolves around finding and generating leads for my boss who takes up the client meetings while converting into actual sales opportunity

I stay alone and am a bachelor with the entire family staying in North. Have been requesting for work from home setup for a couple of weeks yet the management is too high headed to agree, not looking for complete work from home just for a couple of weeks request is met with a big NO

I feel disinterested in the work I do. Always thought marketing would be the place I'll settle not the sales. Nor do I feel valued at the company despite being high performing employee

Any motivation any thoughts on how I can switch to marketing would be a great help

1dvvvx4,Alternative options to psych honours+masters?,"Hi, uni student here in my final year of undergrad for psych. My original plan was to get into honours at uni for psych and move onto masters to eventually become a registered psych. However as it turns out my gpa is not the best and I only have one more semester to go. I could potentially get accepted into honours, however I feel this year it'll be quite competitive so now I'm considering other options if I'm not accepted.

1. I've heard about doing a grad diploma that is essentially the equivalent to honours however I think it's all online based and has a much higher fee. I feel like studying online and paying all of that would deter me from doing good in that year (I'm really opposed to the idea of studying online lol)

2. Masters in counselling OR social work OR occupational therapy??? If I have my bachelors in psych I can move on to do a masters in either one of these however idk which one would be more beneficial or provide better opportunities

At the moment I don't even know for sure exactly what I want to do but I know I wanna work in the mental health sector and I also have an interest in prison settings or drug and alcohol use and NOT working with kids 

A few other things 

- I know being a psychologist would have a better salary but I'm keen to know the salaries of other areas and if they're similar. If I manage to get into honours at my uni I will for sure go for it. Due to the cost of living I want to study something that will give me the potential to obtain a high paying job (as do most ppl)

- I'm not interested in taking a gap year or delaying studies

There’s a reputable private university that offers two Masters I am interested in: Business Analytics and Supply chain management.

1dvvjfm,How do I find a new path that isn’t university?,"Help me find a path that isn’t uni

Hi, I’m looking for some advice on starting a career path that ends in me doing something I enjoy.

For context, I’m at university and I hate it. It has completely ruined my health and I dread starting second year. I’m doing a law course however this is not what I had planned to study it’s only what I have ended up doing due to getting a nasty surprise with my A Level results.

I have decided that perhaps an entry level job/traineeship/apprenticeship is the best way forward for me however I’m unsure exactly what areas I should be searching in. I had hoped to study modern languages at university and had done French, English Literature and Media Studies at A Level. French was by far my favourite subject because I loved the patterns and logic of grammar and how all the different nouns and verbs etc. could be sorted and classed. On the other hand, I absolutely loved the analytical aspects of English Literature and how it also helped me maintain my love for reading even while I had a lot of schoolwork. I would love to work in a profession where I would experience things similar to this but due to the people close to me/in my family having pursued very different career areas, I don’t really know what the job scene is like concerning my interest or even the types of jobs available.

So I put it on my resume and found something else that atleast pays me for what I’m doing. Only thing is she’s gonna be pissed I’m leaving during the summer during peak time. And I’m scared she’s gonna mess up my job reference when they call and claim that I’m not even keyholder when I have been for 6 months.

1dvuvga,Stuck Between Two Job Offers: Prestige vs. Stability – What Should I Prioritize?,"I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could really use your advice. I have two job opportunities on the table, and I’m torn about which one to take.

**Option 1: Voluntary Internship**

* **Pros:**
   * It’s with a well-known, prestigious company.
   * The tasks are super interesting, focusing on machine learning and data pipelining.
   * I’ve got the offer, so it’s certain.
* **Cons:**
   * It’s only for 4 months.
   * The pay is low (it’s an internship, after all).
   * High pressure to finish projects within the 4 months.
   * No guarantee of a job afterward – it depends on available openings.
   * Start date isn’t immediate, but in two months.

**Option 2: Student Job**

* **Pros:**
   * Immediate start (if I get the offer).
   * Higher salary.
   * Open-ended contract, offering more job security.
   * The company, while not internationally renowned, has been around for decades.
   * Tasks are related to data analysis, with the flexibility to take on my own projects.
* **Cons:**
   * I haven’t received the offer yet (but it looks promising).
   * The company’s name doesn’t carry the same weight as the first one.
   * Uncertainty about how much the tasks will align with my interests (no Machine Learning mentioned in the job posting, but I believe I could start my own project in the subject once I'm in the company).

To add another layer to this, I’ve been in a tough financial situation because my previous employer didn’t pay my last few salaries, likely due to bankruptcy (another story for another time). So I'm runinng out of savings and freaking out a bit. That's why waiting two months for the first offer stresses me out.

Given these circumstances, should I prioritize the prestige and potential future opportunities of the internship or the immediate financial stability and security of the student job? How should I weigh these pros and cons?

Open your resume and use Ctrl+F to search your document. 



Or better yet, run it through ChatGPT to proofread your resume for spelling mistakes. 

""Here's my resume, please proofread to ensure the correct use of grammar and vocabulary. Also ensure the most suitable hard skills and soft skills for the job position is emphasized in my resume.""



If you've correctly spelled “manager,” good for you. If you find “manger,” fix it now.



Take it further and add strong examples of your leadership—how many employees or projects you've managed, what you accomplished, etc.

1dvufi4,I really could use some career advice :/,"Thank you for taking the time to read.

I have been with my current company for almost a decade now. 
I am a top performer in my company. I am a top 1% sales agent (I mean this humbly) there. I have also worked in management for the company. (I ended up deciding to go back to an employee because I made significantly more as an employee vs what I made as a manager)
I am a extremely hard worker and have always gone above and beyond to provide results. 
I’m the type of person that works more than I have to, to ensure goals are met.
After working for the company for almost a decade, I have been thinking about trying a different field, trying something new. 

My boss talks down to us and belittles us as he believes this is how to get results.
He’ll call me and chew me out until my eyes start watering. 
A colleague of mine complained to hr and my boss orchestrated a way to get her fired- & that’s what happened. 
After going through this treatment for years I’m at a point now where I’m realizing that maybe it’s time to move on. 

So I started applying to other places, a friend of mine that works with a company that does business with ours referred me to their company 

And……. I never heard back. Not a email, call, interview or anything.

I thought it was strange and my friend followed up with her boss and he told her that my boss bad mouthed me and said really awful things about me that I’d completely untrue. (If it was true why would he keep me on his team?)

He is blacklisting me to other companies so I have to stay working for him.

What should I do? :/ I feel so stuck and like my years of hard work was all for nothing. It honestly gets me so down at times but I know God will bring the right employers into my life

I figured maybe a remote job might be the best option since I live in a small area where everyone knows one another, It’s disheartening to work so hard to be trapped by someone like that.

1dvqjz9,Seeking Career Advice: Overcoming Challenges in the Interior Decorative Panels Industry,"
Hello,

I am currently working in an interior decorative panels manufacturing company and oversee the entire production process. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology. I began my career as a machine operator for the PUR flat lamination line for interior decorative panels while I was still pursuing my degree. Over time, I was promoted to Production Incharge.

In my home country, it is common for employers to overburden employees, assigning additional responsibilities like managing stocks and accounts. Due to this, I left my first company. After that, I joined another company where I successfully restored an 8-year inactive cold adhesive lamination line for interior decorative panels. Again, I was promoted to Production Incharge, but I faced the same issue of excessive workload and insufficient pay.

A business owner approached me wanting a production line for interior decorative panels, which are usually imported from China. I offered my assistance to design, manufacture, and supervise the setup of a production line in my hometown, and fortunately, it was a success. Then, I was once again given the role of Production Incharge, along with additional responsibilities such as stock and account management. I took the job because I needed to pay my tuition fees, as I was nearing the end of my Bachelor's program.

I have now been working in this company for three years. I am also responsible for communicating with raw material suppliers and have established strong relationships, particularly with suppliers of interior decorative films worldwide. Despite my efforts, the company pays me inadequately compared to the workload. When I discuss a salary raise, they claim to be in financial trouble.

I feel unappreciated and overburdened. However, the industry in my country is limited, and I am aware of the lack of opportunities that would respect and fairly compensate my skills and experience. Switching careers would mean starting from scratch, although I have experience in graphic design freelancing.

In summary, I seek your advice on what to do in my situation. Should I try to go abroad, where my skills might be better appreciated, or should I switch my career? I am considering pursuing a career in interior design, which would require starting from the beginning, but I am willing to take the risk. Do you think it would be worth it?

Thank you for your advice.",Ok_Rush5434,1,1.0,0,1720157760,2024-07-05 05:36:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dvqjz9/seeking_career_advice_overcoming_challenges_in/,7,2024

I did my MBA in marketing and got into a top 3 NBFC as a relationship manager where I did very well performance wise for close to 1 year and due to me getting a dry promotion there (ie no CTC increase) I chose to leave and join a top 3 private bank in India as a Deputy Manager but as usual working in the private banking environment with all the shitty office politics ; pressure and especially micromanagement had finally pushed me over the edge and I was forced to resign after only working 6 months in my second job 

I am currently mentally tired and extremely unsure regarding my next career move but all I know is my passion for sales is long gone, all I have are my skills 

Key Skills:- 

Customer Relationship Management, 
Financial Analysis,
Credit Analysis,
Kyc Analysis,
Digital Marketing,
Power Bi and Business Intelligence,

So taking into account my current skills , qualifications and my 1.5 years experience in corporates what should be my next move in a non sales based role?

1dvpie6,"Mass exodus - boss and grandboss quit, denied promotion, where do i go?","I've been with my current company as a project manager for two years, in the industry for 5. When I started here, my boss was very hands off and neglected her own work. She ended up going out on long term disability shortly after I started and myself and the other two project managers were basically on our own. We were all fairly new and we banded together and worked our asses off to keep our department afloat. 

Six months ago I was about to go out on maternity leave and told the vp of our department that I would not be returning if they didn't hire additional project managers to help with the workload and provide us with a leader. 

I'm a very high performer with a lot of very visible projects, so the vp actually did what I asked. We were moved under an incredible director (absorbed into her department) and three new PMs were hired to help with the load. 

While I was on leave, this director approached me about a promotion into the manager position. I would be between the PMs and the director. I declined, because I wanted to focus on new motherhood. She was totally fine with it and promoted one of my colleagues. I fully supported this. The director put a promotion in the works for me to Senior Project Manager.

The company overall is poorly managed. And I've been back from leave for three months. In that time, my team has thrived under the new leadership structure and I have personally trained all the new hires. 

Three weeks ago the director pulled me aside to tell me two things. 1) She was leaving the company for a competitor. 2) my promotion was denied because I don't have the years of experience required. Despite the fact my colleague didn't have the years of experience required for her promotion, or that I'm already doing the job. 

She told me there was a position for me with the competitor if I wanted it. I've had three interviews with them and believe an offer is forthcoming. I also requested a meeting with the vp of the department to discuss my career progression at the company. 

I also found out yesterday that my colleague, who was promoted to be my manager just a few months ago, is also leaving. This leaves me as the senior most pm on the team and the only one with knowledge of all processes. 

I'm not quite sure how to approach this with the vp when we meet next week. I'm 99% going to leave, but part of me wants to make some outrageous demands just to see what I could get. Or should I just cancel my meeting with the vp and wait for an offer?

1dvovtk,Need Advice!,"Ok! This one has gone out of hand and I, am confused on what should be my next step…

Let's call my manager Adam and a team lead Mike. We were all in a standup meeting over Microsoft Teams, and suddenly nostrils began flaring and the next moment we were witnessing a nasty fight between the two, where Adam was asking Mike to give him the ticket numbers he had worked on yesterday and what would he be working on the same day etc. Mike shouted through the meeting with some uncultured words and Adam asked him to shut up and stuff like that… Meanwhile we team members were shell shocked on what’s happening!

To give a background on the nature of these guys, Adam joined the project few months back, is a manager who likes to micromanage things from his end. He asks all his reportee on everything they are doing, who logs in & out when, etc. Whereas Mike when later I talked with other teammates is a kind of snake who was in that project for about 1.5 years or so, with numerous escalations by the client himself, and was recommended by the client to be fired from the team. Adam knows about his adventures when he came to the project and gave the client assurance of 3 more months to see if he (Mike) really could improve. The team members knew Mike’s work ethics (shouting to team members, asking someone in the team to work on his work item etc.) and the last straw in the coffin was when a junior team member complained to Adam about the work he was getting from Mike, which was supposed to be worked upon by Mike. That infuriated Adam, and thus all the anger in the call.  
  
Now, I am someone with a lot of experience (work wise) and didn’t work for a team that does all these things throughout my career. And naturally, am upset about the whole event. I couldn't concentrate on my work after all this and is thinking of trying to get out of the project (or even the org) as soon as possible. The toxic work culture is not my cup of tea, and I can’t stand shouting, micro-management and unethical work culture at the least.

What is your opinion? Am I doing right, or should I stay put where I am now?",trend_killer_1,1,1.0,0,1720151494,2024-07-05 03:51:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dvovtk/need_advice/,7,2024
1dvovj2,Less Physical Jobs for Woman in her 40s?,"My mother has been working a job cleaning for around 6 years, and I've noticed the physical and mental toll it takes on her as she enters her middle age. It's getting harder for her to wake up and brush off soreness, and is developing a bit of arthritis in her thumb.

She dropped out of a local university psychology program after attending from around 2000-'02. From what I've heard she didn't have amazing grades as she didn't take it seriously.

Has experience from retail in her youth on top of the past 6-7 years of cleaning and other odd jobs.

Up and down mental health, suffers from burnout and some PTSD, I'm thinking a fresh start doing something fulfilling can flip that around. She is nervous to go back to school or move to an unfamiliar job environment, but if we could get her motivated and excited we could probably fix that. 

Anything making over 30k would probably be fine. 

Are there any entry level jobs? Could she still utilize her college experience or is that useless? Any good 2 year degrees? Tips for managing going back to school while raising kids? What has good insurance and benefits?

1dvolxg,Would you leave this job?,"What would you do? Here’s my situation:

- Been at current job for 10 years

- Very niche industry

- My specific role (communications) is transferable to other industries, if I wanted to move outside of my niche 

- Small company (40 people)

THE GOOD: 

- I’m at a consultancy and we are considered the top in that niche industry

- I’m part of the exec team; i’m given a lot of trust and respect and if I think something is important to do or to change, I can generally make some headway making it happen

- Over the past five years, I’ve had very substantial raises annually, so I don’t feel I am not being recognized financially. 

- Founder will soon retire and plan is to make me a partner (and 4-5 other people); but yes, this would involve a substantial buy in 

- In this niche industry, it’s very difficult to find a place that isn’t toxic let alone a nice place to work, and this company is one of those nice places. 


THE BAD (depending how you look at it i guess)
 
- The retiring and making partner thing - there is no timeline for that, and the founder simply won’t commit to one (mostly because it some kind of ego/mortality thing for him); some evidence suggests it’s 3-5 years, but who can really count on that. 

- The founder, while I respect him, has gotten completely out of step with our specialization (communications). He suggests things that simply don’t work anymore, and I have grown really tired of working with someone so out of touch. I don’t feel I can learn from him. 

- While he has succeeded in building something great over decades, he is actually a poor leader and has no vision (and cannot articulate one). 

- Of my other potential partners, only one is actively trying to push with me to evolve. The others are open to it, but also very stuck in old ways. I am constantly driving these evolution conversations, not them, which starts to feel like a burden when it’s not even my company. 

- I swing between a combination of bored, burnt out, and disinterested. I used to have tons of drive for the work and was a crazy high performer, and now I’m just kind of sliding by. 

- The industry is so niche - and I feel like I’ve reached so high up in it -  that I feel like I have a job a lot of people would really kill to have (interested in my niche). So I fear I’m crazy to give it up.

- If I leave, despite my transferable skills, I will be headed into the deep end with A LOT of new stuff to learn and expected to perform as if it’s not new at all. I’m terrified. 

- I don’t feel like i’m growing, thus the desire to leave. (But if i’m being given the chance to shape my own destiny at this company eventually, should I suck it up and stick it out?)

- Income potential, if leaving, is going to be parallel or maybe up to $20K higher in near term. Long term, there is huge income potential if I leave, but it’s impossible to gauge what the comparison might be to becoming partner.

1dvn04c,Is the grass greener?,"I’ve been at my current employer for 10 years, since I turned 18. Shortly after I turned 26 I decided I had enough of being in a dead end career and went back to school. After I told my employer I was enrolled, they moved me into an admin position where I could gain experience using my degree. Now that I’m in my senior year, I am having title changes and raises placed in front of me for once I graduate in the spring. I started out making $9.75 per hour in 2014 and am now making $54,000 salary, or $26 per hour in 2024. 

The thing of it is, I feel if I’m pigeon held in this industry and wouldn’t mind a change, but at the same time, having 10 years here, I am scared to jump. A year ago, I would have told you that I’m more loyal to my boss than the company as he has been nothing but a true leader and mentor as I face the challenges coming from an operations/production environment to admin. 

My degree is in engineering, and I currently work in a warehouse environment, and while warehouses are a dime a dozen anymore, I don’t know if I can see myself doing this 2-5 years from now. 

My question and the advice I am seeking is, what would you do? Not having the degree yet, would you stay until you got it? I did not use their financial reimbursement for fears of layoffs or if I did end up leaving. I have several saved jobs on indeed and LinkedIn but I have yet to click apply on any of them, just for the fears of leaving where the grass isn’t greener.

1dvlnym,Leaving after only a week at this job,"Okay, to give you guys an Idea about the background of me, I'll start off like this. I'm from a small country in the Indian subcontinent, and the culture, work ethics and economy are vastly different from those of the developed world. And the career path I'm talking about here is IT. So, I've been employed by this small company for two years, and I had a really good time there. Me and my team handled the blue collar side of the company. Most of the cabling, infrastructure and R&D side was conducted by me during my time there. Although the paycheck was a bit on the slim side, and a minor mishap here and there, it was good for me. Then things took a bad turn and  I decided to leave the institute for a better job. 

  
Then I found this new job through a friend of mine, and under his advisement, and because of the pressure I was getting from my family for a better salary (although it's not a lot higher than the previous one), I decided to give it a try. I knew it was an IT company, and I clearly expressed them my field of expertise and interests regarding a job. Whether it's a misunderstanding or not, I was not given the work I'm able to do. It's only been a week since my first day and I most certainly hate it. Its not the workload or the toxic people but the nothingness that is killing me. I used to design things in my head and on my notebook and build them with my hands. I designed solutions to fulfil the requirements of our clients back in the day. Now I'm just a sitting blob in front of a computer screen with zero satisfaction. Its an IT admin job they say. I'm not good around computers. Browsing and playing a game now and then, that's where my computer literacy stays. 

  
I consider being happy and satisfied are major parts of success. Without those, a huge salary won't make a man happy. I hate myself for choosing the wrong job and putting myself through this misery. Sometimes these thoughts make me think whether I've become mentally unstable. Should I seek psychological counselling or something? Please advice me on that matter too. 

Now here's the situation. At this point I'm not interested about ruining the carrier or anything but being in a job that makes me happy. Screwdrivers, wrenches and hammers are my tools, not some software on a computer. I always wanted to work for myself, to be self employed, but considering the current situation of the country, that's economic suicide. With this decision, I face the risk of being unemployed for some time. To prevent myself from going crazy, I'm gonna make the decision today. Still being in the probation period, there is no need for a notice that has to be given weeks-prior. A simple call or a text to the HR is gonna cut me loose. What should I do?

1dvllhv,Graduated 2 years ago and have yet find a long term career.,"
I am currently 29 years old with a bachelor’s degree in business marketing. My primary work experience has been in the restaurant industry, specifically in serving, which I find unsatisfying. Recently. Following my college graduation, I faced challenges securing employment due to the requirement for experience or low salary offers. This kinda stopped me from actively pursuing career opportunities. Looking back I regret not accepting lower pay earlier to gain some work experience. 

Recently I transitioned to a position as a biomedical lab technician, specializing in working within clean rooms and certifying HEPA filters according to NSF 49 standards. Additionally, my responsibilities include maintenance and scheduled certification of Biological Safety Cabinets (BSC). Although I find the work quite fascinating. I’m just a little worried about the pay. I made substantially more than I do now.

I was told by my boss that they  would pay for my nsf 49 certification if I wanted to take the time and study. From what I was told this takes around a year of field  work and  quite a bit studying to even be ready. Does anyone know if this certification would benefit me in the long run?

I'm just trying to find motivation to stick with this job  because I really don't want to go back to being a server but I also am going to have to struggle financially for a little. I don't mind sticking it out with the low pay for a year or so I just want to figure out a game plan on how this is going to benefit me in the long run. I'm scared I'm going to convince myself that im going nowhere with this job and that Im wasting my time. I've looked up the salary's for this kind or job for somebody with experience and they pay is terrible for the amount of knowledge needed for this.

I’ve always wanted to do medical sales in this a reasonable entry level job that could help get my foot into a the medical sales world? If not what kind of jobs with this type of work experience help me get? I don’t want to spend a year or however long trying to build up my work experience only to find out that this won’t help me get a better paying job.

The past year and a half I’ve become more and more depressed…..I just want to find a job that gives me purpose I feel like I’m going to be stuck in the restaurant industry the rest of my life……

I assumed it was just casual conversation about whether if I'm able to learn something or if I am having a difficulty or how am I finding the new work.

Option A is a sole contributor strategy level position (think product manager) with no direct reports responsible for KPI’s of product but no real authority. 

Option B is a leader of others and strategy of the divisions products. direct reports of 3, indirect of 20-30. 

Which would you think make the most sense for experience to keep growing towards a C-suite type role?

1dvhe5f,Interviewing for a job I don’t necessarily have the experience/qualifications for? Advice needed!,"Hey all,

I hope you are all doing well!

I am looking for some serious advice. I applied for a “Research Manager” position at my company that they recently posted and I got a call back to do an interview. However, I don’t really have the experience for the position. 

It’s not a scientific type “Research Manager” position, it’s a grant writing position where I would oversee a small team in securing grants for research projects. However, the job description also includes things like “Plans and coordinates research study protocol” and “plans, implements, and maintains data collection and analysis systems”. 

I have been working at the company for the past 2.5 years as an administrative assistant in a department. I was planning to go to school this fall, but I saw this position and it’s genuinely the type of work I would like to do. I’ve also been wanting a more rewarding and challenging position, and would love to move to a more senior role as I feel I’m ready for it (I have mentioned this to my boss).

The only thing is I don’t really have the experience I feel for this position. I have done grant writing, but I’ve only written two myself (which were successful) and I’ve helped my manager write/proof read a few grants and interim reports but that’s about it. I’m mainly a little hesitant on all the “research procedure” type stuff as I’ve never really don’t that before. I’m mainly wondering what my strategy should be for the interview? Should I flat out say I may not have the experience but I am very eager to learn and willing to put the work in? I’m not sure how to go about it. I’ve thought about withdrawing my application but the interview would be good experience. It’s a pretty niche organization so I imagine there are only probably 2-5 applicants they are interviewing (from what I’ve heard) including myself. They also want administrative experience as listed on the job description which might help in my favour. I’m also only 19 (will be 20 this year) which might be a negative.

Tl;Dr: how should I go about interviewing for a “research manager” position where the focus is grant writing but also including research-esque  protocols and procedures when I don’t have experience or much experience in that field?

Appreciate any help!",kilawnaa,1,1.0,1,1720127294,2024-07-04 21:08:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dvhe5f/interviewing_for_a_job_i_dont_necessarily_have/,7,2024

1dvgnll,Career advice for demotion,"A year ago I got promoted to a Director Level position from principal level position in my company. Honestly I wasn't prepared for it. The company was going through merger at that time and there were lot of cultural shift between two companies. Fast forward today, it's been one year and I don't think I am liking my position. I did not get any pay increase with my position due to some BS market condition reason even though my responsibilities has been increased to 10x. My manager was new to me at that time and I think I made the mistake accepting that position. My relationship with my manager who promoted me is just OK but definitely not good and some time bad as well. He has 0 empathy toward his direct reports and focus on company growth only and extremely hypocrite. He is definitely not a type of manager I want to work with. I think he brought that culture from previous company which was completely different than my current before the merger. 

Another reason why I am not liking my job is because of all the operational BS come with this role and I am finding any time to do my technical design and development which I am passionate about even though those skills are expected in my role as well.  I listened to my body and I am not happy for sure.  I have few choices and looking for suggestions.

 Option 1:  Ask my manager to down level me to principal engineer with current salary ( as I mentioned I didn't get salary increase). Yes, I understand it feels like demotion from Director level but at least I am finding mental peace not having to do all these BS operational work. I am not sure how this manager would take it as I don't have super good relationship with him.

Option 2: Coast this current position as much as I can and find the opportunity for IC role in another company with equal or higher salary.  PS: I am in the same company for 8 years now and I feel like stuck. My worry in this option is I have start fresh in new company and I have growing family of 3 years old and 7 years old. 

Option 3: Ask for demotion to principal engineer and look for another opportunity in different company.

I am also confused whether I should pursue management opportunity in my career or work as an IC. I really have bad experience with management with this company and I have a fear that I would find the same in next company.

1dvgj8r,I don’t want to go to college but don’t know what to do.,"I’m finishing high school soon and have no idea what I want to do for a career. I’ve never been a fan of school, classrooms, and learning, and don’t want to spend another 4 years in college after 12 years of school. School makes me incredibly anxious and by the end of the day, I don’t even remember what I learned. After Covid, and sitting at home during quarantine, I got really bad anxiety, and just sitting in a classroom gave me a panic attack. After this, I especially don’t enjoy school, and I feel like people don’t understand exactly how I feel. Everyone tells me that I need to go to college, and sometimes it makes me feel like I won’t be successful without it. Since I don’t want to go to college, I feel like I would be going for someone else and not myself. I would much rather work than learn, and not for money, I just find work more interesting. I’ve been thinking of going to trade school or opening some sort of business, but I don’t know what is profitable nowadays, and opening a business frightens me. When I talk about not going to college, some people think I’m lazy. I just don’t find joy in learning things I’m not interested in, let alone things I don’t need for my career. I don’t plan on being a doctor, lawyer, engineer, teacher, etc, and I wouldn’t go to community college just to sit for 2 years not knowing what to do next.

1dvetkc,Career advice for a 28 year old?,"Heya Reddit 👋

I'm at a bit of a crossroads in my career and would love some advice. I'm currently an Operations Specialist at a company, which basically means I wear a lot of hats.

What I currently do:
- HR: Planning employee engagement activities, recruiting & hiring, onboarding, managing insurance & benefits.
- Finance: Handling payroll & expense claims, creating cyclical reports & yearly budgets (no accounting though, we have an external pro for that!).
- Internal Systems Improvement: This is where I thrive. ✨️ I automate processes with Google Sheets, built our knowledge management hub, and love finding new tools like Zapier & Asana to streamline workflows. I'm also a Salesforce admin and Google Drive guru in the team.  

While I enjoy the variety, I feel like I'm spreading myself thin. I'm alright at HR, but it's not my passion. On the other hand, diving deeper into finance seems like a whole new career path requiring certifications (CPA and the works) that I'm not interested in unless it involves process improvement.

I genuinely enjoy systems and process improvement.  I want to use my skills to help teams work smarter, not harder.  Here's the thing: I'm not sure what kind of jobs exist for this niche, or if there are specific courses to specialize in.

Here are some specific questions I have:

- What kind of job titles should I be looking for that focus on systems & process improvement?
- Are there any relevant certifications or courses I can take to deepen my expertise?
- How can I leverage my current experience to transition into a more specialized role focused on systems improvement?

But really, any advice would be greatly appreciated. 😅

Thanks in advance for any guidance!

I ran training & leadership dev’t programs as an AVP and Sr Director for years. 15+ years ago I became an individual contributor (IC). I was good at managing & mentoring people, had a great rep for feeding future mgt pipeline, etc. but that time of my life was done— and IC is heavenly!

I’ve been at current company 5 years as IC/WFH. A few months ago, I was assigned a fully remote early-career team halfway across the planet and got zero notice 🙄. Opened up dusty bag of management tricks, it’s fine tho I miss IC and got no raise.

The consulting company running the mentor program is now after me to register. Besides now classified as a ‘people manager’, I also tick a lot of boxes they need to show diversity in that program. I just want to be left alone. Taking on the team was one thing, I do not want to further stretch my 60+ hrs/week.

Plus, there’s a whole series of classes and workshops, coaching the coaches by the obscenely highly paid consultants, mentor circles to peer mentor fellow mentors, ad nauseam, that’s part of the program.

It is also expected by exec leadership that you do it when asked because it’s an honor. Blech. I’ve heard it affects reviews & raises if you don’t for not being a team player.

I never want to be director-level or higher ever again, zero desire for career advancement at this stage — I stopped mentioning that because it confuses people that anyone would have no desire to  (re)climb the ladder.

1dv98sd,24 unemployed. Quitted toxic workplace without a new offer. No idea what to do next. ,"Hi everyone, I recently quitted my job as a MKT executive for a startup company bc I couldnt take the toxic workplace anymore. After chasing the money for over 1 year in that job, I couldn't take it anymore and decided to quit without finding a new place. 

 A little bit of context about my last job, it mostly online/hybrid and the salary was pretty good for my Junior position, but at the same time the company wasnt rlly functioning. The company has less than 10 ppl, no actual department at all and MKT is often assigned Sales and Bus Dev tasks, sales eventually became our main tasks bc the company was struggling financially. I was doing okay, closed a few sale deals (eventho I hate sales) and was just doing a few very basic MKT tasks. After a few months, bosses were super toxic and only focused on Sales, no actual management and no opportunity to upskill either, so I decided to quit before it was too late. Beforr quitting, I gained little MKT skills, which was what I liked to do and major in, and ended up doing sales or BD tasks that were mainly to make higher management happy.

After quitting, the biggest problem I'm facing right now is that I suddenly feel so lost in life, I've no idea if I should pursue a new job in Marketing or in a different field (i.e. I was looking at Education). At the moment, I've lost interest in everything and everytime I think about applying for a new job I'm just so scared of meeting shitty bosses again... I know I have to move on and find a new job, but my mind is pretry fried and numbed at the moment :((

I have some saving and living with my parents so I can still go on unemployed for another few months but sometimes, I cant help but feeling like Im falling behind with my peers. Im considering different routes: 
1. Learning a new language and becoming Support Executive/ Customer Service/ Executive Assisstant/Travel Support
2. Learning a teaching certificate and try to step foot into being a teaching assisstant for small kids (I live in a SEA country and there are a lot of academic institution for children)
3. Finding a new job in MKT field, the current market these days will highly offer offline with a much lowe salary range than my prev job
4. Interning for free or at a very very low salary in  nicher field in MKT (ie ad operation - which I had zero experience in the past)

I have over 10 years of FMLA, short-term disability, long-term disability claims management experience along with three years of sourcing/recruiting experience as well. My main interest is possibly transitioning into an HR benefits role or possibly compensation role. I am currently in the process of completing my HR management certification through the university of Phoenix so I’m just looking for any advice that anyone may have in regards to transitioning into the HR field I am even interested in any mentors.

Thank you in advance! ",Enough_Tie_5509,1,1.0,0,1720105356,2024-07-04 15:02:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dv90jv/advice_for_career_change/,7,2024
1dv901j,Career advice needed please NEBOSH,"Hi everyone apologies, this is my first post here, found myself in a bit of a dilemma recently and hoping for some sound impartial advice.

I had worked in retail for 25 years since the age of 16 before being made redundant last year due to the company going Into administration then liquidated. I held a reasonably senior position in the business and had many experiences over my career including area management secondments and health and safety roles within the business. Due to the companies' ongoing difficulties, my secondments were usually cut short or the business restructured so that the roles were no longer part of the organisation. When I was made redundant, I found myself short of realistic career path options due to not having held permanent positions in the field I was looking to get into our any formal health and safety qualifications other than a lower level IOSHH certificate.

I was lucky to find a job with another retail company as an Implementation manager and have been there for 8 months, with some success. I have enjoyed it, although the work is demanding due to the level of investment the business is undergoing, working 6.5 days a week and staying away from home for at least 4. They matched my previous salary and gave me a company car and on paper it is a really great opportunity, however despite managing my own time and flexibility it's eating a fair bit of my personal life up as well as being a fixed term contract til October next year. I am currently working Friday to weds most weeks with Thursday as my only rest day which I tend to do admin.

I was contacted recently by a previous colleague of my former employer who I worked with on the health and safety committee. They are now the director of a  high perdoming property maintenance and construction firm and have offered me the role of Health and safety operations manager with matched salary and benefits as I currently have and the promise of Full NEbosh diploma lv 6 tuition paid for and additional industry specific qualifications such as NEbosh construction, fire safety and SMSTS courses included. 2 days a week at college, 1 day in the office and 2 days field based. Most weekends off.

I spoke to my current employer to be transparent and they have counter offered by telling me they will increase my salary by 3k (I am already paid 5k more than my peers due to salary matching when I joined), make my contract with the business permanent and also pay for a NEbosh diploma with the succession plan to become a health and safety officer within the business when my current term ends in October. They have made it clear they want me to stay with the business and will also agree to 1 day at college and for me to take most weekends off as I see fit (manage my own schedule) which is a nice sentiment, however I'm not sure how realistic it will be.

Obviously both offers are very appealing to me and would allow me to gain a qualification on paper to use in the future outside of retail. The construction company director has already hired a team of two to work for me including some of my other former colleagues. I get on very well with my current team however there is some friction within the business around our project and how it affects store level so I have to deal with a fair few challenges and mud sligning on a daily basis.

Just looking for some advice and some things to consider as to whether to jump to a new opportunity and industry now (I have only held one job before this one for 25 years so jumping ship doesn't come naturally to me) or to stick with my current employer knowing they are pushing the boat out going way above what they usually do.

Any comments will help

 B.S in Health Science 
GPA: 3.85

Rad Tech: 
I have already completed all the pre reqs for the program. I only need to take the TEAS exam. And, the tuition is only $3,000 per semester for the two year program which is only 20 min drive away. 

PA:
I have to retake A&P 1 and 2 since they expired along with Gen chemistry 2 and biochemistry. I have to get a healthcare job to gather experience. Tuition for some programs range from 50k to 120k. 

I am already 28 yrs old. I live in NY so I want to be able to make good money to live comfortably and have good work/life balance. I know with rad tech, you can branch out into different modalities that can increase your salary. I think I have a higher chance of getting into the rad tech program but being a PA just sounds more lucrative and prestigious. I just don’t know tbh.

1dv86s0,Middle aged feeling like my degree is useless ,I'm 45 and I have a degree in sociology. One of the problems with getting a degree like that is it's all critical thinking and analysis and zero hard skills like using Microsoft office. I didn't graduate college until my early 40s. There's no way I'll get a job outside of retail competing with people who have degrees who gave them more practical skills. I want to learn these skills and maybe even get some certifications so I can have a job where I sit at a desk. I don't know if I should go to community college and get an additional associates in basic computer tech or maybe to a vocational school or go to some kind of private class for certs thing and how do I know if one is a scam or something.

My boss has always said that I can leave when my work is finished and also told me the days before the holiday we weren’t expected to work the whole day like we normally do. 

I left around 1:30 yesterday, I was the only person in the day before the holiday. This morning I woke up to the information that a fridge had gone down.  When my boss told me she asked what time I left and why I left at that time. When I told her what she had previously told me she never said that. 

The company I work for gets very tight about these things and a report is going to be written up about the scenario and I’m sure me leaving early will be in there. If anything comes up about me leaving early I don’t want to throw her under the bus, in terms of me telling someone she told me I could leave early but I don’t take a knock either.

1dv67ae,Transitioning from HR in Turkey to HR in the USA: Seeking Advice,"Hello everyone,

I am planning to relocate to the USA in two years, as my husband will have a work permit, which I believe exempts me from needing a separate work visa. Currently, I work as an HR Generalist in Turkey, and I’m considering my career path in the USA.

My main question is: How important will my work experience in Turkey be when applying for HR positions in the USA? Alternatively, would pursuing a master’s degree in Organizational Psychology enhance my prospects more?

To provide some context, I have two options to consider for the next two years:

1- Completing a Master’s in Organizational Psychology at METU while working part-time  at my current company (relatively a young company in construction)

2- Taking a high-paying entry HR role at a large national defense company.

I’m weighing the potential career benefits and financial implications of both choices. The defense company might also offer only an internship program with lower pay, whereas my current company might provide a part-time salary based on my current wage.

I want to ensure I make the most strategic decision to enhance my competitiveness for HR roles in the USA. Your insights and advice on transitioning from a Turkish HR background to a US HR position would be greatly appreciated. What would be the optimal path to pursue to avoid unemployment when I arrive in the USA?

Thank you in advance for your guidance!",lunif3r,0,0.33000001311302185,0,1720097515,2024-07-04 12:51:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dv67ae/transitioning_from_hr_in_turkey_to_hr_in_the_usa/,7,2024
1dv4dfd,Is this job worth it? Does it have any future?,"Heya!

So I got an email saying I have been selected to participate in further phases of this job: [https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/invisibletech/jobs/4342711101](https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/invisibletech/jobs/4342711101)

Even at the low-end, this pays more than my current job. At the high-end, this will easily put me significantly above what most people make in my country (I'm not in the US - my cost of living is much lower).

However, will this be a good move for my career? Should I look at it broadly, or just go after the money I'll get in hand right now?  
  
I recently joined my current position as a Customer Success Lead in a Saas startup, with promises that I will be allowed to branch into other aspects of the company as per my wishes (since I am a generalist) with a boost in pay in 6 months.

I also have D2C and Operations Experience of about an year. But my total experience is less than 2 years combined.

So, do you guys think this job is dead end? Do you think I will ruin things if I leave my current job for this one?

I am in a field I studied a lot to get into, but when I graduated I couldn't get into an R&D capacity. I ended up in manufacturing. I hated it, I've always hated it, and I think the entire profession is a trap. I want my school to refund all the money and take the degree back, because retail was more technically challenging than this BS they call engineering. I've been out of school almost 10 years and I've yet to get to design anything. 

Every job I've had was both boring and unstable, fraught with layoffs and bankruptcies. I finally got to a place where there were some design aspects to the job and the place went under before I even got a chance.

1. How do I get to be at peace with the investment of so many years and so much money being utterly worthless? 

2. Are there other careers where I can do..... something? Anything at all. Financially speaking, I have to make some money, but there is leeway.

1dv0qwx,Help Advice Needed!!! Should I go with a Job Offer from Company A or B?,"Hello r/careeradvice 

This will be my second post on Reddit, and as a lurker posting should give a sense on how much I need your advice!

  
Background: I am working in Tech IT Server Hardware Sales as an Account Manager. I have 5-6 years of Tech Sales Experience starting out as an ISR for a famous VAR and now working at an offshore Taiwanese Server company. We compete agaisnt Server Solution providers such as Supermicro, Dell and HPE etc. I recently started this job during the start of this year, and during onboarding another competitor I've been applying for got back to me with the intention to finish our original interview process. In short, they decided to move forward with my candidacy and offer me the job! I have one week until the offer expires. I'm not sure which job to take. Please Help!

  
Company A (current):

* Title: Account Manager
* Salary: 80,000 USD base - Commission TBD. = Final Take Home 80,000
* Quota: \~10-15million
* Book of Business: Set book from warm leads handed down. Steady run-rate, good relatioship with customers. Minimal prospecting, more farming than hunting
* Customers: Enterprise Server Integrators, Appliance Companies, Broadcasting Companies.
* Hybrid - 3 days onsite, will soon change to 2 days onsite
* Culture: Asian Heirarchy, I report directly to the President of Sales
* Personal Thoughts: A smaller company of the two, with alot of potential to grow. My book of business is every sales candidate's dream. Easy pipeline, more like account managing to grow revenue. I feel like I can sit back and relax as customers have a steady run rate. Downside is I havent received commission since Q1 of this year, and I have been making my KPIs. In fact as of now, I am ranked 2 within the entire Sales Org of 6 people.

Company B (competitor):

* Title: Field Account Executive
* Salary: 100,000 USD base - 48,000 Commission = 148,000 OTE
* Quota: TBD
* Book of Business: One key account to manage, rest will be hunting which I'm trying to avoid.
* Customers: Cloud Service Providers
* Hybrid - 3 days onsite non-negotiable
* Culture: A bit more western and progressive. Unsure
* Personal Thoughts: NOW here is where this gets dicey. During the interview process... which took a bit over 12 months to finalize. Yes, dont worry to much about it. I'm thinking already a RED flag. Anyways, moving forward, during our final stage the Hiring Manager confirmed that I will get the job as I am their top candidate and will have an offer letter a week after meeting. At this time I told them that I have another pending offer with 160,000k OTE and this expires in a week. Both the HM and Recruiter confirmed ""on text"" that they will match that and will have the letter before. Fast forward a week, I received nothing and ultimately reject my 160,000K OTE offer as it expired. Dont ask why I didnt go with that offer. The NEXT DAY, Company B asks if I took the competitors offer and after disclosing that I rejected it, I get a text shortly after stating that HM/VP of sales has changed their original offer to 90,000K base + 20,000K commission = 110,000 OTE. THIS INFURIATED ME, as this is a classic bait and switch. In short, all trust and integrity with Company B is 0. After endless negotiations with the HM and back and forth letter of negotiation they decided to revise my Offer Letter to what it is now. r/careeradvice  Im basically afraid that if I take this offer, they will shortly let me go as both parties know that trust is 0 and Company B has shared that they see me of no value.

1dv0o22,"Great opportunity, Should I quit?","I’m type A. Enthusiastic learner but life just throws unique challenges at me I wanna jump of a cliff sometimes, but not really. 


I think I’m broken, maybe it’s the PTSD, ADHD, Anxiety. Idk 

Anyway I have a great job, just transitioning my career, I’m also back in school. 

I have a crush on my coworker. My coworker has a lot more seniority than me and is really smart which I think is his most admirable trait. Im female mid twenties and honestly don’t even know how old this guy is. He’s definitely 40+. Oh and he’s married. 

Morally I would never cross that line. lol I’m mentally crazy I wouldn’t add more shit to my plate. 

Looking at my job it’s a great opportunity, sometimes I still wonder why the hell I got hired. Schools is going great too. 

Only thing is my mental health really sucks and I’m not that fucking smart. I feel like I’ve double booked my self. I thought I could do it all but I’m learning very quickly that I can’t. I’m constantly overwhelmed feeling like I can’t just focus on 1 thing. I’m playing catch up. 

I always got away with seemingly being smart above average but my choice of career change is a bit more technical and take years of focus or maybe that’s just my adhd brain idk? 

Also me having a crush on a married man gives me a reason to hate myself everyday. I noticed I’m more self negative, like I fucking hate my guts how horrible am I. lol sounds ridiculously typing because I know is I didn’t do anything. But also I hate myself because I know deep down some part of me does want something. But I also know in reality it just never will. So why do I treat myself life crap. Or maybe I am crap

I’m sapiosexual I think. I wouldn’t even say I’m physically attracted to this man. It’s the intelligence that has me starstruck. 

Unique challenges I mentioned earlier right ?

One things for sure I’m sad. Great job but I’m just not myself anymore. I’m sad at how horrible I feel. And sad that I shouldn’t even be there and don’t really add much value anyway. 


All my friends say it’s stupid to quit. Just work less hours. But I know mentally even though I would like to I’ve never been a half ass person. I know I can’t give my all to school and the job. + shitty mental health situation. 

Being a type A, I know I need to just cut out the root and quit. 

But am I being stupid? Maybe I should work less hours and will get over the mental hurdle. Or maybe me knowing myself deep down I feel like it’s time to go and it’s def not healthy. 

But what if maybe it’ll get better and my anxiety is over exaggerating. 

My gut tells me. Don’t be greedy if it’s about money. It’s time to go. 

Logic tells me don’t be a dumb bitch and inconvenience yourself into struggling. You’re in a fucking amazing learning environment fuck your mental health. Kill yourself in your dreams if you want.

1dv0c2z,Help choosing a career?,"20 year old in Australia, final year of Bachelor of Psychology, have one more semester to go before I graduate and I have absolutely no idea on what I want to do and Im very stressed. I am very privileged to be able to live in this country and have various options to choose from but its giving me this overwhelming fear of uncertainty thus I am here seeking help. Before you guys ask why I chose psychology, I had a passion to work as a neuropsychologist but it is extremely competitive in Australia (Around 15 students accepted into the course) and I kinda lost my motivation to pursue it over the years.

All I know is that I want 2 things, Work Life Balance and high earning potential, I've considered Finance, IT, Property, Logistics, Law, Marketing and HR but I still have no clue what I want to do and I have until December to decide what postgrad degree/ masters I can do that would allow me to achieve my 2 goals. Please if anyone can provide any help on how I may be able to choose or differentiate between the degrees please let me know.

Stepping my foot into internships for these fields are also very difficult considering the degree I'm studying and the competitiveness.",Manav-Verma,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1720075315,2024-07-04 06:41:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dv0c2z/help_choosing_a_career/,7,2024
1dv06tk,Career/GCSE,"I have until this Friday to choose my GCSE and I want opinions.

I have currently chose Spanish, Drama, and Art.

I originally aimed to be an architect but I have gained a newfound love for Drama with even professionals pleading for be to become a scriptwriter. Problem is, as you know, the Drama world is concentrated in America and it would be harder for me (of African ethnicity) to become somewhat a high wage actor let alone a scriptwriter (it would be much harder to be a black scriptwriter than black actor).

This is why I’ve sort of fell back onto architecture as I love drawing but I definitely love Drama more but from not exactly the richest background, I do want to be making money. Not exactly billionaire rich but rich to where I don’t worry about struggling and being able to provide for a possible future family.

The question is are my GCSE’s valid (I have been considering changing Spanish for Product Design) and I just want some opinions and advice on how to become an architect or actor and where I’d make the most money, the best schools and countries to act or do architecture (my brothers would pay for me to go abroad) and the chances of becoming big, etc.",Kumotempest,1,1.0,13,1720074784,2024-07-04 06:33:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dv06tk/careergcse/,7,2024
1dv0632,Should I cancel a signed job contract because I've been offered another job with much higher pay?,"I am resigning from my current job at Company X and have already signed a one-year contract with Company Y.



Company X is smaller, while Company Y is larger. Both are contracting companies with office jobs. The workload at Company Y will be about five times greater than at Company X, but the pay increase is less than 10%. I resigned from Company X because the work environment was very uncomfortable, even though the pay and workload were balanced. I'm not sure if Company Y's environment will be comfortable, but I want to try something new.



Currently, I am serving my notice period at Company X and will join Company Y in one week. However, I received a job offer from another large company, Company Z, with a pay increase of over 50% compared to Company Y. The job at Company Z is also an office role but in a very remote area with no entertainment options like in big cities. After the interview with Company Z, they told me they can give me up to 10 weeks to join them.



I have four options to consider:



1. Reject Company Z's offer and honor my contract with Company Y for the full year. This would prevent any blacklisting from Company Y since I would fulfill the entire contract. I am concerned about being blacklisted by Company Y if I cancel my signed contract, as I might want to apply to Company Y for career advancement in the future. Company Y is one of the largest companies in my industry, while Company Z, though large, is a client company and not a contractor.



2. Cancel the contract with Company Y and join Company Z right away. The pay at Company Z is significantly higher, but the remote location might offset the benefits. This option would likely result in being blacklisted by Company Y, which I want to avoid because Company Y offers more pay potential in the future once I gain more experience at Company Z or other companies.



3. In the interview with Company Z, I told them that I can join in 17 weeks at the earliest, allowing me to work at Company Y for 3-4 months without canceling the contract before even starting. I thought 3-4 months might be enough to avoid any blacklisting from Company Y. My contract with Company Y states I can resign with an approved one-month notice, but if it’s not approved, I need to pay a penalty. However, Company Z might not be willing to wait 17 weeks.



4. After the interview with Company Z, they said that they can only give me 10 weeks to join. This only allows me to work at Company Y for two months first, which would be enough for the notice period. However, there is a risk of being blacklisted from Company Y because two months is a very short time, and Company Y would be wasting resources training me as a new employee only for me to quit right away. Company Z suggested I ask HR at Company Y whether I should cancel the contract or work for two months first, but I don’t want to risk damaging my relationship with Company Y right away by asking this. Should I ask HR at Company Y about this and tell them about Company Z's offer? Or should I start working at Company Y without any notice about my plan to quit after two months? This is risky because it means committing to Company Z despite not having notice approval from Company Y. If the notice period is rejected by Company Y, I would need to pay a significant penalty.



Right now, I am leaning towards option 3, so I don’t fully reject Company Z but inform them that I want to join them later. I still need more time at Company Y to be useful there and prevent blacklisting. I plan to tell Company Z that I can’t join in 10 weeks but might be available after 17 weeks, just as I told them during the interview. This will probably mean that Company Z will let me go entirely, or actually keeping me in mind if a similar position is available. Alternatively, is option 2 better for my future just because the pay is higher? Please help.

1duyyqd,Struggling with Development Manager's Ego in a Small SaaS Company - Need Advice,"I joined a payment SaaS company a few months ago, and I’ve encountered some significant challenges. The company is transitioning from a sales-led to a product-led approach. During my tenure, I identified that we need to completely redesign our core product, as we're moving from reselling software to launching our own in the market.

Here’s a bit of background:

* I'm the first product hire, with extensive experience in structured environments at large enterprises.
* I have a project manager and design/dev interns working under me (remote, north america), delivering a redesigned product.
* The team is split between onsite members and an offsite team in India.

The crux of the issue is our Development Manager. He has an inflated ego, provides no clear deadlines or timelines, and gets tries to confuse people and get them lost in technical jargon without offering proper explanations or documentation (Only thing we have is JIRA). Despite creating user stories and a working prototype for the redesigned app (which is only missing a few workflows), he claims he can't give a timeline or start working on it until it's 100% complete.

Our organization is small, with about 50 employees and some sales folks. The Development Manager has been with the company for over 5 years but hasn’t produced anything significant. The previous approach was reactive, based on directives from the company owners. Now, as the product manager, I’ve introduced a strategy and prioritization, but progress is stalled due to his reluctance.

The Development Manager insists on all communication going through him, preventing me from speaking directly to his team. Others have also complained about him, but as the first product manager, I have greater visibility into the issues. I've escalated the situation to my manager, who is the company president, but he lacks decisive action and isn't supportive of having an onsite dev team, which is crucial since we work onsite 5 days a week.

I'm eager to deliver on my responsibilities, but the bottleneck at the development stage is hindering progress. I’ve tried multiple times to reach an agreement with the Development Manager, but it seems he’s more focused on protecting his position rather than collaborating effectively.

I’m looking for advice on how to navigate this situation. How can I better manage this Development Manager and ensure the successful delivery of our product? Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!",lustlovelust,1,1.0,0,1720070226,2024-07-04 05:17:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1duyyqd/struggling_with_development_managers_ego_in_a/,7,2024

I work in a department separate of his but my workspace trailer is directly across from his space of work. It started when I went outside with a different coworker to check out some stuff the electricians were talking about (the electricity went out and a lot of stuff in the back was melted) on our way back around inside our trailer the guy, we’ll call him X, came over and asked what brought us back there since that’s the Xs workspace and I made a joke and said “just hard work out here” (sarcastic bc I work in the office) and he told me “you make this place look pretty”. At first I didn’t do anything I just kind of ignored it. But later he came into the office again and came to my desk with his hand out, I thought maybe he was shaking my hand or something but he pulled my hand in and said “want to dance?” I was kind of uncomfortable it’s like 8:00 AM in the office like what?? but I just said “no I don’t dance I’m not good at it” and just kind of laughed it off. The final incident was when a coworker got a call that I was called to Xs office. I asked if they said why since I never went over there and there wasn’t a reason. When I got there he had a photo of me pulled up on his computer from a company event and was saying things like “I knew you were beautiful but damn” and “if I were you I would print this and keep this on my nightstand” and when i asked if he needed anything else, that was it. it was scary because I was alone with him, he called me over and got me in a position that could’ve been bad. Well I told my bosses and today I had to talk to a lawyer and HR. After telling them everything the lawyer said “nothing that I have heard seems to make it impossible to move forward” and “ we will talk to X and make sure this never happens again, but I am optimistic that you and X can continue to have a healthy workplace relationship in the future” this shocked me and I kind of locked up. Another important note is that another female coworker said that he asked her about me and she could see him looking at me walk to the job trailer through the window in his work space. I felt like this was taken lightly. I don’t want to work where I feel like I’m peeing preyed on or gawked at.

1duxom5,Feeling pretty lost about what choice to make. Stay with my company or go for less pay while being treated better?,"Hey there my name is Laura, I am a 36 year old Medical equipment sales professional from Arizona.
I have been in the same field for 6 years. 
When I first started I instantly excelled and was a top equipment sales agent. 
When I first started I was treated well, praised, promoted to management. 
Then the pandemic hit and my position was eliminated and I went back to being a sales rep. 
They had me rebuild a different dept in the company whilst promising to give me my management title back- but didn’t. (At this point I have no desire to do management but it was definitely betrayal back then to dangle a carrot in front of me that they had no intention of giving me….for monthsss)  

I am one of their top agents and make 6 figures so it’s hard to complain and I am trying to be grateful that I have a job but what I don’t appreciate is the mind games, being put down/talked down to. My head boss is pretty verbally abusive towards me and puts me down, the highlight is I don’t have to see him often since I mostly interact with my supervisor. 


This is my question:
I was offered a position at a competitor company, the only thing is…it pays much less than my current company.

I keep going back and forth that for the sake of mental health I should never work for people like that at my current company but at the same time…..
I have responsibilities and I don’t know if It’s better to go to a different company with less pay but treated better.
And I could go to the other company and have someone treat me poorly there.


Sometimes I think it’s about choosing your hard.
Working for a jerk of a boss who plays with me, hard- but working a job that doesn’t pay well would also be hard

1duxjvs,Feeling Lost in My Career Path: Will I Ever Find My Way Back?,"Hi everyone,

I’m feeling quite lost and could really use some advice and support. After being laid off and making a career switch, I find myself stuck and uncertain about my future. The real question that haunts me is: will I ever be able to get back into my field and find purpose in my career again?

I spent about five years in tech roles working in laboratories before transitioning into sales and client-facing positions. I made this switch four years before my layoff, so I have four years of experience in client-facing environments. Despite my efforts to progress in these roles, I feel like I’m still too new to truly establish myself, especially in such a tough job market. This constant struggle leaves me feeling like I’m a problematic employee and a terrible human being.

I’m a 32-year-old woman who feels washed up. I don’t want kids, and here I am, working a low-paying job despite having a master’s in business and a bachelor’s in a STEM field. I’ve been told by older people how useless I am and how foolish my investments were. I used to make over $120,000 a year before I got laid off, so I know my education isn’t useless. I think I’m just in challenging times.

But still, I feel like a washed-up millennial, like one of those losers we used to see on TV who never got their lives together. It seems like many of us are trying to get our lives together, but there’s nothing to show for our hard work. Are we all going through this? Are we all depressed about it? We tried to make something of ourselves, and now it feels like we’re not being given any opportunities. Are we all just washed up?

I question whether I’ll ever be able to return to my field, and if I do, how to make it work this time. I’m seeking any advice or guidance on where to go from here. How do I navigate this career limbo and find a path that brings me fulfillment and stability?

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Your insights and encouragement would mean the world to me.

I beg her to use her sick days, but she always says she can't because they are too understaffed. she has a decent upper management boss, it's not him that's making her feel like she'll get disciplinary action or like shamed, it's mostly just complaining coworkers, and the fact that she is imposing that standard on herself and putting this job before her health.

she's been there nearly 20 years, is a department manager, and there are brand new workers (at some type of equivalent or lower supervisory level) getting hired with wages $2-3 more than her. she just doesn't complain, and doesn't advocate for herself. it just makes me so upset how much of her life she's dedicated to this job, and not been fairly compensated for it. 

I was thinking today if I could call her boss and ask if she could advocate for a raise for herself (she won't initiate asking, so I just want to get details to empower her), or I want to at least confirm her sick time will be paid out to her when she retires. I don't know how raises typically work at grocery stores - would raises be given if she argues COLAs or merit? I'm fairly certain no union. She doesn't get yearly raises, I don't even know when her last one was but I know her rate has only gone up maybe $10 since 2006. 

sorry this is a little ranty, but I just want to know if anyone has advice so she at least is paid a fraction of her worth.

1duvldf,My boss hates the people I hire and she shows it ,"My boss has really high standards and has hated 2 of the last 3 people I hired.

I involve her in the interviews and we both agree on the hire before extending the offer. Both times she’s basically decided within two weeks that they’re not cutting it. She starts to sprinkle in comments to her boss and it becomes mini campaigns against these new people and in some ways I feel like they never got a fair shot.

One of these hires took the bait and went a little crazy due to her nitpicking and ended up getting fired after a few warnings for bad behavior. Part of me wonders if he could have been great in a better environment.

This new hire seems incredible stressed with the pressure she’s under due the job requirements. My boss, seeing the stress, has zero empathy and drills into her, critiquing and giving way too direct of feedback. I give the same feedback in a softer way where I don’t worry that I’ve ruined a perfectly nice persons day.  

My boss’ comment afterward is “I think she’s going to quit and she should”. My boss thinks this lady totally oversold herself for the job she’s in… while I agree, I’m willing to get stuck with her for a while and I don’t necessarily want another hire-failure under my belt within 6 months of the last.

1duv4vy,"I’m really bored staying at home, what to do?","So, I am 19, and I have been at home for the last six months. I graduated high school in 2023 and started school in engineering. I lasted a semester even though I was smart in high school, got engineering prerequisites done just for engineering, took advanced classes in high school just for the dream of becoming an engineer. 

I took a semester off after that one to figure out what to do. Doing that made it even worst since I stayed at home and played video games for four months straight. I started my commerce degree in the spring term, after taking those classes, they felt so easy like I was in kindergarten. Although I didn’t go to classes cause I felt it was useless. 

Right now I am doing online classes for summer term. I feel like I am so useless and lazy. I can’t even get up to apply for one job, although I clean the house and do dishes so parents don’t have to.

Also, since I left engineering, now in b.comm, I just researched so much straight for 8 months. Every time I come back to commerce feeling that it’s the only right degree for me.

Now back to the actual topic which is what should I do, I’m so lost everyday, all I do is play video games consistently the same game, the same song while playing it.

1duungs,Switch to RTVF major or stick with communications?,"I've been in college for the past 5 years. The past two l've just been taking one or two classes a semester because of the uncertainty l've had with college. My first major was Creative Media Industries but i panicked and switched it to psychology then to marketing and comms because I wanted to graduate on time but now l'm still in college and still have 1.5 years left to graduate. HOWEVER, my passion still lies in content creation and videography. l've done it my whole life. Problem is that if I switch to RTVF, it will most likely be THREE years before I can graduate. I will be around 25-26. I really feel like I might be missing out on the RTVF major if I don't do it but I'm so scared about being in school for so much longer.

1duueeh,I will be graduating from my bachelors degree when I’m 28 - will I be at a disadvantage when applying for a serious job? Science field.,"I’m 25 and finishing the second year of my studies. I started university late - around 21. The reason I was so late is from childhood/teen trauma, with my dad leaving when I was about 15/16. Ever since then I can’t seem to take my academic life seriously. I left school for a few years and went back to finish it. Did well enough in high school to get into the degree I wanted which was a bachelors in science. 

I was thrilled at first but got demotivated very quickly. I thought I would be at an advantage for my age and experience. But I ended up failing that year and repeating it. 

I have a history of depression and self-harming but I stopped that prior to starting university. But over the years I’ve noticed a rapid increase in depressive traits in my behaviour and mentality. I would be physically, mentally and emotionally drained all the time. No matter how much sleep I got -I would be tired and it was a challenge to be productive. I couldn’t study for long periods of time and my concentration and focus would shift constantly. 

I would skip lectures regularly and struggled to complete assignments on time. I would procrastinate a lot - and it turned into a bad habit. As if I wasn’t demotivated enough, from these habits of course my grades would plummet and I’d get demotivated even more - it was a cycle of constantly breaking down my self esteem. I rather did things that made me a bit happier and put me at peace than the actual work I needed to do. 

I started second year, and things got worse. My grades got worse, my procrastination got worse, my exhaustion was constant, during the school year I was living and breathing exhaustion. I ended up failing that year too and I repeated again. 

So now I’m on a repeat year, and I have several resit exams to do next month which feels like my last chance and about 5k of fees to pay for repeating. I’ve been working part time to pay it off. 

Sorry for going off track a bit - but needed to let that out since I can be anonymous here. But going back to my question, with my history of repeating in university and graduating at 28 - will I be at a severe disadvantage or struggle when applying for work in my field?

Thanks

1dutwe3,I messed up my resume by flip flopping between marketing and sales. Now after being laid off so many times I think I need a brand new career altogether (remote),"I feel like I flunked out of my career. Many people I worked with as peers have reached VP status by now. I’ve been laid off 3 times in 2 years and my resume is a mess. 

I’ve sold advertising, worked in culture and even marketing for major CPG brands like Jägermeister. I launched VICE’s first CPG product (which looked cool but the product failed.)

In 2022 I did 130 job interviews, of which only 2 led to offers. Both offers were below what I was accustomed to being paid and both laid me off 3 months into the positions. 

I recognize that I am making this slightly more difficult for myself because I am staunchly against working in an office. But much of my career has been remote, since long before the pandemic ever happened. 

I launched a small business to try to avoid working for people, and it’s still operating but I just don’t make enough money to live. 

If anyone has suggestions on good paying remote jobs, I am all ears. I have scoured the job boards and I’m still applying but it’s very demoralizing and seems like a waste of time. I don’t even care if my future work leverages my past experience. I just want to make money and avoid offices. I’ll do pretty much anything.

I was already nervous and i rambled like an idiot. In hindsight if only my mind was calm, i couldve answered it. Its not even a tough question but because it was specific, i was caught offguard kind of.

1dusm9a,Looking at a career switch,"I currently work in customer service at a major telecommunications company.  It's great pay and benefits but there isn't any real growth potential.  

I have my BA in business administration and an MBA with an HR concentration.  I graduated with my undergrad degree in July 2009 and then went onto my MBA right after and graduated with my MBA that following November 2010.  

I have a lot of customer service/sales experience dealing high call volume in an inbound call center setting.  I also have customer service skills that are more along the lines of dealing with customers in manufacturing.  Basically I was the go between the factory that I worked for and the customers purchasing parts, etc from my factory.  I have knowledge of quoting, ordering (i've used SAP and JD Edwards in the past).  After ordering parts, I got the shipment/transportation ready and set up and then did invoices.   

I dont have a ton of experience outside of customer service and sales therefore I am having a really tough time trying to find something that I can grow from.  

I have recently tried to get into claims because you can work your way up in claims as you gain  knowledge/experience and work my way up from there but I am having a difficult time finding a company that will give me a chance.  I dont have my license yet but I am a quick learner.  

Aside from claims, I am uncertain of what else I can do with my education and experience to switch fields.  I live in Iowa.  I dont want to move.  I am open to remote work as I am doing remote work now but I would like something a little more fulfilling but I also don't want to start at $15.00 an hour making the change.

Sorry, I know that seems like a lot to ask and maybe I am expecting too much but this is why I am asking for advice.  I am trying to look at other options for careers that doesn't have to deal with sales.  I am not opposed to customer service but I guess I would like it where it's not in the type of it being a back to back billing question type thing but more task oriented which is why I thought claims might be a good option.  

Any insight?  Please try to reframe from being too harsh.  I am not expecting to start a new career at top pay but I also can't afford to just make $15.00 an hour.

1duq1rf,Big4 Irish firm moving to 3 days in office ,"Hi all - looking a bit of advice please. 

I (M early 30s) am working for a big 4 firm in Dublin for over 2 years now. I was employed on the basis that 1 day per week was fine in office as I live 2 - 2.5hrs drive away, about 110mile / 170km each way. The train is about 3hrs door to door so I usually don’t opt for it as it’s €35 day return so not too much lower in cost for half a tank of diesel to get me up and down for the day, as the train is 40 mins away and not on the same route I’d drive. 

They announced this week that they are moving to a “more formal” 3 days in office. It doesn’t appear to be mandated. The only repercussions stated and confirmed by HR to me are that “bonus/reward, performance, and promotion/progression” will be affected for anyone who doesn’t move to this and conversations will be had. 

I’ve nothing against it to be honest, that’s fair enough and I can see the pros and cons of both sides of the argument. I’m not on here to get into the whole WFH/traditional office debate. 

Upto now we had hybrid plans, where a few others from say cork, or mayo that were far away like myself could operate on a hybrid plan where it was agreed with manager where every other week / once a week would be ok if they went to a regional office. As my closest regional office is in Northern Ireland this was never an option as it’s the Uk arm of the global firm. 

I’m in the office tomorrow to fulfil my one day per week and I’ve arranged an informal chat with my director and partner. They’ve been sound enough to me all along but they’ve remained very tight lipped this week when I pressed them on a virtual call about it. Their hands may be tied I suspect. 

I’m thinking it’s a flex of muscle, and ultimately can they really sack us? I’m not anticipating anything too drastic unless further guidance is given before 1 September. It doesn’t suggest this, it just spells out to me that you won’t be given a pay rise or much of one each year, won’t be considered for promotions and will be cast as a bit of a black sheep?

On that, funnily enough, I received a great bonus last year, but last month my annual bonus was slashed in half, and pay barely went up. Someone has also been recruited in to do the same job as me but in a junior role. Maybe I’m paranoid but it almost feels like the higher up partner knew about the upcoming change in office attendance this is all a backup in case I was to jump. I was told before I entered the big 4 that everyone is maybe nice to your face but they knife you in the back, whereas construction is up front you say what you think. 

When I heard the news Monday I was tempted to scramble to indeed / LinkedIn to apply for jobs, but I’ve calmed now and I’m of the opinion “hey, I’m not going anywhere, I’ll take my salary and I’ll do my 1 day, if you aren’t happy about that then do something further”? 

I’m on great terms with everyone in work but for instance today there was a senior manager and above call and I was the only one of 12 on it remotely, it’s hard not to feel a bit isolated when everyone else lives a lot closer to the office. 

It’s hard for me to get the same money elsewhere outside of Dublin, certainly not closer to home. And if I did I’d have to attend an office 3 days per week in Dublin anyway. 
I come from a construction consultancy background, sometimes in construction you’d see where a firm would pay for accommodation or a fuel card for employees - I doubt this is even worth asking for in a big 4 firm. 
Maybe that’s the best I could hope for is move back to construction and do 2 days per week with a firm, but in the hope they’d cover my fuel expenses and/or to stay over one night per week. 
I could ask for an increase in salary to cover the fuel or staging over a night in my conversation tomorrow - but I don’t know if it’s just me - it doesn’t feel the same, it’s like you’re spending your own earned money to pay for accom and commuting to work! Especially when it’s long distances. 

I don’t mind the job at all but I don’t love it. It’s probably a routine thing but in the last year I’ve grown to really hate going to Dublin even though it’s only one day - a lot of people would probably kill for that. The corporate red tape and endless amount of after work social events are draining , I was never in a big 4 / financial services before this and meetings filling your calendar that have nothing to do with you are growing tiresome. My manager is very easy to get on with but he’s not great at progressing you and never ever has a bad word to say even when I know I haven’t performed a task well which is odd. Maybe it’s just me coming from construction where it’s all thrown out on the table in meetings. 

Many thanks in advance. It’s been annoying me all week and I’m not sure whether to start looking for something else or just stay put. My wife and I are recently married and hoping to start a family in the next year so that’s on my mind too, I’d like to be settled. 

I don’t mean to come across as entitled so sorry if it appears that way. I’m open to hearing all sides of the debate. ",BrotherMore6592,2,0.75,0,1720042772,2024-07-03 21:39:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1duq1rf/big4_irish_firm_moving_to_3_days_in_office/,7,2024
1dupyqj,"First career job out of graduation, is this normal? ","I started a job a little over a year ago in graphic design in a marketing agency and very quickly moved my way to a management position due to my great work and how much clients love me. But I’ve only been given a 3% raise on my already low hourly pay. I’m well below what my friends are making out of school. The company said they haven’t had someone like me come in and that I’m doing well so they’ve piled so much work on me that I’m commonly working until 8 or 9pm at night. I work remotely and I have to start at 7am. We only get overtime after 40 hours not after certain daily hours worked and I’m told to stop working once I hit 40 hours usually but now I’m being told to go into overtime to get the work done and I’m completely fried. 

Ive gotten to a point where im so over worked and there’s so much work that it would be impossible to get it all done so I told my boss and they brought in a couple designers that can just help with bits and pieces but im still left with the full projects most of the time as everyone at the company doesn’t have the skills I do unfortunately to really help me. 

My boss completely acknowledged how much work I have and how burnt out I am and how they’re trying to get me help while also piling on one more incredibly large project on my plate this morning. I’m now being told I have to check in with my boss every morning when I log on because someone told my boss I was logging on late but I’m logging on late due to the sheer exhaustion from how much and how late I’m working. I don’t feel like this is really fair. 

How should I go about this? I was thinking about setting my cut off hours to just be 8 hours a day and that’s the amount of work done I get in that timeframe but I’m afraid they’re going to fire me if I set that boundary. I don’t know.

I (21m) applied for a job a few weeks ago and was offered the position. My current job is draining my energy due to lack of other employees, lack of leadership and growth opportunities in similar departments. Anyways, I applied for a great job that would pay a lot more a year not including potential bonuses and seems like a great next building block for my career! Here’s the catch - I hate my career path. I’ve done extremely well in my field and have a great understanding in what I do. I am just not happy. I stay here currently because it’s full time remote, and it pays decent. The reason I am having a hard time is because I can almost confidently say I am not happy in this field and I feel like I still have time to truly find what I can enjoy.

1duppsp,"Job asking me to work abroad for 3 weeks, dreading going","So I hate myself for feeling like this but I’ve been given the opportunity to travel abroad to work at another office in my company for 3 weeks next month. It’s in Europe and I’ve never even left my city in NA before so this is a huge shift for me. It would also be a solo work trip, no one in my team is going with me and I know no one there.

Problem is I’ve never travelled before and… don’t really want to go. 3 weeks is a long time imo from having no travel experience at all, especially alone, in such a drastically different place. I’m also pretty introverted, I don’t go out much and am pretty comfortable at home. I don’t even go to the office nearby because I prefer WFH.

I also don’t really care for my job anymore. I’ve worked here a couple years and I don’t really like what I do and am looking to get out and look for other opportunities. I’m already applying to other places. I’m paid a fairly low wage.

So yeah, pretty much everything in me is telling them I’m not interested and instead focusing my time on finding another job. But everyone I’ve asked about it is telling me I’d be making a huge mistake. I get it’s a whole life experience/get out of your shell/ once in a lifetime kind of thing. But I’m absolutely dreading it now and feel like it’s pushing me further into a job I’m trying to leave.

Am I fucked up to feel like this?

1dupc8s,Do I accept a FAANG contract or a regular position at a lesser known company doing the same thing?,"It sounds like I’d basically be doing the same thing for both jobs. I’ve already accepted the contract position for the FAANG, but it doesn’t start until two weeks from now. 

Pros of FAANG:
Fully remote, will look good on resume, could make connections and hopefully get a full position someday, could potentially take off a lot of time to travel (though it would be unpaid), the FAANG supervisor was really excited about me

Cons of FAANG:
Can’t work anywhere but my home, no holidays or sick days, 6mo contract but would be extended to up to 2 years with good performance, probably not the best health insurance, 15 days of vacation time if I work a year - can’t take PTO until 3mo in, no other benefits, might get stuck in a contract rut, might not get offered a full position

Pros of option 2:
fully remote (I *believe* I could work from anywhere. There may be several states I’m not allowed to travel to while working), salaried (the same pay as the FAANG if I worked at the FAANG for an entire year, minus $2k but if I take a lot of unpaid time off at the FAANG then I’d make more w/ option 2), I believe it’s better health insurance, 15 vacation days, 2 floating, 2 personal, and 5 sick days

Cons of option 2:
Not a FAANG, might have to work 2-3 hours earlier than my normal time zone hours (getting clarification on this)",skinprogress,0,0.5,2,1720040943,2024-07-03 21:09:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dupc8s/do_i_accept_a_faang_contract_or_a_regular/,7,2024

1duont4,Job Decision,"Hi all! I am at a weird crossroads with a job choice. Currently, I work at a pretty low-stakes job. I'm a library assistant. The people are lovely, it's mostly calm, feels safe, but the work is ultimately so so boring. I've been here for almost two years. 

Prior to the library job, I worked at what I considered to be a dream place. I got to meet talented writers from all over the world, travel, and be surrounded by people who care about writing and arts. I worked mostly as an assistant for a program dedicated to high school creative writers, both American and international. The problem with that job at the time was that the management was severely toxic. I had two associate directors who refused to speak to each other, no one above me had any understanding of the program I worked on so therefore could offer literally no help, and I felt overwhelmingly drained by the drama of it all.

The two associate directors no longer work at this place, and earlier this year they rehired the most competent human I've ever had the pleasure of working with. She's genuinely incredible and is already reshaping it to hopefully be less of a dumpster-fire workplace. Last week they posted a new opening for a coordinator position for the program I originally was an assistant for. I can't stop thinking about it. Career-wise, it's what I'm more interested in and passionate about. But I also don't hate my job and am afraid of the grass always looking greener even if I do leave. I'm also obviously worried that the drama and gross toxicity is still part of it all. The pay is pretty comparable, the new job would be about a 5% raise from what I'm at currently. The new associate director also used to be the coordinator for the position I'd be applying to, so has a lot of knowledge about how it's run.

It's also hard for me to not feel like I'm somehow betraying my current boss. She's expressed so many times how grateful she is to have me, even today said she didn't know what she'd do without me. I know this is just professional decision, but it's so hard to lose the guilt.

What would you do? Leave? Stay? Quit everything and get off the exhausting grid? \*It's worth noting that I'm just preparing for if I did get a job offer. I have not applied yet. I just want to think this through fully before getting that ball rolling.

TLDR; current job is easy but v boring, possible job prospect is dream career but is more stressful. I can't decide if losing my peace is worth a rewarding but harder job.",Plenty-Elderberry992,1,1.0,1,1720039250,2024-07-03 20:40:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1duont4/job_decision/,7,2024
1duofvm,I feel like I have no purpose ,"
Hello this is my first time venting on Reddit, but  this September I’m going to be a senior in university. All my classmates are either applying to grad school or figuring out full-time work/ internships. I’ve dealt with a LOT of mental health problems growing up and sometimes I bsed my way through classes and didn’t really care for the content. Im studying computer science and digital art. I was considering game or app design but I absolutely hate computer science and I kept forgetting how to code as soon as the classes ended so I just stopped caring for the future classes and played the lectures in the background or got help from chat without trying to understand what I’m even doing. Im halfway through a summer coding class and I haven’t learned a single thing. Im scared I’ll have to code something later on and I won’t have access to even use the internet to figure it out or once I take the advanced class I’ll be stuck. The second I figured out I dislike computer science I stopped aiming to understand and only bsed for A’s as I said before but the bigger problem is I’m graduating, and I have no idea what else I’d even wanna do. Like yes it’s too late to change majors but I’m not complaining about having a comp sci degree in the first place, but I can’t code, I can’t do what I’ve been “learning” since I started cs classes. I’ve let my depression and hatred for learning get to me and essentially slacked off. Now I’m lost. I have almost a 4.0 but what’s the point when I don’t remember shit. I don’t even know what I wanna do after I graduate. I’m scared. I don’t wanna “grow up”. It’s a scary feeling. Like I guess I could watch the lectures for the remainder of the summer class but even so, what should I do in the long run? I waste my time reading webnovels or watching anime or drawing. It’s disappointing. I’m disappointed in myself but then again it’s too late to pick up spilt milk. I don’t have any passions besides these useless hobbies and I’m not gonna lie, I’ve been considering sewer slide at times. What purpose do I even have? I’ve wasted the full ride scholarship I got to this prestigious university by bsing my way through. I’m scared.

1duodai,"Recruiter and HM ask me to reconsider my withdrawing my application?
","Hello all,

Today I had the final interview with a large company. Up until now the interview process has been very pleasant and quick.

Unfortunately I had a strange final interview. The hiring manager outright told me that his team was understaffed, all pulling overtime, and ""for wild and crazy reasons"" (his words), they had ""recently lost a few staff in the department at once."" He also said a few other things I found strange, like ""I know I'll be your boss, but I don't want you to ask me too many questions.""

He also never turned his camera on and seemed very dodgy when I would ask him questions about advancement and work/life balance.

And finally, I just didn't feel the HM and I connected at all. Given all this, I assumed I was out of the running.

After the interview, the recruiter (who has been great throughout all of this) emailed me to ask how it went. I was upfront with him and told him that it wasn't a great experience for x, y, z reasons, and that ultimately I didn't think the culture of their organization would suit what I am looking for in my next position.

The recruiter responded saying ""I am sorry to hear that the experience wasn't what you hoped. The HM had great feedback about you and was excited to move forward with your application. Would you be open to having another call to address your concerns and answer your questions with more clarity?""

I'm not sure what to do here. That almost seems a little desperate to me, and the day-to-day the HM described sounded stressful and a bit chaotic. But at the same time, getting this job would mean a nice raise and a trajectory for making even more money down the road.

Anyone ever experience something like this? I don't think I see myself reconsidering. My gut is telling me to beware.",Playful_Carpenter513,1,1.0,1,1720038509,2024-07-03 20:28:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1duodai/recruiter_and_hm_ask_me_to_reconsider_my/,7,2024
1duo0si,Struggling with Career Decisions as Non-Breadwinner,"After many, many years of training, my SO is now the breadwinner by a longshot.  Her high earnings push us into a high tax bracket, which means basically all of my earnings are taxed at nearly 50%.  Additionally, we have a nanny for our only child, which consumes almost all of the post tax money I earn.

My job is full time in office, and I'm in a line of work that makes remote unlikely.  I think any change of jobs would increase my workload, thereby increasing stress and hours, and subsequently increasing the money spent on a nanny.  Been doing the same job for quite a while now and turned down previous opportunity for a promotion bc I thought our family would suffer.

I could be a stay at home parent, but I'm hesitant for several reasons:

-Not sure that I'm cut out for spending my entire day with a toddler


-Limited networks for SAHDs


-Worried about inability to get back into the workforce at a later date

1dunjwq,Fired for doing my job,"Before I start ranting and asking for advice I do want to say I have a lawyer (not sure if he is a great lawyer but he is someone supposed to fight for me and what is right) for retaliation on whistleblowing and pregnancy discrimination. 

I am a 25y (F) with about 6 years of social work experience. I left my previous job and took my first ever clinical social work job as a case manager in April. I was so excited for this new opportunity!

Two weeks into the job I reported my direct supervisor for telling us to disregard the policy and just to let patients go on transport without the doctors signed orders. My direct supervisor also told my coworker to not document complaints from patients factually but instead to make it vague and that she needed to change her documentation. That same day my supervisor asked me to print a handicap sticker form and she had a doctor sign it for her. I felt uncomfortable with her asking me to be involved but most importantly I felt like that was taking away from the care of the patients, the doctor is there for the patients not to sign forms for personal gain. That night I called my old professor to ask if this was in fact an ethical issue, I said I felt like it was but didn’t know because I was new. He did tell me that it was wrong especially since it could harm the patients. The next day I spoke with the person directly under the CEO and made my concerns clear. His response was that I was new and I didn’t understand the policy. He did say that the policy in place was to get the doctor’s signature, I responded that I was concerned that my direct supervisor told me to do the opposite of the policy. He told me that I could talk to the patient advocate with any other concerns. I responded that I was a social worker, I spoke to other social workers which agreed this is an ethical issue and needed to be reported. Nothing ever came from this other than me becoming a target.

I started documenting everything, dates, location, witnesses etc. there was physically neglect and patient abuse happening. I eventually went to HR because I patient was in a really concerning condition all day and the nurse did nothing. I found the doctor, had the doctor look at the patient and the doctor said she needed to go to the ER for possible stroke. She had been like that all morning and the nurses did nothing!! I told HR and they said that they couldn’t do anything about patient concerns that it would be another person I needed to report it to. I told HR that I wasn’t concerned about the patient I was concerned about the nurse that did nothing to help the patient. She informed me that she could not do anything. 

I noticed they started falsely documenting medical records. They were saying patients had a tracheostomy when they never did. They were saying they were taking heavy medication when they weren’t. It was a red flag for me and actually affected the discharge placement of the patients because it was huge medical things.

On May 30th I told my direct supervisor I was pregnant, in front of a witness (thank goodness).

On May 31st I sent a email about my concerns of the abuse and neglect and was immediately locked out of my email. They had a previous supervisor come in and try to start telling us to get release of information forms signed. In my email it said I was concerned about the HIPPA violations and felt like they were trying to start covering their asses. When I asked where the signed forms were for the clients we have been releasing information on my direct supervisor (the one I sent the email to and told I was pregnant) told me to come into the conference room with HR and they fired me. I asked why I was being terminated and they told me it was a cultural difference.

I feel stuck and lost and I don’t know what to do. Clinical social work experience looks really good on my resume but I can’t even use it. I have had 3 interviews but I’m 7 months pregnant and been denied for 2 out of the three jobs. In one of the interviews she said I wouldn’t be able to do the job because I wouldn’t be able to focus with a newborn.  My work experience and resume speaks for itself, I take real pride in my work ethic.

1duneit,Facing discrimination at work. HR is now on me like a hawk!,"So I'm in a little pickle. I was put on a performance improvement plan (pip) because apparently I had poor performance on 1 single task in comparison to other tasks that I did pretty well without issues. 95% of the job I did fine. 

Before I joined I made manager aware of my disabilities and how I need software to support me. 

Process took over 6 months. 

My manager told me I was doing great. Tells me I passed probabtion. 2 weeks after tells me I'm doing horribly and that my probabtion is being extended because I need prompted for things and also I'm slow. Both of which are due my disabilities. 

The PIP is super rigit and has 0 considerations of my disabilities. 

I quickly realised I need to start recording everything. So I did. Everything in writing I started to document. This impacted my mental health severely. I'm having to see a psychiatric and a psychologist just to help me deal with it all. 

Once I documented everything I told HR and logged a grievance. At the same time I decided to get applying for jobs to get away from this stressful environment. Got 2 stage interview done and looks like they're about to male me an offer.

But also HR investigations reached out to me and told me they're investigating and I need to go to a grievance hearing. 

All this is too stressful. But I started this process to report all the discrimination I was facing to try and get out of the team but it seems like they're too focused on reconciling when in reality I cannot teach these people on how to work with someone with disabilities. 

I'm thinking of handing in my notice but at the same time it's like well I crested enough noise. Maybe I should see where this leads but at the same time I'm super depressed and anxious doing the daily BAU work. 

Any insight or perspective would be helpful. ",AncientData8191,10,0.6499999761581421,19,1720036042,2024-07-03 19:47:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1duneit/facing_discrimination_at_work_hr_is_now_on_me/,7,2024

1dumqv2,Asking for my job back ,"Hi, I need a piece of advice. I have spent a year working a junior data scientist, receiving very positive feedback. I was working on two projects and I was a sole contributor to the second one. Both of these projects were important projects, worth quite a lot of money. I have decided to quit to pursue a career in software engineering instead of DS. I thought my skills are more suitable for that. My manager was devastated that I am leaving, he said that he thinks I have much talent for data science and said that the door is always open. Anyways, I am a software engineering intern in a new company and 4 days in I already hate it. It turned out there's been a misunderstanding and that they want me to work on frontend or tests, instead of the backend. I tried to convince them to let me work on the backend but they said that the code is poorly written, that it would take a lot of time to understand it and that I wouldn't learn anything anyway. I am disappointed and I also don't like the new company's culture, it's much bigger than the previous one and I don't feel that I fit in. I miss my old job and would like to go back. It turned out that the grass is not always greener elsewhere and I think that I had a wrong idea of what software engineering really means. What should I do now? Should I reach out to my former manager and ask him to take me back? How do I do it? Should I keep it humble or try to ask for a raise? How long should I wait before asking? Some more people left after I did so I think they will need more employees soon anyway. I could start ASAP, since I don't have a notice period.

1dulwf0,Notified that I'll be dismissed from my job- now what? ,"
I posted this on another sub, posting it here too to get some advice. 

Received a notice of my employer’s intent to dismiss me from my job. To be fair, I sensed it was coming. My mental and physical health has severely deteriorated in the past year. I have ADHD and anxiety/depression (late diagnosis as an adult), and it, among other personal events (financial, family issues, etc), really caused me to end up with extreme burnout. I fell apart, literally, and haven’t been able to function normally since. Of course, my performance at work took a nosedive, and I was placed on a PIP. I managed to function enough to take EAP and get FMLA to stop the career death spiral temporarily. I got taken off the PIP, but I never really recovered, and now… here we are. 

My executive functioning has all but evaporated, along with my will and hope for the future. I’ve been in this job for over a decade, much longer than I wanted to be because I needed stability for my family. There were no promotional opportunities or room for growth.  I hated it, but I couldn’t get out. I tried applying for several jobs throughout the years, but nothing worked out. I know it’s easier to get a job when you have one, but after a while, being at the same place for 10 years can work against you in future job prospects. To counter it, I took (expensive) certifications and courses, hoping to show that I was still actively working on professional development. 

I aggressively applied to other jobs when I sensed things were going downhill (before the PIP). I got a few calls, got an offer, and took it because I desperately wanted to leave and get higher pay/better benefits, and new skills. I started transitioning from my current job and took a leave of absence to burn out my leave, train, and eventually move into the new job. Unfortunately, the demands of the new job were insane- nothing like how they advertised or presented it in interviews. Sweeping changes were being made, high turnover, conflicting departments, and costly insurance (up to half my biweekly pay for family coverage). It was a startup if that helps. After a few months, I decided to quit and return to my old (present) job to save myself and regain stability. 

At the meeting for the notice, they told me that I could request a hearing to state my case and why I shouldn’t be dismissed from my job. I’ve been under the care of my doctor and a psychiatrist throughout this time, but obviously, it hasn’t been enough to keep me from getting to this point. I don’t know if I should share what’s been happening to me personally and how it’s taken a toll on me or talk about my disability. I don’t know what other options are or what else I could say or do. I feel like I’m already done.

 I take responsibility for what’s happened, but I am burnt out and pretty much dead inside. I’m not happy here, and I don’t see much else beyond trying to keep my job because I don’t have any prospects for a future job lined up, and I’ll be losing my medical, benefits, and accrued time and retirement if I get fired, so…. I don’t know what to do.

Sorry for the long post, but any advice on what my next steps could be or any kind words of encouragement would be welcomed. I’m so lost and just out of it.",Coo-deh,0,0.5,13,1720032255,2024-07-03 18:44:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dulwf0/notified_that_ill_be_dismissed_from_my_job_now/,7,2024

Just to preface by saying I have debilitating anxiety and have undiagnosed ADHD (all of the signs are there).
However, I started my job a few months ago and I am worried I am not meeting my jobs expectations. Of course, as anyone with anxiety would react, my immediate thought is “I will be losing my job by the end of this month.”
What really triggered this thought is him randomly telling me to please include him in all of my client meetings for the coming weeks. (Yikes).
I can tell he’s not happy with my performance and I am scared this will be the make or break. I can also admit there has been a knowledge gap and I am not being a “sponge” with the information to do my tasks efficiently. 
I like doing things correct and when it is not done correctly I go into a panic and think worst case scenarios.

So the question or advice needed is how do I handle this? I know that’s a very loaded question but I am stuck and this is the best job I have ever had. I hate letting people down but I fear I’ve let him down to the point of no return and regret for hiring me.

When I was younger, I wanted to be a ""business guy,"" and I worked in B2B sales for almost five years. However, I thought it would be a good idea to try something new because I became mentally bored of doing the same tasks and constantly chasing prospects.

Since I was interested in tech and computers, I decided to give IT a try. I invested time and money into building a technical skill set by attending community college and studying for certifications. Unfortunately, I have realized that IT is not for me. Two years into the role, I still struggle with the troubleshooting aspect of the job. I had to swallow my pride and accept that my skills are not well suited for these tasks. Despite spending time after work studying concepts and forcing myself to like IT, I feel like I am wasting my time and cannot handle the stress of feeling insecure in my role due to my lack of proficiency.

Having had this reality check, I want to reorganize my life. I am exploring my options to switch careers back to a business/admin role. I am unsure how to explain to future employers my transition from the admin/business field to a tech role and then back to business/admin.

1duk09t,Ex-Founder breaking into Product Management,"\*This is a throwaway account for privacy / anonymity\*

Hey there -



Hope you all are doing well! I just wanted to write this post to get some advice from you all as I think about this next phase of my career. For some context, I was most recently the founder of a technology startup. I started this business towards the tail-end of my undergrad and I operated it full-time for a few years. It was a tough business to grow and I made the difficult decision to move on from the venture. Fortunately, I was able to close a deal earlier this year to have its technology assets be acquired and reappropriated to a different product, and as a result, I am actively interviewing for my next role. After some reflection, I realized that I may be a decent candidate for the role of a Product Manager. Many of the responsibilities that I enjoyed the most about running my startup overlaps with the role of a PM and I feel that the position aligns well with my strengths. While I was a solo founder and wore many different hats, I really do believe that I would be happy as a PM. Here is some more information about me and my background:



* Master’s Degree from a T20 University
* Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science
* I operated as our sole Technical Product Manager and managed a team of engineers through the build and iteration our product offering
* Very hands-on on all major aspects of the business: engineering, design, partnerships, marketing, legal, etc
* I also have a background in sales / marketing prior to me founding the tech venture



I have been interviewing for Product Manager roles for a few months now and I’ve had about a dozen interviews, where about half of them made it to the final round, but no offers yet. Also, I have probably applied to over 1000 PM listings. I recognize that the market is very tough right now and that I’m competing against people with significantly more industry PM experience than I do. On an interesting side note, for two of the roles where I made it to final round interviews, the offer was given to someone with 10 years and 12 years of experience respectively - absolutely wild that I was even under consideration given their level of experience! While I have a preference for remote roles, I would be open to moving just about anywhere in the US for the right role at the right company. Candidly, I have been feeling a bit lost and dejected recently. I am very fortunate to have had the privilege to pursue my startup full-time (a luxury I know many don’t have the ability to pursue) and I know that many of my skills would be highly impactful for many organizations (especially early stage / scaling startups). That being said, I feel like I have hit a bit of a plateau and I’m not sure what else I can do to help differentiate myself from other applicants. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Additionally, if anyone in here was a former founder and successfully transitioned into a PM role, I would love to chat!",Imaginary_Vehicle663,1,1.0,0,1720027521,2024-07-03 17:25:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1duk09t/exfounder_breaking_into_product_management/,7,2024

1dui58g,"Harassed by hiring manager, not sure what to do about it.","So l went into an interview today at a restaurant and it was completely normal. I applied last night and got a call this morning for it. After the interview I got a request on snapchat from the interviewer (unique name and bitmoji is identical to him ). My snapchat username has nothing to do with my real name so the only way he could have gotten it is by taking my number from my application, adding it to his contacts, and looking for me in quick add. At first I thought maybe he didn't realize it was me he was talking to but after experimenting I found out snapchat shows users in your contacts as the name that you put them under in your contacts. He asked if I was single or looking for friends with benefits (basically asking if I wanted to have sex with him) and other uncomfortable sexual questions, nothing related to the job at all. I decided to act oblivious and be nice because I need a job, I told him I wasn’t looking for a relationship and I was asexual. He kept dragging on the conversation asking about my sexuality and whether i’ve ever done anything sexual, gross questions like that. He never mentioned he knew who I was and ignored when I asked how he got my snapchat. I wasn't hired at the interview but they said i'd get a call back after they found out which location would be best for me. I really need a job so i'm not sure what to do in this situation. I'm disgusted by this behavior and I know I should report it but i'm not even an employee so I don't know how or who id even report it to.

1dui4r5,Leaving job for higher salary but losing options,"I currently work at a very large company in a LCOL city. I have been at this company for a little over three years, and really like my job. I also have successfully led a couple of high level projects and, as a result, developed strong relationships with officers and directors in my org, which have earned me two consecutive years of stock option awards, which will vest over the course of the next 3 years. In addition, I was able to share some of my work at a national conference. 

I was telling a friend about my conference presentation, and she told me about a job at her org that she thought I should apply for. This is a smaller non-profit that does really amazing work, and several of my friends work there and love the culture. I am at the final stage of the interview process, and trying to figure out what they would need to offer in order for me to leave my current situation. Would love any advice or perspective.

Current job:
+ $86k + variable bonus (0-7% of salary) which is above average of my position’s pay band
+ 430 stock options, 83 currently vested, the others vest in equal increments over the next 2-3 years (250 are a low strike price relative to the current value)
+ Hybrid work schedule (2-3 days a week in office) & flexible mgmt (I have worked remotely for weeks when I needed to take care of a family member or wanted an extra week of travel)
+ High visibility work that has been successful
+ Strong network with leader, been tapped for leadership pipeline in the future
+ good work/life balance and great leadership
- company has been going through major reorgs and while I have been told our department is understaffed, there have been layoffs of teams
- company outlook seems positive, but always the possibility of being bought out by a competitor

New job:
+ $105-110k (unsure about bonus) would be high range of pay band for my position
+ no stock options — non-profit
+ great company culture, lots of friends work there
+generalist position, so I’d expand my skill sets and work in new parts of the organization than my specialist role
+layoffs are rare
+net pay is higher because company pays 100% of healthcare costs
-5 day in office schedule, unsure about flexible work options
-smaller organization so unclear about advancement opportunities
-starting over with network 

TLDR: I don’t really want to leave my job, but an opportunity has come up for the possibility of $15-$20k more in salary, but I would lose my stock options. The company has done significant restructuring in past couple of years, so I don’t feel 100% safe, but I’ve had some successful high visibility projects that make me feel more secure. I also really like my current leadership and the flexible work options.",Theupkeepisfine,1,1.0,1,1720022880,2024-07-03 16:08:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dui4r5/leaving_job_for_higher_salary_but_losing_options/,7,2024
1duhnpc,I (27F) have never felt so lost in my life than I do now ,"I have no idea on who I am or where I want to be in life. I don't think I've ever actually taken the time to myself to figure out my passion, qualities and interests. I studied Travel & Tourism in college, ended up not doing anything with it, and didn't take it any further after achieving a higher qualification in it. I just liked the idea of traveling because I had a silly idea of seeing more of the world. I was never academically gifted nor did I have that sort of support from my parents to push me to do better. So after Travel & Tourism, I met my partner who advised to take up Science as it's always in demand and interesting. I did that for a few years, achieved my higher qualification in Biology & Chemistry at college then dropped out shortly following the death of my dad. I ended up doing nothing with it either, so I found a full-time job in a pharmacy as a dispenser which is slowly killing me, and almost destroying my mental health. I've done an online course with Google for UX Design again at the suggestion of my partner, got it and again..not done anything with it. 

As you can see, I've been back and forth between different career fields and never quite sticking it out. I just gave up, and now I feel defeated in life. I'm struggling mentally because this has been a huge stress factor for me. One thing I have noticed is I enjoy helping people and sharing any health related to knowledge but I don't know if I'd call that a passion? I've also dabbled in the thought of Game Design because I love gaming and find it sort of exciting at the thought of being part of a team developing a game and characters but sounds dumb when I think more on it. Dietician also crossed my mind but I've read people aren't paid well enough then Software Engineer as I'd like to work from home with a comfortable salary.

I was hesitant as I have always lived by the belief that it is easier to find a job when you already have one, but they seemed confident that they would find something soon. 

It's now been 10 months and they are still without a job. We have workshopped their resume and cover letter multiple times. I've had friends who work in HR go through them just to get another set of eyes on them. They have been looking at LinkedIn, Indeed, local job boards, colleges, hospitals, everything we can think of, but even with all of that, they have only had one interview. They don't have a lot of experience, having only worked retail after college, and not working during the pandemic, but I just can't figure out why they haven't been able to find a job. 

They had a large amount of money in savings, and I have been able to cover a lot of expenses while they search, but they let me know a few days ago that they don't have enough to cover their portion of rent next month.

Im looking for some advice on my current work situation.

I took a Product Owner role after 17 + years of doing IT (Sys Admin, Development and later full stack engineering) and i feel it might have been the worst career decision i’ve made. 

I was told that although this was a PO role in the full Agile sense, there was a need for work in infrastructure and development and thus i decided to take the chance, thinking id keep expanding my Dev and IaC skills but so far its been paper pushing and writing spec documents which isn’t my cup of tea.

I like the company i work for and my current level is where i feel i should be but the company has a strict 1 Year cooldown time before applying to a new role, unless your manager approves your early leave. Here is where another issue comes into play, my Mgr is one of the reasons the work feels so miserable and i find it extremely hard to have the conversation about applying to another team.

The obvious choice would be to apply externally to other companies but I feel the job security and pay here(aerospace) is a notch above that of other big companies.

While I think I am extremely lucky to have a job in this market that I enjoy doing and it does help me be independent and survive, I think it’s not enough to live life and have experiences. I also feel this because I have my partner and my friends all work in a lot higher paying fields (like tech, IT, finance) and I can never dream of being anywhere close to them.

I am currently working in Public Relations but I have been thinking about going back to school and maybe change my scope into something that might earn me more money. I am willing to put in the hard work but I don’t know where to start or what career paths are there for me. 

Quick pointers
age and location: 25F Toronto 
Current field of work: Public Relations 
Salary range: 60k pre tax

TLDR;
I think I earn enough to survive but I dont earn enough to enjoy life. I feel inferior to my partner and friends who are in a lot higher paying fields and am thinking of going back to school to make a shift but not sure where to start. Looking for any advice :)

1dufmjg,75k USD in India or 180k USD in Seattle?,"Hi, I am 23 year old and just got two on-site job offers. One in Bangalore, India for $75k (Base Salary) and other in Seattle, USA for $180k (Base Salary). 

I am confused about which one should I use. People will come and say that 180k usd for USA is average and 75k in India is rich and i could live a great life with it in India. 

But considering long term benefits, I guess I will be able to do much more savings in USA than in India. After expenses and tax deductions, I am assuming I can still save around $85k annually in US while only around 50k USD in India.

1duf4yl,Moving from recruitment into Sales (ServiceNow) - advice please!," I’m currently a recruitment consultant  focusing on ServiceNow in the UK market, I’ve been in my current business for 3.5 years. My target is £350k p/a which I’m confident I will achieve again this year. 

I’ve built a great network of buyers during this time, naturally as they’re the same people who hire my candidates! Honestly, I’ve never wanted to stay in recruitment for ever - but really enjoy the ServiceNow eco-system and want to leverage the large network I’ve built over the years.

My plan is to move into a Business Development role with one of the alliance partners who implement the software, or with ServiceNow direct (one can dream, right?) 

I had a second stage for a role with a US firm who’re at the top of their segment this week. They’re 1000 globally and 15 in the UK with plans to double by the end of this year. 

My current base+comms is roughly £65k. This new gig is offering £75 base with double OTE.


What advice would you give someone like me looking to make this move? What should I expect? And is a sales target for a highly penetrated software like ServiceNow achievable compared to what I’ve done already? New target c. £2m p/a.

I've been working seasonally all over the U.S. mostly building hiking trails but I also did some farming and kitchen work when I needed to. But because of the increase stroke risk I'm not able to build hiking trails because the job sites are deep into the wilderness often 8 hours away from hospitals.

1due35i,"Coworker refuses to work with me, only my manager","I have a coworker, let’s call Jack.
For context, Jack is more senior than I am. He’s in Legal and I’m in a different dept, but we are two people who work on the same material/area of work.
At our company and general area of work, it’s not hierarchical as a heads up.

Since he’s joined, he’s been a bit rude here and there, but nothing I couldn’t write off/brush off.
However, recently during a meeting he outwardly berated me and questioned my authority multiple times. It was so horrible that I could barely sleep that night and the few nights after. Really stressed me out.
So I set up time with him 1:1 about 3 days later, and maturely described how I felt with specific examples and verbiage he used. Instead of any ownership or any acknowledgement even, he said I was disrespectful and rude during the meeting. He also said I wasn’t an expert though I claimed to me. I clarified that I am, I have 9+ years of experience in this field. He said I’m not an attorney though, which I explained that I never claimed to be. But that I still had the right to contribute and work. 

Unfortunately for him, the meeting was recorded. So I sent it to my manager and explained it to her, and then she went to his manager.

His manager had a really kind and reasonable response, basically validating my feelings and saying that Jack should have taken my feedback. She also saw the recording and knew of what he said in our 1:1.

Jack’s manager ended up talking to him and reprimanding him.

Fast forward to a month ago. I had a document that I was sending out to another team. I didn’t need permission nor anything from Jack, but my manager suggested to promote unity or whatever to send it to him for any suggestions.

However, first it took 2 weeks for Jack to review it, though it’s a pretty short document.
Then once he responded, he said this document shouldn’t go to the team. I asked why?
Jack said wait to talk to your manager, that he has spoken to her about this previously.
I asked if he could elaborate, and Jack just stopped all messaging to me.
So my manager is in a different time zone and when she got online, she messaged me first, asking me what Jack was referring to.
I then got on a call with my manager, and we basically conclude that Jack has no valid reason to block my work, nor the authority. He didn’t talk to her about anything separately, so it’s not like I missed anything. She was annoyed with his behavior, but to note, she isn’t Jack’s manager.

So my manager messaged back in the thread that this was just a call for collaboration but that we’d proceed with sending it over to the team as planned.

Then Jack instantly messaged my manager separately (my manager told me). Basically explaining his points. Jack’s reasoning still made zero sense, so then finally Jack scheduled 1:1 time with my manager that same day (my manager was keeping me informed each step).

At the end of the meeting, my manager basically said that Jack just wants his way or no way.
He also finally explained his concern, which was the timeline. I said that if that’s his concern, we could just ask the team for additional information.

My manager said to do so directly with the team, but to make no noise in public messaging channels.


Basically now I had a day to digest this, and I’m pretty upset. I was upset yesterday too, but I just realize how ridiculous this all was.
He refused to communicate with me and it required multiple messages back and forth with my manager + a meeting for this to get somewhat resolved.

I’m deeply concerned with my ability to just do my job too, since he’s the attorney I’m supposed to partner with in my area.
I can’t ask for someone else on my team to takeover, I’m the only person with this expertise.

Any suggestions on what I can do next?
Should I talk to his manager, my manager, HR, or all?
How can I frame this to them so it’s taken seriously? I don’t even know what would be a happy ending here besides him leaving the program or company. What would I ask for? Him to be more cooperative?

1du97gb,Working at dad's company's subsidiary - good or bad?,"Hello folks,

I have just recently finished my master's and am working at my dad's company (that does work related to my field of study) as a business development associate. I am trying my best to learn as much as I can about the business while also thinking about my career options. In the long run, I want to do some sort of business/strategy work at the executive level in the same industry or investing e.g., VC.

The job market right now, as you guys know, is shitty. I know smart and hardworking people still land their dream jobs, and I don't want to make the current market situation sound like an excuse, but it is nonetheless a factor. I know that I'm smart and hardworking as well, and don't want to settle for anything less than I want.

A month into my current job, my dad says he is thinking of expanding the company overseas. He wants to establish a subsidiary in a different country and tailor the business model and strategy to it, with me operating it. The parent company (the one I'm working in now) is a late stage startup, currently undergoing a small financing round before its pre-IPO. There is some revenue, the tech is promising, and despite some hurdles everything looks pretty good at the moment. He says he has been thinking of overseas expansion for a while, and trusts me enough to know that I will do a good job as the subsidiary head/manager whatever.

Based on the things I just said, I have a few questions for you (aspiring) entrepreneurs / people who might have been in the same shoes.

1. I definitely feel passionate about the product/company and feel like I will learn a lot through this role. I just don't know if I'm prepared to have such a huge responsibility at a young age. Being in charge of a subsidiary sounds exciting but also challenging. Then again, this isn't an opportunity that comes every day. What would you guys do if you were in my shoes?
2. If I take this job, would it pigeonhole my career? I'm afraid that whatever conclusion comes to it (becoming very rich or failing miserably) I don't really have options to really pursue anything different. Maybe an angel investor if I become really successful? Or independent consultant? I don't know, but it seems like conventional corporate careers such as consulting would be out of line

Apart from answers, any other comments - both positive and negative are welcome. Just please base it on some kind of evidence/experience and not without rationale.

1du5vbf,I feel like a failure because of a start-up company.,"For context, I applied for a junior role in a start-up company, but after several interviews and a case study, the ceo offered me a different role which involves social media. From a junior role, they offered me an executive role. Lo and behold, when I started I found out that I will be the one handling all the social media responsibilities. Take note, I am a fresh graduate with a lot of marketing internships in big local and international companies and the ceo is well aware of this. She offered me a good pay and claimed that the company has a fun working environment. I was so happy. I felt like all my efforts were validated and finally, my career is on track.  

The first week was okay, I started third week of May, there were group meetings, daily meetings with me and her and the graphic designer to discuss social media but the next three weeks left me in shambles. No daily meetings anymore, my social calendars I worked so hard for are not even being checked, the CEO micro manages everyone, wont event reply to most of our messages and approvals, and makes ALL of our (graphics and me) works revised. She would approve something then change her mind last minute or completely ask us to revise something only for us to end up not posting anything because she doesn’t wanna do it anymore. I was so frustrated but of course, as an employee, I have always been respectful and communicative towards her even tho she barely responds to my inquiries. 

I was planning to stay just for the sake of survival because I need the salary but guess what? She called me last July 1 for a “quick chat” and informed me that they dont need my role anymore because they are switching their company into a different one. And I don’t know why, but she even managed to show a bit of enthusiasm as she did this. She expressed how she doesn’t wanna do this and how she feel bad and proceeded to slightly chuckle and say that “I hope you still manage to have a great day.” And just like that, she ended up firing me the same day. 

I want to honestly cry out of frustration. This is my first work and it was so traumatic. I dont even know how I’m gonna move on from this.

Even DSMs for other insurance agencies, what can you tell me about the job? Any advice? What’s the salary range?

I’m five months into a new job, and it isn’t what they said it would be. The title of the job, job description and interview conversations had me convinced that this would be a heavy marketing role with some admin/clerical duties. But it’s been the exact opposite. Most of my time is spent doing mundane, administrative responsibilities with very little strategy, which is my forte. I’ve raised this to my manager, who watered down how much admin work the job entails. I’m thinking about going a step above, and raising my concern to the executive director. The ED is ambitious and *should* see the value of good marketing, and should understand that the company needs someone committed to it to allow it to grow. If the ED isn’t amenable, what do I do?

1du2zh6,Mid 20s - seeking career change,"New to Reddit, but hoping I can do this right. I’m in my mid 20s, on my second job after college, and am looking for advice on what to do. 

I’m currently CSM at a tech company that was just acquired by PE. I don’t like the work, being a CSM isn’t for me. And I anticipate layoffs in the coming months. I’m a very high performer from a metrics standpoint, but the day to day is easy and the work is not challenging. 

I have been toying around with recruitment for a bit, but I’m waiting to go all in until I get paid on my remaining commission in August.
I am considering several options, and am seeking advice. 

- Work at a startup in sales. I love the idea of getting gritty and actually making an impact. In my current job, I feel like creating any change or tangible impact is extremely difficult. Going to a startup would allow me to be rewarded for working my ass off. Of course, there is tremendous risk with a startup. 
- Work in an ESG focused role. My passion is sustainability, and I would be truly motivated every day if I was at a company that was making an impact on the planet, and not just trying to make $$$. Making good money is important to me, but in a perfect world, I could go to a for profit ESG startup. From my initial research and info interviews, it seems like I would need more school for this to be possible. 
- Education. I could do a Masters or a 12 week program on ESG. I’ve found several courses that are ~10 hours per week, 12 weeks long, and gives you access to job oops and alumni databases.

This cycle has repeated itself for over a year and I’m now at the final month because I have been getting financial support from my parents and they can’t help me after this month.

1du1o4w,Would I be wrong for leaving?,"To start I am universal banker in a small community bank. I work full time and also attend college full time as well with up to five classes some semesters. 

My bank is pretty small so I am cross trained on multiple positions, such as working our ACH/operations desk and even doing things for our CFO when he is out. I got a raise for all of the cross training recently but it is barely worth anything for all that I do.  I make the same now as what another teller did who was hired with the same experience as mine. However throughout the time he worked there he was never cross trained on anything and never promoted to universal banker. 

The people who I serve as backups for are also not trusted to have a cash drawer so when they are gone I am doing everythinggg. 

I have also had some issues with the person who I backup for as they are not always the kindest and have spoken to me pretty harshly resulting in me crying at work one day. They will never admit they have made mistakes not so tech savvy always so this creates issues. They also gossip heavily about everyone at my job. This person had the same issues with the person who was previously in my position which ultimately resulting in her leaving due to the environment. 

Recently the two people I am a backup for have been gone for much longer than they usual are resulting in me doing so much. I am expected to conduct transactions, work the ops desk, answer phones, open accounts etc. I had an issue with all the responsibilities they were putting onto me and I went to HR explaining that I am unable to do my own job 100% when I am covering for others so frequently, and I may need to have another person help out sometimes. This fell on deaf ears and they said oh of course we understand, but the next day it was like they forgot and continued to drown me with accounts and other things. 

This also would not be much of aproblem  if our systems were updated but they are not and almost every day we have issues. We also allow so many things I don’t believe are right because some customers are shareholders so we give passes for documentation or signatures.


This had affected my relationship and my school as well because I am so consumed with the thought of work and I am always complaining and just exhausted after work.  I have an interview next week for a much larger company. It is a higher paying job and I would have the opportunity to advance my career there. I just feel guilty for leaving as I know they will struggle especially next month as one coworker will be leaving on maternity leave. I cannot imagine staying another year there though.

1du107k,Company makes it quite difficult for me,"I joined a new company and from the start, I get the feeling that my company makes it quite difficult for me.

First feedback I received was to be more social interactive (for work related stuff, there are no problems) with my colleagues and that I physically smelled. My colleague was pissed at my manager for discussing this with me.

I bought perfume and I tried to be more social interactive with my colleagues. This however is one sided. I am the one engaging, but none of my colleagues seem to be interactive towards me. I don’t get invited to anything, except for company events where everyone is invited.

I discussed with the people why the social interaction seems to be one sided within the company. I think they discussed this and did something with it.

Then later I showed impatience in the chat where none responded to my comments (that was my bad).

I made another remark where I said that I was bummed out for not being included in the company photos. Owner of the company lashed out at me through the chat (aggressive behaviour). I was also blamed for removing my own messages in the chat.

Now later, my manager told me that I try to force the social interaction with people, that my colleagues don’t have to be my friend and keeps saying that the contact between me and the group isn’t at its best.

I agree with the “don’t have to be my friend” part, but then why give me the feedback that I need to be more social interactive with my colleagues? Social interaction is very one sided (I make the attempts), so there’s no way I can improve on this unless my colleagues allow me to be part of their culture. I think this feedback is unreasonable and unachievable.

1dtzyhs,Thoroughly unsure on what to do next,"Background below:

As an excited kid in college, I was really sure I wanted to go into supply chain consulting and I was lucky enough to pursue this after my Masters. 4 years into it, I was super fried and had pretty severe health issues because of it and quit. At the time, I quite liked the idea of building something and decided to join a mid stage startup in a similar sort of role.

It all seemed very exciting at first, but our org is now pivoting to cater to a different geography and is laying off people thick and fast in India. I am almost sure I’m going to laid off (my boss also hinted at this) *but* I dunno when it’s going to happen.

My boss told me this in confidence so I can’t really speak to my manager about it either, but working with a sense of impending doom makes fairly easy tasks a lot harder. Added to this, my pay includes a variable which is based on the number of clients we land, this also sucks for me since I’ll probably be gone before bonuses are paid out. (I get 🥚 variable in this scenario) 

The obvious answer to all this is to find something else and quit, but I’ve got no idea what I want to do next.  Not sure I want to join a startup again because I don’t want to fall into the current cycle again. Also don’t want to go back into consulting again because of the stress levels. Supply chain strategy roles (where my experience lies) are few and far between and I seem to be either over or under qualified for these positions.

I don’t have ops experience per se and feel like my resume wouldn’t be as strong for these kind of roles either.

Reddit world, pls guide! Does career counselling help with this sort of thing? If yes, details of a counsellor would be greatly appreciated!


TLDR: Worked in a supply chain consulting role for a large firm and then a startup.
Probably going to be laid off soon and am looking for a job but have little to no idea on what to do (don’t want to go back to either)

1dtzvi4,How to deal with unclear instructions and vague feedback and recover relationship with boss?,"I’m on mobile so apologies if the formatting is off. I’ve been in my role about 14 months now and overall have really enjoyed it. However, right around my anniversary I was chastised by my boss for alleged communication issues that occurred as we prepared to host a key event. This has since translated to the last two months being very tense after receiving fantastic feedback and kudos the full year up until this breakdown in communication - now I am frequently given vague feedback and hearing comments from him that I’m “not quite meeting expectations” in my command of the legal environment of our field (only have been in this specific niche at this role) and that I have “communication issues.” 

To keep things vague, he wanted to change a tech vendor last minute to display some fundraising pages at an event and asked me to find a new one. I was successful and found a good vendor but my boss was very frustrated by the fact we had several emails between us to discuss the vendor and that he frankly kept not fully reading my emails so he was missing info. We then had some issues with the vendor at the event where we had to figure out how to make the page auto refresh to show fundraising progress through the night. Being the problem solver that I am, I found multiple solutions that would do this and that seemed to make my boss more frustrated. His solution ended up being having someone manually refresh the page over and over again even though I had found two applications that I tested and proved they would automate the page refresh. I also found out later that our CEO (small nonprofit) was upset with me at this event because I had emailed her the month prior where I very professionally let her know I was not able to make a voluntary dinner as I had planned (plenty of notice) but that I was looking forward to seeing her the following morning. She never responded, which is no big deal, but I guess I really offended her by not giving a bleeding heart reason why I couldn’t attend anymore (my cat was collapsing and nobody would be home for 12+ hours if I left in time for this dinner). I would never presume that the CEO of any org would care about my personal issues but my boss was very angry about this along with the multiple emails about the vendor and the problem solving issue. The CEO apparently said I was incredibly rude and my boss just chose to believe it. After he gave me very negative feedback about this I forwarded the email to him and while he agreed with me about it not being rude he told me I needed to be more personal in my interactions with the CEO. 

Where things get even weirder is that at this same event my boss “tested” my problem solving by coming to me in a pretend panic about some mailers we needed to send back to our office from the event. He “thought” they were thrown away for some reason. I reassured him that was not the case and went ahead to go check as I was going back to our home base room anyways. I confirmed I was correct and sent him a text letting him know. This was NOT what he wanted me to do - what he really wanted me to do was ask our office admin to check on this and then give him the info she relayed to me. This still doesn’t make sense to me but I guess that’s how he likes things done, with an extra specialized middle man added to processes.

While I could tell my boss was irritated at the time, I chose to believe it was just stress because I genuinely did a good job presenting and working at the event (feedback from attendees/other boss). I was wrong. He raised his voice at me and gave me really negative feedback with no ways to improve before awkwardly congratulating me for graduating with my graduate degree and hanging up two months ago. He did later apologize but our rapport has really not recovered. While he would sometimes go back on his word and forget his own instructions or change his mind, he now does so frequently along with giving the most vague instructions verbally for tasks. He’s also providing negative feedback on these tasks with no measurable ways for me to improve or acknowledgement his instructions were vague/expectations were unclear.

*To summarize the feedback was:*
- I need to have better command of my own knowledge of the legal environment for our field. 
- I have “communication issues.”
- I try to solve problems by myself too often. 

*To work on these things:*
- I’ve committed to independently studying outside of work, enrolled in two education programs (one finished), and continuously took opportunities to speak on the legal issues affecting our field in internal meetings. This seems to be improving with him at least.
- I’m trying my best to over communicate and to call him more often instead of email (even though our org uses email chains for literally everything). I am also asking for extensions on certain things because he *hates* when something is turned in on the day it’s due.
- If anything is even slightly out of my wheelhouse, I will either ask him or a colleague to step in/help. This feels really inefficient but I’m doing it anyways.

I am really at a loss and I’m not sure how to recover the great rapport we had prior to the initial breakdown in communication. I just turned in an objectively great draft product for publication and while he had some constructive written feedback his verbal feedback was not useful or reflective of what he wrote in the document. He once again went back on his instructions, changed his expectations, and then vaguely said he wants to see “more.” When I ask clarifying questions he just seems annoyed. 

I have been extremely deferential and accepting of the vague feedback, but I feel the current environment is not conducive for my success. I am known to be quite confident (rightfully so) and very capable/intelligent, but these conversations are seriously breaking me down. I have a graduate degree for my field (public policy) and nearly 6 years of demonstrated professional success within that sphere. I feel like an idiot. I’m too nervous to take “risks” and make suggestions for improvement on any of our processes. I even went back to read emails from Jan-April to see if I was misremembering the glowing feedback I was receiving and I wasn’t. 


I really like this industry (planning to specialize in it), the org, my role, and honestly my boss too outside of these two months. I am in desperate need of advice.

1dtz7ay,Any career ideas for adults with disabilities/mental health needs?,"
Disability career advice

Hi all. For context, I’m under 30 and have multiple invisible disabilities and mental health things. You could summarize me at work as this: I have the bipolar creativity but am introverted and not confident, and have none of the stereotypical adhd charisma. I can do most things with like 80-90% proficiency but will never reach 100% and the missing bit is always what gets me in trouble. I don’t have social skills strong enough to allow people to overlook the missing bit, so I could never be a “personality hire” vibe person. For instance, I can drive, but never decisively enough to not get honked at semi-regularly by impatient people behind me. I can miss details, unwritten social rules are very hard, sometimes I can unintentionally say minimally insensitive things or have too flat a tone/facial expression although I am very empathetic and nonjudgmental, and although most of the time I’m emotionally normal, if I’m going through stress I can have large emotions and be emotionally unstable which is a problem. It’s very hard for me to not take home to work with me and I’m working on it. 

I’ve been mostly holding down jobs as an adult but it’s been a process finding the right fit. I think I just need to find the right environment and culture. My current job isn’t unbearable but it’s difficult enough socially that I am looking for a better fit once I’ve been there for a respectable amount of time. Any advice on field or jobs that fit the following criteria or vibes? See below:

- a job that has mostly structured work interactions or where you get training on how to do your job and where management genuinely gives feedback and is professional. At my current place if I do something wrong socially, management just gossips and sideeyes me and gives no feedback so I just have to guess. But I’m learning office politics I guess which is a lesson of its own

- not unethical

- ideally middle class or above salary, unfortunately I live in a high cost of living area

- good work life balance. If I work more than 40 hrs a week, I will burn out. Ideally I’d only work part time, but healthcare in the US 👹

- open to in person, remote, or hybrid

- ideally something not direct client services like teaching. I would not have the social batteries

- ideally something where my “deliverable” isn’t dependent on people outside me or my team, so ideally not sales or something networking heavy. Ideally not customer service or self employment

- if it is customer service or direct client services, ideally the work should have very routine and predictable social interactions - if it’s boring or rote to others that would be better for me socially 

- ideally something where I spend a good amount of time alone 

- ideally something creative

- something I can pivot to without a stem undergrad degree but open to more education 

Idk, any ideas? Thanks in advance

1dtz1bl,Is phlebotomy a good job for someone who's restless and likes variety of duties ?,"I've always been interested in the medical field but never pursued it. Now I'm almost 41 and considering going back to school for something quick and concrete that pays the bills and the schooling is not long or too expensive and something I can easily get a job in. 

I've thought of lvn but it's one year at the place I'm looking at and it would cost $30,000 in loans. I'm already in so much debt and I don't want to take out more loans. So I'm looking for something that wouldn't involve a huge amount of loans and something that would ideally take me before to 6 weeks. 

Somebody had said phlebotomy but the thing is I like a variety of duties, I'm a self-diagnosed ADHD I really believe I have it because I get bored quickly and I'm restless. I worked a couple of office jobs and I found them really boring and I would get bored and depressed there and I just want to make sure that I wouldn't go to school for no reason and then hate the job duties. Also I do have a slight fear of needles and blood and I used to be a huge germ phobe and I was afraid of HIV and I heard that this career has high rates of that but I don't think that's really true anymore now that there's less and less people with it and it's also less transmittable now that the ones who do have it are on medicines am I correct?

 And like I said I'm not as afraid of it as I used to be now that I'm 40 and basically my life is half over anyway. But I am tired of going from job to job and I'm tired of never liking where I work. I worked as a teacher for a few years without a credential but they wanted me to go back and get my credential to keep it. I don't really enjoy teaching maybe it was the types of jobs I had. I continue to send teach to get by and that's more just day to day I never really get to know any of the students or schools or anything.

1dtyltt,What are some good jobs for criminals?,"As a former fraudster and criminal, I find it very hard to keep any job.

I became a criminal because I was severely abused, neglected and tortured as a child - and noone saved me, although many ""cps"" services saw it.

Due to that I feel absolutely no obligation or motivation to add value to the society that failed me. 

I also can't imagine having my worth ruined by a job. Due to the abuse I have very low self esteem but very high ego, so I can only imagine doing ""big"" things.

These 2 factors made it impossible for me to work (I tried A LOT) and so I turned to creating frauds, which was ""perfect"" for me.

But I want to be a good person. However I still can't get over the 2 factors. I am in intensive therapy but I need money now.

So, what are some jobs where I won't be rewarded for the value I bring, and where I won't be helping society?

1dtxnnr,Unpaid intern to potential Paid full-time. Is this a bad idea?,"I am a recent college graduate hoping to get my foot in the door for UX/UI design. I didn't realize I applied for an unpaid internship during my search. After the first interview, they said I can convert to a paid full-time position after a couple of months if I fit the team and do well in the role.

I think this project would be helpful for my portfolio because it focuses more on complex problems which I think my portfolio is lacking. I already have experience working for an unpaid internship and a bit of freelancing. The company I applied to is a startup. I don't want to lose out on the ability to work full-time, but I also don't want to be taken advantage of. I think the answer is obvious, but I would like to hear advice given how competitive getting an entry-level position would be.

Also, would it be a bad idea to ask what the salary may be this early when I haven't even started as an unpaid intern yet?

1dtwpts,New job stress and uncertainty. Manager left. I am new. Have no clue what I’m doing.,"Hey everyone, joined a new org been here for about 5 months now. It’s a wonderful place to work, I like what I’m doing, we make a OTC brand I’m in product development. It’s been hard understanding this large corporate company, but I get along really well with everyone and I’m starting to understand the lingo. Mind you this is my first real job, I worked at a start up for about a year. 
By my 4th month my manager quit. I have a team of just 2, me and one girl. We have been handling things well. Bjt this week has been a struggle. 
One meeting with marketing was jsut so hectic, trying to build a timeline for a project but I really don’t understand a lot. This is my first real project and I don’t know how long things take or the exaclt steps that need to be done and I don’t want to share the wrong info or worse- don’t want to flat out say I don’t have a damn clue!!! 
And another project I request things from our plant across the country but they are so difficult to work with. Info that I get from one person I put In my document and then when I present this to them they tell me all of it is wrong and that I need more info or more documents done which I have no clue what that’s about. The meeting I came in very confident to present what I need from them and everyone starts bickering and our engineer doesn’t want to go run this trial becuase he doesn’t think it is his job. I left the meeting with a lot more work to do and I am ok with that as I need a few more things. But the plant is so hard to deal with and that was one of the reasons why my manager left. 
We currently have no manager and I am feeling lost, confused, and overwhelmed. I have no clue what I’m doing honestly and I am so stressed out and can’t figure it out. 
The issue is hiring a new manager will take a few months, and the person now must learn about our product. It’s going to be a long time until we have someone to guide us. But I booked a 1 on 1 w my past managers manager just to talk to her about how I am feeling. Any advice on this? I don’t want to rant to her but I feel so much right now and everything is jsut a mess. I have no answers for people and I am at a loss for words in meetings.

1dtu7rw,Conflicting Performance Evaluation,"I am a professional with 15 years under my belt and I have never before been told that my communication is sub par or unprofessional or needs improvement. 

A couple of years ago, I left a corporate job for one in the public sector (local government, not elected position - I am a policy officer). I just received my 2nd annual performance evaluation. 

I am absolutely lost. 

In my first performance evaluation, my communication skills were rated as ""exceeding"" last year. This year, I am listed as ""needs improvement,"" but my collaboration and project management are at ""exceeding."" I have not changed how I communicate. I have not changed positions. I have not changed managers. 

I am a direct communicator. I prefer to use simple, easy to understand words. I do not write lengthy emails, if I can help it. I also ask questions, especially when unfamiliar with a particular topic or trying to cover bases. This post is a fair representation of my written and spoken communication.

My agency is undergoing significant change due to changes in funding, regulatory requirements, etc. I have noticed that people in leadership positions are often suspicious of me - likely because I'm ""new,"" look significantly younger than my age, and I don't hesitate to point out when things are out of compliance or illogical. I am never rude, and I never raise my voice at anyone - regardless of how they speak with me. I have also noticed that people in leadership get frustrated when I ask questions or when I cannot guess what it is they want. 

People in leadership have complained to my direct manager. 

I am so very confused. Perhaps, people in the public sector communicate differently than in private sector. I have only had positive responses from people I have directly worked with (lower level management) on various projects. The immediate feedback from direct ""clients"" to me is that I am very helpful and patient.

I typically get constructive feedback and am rarely awarded praise. This request for me to take additional courses was after I had asked for clarification on a certain topic, and was basically told as a response to take a bunch of courses. 

My review is in just a few weeks, and overall my time working here has been rough as I had to deal with a coworker my whole time here who had been working hard to get promoted and felt the need to make me look incompetent and make themselves look extremely competent in order to promote themselves (they were successfully promoted recently, and it felt like my “incompetence” was a way for them to get up the ladder). They would actually call me out when i made mistakes in the beginning and i went to my managers about it and they basically did the corporate speak of “tough luck she stays and u have to deal with it”. 

Additionally, I will work on projects and sometimes not be included on key calls with outside groups (engineers or product people usually) to discuss. It will be my manager (the person who now got promoted to that) and director on those calls even though i did the work.

I am planning on countering but this is my first time. How does my first rough draft email template look? Open to any and all suggestions.

Note: The initial offer was 70k

Dear \[Recruiter's Name\],

Thank you very much for extending the offer for the \[Job Title\] position. I am very excited about the opportunity to join XYZ Company and contribute to the team.

After going through the interview process and learning more about the role, I understand that I will be taking on responsibilities previously held by \[employee\] as Onboarding Manager. This includes onboarding and integrating new customers, acting as a subject matter expert and Solutions Engineer to train customers and perform demos, creating training documentation, and providing technical support as a Support Specialist. Given these combined responsibilities, I am targeting a salary in the range of $80,000 to $85,000.

I bring over 5 years of technical support experience, with 4 of those years specifically focused on customer-facing Software as a Service (SaaS) support. In my previous roles, I have worked closely with Onboarding and Implementation Managers to drive success for both new and existing customers. Additionally, I have experience joining smaller support teams and building processes that create significant impact, both externally to best support our customers and internally to strengthen the team.

I am confident that my skills and experience align well with the requirements of this position and that I can make a valuable contribution to Syncware. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of joining your team and look forward to discussing this further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

This is being positioned as “we were able to guarantee your job until next year” but I can’t help but think this is their way of getting our best work out of us and then letting us go when they’ve found suitable replacements.

Here is where I need some guidance: I am extremely demotivated and am wondering if anyone has been in this situation. Any advice on how to stay afloat while morale is tanking?

Some other details that might matter:
- They’ve offered relocation assistance (financial and otherwise), but the cost of living is higher than where most of us are coming from and we won’t get a wage increase. 
- They won’t give us anything in writing about how long our jobs would be guaranteed if we did move.
- All of the departments being asked to move have been working remotely together for years.

1dtrtuy,Got a disappointing pay raise after a glowing performance review. ,"I recently got promoted and heard about my pay rise today which is disappointing, to say the least. It's more in line with a standard annual raise (around 9%) than promotion money. My disappointment was exacerbated when I learned a colleague was offered just a little bit more - 9.5% despite making half the numbers I made last year. For further context, he was refused a raise last year based on poor performance so maybe this is an effort to incentivise. But still entirely unfair to me. Do you have any advice? Is there a way I can push back or ask for clarity on the discrepancy between what was offered to him and me?

","Hey guys, first timer here. Felt like reaching out today, and was like ""why not ask those who have already been through what I'm struggling with?"", so yea, here I am. I'm Luke, 21yo Italian guy, who's trying to find out what my next step in life should be. I have lots of goals in mind, and things I wanna accomplish by 2026 (health and wealth), but I'm constantly trying to understand what to do. I was originally a tech student (was really into cybersec back in the day). Then I lost interest in it for some reason. I also used to be an affiliate marketer. Made good money off of it at 19. Then got into sales (craigslist, eBay, you name it), but didn't like it since it was monotonous (I was basically selling used stuff every day and didn't help me learn anything new). I love coming up with ideas. I love helping people. Love reading books as well as contributing to society. today I had one guy tell me how appreciative he was of what I said to him. He was on the cusp of shutting down his discord server, but my words made him reflect his decisions and decided not to close it. He then reached out to say thanks. It really warmed my heart. I love psychology, talking to people, sales, and stuff that makes me learn new things every day. I'm not looking for a job where I'm doing the same thing over and over again. That's not me. I picked up copywriting 3 months ago. Felt cool at first, but given the fact that I was always behind a desk and a behind the scenes type of guy, I instantly lost my passion for it, although I found one client and worked for them. Still, I didn't feel accomplished and satisfied. I don't know why. It's been a month since I've been second guessing things. I don't know what to do now. Part of me says to go to college and study psychology, but ofc if I do I wouldn't be able to reach my goals by 2026. Another part of me says to do something else. I don't know what to do and there's nothing to this day that truly gives me a sense of satisfaction. Some dude told me to just get the needle moving, do things and adapt to them as they come. In my case, it'd be going to college, moving to another city, which I think I extremely need rn, push myself every day, and most importantly, network with someone in person (I need that so bad too). I've been procrastinating so bad lately. I just don't want to waste 3 more years of my life going to college, studying something I may not need in the future (I don't wanna work for anyone but myself), and stuff like that.

Alright should I pursue a masters in Embedded or VLSI/Microelectronics ?

Keeping my interests and what I'm good at aside. 
I do know that India is forecasted to have a good run with semiconductors but how much will it impact jobs ? 
I still see many product companies like amd, arm outsourcing VLSI jobs to service based companies in india. 

And if we talk about salaries and growth. Will I be better off with VLSI in 10 years ? 

Isn't the market too cluttered with Software Developers ? And isn't embedded just SDE with a few extra steps ? (Atleast that's what a friend told me) 

I have an admission letter at hand for a college for Mtech in embedded and now I'm having second thoughts if it'll be worth it.

Should I just wait another year and try to get into VLSI ??

I can't seem to make a decision as I'm equally biased and love both sides of the coin. 
I know I would love doing either one of the career paths. 
So, what actually stands in my way is the growth and salary in INDIA.

For that reason, I created a new set of practice exams specifically designed to help others learn their rights, and what providers and health insurance plans are required to do in accordance with HIPAA regulations.

1dtnxnn,I’m thinking about pivoting from finance to marketing. Can you guys give me your thoughts? ,"
Title says it how it is 

I’m finishing up undergrad and I haven’t enjoyed my finance classes. I haven’t found any finance-related careers that interest me. Everyone else graduating with my degree seems to be locked in on a career (banking, consulting, FP&A, etc.), yet I can’t see myself doing any of it. 

*Here is why I am thinking marketing:*

- I enjoyed my intro to marketing class

- I liked learning about consumers and creating a brand 

- I run the largest club at my university. I have always loved doing the marketing and I really dislike doing financial/tax/treasury stuff.

- I like the creativity

- seemingly better WL balance than most finance careers

- I tend to get along more with the average person in marketing vs the average person in finance. The finance bro stereotypes are hilariously real and that is not my crowd whatsoever

- i would feel closer to the product

- I’m kinda bad at math lol. Finance doesn’t come easy to me

*Here is why I’m hesitant:*

- it’s no secret I could make more $ in finance. However $ is not my end-all-be-all. I just unfortunately have the expensive hobby of building cars and I want to be able to support that hobby. 

- insecurity. Make fun of me, but it’s a real part of my decision. I know it’s dumb, but there aren’t a lot of men in the marketing program at my school and I would feel out of place. I’ve also received judgement from people when I tell them I’m thinking about switching to marketing. 

- regrets later in life. I fear later in life I’ll regret not starting a career in finance as it feels like a more mature career. I don’t know haha

I spoke to my current manager and was given their support on the move.  I’m a team of one in my current role, so was told there would be a longer transition to the role (many months) in training my replacement. I checked in a few times to ask on whether I needed to interview (no), salary expectations (radio silence), and next steps and there was always some reason this was being postponed (legitimate reasons). Fast forward 5 months and I reached out to the new manager because she was confirming I was still interested (I said yes) and they are now posting my job (which I pretty much wrote).

I have 3 years experience in in house Tax department, completed CA and have a master degree in accounting. I am considering changing my career to FP&A.

I have been looking for a new job as a Financial or Management Accountant for an easier transition, then moving to FP&A in the future. However, the job search process doesn't give much result.

What do you think is the best way to progress my career to FP&A?

* Go to public accounting with job that can bring experience such insolvency, audit, forensic, so it is more aligned to FP&A career path.
* Move to junior accounting role such as assistant accountant, progress into financial/management accountant then FP&A.
* Continuing working in tax with additional study to become a Certified Global Management Accountant (CGMA), then slowly moving to FP&A role.

Very quick background: Software Engineer out of college job. Full time for the past 1.5 years.

This company has a ""tradition"" of doing raises in July ish time. Somewhere around the middle of the summer. After the first half a year, when the time for raises changed, I was ""not eligible"" because I just got my full time offer and it technically wasn't 6 months since I started. 

Now a year since then has passed and I haven't gotten any type of raise. It seems like my boss is pretty happy with me and I can definitely say that I learned a lot during the year and have more knowledge and specific tech we are using. Should I wait until this raises time comes or should I bring it up to my boss? The thing is, I do enjoy my job and I feel like I am happy with my pay, but also I keep hearing from people around me how they got a raise already even though they worked there for not even 6 months. My company is very corporate in terms of the processes and it feels like even if I ask, the answer will be ""wait until around a month and we will talk"", but at the same time my boss is really nice and I have a feeling that if I do say something, he will try to help.

I am a bachelors student studying in Australia. I am about to graduate with a Bachelors in Biomedical science. I have been to numerous counselling sessions, open conferences and had talks about whether going into research is worth it.

I understand it’s tricky and it is a lot of work for very little money (depends on grants). I was thinking of doing masters and a PhD.
My main goal is to be a professor and so I have heard that to be a professor I need to do research first (Post doc etc). 

I just wanted to ask fellow researchers/scientists here, is the pay good? What keeps you motivated to not give up? What if the experiment you were working on for years wasn’t correct or rejected, how did you take it?
What other pathways can I focus on if not research.

1dtk3fn,Should I do this PhD ?,"*(field of career : science, scientific researcher, thesis, PhD, biology, marine biology)*

Hi everyone!

I am (F22) finishing my studies this year and I don’t really know where i’m going. I’m going to explain all of this a little bit:

- I have a Bachelor degree in molecular and cellular biology

- And recently, I graduated from my Master degree in biomechanics, biomaterials and health

Since my third-grade, I was attracted by prothesis, robot arms and legs, and helping people missing limbs. I remained in this path during my studies, explaining why I did biology then biomechanics. 

I also had the chance to work during summers and two of them in an aquarium (also a scientific and veterinary center) as a saleswoman in the souvenir shop. It allowed me to meet the scientific mediators, to learn more about the ocean, its different ecosystems, its role and about its flora and fauna. I already loved marine biology since I was little (I am living next to the sea, my grandpa was a fisherman, …) but I never tought about going into marine biology as a job. 

Annnnnnd now… I can apply to two PhD, one about coral reefs and the other one on mangroves. There are my favorites ecosystems when it comes to marine biology and my family, friends, and internship’s colleagues told me to send my application. But I have some doubts : will this PhD be useful for me ?

I know that:  
- I want to contribute to the protection, preservation and restauration of ecosystems.  
- I want to be outside, to do concrete actions for it, not to be stuck behind a desk 24h/24h, everyday at work.   
- I want to be useful in this fight against global warming (Even if I have no ambition to revolutionize the world), not just in my personnal life, also in my professionnal life.  
- I don’t really want to be an university lecturer and researcher (that’s the classic path in France)

Soooo i don’t really know if a PhD is worth it. Can it be another string to my bow ? Will it be easier for me to go in the protection or restauration of ecosystems (coral reefs for example) in the field with a PhD in this domain ? Or to do science popularization in aquarium, museums, etc, …

Also, another part of me thinks that working in a grocery store will be wayyyy more easier than asking myself all of these questions but I might regret the decision of not asking them and not taking my chance to apply if there are any hahaha

If you have any advice, please, don’t hesitate! 

Thanks in advance

One of them was "" Nights and weekends are mandatory, can you work nights and weekends?"". The store closes at 10 pm. I have insomnia and ocd which means I have a rigid night time routine that I have to keep so that I don't have a bad episode and I need to start getting ready to sleep around 8:30. The interview is tomorrow and I don't know what to tell them because I feel like jobs won't take insomnia seriously. The good thing is that I can work any day of the week so I have that on my side. If I get home that late I'll still feel wired and probably won't sleep. I have no problem staying until 7 or 8 but 10 is too late .

1dtiji7,Should I quit my first UI/UX design job? I already miss the old design company.,"TLDR: 24yo, recent graduate. I am in dilemma of resigning after just 3 weeks in the UI/UX design small company job. I not sure their way of working is truly UI/UX, and I don't feel the friendly vibe from my senior nor is the atmosphere feel friendly. I still can bail out as I still hold the part time position at old company, it is more like they will ask me if I am free to do the work for them so it's kinda like few months and get one project type of job. The full time in my old company kinda filled but there is still chance. I am not in financial crisis or anything as I live with parents so there's that. Should I listen to the distress of my heart or keep going for few months until I fit in?

Hello, so for context I am a recent fresh graduate in Malaysia. I used to work as intern in a normal graphic design company and work remotely part-time for them as well after I graduate as I take some time to relax. Why I didn't go full time there? It is because it was far like 1 hour 30 minute per commute but at least I was using public transport. I live comfortably with parents for now and I usually back home with 1 hour of free time not counting eating or bathing.

The reason I change to UI/UX design is because I still young so I want to try something that I always want to try and ngl it is about money as well. The company I found and accepted in also near to my place, go to the office by driving 30 minutes and back in 1 hour if there is traffic congestion. But now I feel it is more stressful than what I thought

Now the main point is... 3 weeks in I feel like I am not fitting in the company well. It is a small company and there is only 1 senior I have to face him everyday. The onboarding was really tame, and I am instructed to study material design and human interface guideline under 3 days and the next week I already start on a medium size project.

I am also not sure if this is really UI/UX design job... Because I need to add additional function to a in house software. There are no wireframing, only high fidelity mockup of previous work. I have to follow the material design guideline in spacing and also the company way of arranging the layers. There is no corporate identity, only follow the material design and their old works...

The office atmosphere is not really friendly, everyone is so quiet with one desk far from each other despite sitting on the same desk. The senior is not really friendly... On second week he keep telling me the design is not that good and when I ask back how it should he told me to figure out myself. And he also always explain in unfriendly tone and there are so many internal feedback. After 3 weeks, today he final teach me how they doing the layer grouping in 1 hour. And I have to show the work at 8am tomorrow. Which mean I have to OT, and they dont pay for OT. I asked in interview if they OT a lot, they just told me they back on time but if there are task then we have to bring back home and there is not OT payment. The annual leave system needs go through 4 persons. HR, 2 managers and boss despite being a small company, they are actually under a big sister company that is controlled by a boss.

Although my intern job was far, but at least I was kinda not feel hopeless at there, the seniors are friendly. And they do have OT payment or leave, their benefits much better despite being lower salary like $500\~$300 than my current job. At least I dont think about my work at home.

So now I kinda in a dilemma, should I quit my current job as soon as possible since it is probation period? And I still have chance to go back to my old company as I was still their part time worker, although their full time position might be filled. Should I wait for 3 more months until my probation end? Should I just fit in and keep trying at the current company? Now I dont even do anything I like during free time, I have to work a bit after work.",DesignerMundane,0,0.5,1,1719916126,2024-07-02 10:28:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dtiji7/should_i_quit_my_first_uiux_design_job_i_already/,7,2024

1dti42c,Burnt out on changing careers/trying to find my passion. Help? ,"I'm 28 years old and currently hold a B.B.A. in Accounting, which I just received in May of 2023. I quickly got an auditing job because I have this mentality that I just HAD to get into something as quickly as possible that had to do with my degree. Is this because I would care what people thought about me not doing something with my degree and be seen as a ""failure""? Probably. Anyway, I and hated that job. It took such a toll on my mental health, so I began looking at other career paths (I know - I am one to rush into things, hence why I'm making this post) and ended up in a MAT program for Elementary Ed last semester. I had always wanted to be a teacher, but it was never the ""I can't see myself as anything else"" attitude. I didn't even seriously entertain that thought until last semester when I realized I could do an option 6 degree while working full-time. I enjoy subbing, the coursework, etc., but I am already feeling very discouraged/burnt out and I am barely 15 credits in! (I think this is where I was already so burnt out from my bachelor's, but I also realize I shouldn't have rushed into something new.) I am thinking of dropping a summer class to take a breather right now because I feel like I have rushed into something that I may not even get to finish.

I have always been searching for a greater purpose in a career. I have left great jobs because of this. I just want to be something more than an employee at a company, but I am so burnt out on everything that I am barely hanging on. I feel like I could find a good clerk/assistant job, but something in me is making me go further and not allowing me to rest. I am just so confused right now and want to drop college for now, but I've already started and I don't want to be seen as a quitter. I am also terrified of maybe regretting it later.  

I suppose the purpose of this post is to ask for any advice that people may have who went/are going through similar situations. What is your experience on being burnt out on searching for your ""purpose""/career? How do you cope with not knowing what you want to do? Any advice is so appreciated because I am so lost. TIA.

1dthml3,How to propose an irregular form of compensation ,"29M work in tech making 120K. When I was hired I convinced the executive team that my strengths were not just in my experience as a design engineer but as a coder for building custom plug-ins and tools within our design software. They loved the idea and half my duties are in design and the other half are in software development. 

I managed to get the plugin I pitched from concept to deployment to the production team within 6 months without any help internally. Because of this, they seem to think I am some software genius and want to use my skills to grow the company

The CEO approached me wanting to give me an officer title and charge me with leading the company in incorporating A.I. into all departments and outlined a few projects he wants me to complete as a starting point. 

I explained to him that it's not that simple but because of the relatively small size of the company, I am more than up for the task. In order to get a respectable system in place I would need to setup SQL databases, servers for hosting and/or cloud computing, data analytics ect. All of which I'm not 100% familiar with but know enough to be confident in my ability to deliver. 

I am pretty well versed in renegotiating pay and would normally have no problem telling them how much it's gonna cost them to get me to do this. Admittedly, I would probably do this without any significant pay bump cause I am totally amped at the idea and how it will transform my career. But I want them to understand that a larger company, this would involve an interdisciplinary team of data engineers and ML scientists working collaboratively to execute these projects.

Because of this wild ask I also have a wild request. I want a slice of a the pie. What would be the best way of bringing up to the CEO that I want a piece of the companies profits. Essentially Im planning on pitching that if the company passes the revenue metrics year over year that I would get a percentage of the revenue/profits plus a 6 percent pay bump just so I don't feel like a sucker for the first year or so. But I also want to ask for other things like a car or paying off my student loans.

I wasn't particularly good at it in university and thought I wouldn't be able to make a career of it but I did manage to find a job that's well paid and I got good at it. However the job is a bit of a dead end in my country and I don't have much hope of landing anything remote from another country as although I am good at the job I am not really a senior as there is no way to learn the stuff required for senior position at this firm. I am stuck at what I can do with my career. The management is also quite bad and they are now forcing me to do some other work than what  I usually do so I don't enjoy the job at all currently but the money is very very good.  


I may have the opportunity to switch to another job however I am not sure what the opportunities to progress there will be or if I decide to leave it as it is also a bit niche for my country and will be making less money. My other option is to try and move to software development (currently working with hardware) but I think for that I will probably have to completely leave my current job rely on my savings and maybe have a few months or a year studying and job hunting but will probably have much more opportunities in the future if I do manage to get into software.

I am currently making enough money to not have to worry about anything financially at life but I feel disappointed and disinterested in my day to day work and that's making me depressed. On the other hand I am worried if I leave my current job I am worried about the financial side of things.

1dte1lb,What to do when a senior colleague belittles(?) you? HELP!,"I'm not sure how to handle this anymore... it's been over 1 year at the company I started. I've been working here for about 1.5 years (started last January) and my senior coworker had started 2 months after me. We were both new to the team and the guy refuses to allow me to help him with any projects or even hand over some of this smaller projects to me when our supervisor asks him to hand over projects to me.

1 ) We both started at an operating company - he was hired as a senior staff member two months after I was hired as a junior analyst. We were both hired as contractors but he got a permanent position before I did. When we both started at the company, the previous senior coworker left the team and the other one was on mat leave. So it was both of us newbies working on the team. We both work on projects in various states. He primarily leads projects in California. I lead projects in Montana, Alaska, and Michigan. While most of our company assets are in California, quite a few are in the other states. Because we were short-staffed, I was asked to lead projects in the other states that were meant to be led by senior employees and take on that responsibility. I had to learn everything myself pretty much and no one helped train me. So I spent hours reviewing previous work, reading through any guidelines I could find and teaching myself how to complete those projects that I was handed over. Very rarely did I ask for help. Anyways, this senior colleague is under the impression that I was trained for an entire month before he started working at our company and this is why I'm so good at that job. When I told him that I wasn't even properly trained because 2 weeks after joining, the senior employee who was on the team left. So I had to teach myself things. Then he told me, ""I don't believe that one bit. You are lying.""

2) One time, I had received a link to some training that another department sent over. He didn't receive the link and I didn't know it. So after we found out I received it but he didn't, he then started accusing me of being dishonest with him and told me that I was lying and he didn't trust me one bit.

3) Every time we are near other employees at the company, he always states that he is the one who does all the other work on the team and he's managing all projects even though I'm LITERALLY standing right next to him and we both work on the SAME team and I've been handed projects within other states and also working on the same projects just in different states. He refuses to introduce me to other people and pretend that I don't exist. We sometimes hire consultants to do some work for our projects, and he does the same thing with them. Once we had a lunch with a consultant and I had to leave early during that lunch as I had a meeting. I found out from a coworker (who happens to know of one the consultants personally as a friend) that, once I left that lunch early, my senior team member basically portrayed me as an assistant on the team and nothing much... he was doing most of the work.

4) He refuses to allow me to help him with any of his projects. He likes to hoard onto projects and every time my supervisor asks me to reach out to him and help him with some projects that he has, he refuses to allow me to help. It got to a point where my supervisor will ask me to take on some of his complex projects in California as she thought it would be good cross-training for me and he could be the senior supervisor ...and he would tell my supervisor that he would hand them over. Then when I would approach him to go over the project handover, he would tell me that he's busy and will likely not require my help. He told me that the summer student was helping him and that he didn't require any of my assistance... maybe he'll reach out to me if he needs my assistance for the more ""basic"" stuff that the summer student was already helping him with anyways. I told him that I would eventually need to learn more than just the basic stuff which was why our supervisor told me that I should take over the project, especially since he was overloaded with work, and that would be a good opportunity for me to learn and also help the team. He then said, ""Yeah, I get that. I'll let you know once I get my stuff organized."" Then he completely avoids me and tries to avoid handing over his project. He then tells me a few days later, ""It doesn't make sense for you to do this project. I can do this project faster and efficiently - it's a waste of time having to teach you since you'll have lots of questions and the time I spent answering those questions, I can just finish the task myself.""

5) Whenever I get handed a mini project in California, he's always asking me, ""Oh, why do you have this project?! This is California!"" -.- Like dude, our supervisor told me to take it on and I'm working on it!

6) Our boss hired another senior contractor last year. Him and her got a long well. She had the same knowledge level as I did but because she had years of project management experience over me, she got a senior contractor role. Anways, he was not thrilled to hear that I got a permanent offer to as a junior on the team instead of her being a permanent senior employee. He kept telling me how he didn't understand why she was the one who wasn't chosen to be permanent.

7) He does not have the background knowledge on regulators to lead projects in Montana, Alaska, and Michigan and I know all those states including a bit of California. So he's always frustrated about that. Also, his knowledge on California when he first started working at the company wasn't all that great either - I taught him some stuff on California that I had learned while I was at the company before he joined. He keeps telling me how he can't have me helping him with California because he needs to know more than me. Then he would tell me how I was a faster learner than him so he needed to learn everything first before I got involved in those projects.

8) He even went far as asking me what my educational background was and told me how I probably made more money than him since I had an engineering degree and he only had an arts degree. I'm a damn junior employee and he's the senior!!! -.-

Now my supervisor wants me to take some projects from him and learn from him on California so I can start helping with more projects but his guy is refusing to let me take on any of his California projects and will not teach me at all. I'm not sure what to do anymore?! My supervisor thinks I'm getting along well with my coworker but he's refusing to work as a team. I feel like he sees me as a threat and that if he teaches me, then I will know more than him. My boss told me to train him on work for states I've been working in for projects and I've taught him everything I can but he refuses to cross-train me. I'm not sure what to do.... My supervisor doesn't know any of this. :(",thatnomadicgirl,1,1.0,0,1719897528,2024-07-02 05:18:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dte1lb/what_to_do_when_a_senior_colleague_belittles_you/,7,2024

1dtdnvr,Asked to work 60h+/week at new job,"Hi, I recently graduated with a bachelor's in CS, and I signed an offer letter with a startup in San Francisco. I was very excited, my girlfriend and I just moved to SF (1 year lease, spent a lot on moving in, like security deposit, furniture, ...). My girlfriend doesn't have a full time offer yet but she just started 2 part time contracts which bring in about 3k/month.

Today was my first day and I was super excited coming in. But they told me they expect me to work 10-11h days, 6 days a week (in person everyday). I don't even get holidays like the 4th of July it seems. They were acting like me getting the Sunday off was a huge sacrifice on their part.

To be fair the co-founders work 12-14h a day and 7 days a week. But I have a bike ride home and I want a work life balance. The thought of barely getting time to make dinner before I have to go to sleep, and just one day a week where I probably won't have the energy to go out and experience my youth makes me pretty depressed.

The salary is $125,000 with 10k signing bonus (which I haven't received yet, and have to give back if I leave before 1 year) plus 0.5% vested over 4 years. I checked and I'm an exempt employee meaning I can't ask for overtime pay. It's also at-will employment so I guess they can fire me for demanding less hours if they please.

Btw the contract didn't mention anything about work hours or work days.

I got really good vibes from the co-founders at first, they're only like 1-2 years older than me and I knew I'd have to work hard but thought it would be a good time.

I'm not sure what to do, this is my first day at a full time position and I already feel like I'm going to burnout.

I'd really appreciate advice on handling the situation.
I feel like I want to be strict about my work life balance, but there is a lot on the line financially if I lose this job.

1dtbqyg,Wife was denied additional 2 days off for our honeymoon after already postponing a year. ,"Me and my wife recently got married last year. 
She does not get much vacation time, So we decided it would be best to wait a year to take our honeymoon after some pushback from her boss. (We only took 1 week for our destination wedding.)

We decided to book our honeymoon for our anniversary, recently my wife put in her request for 2 weeks of pto 8 months in advance and it was approved. 

Now we are 6 months out from our honeymoon and we Just found out The last day we are in the country we are traveling to for our honeymoon is going to be a major holiday there that we had never heard of. 

When looking at flights, if we rebook the flight to leave 2 days later it would save us $600 and we would be able to enjoy this local holiday. 

Me and my wife asked our jobs for an extra 2 days off and I was approved but my wife was instantly denied. 

Her office manager was very rude and condescending, My wife felt as if she tried to shame her for requesting these extra 2 days for our honeymoon. Her boss said she was lucky she even got the two weeks approved and that she was too valuable to receive this much time off.

Immediately after this meeting her supervisor went home early and then took a 4-day weekend, and the Office manager who just denied her request went on a week-long vacation. 

They claim my wife is so valuable but they have not given her a raise in 2 years. 

I am absolutely so frustrated that they would treat her like this, especially considering she has the most seniority besides the supervisor and manager, and my wife has to cover for whoever is out on vacation but it's impossible for them to do it for her for an extra 2 days. 

As far as she is aware, her company does not have a policy against taking more than 2 weeks off at a time, but one of the two extra days she requested would be unpaid. Again, My wife does not believe her company has a policy stating she cannot take unpaid time off. 

The job market is very bad where we are but my wife is looking, although she would ideally not like to leave this job. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on a workaround or way to approach her boss/company and see if they can reconsider? 

I know the right answer would be to suck it up and not take the extra 2 days but the whole situation just rubbed us both the wrong way, especially after postponing our honeymoon for a year to accommodate her job, and we have not taken a vacation since our wedding.

1dt9o3j,Full Time Youtuber looking for a career change. It's just way too volatile to be relying on financially.,"Im 23 now and have been doing youtube full time for 2 years now but am ready for a career change. Long story short I had no idea what I was getting myself into with pursuing Youtube as a career. The algorithm, is extremely volatile.

One moment your channel can be doing very well and then the next moment it's completely dead. I went from making 5-7k a month on average last year to this year only making 2k a month maximum.

Back in November of last year my views just completely dropped out of nowhere and thus my income was cut over 50% as well. I imagine it was due to increased competition in my niche but also algorithm changes by Youtube. Being a full time youtuber isn't what it seems at all. Your income is extremely volatile, youre at the mercy of a very unpredictable and volatile algorithm, and you can get no benefits from it(medical , health etc.).

During this journey I've been in college thankfully but the problem is I don't even know what career I would have interest in pursuing in the workforce. The major im doing right now(Data Science) was a major I chose just to have a degree in something due to parental pressure to finish school and I don't have any interest in becoming a data analyst or anything like that.

I have only like 30 credits left for the major so it makes sense for me to complete it rater than start something else. Im a very introverted person and like to work by myself.

1dt7dw4,Advice about new potential position,"I have been working as a contractor for the last 18months at a wonderful company and I absolutely love it. I have been very successful in my role, and get great feedback from senior management. Honestly, I’ve also had a few bumpy interactions- I have ADHD and can be seen as a bit “full on” on occasion. But I have been able to resolve any minor conflicts and have a very good working relationship with my peers and management. For the most part, it has been really great and I’ve delivered multiple projects - even saving some from disaster. 


My contract is up for renewal in August, and there has been talk about me moving into a different role, one that was originally pitched to me as a promotion, but now it seems it’s more of a sideways move (same job grade and seniority in title) - but as an employee, not contractor so I get the “bonus” of a significant pay cut. 


This new role hasn’t been confirmed yet, but yesterday the company I contract through advised me that my contract won’t be renewed. I now feel really out on my ass. 
I’d like to send a message to the new manager (who I have a good relationship with) to ask if she would consider taking me into the proposed role as a contractor so I don’t lose ~25% of my pay, or if the role can be changed to a more senior role, so that it is some benefit for me. I’m also very concerned about shooting myself in the foot, I seem to receive a lot of career “promises” that never come to fruition.  


I really like the company and I want to stay, but I’m also a single mum with three children, so a big pay cut without at least a career progression incentive seems stupid. Yes, I could get an other contracting role somewhere else, but I feel a strong sense of belonging here and they are wonderful with WFH flexibility to support families. 

Any advice?

I have culinary experience through my schools program as I did that for 2 years with an officer position my senior year.

I’ve been a regular at this restaurant ever since it opened up and it is literally my favorite restaurant.

Thing is, the only posting they have about job openings is on their door.

Do I walk in and just hand them my resume?
Do I call their number and say something (?)

I have a letter of recommendation from my culinary instructor and I have my food handlers card. I also have a cover letter as well.
I have those things prepared because that’s what we learned to prepare as part of the curriculum for the culinary class. Should I provide any of it? 

I have no idea what to do but I really want the job or any job. They have a line cook opening and I’d really prefer that over being a server. I’m more fond of back of the house rather than front of the house.

1dt61dq,Seeing advice or perspective on career paths? ,"I am at a time where I am looking for a better career and opportunity for myself and also my wife and son. In 2021 I applied to a Air Traffic Control bid and it has been a very long process due to me being Tier 2’d on the MMPI test but I am at the point now where I should be evaluated soon as given a start date assuming everything goes to plan. However, in April of this year I applied to my local union hall for an Elevator Mechanic apprenticeship. I have passed the aptitude test and passed my interview now I am on the hiring list waiting to be called. These are obviously two very different career paths with two very different work loads and responsibilities. I have enjoyed aviation since I was a kid but I could also see being a mechanic due to liking hands on work and most of my work experience has been with tools and with more manual labor. I have researched the ATC career and have seen it to be a great opportunity overall but I’ve also seen it to be somewhat neglected in terms of pay versus the workload. The Elevator Mechanic trade I have read is overall a very promising opportunity as well with some negatives as well, just like any other job. Anyone have any opinions or commentary on which would be the overall better choice? I enjoy getting other people’s perspectives, experiences or suggestions on things so anything is welcomed. It obviously boils down to me as a person and what I want but maybe there is a controller or mechanic in here that could give me some POSITIVE insight? Or even someone not in these two trades who are successful that may have some general advice for me? Thanks.

I used to think it was not “the most fulfilling” job but hey, it paid the bills! It now feels like a drag everyday. Importance on random things that don’t matter. Unhelpful people giving themselves status because they work in tech/finance. Pressure to crunch to finish deadlines so that project X is delivered on time.

1dt3rb3,Should I leave my job because I ran out of pto?,"Hi everyone, looking for some advice. 

My job has vacation time and sick time put together as PTO that I accrue over the year. I got about 3 weeks of vacation because I transitioned from part time to full time after graduating college (yay). 

I’ve already have exhausted a good chunk of my PTO for vacations, family emergencies, and for being sick. I found out recently that I only had about 34 hours left of PTO, after putting time in for vacation which would have been 8 business days. 

I understand that it was my responsibility to know my time and also use it responsibly. However, since I have that vacation planned in two weeks, I will be using the remaining of my PTO for the year. This means if I get sick, have another family emergency, or even an interview, I am not able to get paid for the time. Sure, I could use unpaid time off, but I apparently can get approved for 3 days out of the year for that unpaid time. I guess I would get terminated or something if I called out for any reason after using that time. 

I recently had a job interview (took a day off for that one), and I think everything went really great! So I might have something lined up if they decide to continue with me. 

I don’t want to risk getting sick later in the year and have to call out and have no time to cover it. I would also owe my job money for probably using too much time if I took my vacation. I don’t mind having to pay them, but it would be ideal to avoid it. 

Would it be a smart idea to leave my job and keep searching until I find a new one? ",defrences,0,0.5,2,1719867171,2024-07-01 20:52:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dt3rb3/should_i_leave_my_job_because_i_ran_out_of_pto/,7,2024
1dt3pk2,Are any of these beliefs I have about work very unprofessional in your opinion?,"I truly don't mind if someone says they are, I'm just curious:

1. As long as you're not creating a safety hazard, hurting the reputation of another coworker, or creating a financial issue, I don't believe it matters if someone does things with 100% accuracy at work. For example, say some wrote a report with a font that seems uncommon and it looks a little strange. I personally wouldn't complain at all. Since, you can just change the font in like 5 seconds if you're asked to.

2. I don't believe it matters at all if someone has typos in messages or emails sometimes. Everyone makes mistakes in my view. Whenever a coworker does this I don't care.

3. I think it's ok to take advantage of the company you work for sometimes. Since, in my view, I feel like most companies probably take advantage of employees. An example could be I think it's perfectly fine if someone fake works at work sometimes. Another example could be taking extra pizza at company pizza party.

4. I don't believe it matters if someone has a profile picture at work. My reasoning is because I feel like people can just walk up to people and see them. Once you see someone in real life once you know who they are.

5. I kind of think it doesn't matter at all really how someone dresses at work. If someone wears a t shirt or collared button down shirt I view them the same way.

Would you highly recommend I change my view on any of these things?

1dt2ypt,Why were my hours cut at a new job? I had half of my hours cut after being there only 2 weeks!,"I was promised f/t hours by the main manager at my current job. I needed benefits. The first month I worked 4 days a week & 32 hours a week.

The second month, this month, I’m only working 2 days a week, 16 hours a week. Also, I’m only working 7 days the entire month!!!!

Why? I don’t think that I did anything wrong unless you can count me requesting 3 days off for personal reasons that I can’t get out of. I get those days off. 

The main manager didn’t get back to me but a case manager did. They gave me the days off but I wasn’t told I got those days off. I saw that I wasn’t scheduled those days anymore when the schedule came out. 

I was one minute late to clock in a few times because the app is slow. 

Also, I had 2 clients the first month. I got two new clients this month. I’m a care taker. 

This month I’m no longer going to be working with one of my original clients.

I asked them why & they didn’t tell me anything yet. So I don’t know if that client complained about me or not. He got annoyed with me once. 

I haven’t had any issues with him though aside from that. He barely talked to me & he stayed in his room most of the time.

He never said anything negative to me. He is an angry person though. He’s always screaming about something in his room. 

One of his roomates doesnt like me. She always ignores me. She’s friends with one of the managers there who does the scheduling. 

She’s not my client though. I worked with a few other employees & maybe they complained about me? 

If they did, I wouldn’t be scheduled for that house again or with them probably. I don’t have a problem with anyone. Most of them say hi to me.

I still have one original client at the same place. I taked to some of my coworkers & clients & they said they hired a bunch of new people & that other employees have complained about their hours being cut too. 

I don’t understand why I was offered f/t hours then had what I did get cut in half. 

I’m going to try to talk to the managers in person on soon. One of them said she’ll talk to the main manager about my hours. 

I said that I can work different shifts so I was told that will increase my chances of getting more hours supposedly. 

The main manager is blowing me off it feels like as he doesn’t answer questions, is vague, says to email him then ignores me.

Today he’s in meetings until I get off work all day! Why are they doing this to me? 

Why did the main manager not keep his word? He shouldn’t have promised me f/t hours if it wasn’t available! I was already hired at that point. 

I don’t understand why they’d hire a bunch of new people when they don’t have enough hours for the current employees.

1dsy8cp,Forced to resign (help please),"Hi everyone. 

I’m hoping to get some advice here. I started a new job in February and 8 weeks ago I’ve had to go off on sick due to unexpected emergency spinal surgery. I’ve done everything correctly supplied fit notes from my hospital had calls with my boss to keep them in the loop with my recovery. 

My estimated recovery was for anything up to a year but I was advised I may be able to go back to work on light duties after about 12-14 weeks. 

Last week a had an unexpected phone call from my boss asking for an update.This was completely out of the blue and not booked in like all my other calls have been. She asked me about my recovery and my mental health (this has been rock bottom at the moment with everything going on) and told me realistically I won’t be coming back within the next two weeks so what do I want to do? I replied with I still have four weeks left on my fit note and I’ll be seeing my  surgeons  at my next check up and will determine if I’m fit to return to work. 

In a round about way she said realistically I won’t be back within the next two weeks so I need to make a decision that’s best for me and my recovery and how not having the strain of wanting to return to work will help with my recovery and remove any pressure in order for me to focus solely on my recovery and not worrying about work. She said do I think resignation will be the best thing for me. Then continued to interrupt me and tell me how she feels this would be the best for my recovery. I felt completely blindsided by her and manipulated into agreeing with her. She then said so you agree resignation is the best option ? I paused as I was overwhelmed and said yes… I think so because I won’t be able to return to work in the next two weeks. She then paused and said can you just say again loud and clearly for me you would like to verbally hand in your notice. Again I paused and said yes. She then hastily finished the conversation and that was it over. 

After sitting on this a while after I feel she recorded the conversation without my permission or knowledge and also I feel she bullied me into verbally handing in my resignation so as to get rid of me. 

My question is can they legally record me without my permission? And would I have a leg to stand on questioning this? 

I feel they have gotten rid of me and she abused my current mental health and situation to get rid of me so they can get a new body In because they didn’t want to wait for me? 

Sorry for the long one any advice or words would be greatly appreciated. 

Many thanks ☺️ ",Party_Obligation2782,4,0.8299999833106995,5,1719853598,2024-07-01 17:06:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dsy8cp/forced_to_resign_help_please/,7,2024
1dsy0jm,I need some advice with where to go next,"I’m currently 21 years old and I’m a community college student in New England. I’m currently enrolled in an engineering program that will allow me to transfer to a 4 year. I also work at an internship part-time at an engineering firm. But the thing is, I’m not enjoying it anymore. Last semester I was just so depressed from always studying when I got home for hours into the next morning only to barely pass my classes. There were even times when I didn’t have time to sleep and shower (I know, it’s gross) let alone see friends and family. I’ve taken the summer break to readjust my life (workout and exercise more, eat healthier, and trying to reverse this depression with professional help) but I don’t want to go back to school for engineering. Don’t get me wrong, I still want to get a degree, but I feel aimless and I don’t know where to go. Engineering is something I thought I wanted for myself, but after working at my internship, I’ve realized that I don’t want to be at a desk all day doing calculations. Im at a point where I have all my gen eds, minus a class or two, so I can start any other major as at least a sophomore and take the core program classes but I’m stuck on what to choose. I’d stay in engineering because I’ve sunk two years into it but I just can’t handle the stress and depression that came with it. I’ve looked into everything from construction management, to business, to electronic technology. I have a little interest in everything and unfortunately I tend to loose interest in what I do sometimes. Currently, I’m looking into Criminal Justice and a minor in psychology. I’ve always loved the idea of helping and being a part of my community and being a cop seems really cool (I know it’s not a requirement to have a degree to be a cop but I’ve heard that it helps to raise the ranks easier and get a better salary). I also don’t want to be rich, just to make enough where I’m not worrying about money all the time and have the possibility to make more and support a family in the future. I also want to possibly be a political figure in the future (like city council, mayor, governor, senator, rep, or even president?) to further help the community I grew up in. I’m scared that I burned myself out and that I lost my ability to like learning but I hear CJ is an easy major that teaches you a lot about how our society works under law and I feel like that understanding will be very beneficial to my goals. I’d love some advice from people who have graduated from this major or who have had this “aimless feeling”.

1dsx9hx,New duties - same pay - how to negotiate,"I work as a support staff for a community college in maryland. I started last year with a 10-month contract, and it recently got converted to 12-month. In addition, the position was updated to include additional required duties. The pay obviously compensates me for the additional 2 months of work, but no compensation for the new duties (which I have already been doing for a year now without additional compensation). 

My biggest gripe is the fact that the duties include hiring and supervising people on a daily basis. It's a ton of work and I don't want to do it without being compensated. 

My supervisor is completely checked out and unhelpful. He loves to acknowledge his appreciation for me to coworkers, but doesn't even pretend to care when I vocalize concerns directly to him. He doesn't care about my situation and doesn't care to advocate for me.  

I have until the 15th to sign the new contract and I don't want to. How do I go about this? Ask to have the new duties taken off? 

I'm afraid if I don't sign the contract by the deadline, they will look to replace me. I feel like I'm being bullied into doing additional duties without any say. 

Any advice is appreciated.

I am currently struggling because I have zero motivation at work. I don’t care to be the best, don’t care to get the job done, and simply don’t want to do it. What could be causing this?

For context, I work from home as a recruiter. I started a new position in March, after leaving my last position where I was in a middle management recruiting role and training to take over the department. I loved many of my coworkers and teammates, however I had a child 8 months prior and the toxic work culture was really getting to me and interfering with my personal life, so I left and went back to a regular recruiting role at a company with great benefits that lets me manage my desk independently. I am doing well in this job, still outperforming the other newbies and honestly I am not sure how as I have consistently been unmotivated for 2 months now. The company is great, great benefits, unlimited PTO, fully remote, great work schedule, even better compensation than my last role, but yet I am still just unmotivated and bored. 

Has anyone experienced this and if so, how did you overcome it?

1dsv0m0,Lost and frustrated. How do you know if its your mindset or your job choices that are the issue?,"I feel lost, frustrated and embarrassed.

I graduated with a Neuroscience degree in 2014 and in the 10 years since I've tried many different jobs, careers, job hopped on literally a yearly basis in pursuit of my goals, im highly ambitious and of course... I haven't ended up anywhere near where i want to be. 

Im struggling to work out whether i keep just picking the wrong careers/jobs for my goals and i haven't just found what works for me  and my goals yet OR its my mentality that's the issue.

I dont consider my goals to be insanely world beating. Currently they are just to feel competent at something and have a better than average salary. BUT as (with most things in life) to become competent in my current line of work it takes a long time, in commercial construction management (QS) it takes at least 8-10 years experience, I have 2.5. 

I can never seem to get past feeling incompetent while in the learning phase of each job without getting feeling severely demoralised and anxious, and start to obsessively think about and search for an escape onto a new path where i can be competent and in a more lucrative career. In these times, it quite literally consumes my whole brain and life (have been diagnosed with OCD tendencies previously).Now i feel like ""im behind"" coming into my mid-thirties with a mortgage and kids likely in the next couple of years, my tolerance for feeling incompetent is decreasing even further.

  
Now i know on the surface this looks like a mentality issue as, as ive said, good things take time. BUT there are careers out there, as evidenced by some of my peers, some good things can take a bit less time. Where that period of incompetency/learning is much shorter and the potential remuneration is similar with the same hard work. Im thinking sales/recruitment type jobs (or maybe thats just my perception of those fields). Maybe there isn't something wrong with my mindset of wanting to get straight down to the business end quicker and its just that that the type of work that is now better suited for my mindset. I'm personable and tenacious so it could be a good fit.

Im being made to feel (by others and myself) that there's something wrong my mind for wanting try ANOTHER route, ANOTHER job hop, ANOTHER career change in pursuit of my goals.  BUT maybe its just that I *still* haven't found what works for me yet. On top of this in my current job there's hardly any work for me to do! Objectively! Adding to the confusion whether its me or the job. 

So how do you know whether its you or whether you just haven't found what's right for you.

1dsuw3r,Career path advice for a relatively open book?,"Hey everyone! I am reaching out here for my fiancé, as he is not the type to put himself out there. He doesn’t give himself enough credit for breaking the generational trauma of addiction, narcissism, and selfishness that is his parents, and I want to help guide him to truly thrive. He is in a transitional stage in his career, and I thought now would be the best time to get some honest outside opinions from strangers on the internet! 

Background:

My Fiancé, 27M, has had a successful career as a Restaurant Manager for the past 9 years. In our area, a coastal area, this is a high demand job that comes with a salary, benefits, etc. However, it is also very hard on your mind and body. 

He does not have a degree. He started a semester in college for a BA in general business, but with having his career at the time already seeming to take off, decided to take a step back from that as he wasn’t sure how much that “degree” would truly change things. He was also paying out of pocket. 

Of his management experience, he has spent 3.5 years managing a successful bar and it’s sister restaurant. Moved to a new brewery/restaurant and spent 4.5 years there. Unfortunately, they were experiencing some issues that ownership had no intentions of effectively handling, staff looked to my fiancé to solve, and he was not given the authority or means to do so. He was offered a serving/bartending position at another restaurant with a lot more structure, and accepted with hopes of entering into a management position soon. Plus, the time away from management will be a nice mental break for him. 

My question is- Does anyone have any advice on another career path he could look into? I know that is a broad question. It’s not that he doesn’t have drive to work, he always provides, but there is no one “career” that he feels the “yup, that’s the one for me” about, so he has stuck to restaurant management as that is what he knows. He would consider going back to school, getting certificates, etc. but just doesn’t know where to start or what fields are not a lost cause at this point. 

Thank you for all suggestions, comments, etc!

1dsuste,Mid Career and Considering Taking a Step Down,"Hey all- 

I'm new here, but glad this place exists. I've been in municipal government land use for over 20 years now, with the last 14 years being at the director level. The issue? I am burnt the eff out on it... managing employees, being the whipping boy at public meetings, the nights away from my family, weekend hours, dealing with elected officials, the absolutely crazy members of the public who take up 75% of my time in responding to, the incessant disrespect, arguing all the time, etc etc etc. I have grown to absolutely hate the role I am in, and going to a new city or county or whatever isn't going to change that. 

  
With that said, I have a really exciting prospect in being recruited pretty hardcore by a local stormwater management district. It would be a principal planner role, so basically the highest level planner they have, but not management. They don't really have public hearings or deal with the public much at all. They simply liaise with local governments and implement large scale plans with the help of local governments. Rarely any evening or weekend meetings, very little contact with the general public, and the role would not be management. Win - win - win. 

  
The problem? The salary and vacation time. I currently get 6 weeks of vacation per year, and this job would provide 2 weeks per year. Now, this one can be bargained, and I'm pretty sure that we could get up to a vacation time number that I could live with. The other problem? It's about $35k less than I make right now. And it's a range and step system where there is absolutely no possibility of them offering more than the top of the range allows. A $35k pay cut is intense, but god I want to do the work. I love working in stormwater management and design. I also failed to mention that my job requires me to be in the office almost every day. The new job would be required 2 days in the office and the rest from home. 

  
Im so conflicted. It is 100% a luxury and privilege to even be able to consider taking such a pay cut, but to act like it won't have some effects on my life would be naive. I won't be able to sock away nearly as much money in retirement and kids' college accounts if I take this. We probably won't be able to travel as much or go out to eat as often. But I also wonder what price I can put on my career satisfaction. Has anyone been in this spot before? What did you do? How did it turn out?

1dsulro,Is it normal that a company pretends nothing happens when they fire employees? ,"I work in an European branch of an US organization and it strikes me how firing is being handled. 

The way it works is something like this:
1. Person is informed and leaves the premises
2. The day later we receive an email stating ""person x does no longer work in the company""
3. Management acts like nothing happened. 

This happened also in cases where members of the local management team were let go. To me, this sounds very inhuman - expecially the part that nobody seems to acknowledge what happened.

I'm not expecting answers or clarifications, but I would consider it much more sensitive if someone from the management team would step up and say something along the lines of: ""you have received the email, we acknowledge that this will create some disruption, but we are confident that the organization is still aligned towards our goals"".

I've always had a ""itch"" in the back of my head that in theory, I should be able to leverage the 20+ years of IT knowledge and experience I have, to pivot or contribute to some other field. (because obviously other fields use technology too). 

Mainly over the past 10 years or so, I've been focused on MDM (Mobile Device Management).. so lots of hands on experience with Apple and Android (I have Developer accounts on both platforms) and have worked in small city governments where I've been exposed in integrating iPhones, iPads and Android devices into a pretty wide variety of Departments (Utilities, Water, Police, Environmental, Attorneys, Kiosks in entertainment venues, Social Services, Home Energy Audits, Home water efficiency audits, Festival-checkins, etc.. etc.. ) 

In the back of my head I've always wanted to take all the technology skills I have and find a way to contribute to some ""social good"". 

* joining RedCross or some organization like that,.. and filling a role that utilizes my technology skills

* finding say, an environmental organization (Forestry, climate change, mapping and tracking endangered animals, Ocean pollution, etc?) .. and again, utilizing my technology skills but being more hands on say, out in the forest. 

* maybe even something ""inner city"" to use technology to help poor families or addicts or homeless or ??

I'm curious if any of you would have other random ideas (or past experience) of organizations I could put on my job-hunting list ?

In the past when I've searched for organizations like this,. I see a lot of job-openings that relate to the main skill in the field (example:.. Forestry hiring forestry-experts).. but I hardly ever see organizations like that posting openings for IT or Technology. I'm not sure if I'm just somehow missing those postings or not searching the right way or in the right place. ?

I have a Passport for the first time in my life,. and I'm single with relatively few things tying me down. So moving anywhere in the US or elsewhere would potentially be feasible. 

I like IT and Technology and mobile-devices,. I just don't wan to be trapped in an office staring at a screen all day. I've had a job in the past (small city gov) that was very ""hands-on"" working directly with other employees in other departments,. so I'm hoping for something like that, just larger. 

I'm not in any urgent need for this (as rough as the job market is right now, not something I am looking forward to diving into) but mostly I just want to ""course-correct"" if I'm searching with the wrong words or wrong parameters or searching in the wrong places.",jmnugent,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1719844716,2024-07-01 14:38:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dsukyx/at_50_and_a_20yr_history_in_it_how_can_i_leverage/,7,2024

1dstgkp,Should I stay or should I go?,"Career/life decision

So I just found this Reddit page and I’ve been seriously contemplating a large decision for several weeks, maybe months now. So to give a little backstory here… I am a 24 year old man. I went to a local trade school where I graduated in 2018. I managed to leave there with a 3.9 gpa and score some scholarships so I took off to college to pursue basketball given I wouldn’t have to worry about debt and could get a degree and enjoy college. So that didn’t end up panning out because of injuries and after a year and a half of college… I dropped out because I didn’t see a future in what I was studying. So therefore I  joined back into the trades. I’ve been back in the plumbing field since 2019 and have since worked my way up to being a licensed journeyman plumber. I passed my test a few weeks ago. Currently, the company I work for is a local oil/gas/heating company. I perform boiler installs and have worked my way up to becoming the lead installer. I also got 2 of my best friends hired here and my other coworker who I was working under until I got licensed is the most chill coworker ever. My wage is currently paid out at (23.35/ hr) but with commission is comes out to about 33$/ hr (rounding up). I am not a fan of this pay scale at all and think I am worth more money and the market tells me the same… I want more but my boss is cheap and won’t budge. Sooo to get to the main question I have been contemplating…. my uncle owns a plumbing company which is located about an hour away from me by ferry on a very ritzy rich island called Nantucket. He has given me the option of working for him (45-50/hr) and getting a share of the company and possibly opening my own branch of his company on the mainland where I live now, opposite of Nantucket in the future and I could run things on the mainland and he runs things on Nantucket. The company I currently work for is very specialized and I don’t get to see the other half of the plumbing trade so it’s gotten to the point where I’m not really learning much. I know it’s the smarter move but What’s holding me back from making the jump is the fact that my current company paid for me to get the license and I don’t particularly like being on Nantucket ( I would have to live there during the week or add 2 hours of commute time daily) but I know my future could be very bright if I make the jump. I also like to think I’m a good person and don’t want to betray my friends by leaving but I have been upfront with them about it being a possibility.I’m not sure what to do but I really want to just be successful in this industry and build a life for myself and help my family financially.

I'm almost 26 years old and live with my partner and almost 10 month old son, I'm fed up of living paycheck to paycheck and contantly having hardly amy money at the end of each month. I've been wanting a good career for a little while and would happily do college or university even if it's online as I've seen there is the open university, but I really don't know what to do. I've never known what I wanted to do in life and I feel like I'm currently stuck. 

I finished school and went to college and studied childcare but I feel like I didn't put enough effort into it and at the time didn't have the confidence it was just something to do because I didn't know what I wanted to do and had to go to college and i feel like its not for me. Since then I have had a few bits of voluntary work and café jobs and have since been doing cleaning work. I don't mind cleaning however I have done a few cleaning jobs and one of them I have done for almost 6 years (technically 5 as I've had 9 months maternity leave). I just don't want to be in the same cleaning job all my life and grow up being like ""I've been here 50 years"" I need a change and I want to actually have a good income so I can provide a good life for my son or be able to afford to do nice things I just really don't know what to do or how to get there.

1dss2po,Genuine advice pleasee🙏🏻,"So my parents invested a lot of money into something ( they thought it would be cool for me to do that) but i really never planned doing that. 
I have always had different plans and goals that i wanted to achieve, I’m passionate about. 
But now as the money has already got into it 
I cant help but do that job they want me to, i was thinking okay i will do that for one year so they money that they spend will not be wasted at the end because i did something out of it.


However i know that will be so unfair for me,
I dont want to do something rn which will have no place in my life in 5 years and it seems useless to me. It will waste my energy and time too rather than that i could really pursue my actual dreams.
I value my time a lot like a lott i get overwhelmed knowing that im getting older 
I’m 19 rn turning 20 in couple of months and if i planned to do that job for one year i will be 21. My parents invested the money into it when i was 18 so now you see how much time is ruined. (3years)


This is not only making me feels sad, frustrated, confused, depressed and stressed but also making me wait years for the things i really want to pursueee.
I cant even sleep at night..

Sometimes i feel what if they say- dont worry,achieve whatever goals have. I would be the happiest with no guilt.

So after one year of working that job i can finally work on my things but isn’t it weird to do something which you eventually will quit and doesn’t make you happy too? 

What would you guys do if you were in my position?
Any advice..

1dsqny3,From unpaid dead end job to Senior Software Engineer,"Hey everyone,

Sorry long post but hoping people would find this useful

I wanted to share my story in case someone is in a similar situation. I graduated from a university in London with a first-class degree (4.0 GPA) in Marketing & Multimedia in 2012. Naively, I thought having such a degree would make finding a job easy.

As you can guess, that was not the case. I graduated in July 2012, and after hundreds of interviews and rejections, I finally got an internship offer in September 2012 that only covered my travel expenses. I thought, ""Hey, this is good, I'm getting experience."" The company was a small media firm (20 employees) that helped promote companies on the radio. We would get clients, they would send us promo materials, items, and prizes, and we would distribute them to radio stations.

During the interview, it seemed like I would be making calls, writing scripts, and interviewing people. However, that was far from reality. I ended up cleaning the office, taking out the trash, making tea, running errands, and packing items to be sent.

It was incredibly demoralizing, but I never told my parents. They were proud that I had a job and told our family and friends, so I didn’t want to let them down. The final straw came when we had Filippo Berio, a famous olive oil brand in the UK, as a client [https://amzn.to/3VOHlcf](https://amzn.to/3VOHlcf) . They sent huge hampers of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, crisps, etc. I had to carry the heavy crates of olive oil inside, pack them into hampers, label them, and store them in the closet.

One of the bottles cracked while I was packing, and when I lifted a hamper above my head, it spilled on me and the carpet. The owner scolded me for dirtying the carpet, saying it would be expensive to clean. I was defeated and depressed but apologized, cleaned up as much as I could, and continued working. Normally, I worked from 8 am to 5 pm, but that day it was 7 pm.

A colleague, who I got along with, came down and asked why I was doing this. They pointed out that I wasn’t being paid, wasn’t getting any opportunities, and deserved better. For some reason, I hadn't realized this before. My self-worth had plummeted, and this conversation was an eye-opener for me.

After this, I left the remaining crates and hampers on the floor and didn't go in the next day. This was in December 2012. My phone kept ringing, and I received emails asking where I was, but I never responded.

When my parents asked why I wasn’t going to work, I finally told them the truth with tears in my eyes. They were shocked but extremely supportive, saying I should have told them sooner and that I hadn't disappointed them.

A huge burden lifted off my shoulders, and I promised myself that I would never do that type of work again. I am worth more than that.

After taking a break in December 2012, I started job hunting again in January 2013. However, like before, I faced rejection after rejection. I applied for countless jobs and attended numerous in-person interviews, as this was before COVID.

Despite the rejections, I felt my interview skills were improving. Still, it was disheartening to see my parents go to work while I remained jobless at home. After months of interviews, I finally landed a job as a distribution coordinator for a B2B finance magazine in April 2013, five months after leaving the internship. The job paid £19,000 ($24,000) per year. Although it wasn't much, I was finally getting paid. They also promised that I could move into marketing after some time, which was exciting since it aligned with my degree.

My daily tasks involved extracting data from a database, populating spreadsheets, and sending them to printers and delivery companies to get the magazines printed and delivered. I got really good at this job by creating an efficient system. After a year, I received a small promotion, and my salary increased to £21,000 ($26,000). I could help my parents with groceries and bills and pay for my own expenses, which was great.

However, by the end of 2014, I realized that marketing wasn't for me and there was no room for growth in my role. It was challenging to take holidays or get coverage because I was the only one handling distribution. They wouldn't let me switch roles either, claiming I was irreplaceable (in hindsight, I could have used this to negotiate a better salary or something).

I discovered that I truly enjoyed automating tasks and developed a curiosity about how apps and websites work. With the rise in smartphone ownership, I saw new apps daily and thought it would be amazing to understand how they work and to write code.

I decided I wanted to become a software engineer! The question was, how? Udemy wasn't well-known back then, and YouTube didn't have as much content as it does now. After some research, I found out about conversion Masters programs in Computer Science in the UK. This allows those with a degree to take a small test to see if they can learn programming. I passed the test and enrolled in a Masters course in Computer Science. The course cost £9,000 in London but £5,000 outside London. It lasted for one year. Fortunately, I had saved £14,000 during my time as a distribution coordinator, enough to cover the course and accommodation.

In March 2015, I handed in my notice, left the company in May, enjoyed the summer, and started my Masters in September 2015. During the course, I learned Java, Internet of Things, C++, Android development, and logical reasoning. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

The crazy thing was that I secured a job even before graduation. I graduated in September 2016 with a distinction in Computer Science, the highest honor for a Masters course.

Since 2016, I've worked at amazing companies. By 2024, I became a senior software engineer, working remotely with a great salary and work-life balance. Being an engineer has its challenges, such as dealing with difficult people and tight delivery times, but given where I started and where I am now, I wouldn't have it any other way.

The moral of the story is to always know your self-worth, never give up on your dreams, and keep working hard. You will find a way. Nowadays, you don't need to go to university to learn programming; everything is available online.

1dspu0m,Passion or Money,"Background- So I’m a high school student in 12th grade. I have been contemplating over my career a lot over the last year, and still remain confused. I have always been a straight A student and I’m also among the top three students in my grade. I’m really interested in STEM fields, but choosing what particular domain in STEM is what’s causing me the trouble. I’m quite proficient in biology, maths and physics and somewhat in chem. But my upper hand lies with Biology(neuroscience, genetics!!). So then I started researching on what field should I choose from biology. Most people recommended medicine, but I can’t think of myself being a doctor. Even if I did want to become a doctor, I would go into neurology. What I got to know is that it takes a hell lot of time to become an experienced neurologist/neurosurgeon to make enough dough. 

Next I thought about going into biotech or genetic engineering. And it doesn’t seem that the industry is going very well, major layoffs, underpaid employees, and what not. Academic research ? Meh, sounds good but doesn’t pay well. So then people recommended I choose CS/AI if I want a higher pay. It’s not as if I’m not interested in CS, but I would prefer a career what I’m actually good at. My school Counseller, parents and friends were only able to help so much. Hence I need help from other individuals who are more experienced than me. So should I choose my career in biology, or go ahead with CS ? I would really appreciate all your advice",baddie_addie11,0,0.5,0,1719830295,2024-07-01 10:38:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dspu0m/passion_or_money/,7,2024
1dspr4f,How and when best to transfer to another dpt within the same company?,"Throwaway for privacy. 

I work at a huge international company and been here for years, but in my current position (Sr.Mngr.) only for a year (it was a promotion to another team within the same department). However, I don't feel fulfilled in my role. The work is okayish, but there is lack of structure in processes (which I really hate) and my team is very new so they need a lot of management and hands pn approach (which I understand, but it's really exhausting).

There is another department (more tech-related) that I would like to switch to. However, I've never done this (all my previous promotions were offered to me and I didn't have to proactively look for a new position) and I don't know what would be the best approach. 

I should also mention that I have a great relationship with management of both departments and they're really great people and we go years back. 

So my questions are:

1. How do I do it? Do I approach my direct manager and just tell her that I want to move? The problem is that she is kind of prepping me to fill in her role once she moves on and I know she would hate to lose me. Or do I approach the manager of that other department first (which seems like a bit of an asshole move towarda my own manager)?

2. When do I do it? Do I wait for my annual review? Do I wait for a position to open at that other department? Do I wait a few years to establish in the current role? 

3. What would it look like if I do this and then there's no position in that other department and now my manager knows I want to leave? It seems like a pretty awkward situation.

4. What is even a possibility of a switch to another department for someone who is already in management? Isn't it easier to switch when you're a bit lower in your career so you can build ""from within"" instead of just dropping in from somewhere? For example, would they consider someone who is associate director to be too ahead in their role to switch to a new department where they've never worked before (ex. moving from QA to project management or similar)?

Thank you for all your advice in advance.

1dslk86,Is it time to live?,"I've been working for this job for 10 months now. I gave my all but it appears that everything that I've done went all to trash. Here's the story, since I started working with the company, I became one of the individuals who supervises the new hires though I don't have any position or any additional payments to my hard work just because I am one of the OGs that worked with the company, no in fact, I am the only one left. For 8 months, I've been catering to my coworkers needs and their questions though their questions are repetitive, I even made a knowledge base for them to refer but they are not utilizing it. Maybe because it is way too convenient to ask me instead, but sometimes, it's draining like I have to spend my mornings deciding whether I am doing enough because it appears that they are not learning though we are one of the few individuals that have a good standing to our performance. I felt so betrayed by my own children if you will ask me because by the time that I lost my cool and decided not to help anymore because I felt that they have to finally learn and besides the management does not appreciate what I've done for the company. There's a lot going on actually because when I set the boundary, the two individuals that I molded, isolated me. Like I felt so alone as if there's no one I can lean on. It's not really a problem because I know how to do my job but still. I also heard a lot of side comments about ""do you think we can't do it without your help?"" but since it was not directly shoved to my face, I pretended that I cannot hear anything but I am aware of what is happening. If this is how ungrateful and entitled the people that I have sacrificed my all for so what is the point of sacrificing for 8 months? So, my draining days just went to being unappreciated, huh. So all of the sacrifices went to trash. I want to leave but I have bills to pay.

1dskwk6,I would consider myself to be a diversity hire back when cybersecurity was a buzz word. It’s been over two years and I still feel out of my league. I’m dreading to return on Monday since when I’ve been feeling horrible about my existence in the company since I started. ,"When June started it went from horrible to abhorrent. 

When I go in the office I’d get this immense drowsiness that is so difficult to fight off. 

The desk can raise so you can stand, yet still I frequently jerk myself back awake. 

I’m 22 and I wish I never got the job. 

My coworkers and specifically one teammate has really supported me and basically took care of the vast majority of stuff I should have worked on but just has gotten stuck or whatever.

My own little catchphrase I keep to myself is that he saves the day.

They have all supported me as best as they could but I don’t want to be here any longer. No amount of money is worth it.

The pay is not bad by any means, the company itself is regularly seen on the list of best places to work in the US, and I am the only one that just can’t do it. 

In a very distinct way, I am the only one always feeling bad about myself. 

Since starting almost everyday I told myself “I wish I get fired”.  

I thought of up and quitting. That might be a big shame to the people who helped me as much as they could especially to that one teammate but me being under qualified is an understatement.

It’s been over two years, and I feel I am incompetent. 

How badly I wish someone replaced me. Everyday somehow I’m reminded that I can’t live. And I can and will accept that, for long time I’ve been ready to give up, but this job hold me like a hook. 

And I hate whatever exterior facade I’ve built up.

Side note - feels like I am neglected and abandon in marriage , especially past 3 years and realizing it now and during my post delivery time frame got chance to re think about my career choices around kids 

Hard to decide  for past 2 years after 14 years as RN , should I go up the ladder in management like charge nurse or supervisor 
Or pursue FNP family nurse practitioner program 
I have two young kid age 4 and 9 months 
Live in nanny in future can be support as husband 41 and I am 38 but no one else 

Plus right now I am part time which mean I work 2 days for 12 hours and can find something 3 days for 8-10 hours and have 4 days off 


While going back to FNP masters means higher designation work however have to go back full time work atleast 1-2 years for experience and getting good at it when my kids will be age 8  and age 4 , and eventually find part time 



9 years ago when I started FNP , I left in name of marriage and family and had two kids now but somehow I am stuck with finishing up the school 
I don’t know if there is a right answer or calling because nursing has so so many options 

Anyone done it or can put in outside perspective on pros and cons of masters after having two kids and minimal support ? 

What are the things I should consider making this decision ?
Personal choice wise I am not able to decide because both looks great options and FNP in long run would be extra great , not than RN would not be

I (20M) have always been test smart, rarely needing to study much in high school and even in college. I just graduated in May with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics in three years (thanks to a lot of summer classes), finishing with a 3.8 GPA.

Now that I'm in the job market, I'm on the verge of losing my mind. Despite my academic success, I can't seem to even get an interview with hundreds of applications in the software field. My biggest regret is cramming in those summer classes to graduate early instead of gaining work experience through internships.

At this point, I feel like a complete bum, leeching off my parents, and I'm considering applying for minimum wage jobs just to get by. I'm really starting to doubt my knowledge and worry that I'm not going to get anywhere in life. Probably 99% of the pressure is from myself, maybe I just need to pick up Yoga.

1dsinlj,Feeling stuck in my data analytics career,"Throwaway because I don't want my employer to find out.

I've got a bit of a weird story. I studied marine science with honours in uni, and got into a graduate role at a big government facility in my city. My first role was very data focused, using a lot of coding (R mainly) to analyse data.

I made some poor decisions, joined a team that I thought was very data analytics focused which I wanted to continue in, but ended up being on my own in the team with no one to learn from. I took a role in a new team where I ended up again being the only data analyst.

My role got changed and all the analytics was removed from the role. I am feeling defeated because I'm seeing lots of roles in data analytics and science that I'd like to go for, but I don't feel qualified to do. It's been 3 years since my marine degree, and I didn't learn much about analytics aside from a lot of self study in the last two years. I managed to teach myself some SQL, python and Azure but it's all self directed.

Since my role change I've been feeling completely defeated, no interest in going into work now. I'm even too scared to apply for these roles. I feel really trapped and not sure what to do next. If I take a more junior data analytics role, it's a pay cut by around 20k. That's what I get for making poor career choices. What do I do? Should I just try to go for these roles anyway, even if I get rejected?

1dsimjz,Experiencing a delay in transitioning from paralegal to lawyer. Looking for some insight,"This question might be a bit law specific but I figured it doesn’t hurt to ask more broadly. I’m a lawyer (graduated and admitted 6 months ago) that’s working as a part-time paralegal / law graduate (occasionally full time).

There were two main reasons for this: 1) Severe burnout and health issues straight after law school, and 2) my law firm had a huge financial hit and were unable to give me the lawyer title immediately (in our country, lawyer fees are very expensive).

In the meantime, I’ve had plenty of invaluable training. The firm is very small yet highly reputable so I’m getting a lot of quality first-hand experience and everyone in the office is so friendly and helpful. 

Outside of the office, my experience has not been so great. A lot of people have made negative comments about me (e.g “you should be a lawyer by now, how could you let this happen” or implying laziness/failure on my behalf) or negative comments about the firm (accusing my bosses of bullying/disrespecting me by intentionally withholding my lawyer title).

I’ve ignored these negative comments to focus on getting better and enjoying my time at work, however I’m now at a crossroads- my health is back to normal, it’s been 6 months since grad/admission and I’m due for a performance review so I’m hoping again for that lawyer title! 

The only factors i’m unsure about are of course my firm’s current financial situation (it seems far better now) but also the fact I’m competing with ANOTHER law grad. They graduated and got admitted as a lawyer an entire year before me (meaning they are 1.5 years overdue) but my firm cannot promote them as their English/communication/professionalism is poor, they have immigration problems (could be sent back to their home country) and still lacking in key skills (admittedly, I outperform them even though I’m younger). However, they are somehow convinced in the next performance review that they will receive the promotion to lawyer and not me (if money is tight) because they’re more overdue.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Any advice to share? I’m prepared to leave (and have been browsing around) but given an absolutely shocking job market in my country (many fellow grads are still unemployed) ideally it would be better to stay given the quality of training/experience I get.",ThrowRA_lantern,1,1.0,0,1719802455,2024-07-01 02:54:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dsimjz/experiencing_a_delay_in_transitioning_from/,7,2024

1dsgy1w,How to get a job paying around $40-$50/hr,"So I am in my early 30’s. Have a previous bachelor’s degree in Design which didn’t really pan out to anything. The good thing is I only have a little bit of debt left (around $13K). 

If I was aggressive about it I could pay it off in a year or two with my current pay rate.

I have been looking to do a career change into healthcare. I currently have a technician job in an outpatient clinic which I love but the pay is only around $24/hr and I can’t say there is really room for growth.

I don’t officially have any certifications for healthcare. I just lucked upon this job.

This is fine for now, but I want to be able to save for retirement and eventually buy a space of my own aka a modest 1 bedroom home. I’m not one of those people that want a McMansion. I just want a space of my own.

Financial stability and security is important to me as I have next to nothing when it comes to a support system. I also want to avoid debt as much as I can.

I have been debating on going back to get a degree in nursing but that would cost more money. I am sure I can get into a program that’s about 15 months long but I would have to move out of state and there would be no room for failure or mistakes. I would absolutely have to pass and I’m not confident that I can do that.

That would cost me at least $45K in loans and it honestly seems so risky to me even though the benefits after would 100% be worth jt.

Here’s the thing though. I am tired. I don’t want to go back to school. I never liked school. I was just a student who would pass. I just want a regular job that doesn’t change much, around $40-$50 an hour and then to just live my life.

I really don’t want to have to go back to school. I just want something secure. I have even considered trying to get into the state or county instead.

It doesn’t have to be nursing per se. I just want something in healthcare that will pay me okay.

If anyone has any advice I’d love to hear it. I suck at career planning.

Ive been in my role performing well for 2 years and after doing my research and have learned that I’m severely underpaid (30-50%). I know most of you are going to suggest leaving but other than pay I have no complaints so I figured I’ll give them a shot to make me happy before I decide to start looking around. Unfortunately I work for a large company that has all these bull shit corporate policies and pay bands, so my chances are probably zero. But just looking on how to guide the conversation.

1dsg17n,Job search in the USA with potential guarantor ,"Hey, I need a suggestion regarding this. I'm a final semester student of Software Engineering with expertise in frontend development. One of my father's friends in the USA told my father that if I can find a job in the USA, he would act as my guarantor. Can someone tell me if this is a good opportunity and what steps I need to take to find a job there? Also, what are the other options I should consider?",Own_Oil1761,0,0.5,2,1719794177,2024-07-01 00:36:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dsg17n/job_search_in_the_usa_with_potential_guarantor/,7,2024
1dsg11e,Middle aged man looking for advice. Be honest. ,"Evening people, 

As the title says. "" middle aged man looking for some advice."" I'm 39 years old. I have an awesome little family that is my world. I'm stuck in life and Im feeling totally lost( not depressed). Currently work on the railway. It's been my job for the past 10 years. I have worked my way from the bottom. To pushing myself to gaining more competencies for more work and earn around £40k+ a year. Unfortunately, I don't enjoy my job no more. I am finding I'm going to work angry and I believe I can do so much better. I have come to the realisation that I'm not getting any younger and all this work in the past has took a toll my body and mind. I want to escape but I don't know what I want to do to in life. With all the bills going up and having a family to support. I feel like  I'm stuck. Working with people is not my strong point. I'm not opinionated. I'm just brutally honest. My passion is working with computers and I'm the creative type of person.  I was lookin into UX/Ui design but with AI taking over. I don't know if it's worth taking a step in that industry.  Is anyone else In this situation and has anyone got some good advice at all? Thanks in advance.

1dsfvwr,"I feel lost on my career path, what should I do?","I was going to go into a career into Anthropology. I had a lot planned on it. It was dream career since I was a kid! I was going to pursue a PhD in it and go all the way. I have a passion for learning, I have a personal goal of learning 10 languages fluently. I am currently learning Japanese,Mandarin and Arabic though I only know the basics of ordering food and having a conversation. 

I also dabble in Sign language and I just love the study of language and Art. I want to travel and learn about cultures and the world. I want to be able to move abroad someday with my partner. 

But I also want to be able to provide a stable home for my partner... 

I know this sounds like basic shit that everyone wants but I feel myself teetering. I was \*so\* excited to start this. But the more I look into job opportunities with Anthropology (Im going into my Bachelors program) the more I see there arent many job Titles offered? 

My perfect job is a blend of field research and paperwork. I am great at paperwork! I worked as a secretary assistant when I was in highschool for a bIomedical engineer company. And I loved it. I found I love sitting and doing organizational tasks. I loved answering the phone. And I loved when the tech guys would take time to teach me how to replace parts or run diagnostics. 

I found I love engineering a lot. But I also love running around and gathering data. I have fallen in love with Microscopes on more than one occasion. I just really love learning. Its why originally, I was in the medical field. I was a CMA for two years before I figured out that I cant make a stable living off that. (Though now that its after covid a lot of CMA jobs went from 7$hr to $17hr and I regret that decision. ) 

I am now going to school after my anthropology degree and was going to get an art degree with a minor in film and linguistics because I wanted to be able to go into a field in either. 

Studying art and working as a museum director, I like that!   
Data science, I like that too!  I struggle often to find a job that takes both my passions that I cant let go of together. I love art and get bored of a job even if the money is there if it doesnt scratch both my intelligent and creative side. 

I thought Anthropology was the answer... But the more I look at the job market...The more I get nervous. 

I dont want to be rich. But I do want to provide a stable home for my partner. My partner has Cerebral palsy and She isnt always able to work...I love her so much. She thinks she is a burden on me and she isnt. And I know I shouldnt stress too much about having to care for her since she can care for herself and yet I find myself wanting to at least be that stable pillar and not...The hot mess I have been. Jumping from career to career. 

I enjoy video games and coding, I enjoy animals, I enjoy reading and painting and sculpting and 3-d printing! Im great at Microbes, Im amazing at paperwork, Im good at seeing and spotting things that everyone else may have over looked. 

I promise I have a good head on my shoulders, I have had entire conversations with people about my thoughts on language and animals and While I dont always talk the smartest I do know my shit! 

I just...I was looking forward to becoming an Anthropologist but I wonder if I should get a degree in something else? How can I compete with people far more intelligent than I? For the same job. I wonder if I should Get a degree in Art and Engineering? Or Engineering and Anthropology?  I just dont know. 

TLDR: I feel lost on my career path. I was excited about Anthropology but it feels like if I finish school  in the field I might never find a job or constantly be flipping from one job to the next. I want to be stable when I get out of school with a PhD.

1dsfr4d,Took a pay cut for a new job and now I'm worried I made a mistake.,"I recently completed a 2-year management training program with a large retail company, but I knew I didn't see a future with them (and I was also wholly drained and miserable there). Around the end of the program, I accepted a new job with a staffing company. The only thing was that I technically took a pay cut to make this switch. I'm now working at a base + commission job. My base pay is now $8k less than what I was making at the retailer, but once I get a commission, I could be making much more than what I was making at the retailer. I did a LOT of research on this new role and talked to past employees about the reality of the commissions, and I also worked on my budget to accommodate for the new base pay. I figured that, for a few months, I'd be fine financially until I got out of training- which led to my decision to take the new job. 

I'm moving at the end of August and getting a place alone. Long story short- I need more money than I thought. The rent prices in my area are worse than I budgeted, and I'm scared for myself financially. Training at my new job is going slower than I anticipated based on the outline for new hires (and because my new boss doesn't trust me enough to start practicing stuff I've been learning even though it's been a month now). I'm worried I made a mistake taking this base + commission job. I like the job, and I don't regret leaving my old company for my mental health and work/life balance. That said, I still have bills to pay.

I had a couple of ideas about how to approach the situation, but I would appreciate any insight into what I should do. 

1. Start applying for new jobs and hopefully land something that pays higher by the end of August.

2. Talk to my boss about my financial situation changing and needing more money. I'm not sure how I'd approach this conversation when I just started, but I don't want them to think I already hate the job.

3. Wait it out for another month or so and see where I'm at with training before making any decisions.

Thanks in advance for any advice! ",accgl,0,0.33000001311302185,2,1719793311,2024-07-01 00:21:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dsfr4d/took_a_pay_cut_for_a_new_job_and_now_im_worried_i/,7,2024
