18vkgjb,Risks of talking about business ambitions on the resume,"I'm applying for a very competitive internship at D. E. Shaw. After reading some experiences on Reddit, I'm worried about some statements in my application regarding my enterpreneurship ambitions.

**Resume:**

>*Startup co-founder (Dec 2020 - Present)*

**Cover letter:** .

>.. *beyond technical expertise, I've also evolved as a leader—managing teams, projects, large code repositories, and honing sales skills. My long-term aspiration is to lead a company one day, and D. E. Shaw perfectly embodies the business model I envision: integrating finance, mathematics, and computer science to achieve sophisticated resource allocation with a clear commitment to excellence*.  
>  
>*Investigating your facilities and reaching out to former interns over the last few months has fueled my vision of becoming part of the community, learning from you, and contributing to your team. I am not just a perfect fit for the company based on my skills; I am also invested in making D. E. Shaw a significant part of my journey. With great anticipation, I am ready to demonstrate my capabilities through a summer internship.*

The reality is that yes, I'd love to lead a company in many years, but I know my place right now, I'm 20 years old and I want to do what I must do. Also, I don't need to own said company, so I can picture myself being just another leader at D. E. Shaw.

However, this company seems to want long-term employees and makes them sign non-compete agreements. I'm afraid they might believe that I wont commit fully to the company, or that I'll end up leaving to do my own thing. This is **not** the case.

How should I convey the right thing to them?",pabloasenjo3,1,1.0,1,1704067182,2023-12-31 23:59:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18vkgjb/risks_of_talking_about_business_ambitions_on_the/,12,2023
18vk3t5,How to send my ideas to company?,"Hi guys,  
I'm a Finance student, and I'm enthusiastic about sharing innovative ideas that can enhance companies' market presence. One example is proposing a gaming app for a company or suggesting the installation of Christmas lights around their train, which could create a visually appealing and publicity-boosting spectacle.  
I have several ideas that could benefit companies, but I'm unsure about where to begin. Despite reaching out to some individuals within these companies via cold emails, I have experienced being ignored. I understand that these are just ideas at this stage, but I am eager to collaborate with these companies and contribute to their success.  
How can I effectively communicate these ideas to ensure they are considered seriously and not face rejection or being ignored?

18vjcl4,Should I Finish My Master's?,"I'm looking for any/all feedback on a decision I'm looking at, especially if you're someone who hires folks/works in HR.  
  
Background: Got my BS in Math 8 years ago at a highly regarded university. Went to Education grad school for teaching k-12. Got about 95% through the program, had a complete mental breakdown for various reasons, and walked away. Spent the next couple years in gig jobs, then started full-time at my current company, where I have been promoted up to a respectable position over the course of 5 years.  
  
I am planning to leave this job, and while doing the soul searching on where I want to go next, I thought back to that master's degree and I'm wondering if this transition period is an opportunity to go back and salvage some value out of everything I put into grad school. If it ties up that loose end and adds a plus to my resume, it seems worth it.  
  
However, I don't want to return to this if it will work against me in any way. I don't know what job/career I want to pursue now, but I'm still relatively young/unspecialized, and the options are still ""anything but teaching"". Do you think there would be anybody hiring out there that would be less likely to hire me than they would if I just didn't have the Curriculum and Instruction masters on my resume, especially given that I won't be working in that field? Do you think this random graduate degree for a field I don't plan to work in popping up on my resume 8 years after my BS invites unwelcome questions about my history?

18vhz2d,I think I invested in the wrong career,"8 years ago I found myself in love with cooking, to the point I changed schools and went to a cooking school to become a cook. Going to the university was never and option and I was pretty set on my goals.
2 years into it, and I started to have questions about how the food is made exactly, I remember asking one of my chefs how one makes lactose free milk and he telling me "" how the fk would I know that"". these types of question started to show up in my mind more and more untill the day I met the teacher that changed my life. She was a food engeneer giving us the basics of HAACP and I fell in love with the area. So much so that when I finished, instead of going to work as a cook, I decided to go to university and give it a try.
Now, 8 years later, 2 different degrees in food safety and food engeneer, I'm 3 months away from finishing and starting to work. However I'm looking at the pay and I think...well I think I'm just going to be poor. I really want to be a food safety audit but the pay for that job at least in my country is so bad. I have friends 1 year out of the university making 1500 euros a month and I will be making 900 tops... I can't help but feel like I went after what I really like and ended up wasting 8 years of my life.

18vgs60,Offer Accepted. Give 2 Week Notice on Tuesday or Wait?,"This week I verbally accepted a job offer over the phone and also gave it in writing and submitted it online to the company. In the letter from HR there are two tentative start dates. 
Before starting work I have to submit to a background test and have a TB test. Should I not give notice until the Live Scan has been completed? There is nothing in my background that would come up. I won’t have enough time to get these things done before the first start date so it makes sense to me to request I start on the second date. Since it is in the letter from the recruiter in HR is that a reasonable request? My biggest concern is of course giving two weeks notice and then having my job offer rescinded.

18vge3y,Opinions wanted between two job offers in CPG (consumer packaged goods) industry,"Hi All,

Appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this. 

To make a long story short I have been waiting on a offer from ""Company X"" for the past several months. Several things have happened which have prolonged the process. In the meantime ""Company Y "" came in , interviewed me and offered me the job. 

Company Y is a midsize Manufacturer in the CPG industry. Comes with company car , company credit card , vacation and bonus, salary is at 93k. Position is fully remote and I will travel occasionally. I accepted an at will offer with Company Y. I also want to note that manufacturer experience is very valuable in this industry and it is very difficult to get your foot in the door. So could be useful in future opportunities. 

Fast forward a few days 

Company X came in and is making an offer this upcoming week. Company X is a smaller company , health insurance may not be as benefical , no company car , no company credit card. Could be a potential for going to office 2 days a week down the road and travel will be expected part of the time. However the Salary could be between 115k and 120K.

If company X offered a job at 115K , do you think it is enough to make the switch from company Y who came in and had a more efficient interview process? I think I want to stick with company Y but wanted some honest opinions from completely neutral professionals.

I have positions of responsibility in the entrepreneurship cell and consulting club of my college. (Also a co-founder in the latter). The experience here has been equally rich to speak of. 

What all things can I work upon so that by the end i've strong extra curriculars to show off. I'll try to maximize my GMAT score. Both of these to compensate for poor academics.

18vatya,Should I Stay or Should I Go,"So there was recently a leadership change in my department, that led to me receiving a lot more responsibilities but there was no pay increase along with it. There was one teased, that never came to fruition. It became pretty apparent rather quickly that my new boss had toxic working habits, mentioning that he was working 12 hours a day including weekends etc. This was a red flag to me, but it hadn’t really gotten down to me or my cohorts at this point. 

Over the past two months however it has. He is expecting us to do incredibly time consuming and difficult projects on condensed timelines, e.g. a project that should be given 6-10 months in a 30 day period. Most of these projects are a much higher concern due to previous mismanagement from the highest level of the company. He then tells us it’s our only priority, but stacks even more projects on top of it. When we ask for help, he tells us to figure it out and to let him know if we need anything. He’s now reverted to yelling and cursing at people in meetings with the whole team. Admittedly, a lot of the changes he’s trying to do are right and I agree with them, but his expectations are impossible and he’s not very good at motivating or managing morale. I’ve had several conversations with people recently who are on the verge of tears, or had just finished crying. It’s toxic af. 

Anyway, I’m trying to get out and I’m applying to jobs and getting call backs. I even interviewed at a job with a former colleague and he’s said I’m a lock, and the offer is coming soon, but it might be a month or so due to the new year etc. 

So ultimately my dilemma is that this job is starting to really affect my mood and send me toward depression, I honestly don’t know if I can take it any longer. They also expect an extended notice (I know it’s optional but…), so if I find another position I’m going to have to make them wait even longer. My wife and I did a budget, and because she is the breadwinner, I could leave this job and we’d still be okay. Due to American work mindset, I have a hard time putting in my notice without something lined up and in writing. But it feels like the right thing to do for the sake of my mental health and my family. It’s been a hard year in my personal life, stuff that’s been basically worked through with time and therapy. But it just feels like the pressures from this job are not helping at all. 

TLDR: Should I suck it up and power through a very toxic work environment until I have a new opportunity in writing? Or should I resign and count my blessings that we can financially survive without my income for a short period of time and work on healing and recalibrating in the meantime. Another job is lined up and ideally I would only have a few weeks unemployed, it’s just not in writing.",PrestigiousShelter94,1,0.6000000238418579,7,1704038878,2023-12-31 16:07:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18vatya/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,12,2023
18v9rvg,I feel like I'm giving up :(,"I’m 25 years old and let me preface this by saying I’m in no way “lazy”. I have been working since the age of 12 and I’ve been working my ass off. Bought my camera and invested heavily in it. But not enough to just quit working obviously.

I just don't understand. I feel like I have such bad luck. I wake up at 5am every morning and it seems like every job I've had has drained my energy, enthusiasm, and happiness. Despite giving my all, I always end up losing the job. It's been a continuous cycle of failure that has turned me into a grumpy and defensive person. I feel like I don't even recognize myself anymore.

I am thinking about moving back to my homeland. However, I am also scared because I left my home to become independent from my parents. Plus, I am afraid that my dad will bring up my failures and remind me that I had the opportunity to live in the ""American Dream Country"" but couldn't take it, or even see it.

Btw, photography is my hobby which unfortunately doesn't bring in any income. Nevertheless, I'm quite skilled at it and it's one of my biggest career aspirations, alongside my passion for filmmaking. However, since I'm living alone in this country and have to pay all my bills by myself, I often find myself caught in a cycle where I work just to cover my expenses and can't even afford to invest in new photography gear.

In my last job, I worked as a dishwasher. And before that, I was a project manager for a construction company that unfortunately went bankrupt. As a new hire, I was among the first to be let go.

Anyways, I got fired from my last job because I took 40 minutes on my 30-minute break. I did this because I was working a 10-hour shift and only had one break.

And to be honest, I didn't expect that my lunch break would start as soon as I grabbed the bagel at the front shelf instead of when I sat down in the break room.

It's December 31st, 2023, and I'm feeling devastated. I have no job, no money, no family or friends around me. I feel like I'm giving up :( and I'm not like that ...

If I came to this country, it was because I knew that I could make it. I have always believed in myself and knew that anything was possible. That's why I came here, to find the path that would lead me to my future. But why is it that nobody has noticed the effort I put into every job and my dedication to learning and improving? It seems that people only focus on our weaknesses.

Honestly I'm stuck, I'm 23 unemployed and will attend private university next year where I don't know what to study or if I should double major in order to be more competitive when I finish uni and enter the job market. I come from middle class background so yeah you can say that I lived in luxury kinda so thus why I'm so picky and snobbish.  
  
Don't know in which sector is the best choice. Computer Science,Cybersecurity and IT in general is really booming but I'm afraid that entry positions will be eventually automated and positions will be harder and harder to achieve. Also, I have a hate/love relationship with computers so dont know if IT is best for me. Also, afraid of landing on a code monkey help desk position where I'm just waiting until I'm replaced by AI or dealing with stupid shit.  
  
I never did good in school because I never applied myself and found most subjects boring so decided to do my own things and study Philosophy,Psychology,Classic Literature, Foreign Languages,Geopolitics, Art and Music. Doubt that going down these routes will give me any amount of respectable income either unless there is something I'm missing.  
  
This whole AI thing really gives you the creeps when knowing that some companies have replaced CEO's with AI, finance sector runs mostly on AI algorithms and a whole generation that is not tech savvy or nerds have been taken over as some kind of Technofeudalism where only there the money flows.

i’m also starting with front end because i have some familiarity with the concepts involved. i would be happy to learn full stack over a longer period of time, and ultimately want to be able to call myself a full stack developer eventually, but realistically i know it’s going to take time.

right now i’m taking cs50x because i never taken a formal compsci course. i’ll be mostly doing self teaching unless i can figure out a way to get into a 2-3 year program which is doubtful bc i don’t really have stem program prerequisites since i went a different route in university.

With these info how do you want me to proceed next 2-3 months to eventually land a tech role ? BTW I can't appear for on-campus placements due to some reasons so I must proceed for off campus

18v3q3k,Navigating Finance Business Partnering,"Hoping for some advice from other FBP's out there, as my company has recently made a big organisational change, and in that proces, changed the traditional finance office into Finance Business Partnering.

On paper, it looks like my dream job, because advising managers across the company and analysing business challenges is so much more rewarding that reconciliating accounts and chasing people for expense receipts.

In reality, I find it super difficult to navigate, because I now have several more stakeholders and more tasks, but the regular finance tasks are still there, and the CFO obviously expects us to keep being gatekeepers of high quality data, and stewards of compliance. 

I go to work every day basically feeling like i'm coming up short.

Do any of you FBP's out there have any advice on how to make most impact as an FBP and how to better balance the many different aspects of the role?

Or is the reality just that FBP is another smart way of getting more work out of the same people?",Trick_Smoke1436,1,1.0,2,1704012903,2023-12-31 08:55:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18v3q3k/navigating_finance_business_partnering/,12,2023
18v2kxe,My boss wants a monthly finders fee for work with anyone I meet through him,"This is unique situation and I’m recently an independent contractor so it’s new to me, so advice would be appreciated. I started doing content creation with a photographer (like filming him at photo shoots and with clients for social media). I started editing together the clips for his social media and it turned into me completely being their social media manager. They knew I had social media management experience and hired me to do theirs. 

Fast forward and clients are loving me and the content I’m making them on his shoots with him, and I think it’s making him worried that clients may want content on their own sometimes, even though I’ve done nothing to cross the line or try to go behind his back and get work from people I met through him.

He has a client that owns a restaurant and had seen some of my content, and asked who his social media manager was. The restaurant owner is interested in hiring me completely separately to run his social media. NOW it gets weird- the photographer wants me to give him a “finder’s fee” every month off of what I would charge that potential client. He proposed 20%. 

Is this a thing that people do?! I would understand if it was a one time referral fee, but I feel like every month is ridiculous, considering they aren’t in the social media business and I happen to do both social media and content creation for them.

18v12f8,Why can’t I figure my life out,"This might be a little long, and I’ve never actually posted on Reddit before, but here we go.

I’m looking for some advice on what I should do moving forward, and maybe even some advice on what I’ve done wrong so far. I’m also looking to just get this all in writing to help me think.

I’ll start with a general overview of myself, and I give this from an objective standpoint, in hopes it doesn’t come off as conceited. These are things I know to be true of myself through years of being told by others and professional opinion as well. 
I’m a 24 year old male who is somewhat of an outlier in the things I’ve been gifted with. I have a very bright mind, with my IQ being officially tested at 140 by a professional through hours of testing, and that puts me in roughly the top .05% of people. I am a natural born leader in every sense of what that means. People have followed me for as long as I can remember, and I grew up my whole life hearing that I am a leader. I am also one of the more socially and emotionally intelligent people that you would meet. I’ve never really met someone who doesn’t like me, people frequently come to me with their problems and feel very comfortable confiding in me, every teacher I’ve had loved me, I’m objectively very aware of people’s feelings and emotions and how to best cater to them, I’m often told I’m “the funniest person I’ve ever met,” etc.. I’m also physically tall and broad in stature and at least decently attractive to most, almost the exact type of person you want to be if you do a lot of networking. Again, I don’t say these things to sound conceited, and I almost hate writing it all out cause it totally sounds that way, but they are objectively true and anyone who knows me agrees. I often don’t believe it all for myself, but it really is the truth. I also forgot to note I was diagnosed with mild to severe ADD.

Here’s where my problems lie. School. Starting in high school I began to have problems being able to get my work done. I would procrastinate like crazy all the time and couldn’t for the life of me get my work done until I absolutely had to. Tests always went well and I always ended up doing ok in the honors and AP classes despite my lack of effort/ability to make that effort. I ended up getting a 1500 on my SAT, so I was admitted to a good university in my area. My time in college was far from ideal. Since there was no one really watching my back or keeping me even mildly accountable, I slowly let my habits get the best of me, and despite any perceived effort to build a plan to get myself back on track, I just couldn’t do it. It slowly got worse and worse until I ended up dropping out after 3 years and taking up a job doing electrical work in my area, which I’ve been doing for the past year. It’s a good job, and the pay is around 75k and I’m in a low cost area, so all things considered I’m doing totally fine for someone my age.

My problem is that I can be doing so much more. Realistically, maybe .005, or probably less, percent of the population has the gifts I do to absolutely crush it in literally anything I set my mind to, but where have I gone wrong, and what can I do to fix it? I know school is the obvious answer, and I think it could make sense to go back, there’s just nothing that I would be passionate about studying, and without the passion for what I’m doing I have a nearly impossible time completing the things I need to. Yes I know it’s something I need to fix, but I want to be realistic in the time being.

I’ve always wanted to be an entrepreneur and own my own business, and I always have new ideas from things I research on good businesses to start, but I honestly just don’t even know where to begin, and feel like I’ve thrown so much opportunity away already.

Not sure what advice can really be given, I’m just feeling confused and down on myself. I want to do something amazing with the gifts I’ve been given, and any insight is appreciated.

18uy4w8,"27 male, English and CG art degrees, struggling with direction/finding work","Hi all,  

I’m struggling with my career prospects (along with my mental health) at the moment and figuring out where I should go next. I’m 27, male, and I just finished doing a second degree in an industry that’s suffering quite severely at the moment.  

Some background on me: I started out wanting to be an author (which I still do). From 2014-2018, I studied English at a second-tier school with a concentration in Creative Writing. After graduating, I had some trouble finding a job that summer - lots of Indeed and Linkedin applications, but no interviews - and ended up getting a job at an architecture and design firm in NYC through a parental connection. 
  
The job was a really poor fit for me as I wasn’t really trained for any of the work they were doing, so they struggled to find a place for me at the company. I enjoyed editing their internal video content but there wasn’t much of that work to keep my busy. They eventually put me on spreadsheet data entry, which was soul-crushing.  

After about eight months at that position I applied to a VFX/game art school in Los Angeles and went on to do a four-year degree in CG Art. The school is very well-known in the industry, but I never felt as though my work really measured up compared to many of my peers (although I was far from the worst). I definitely struggled with the more technical aspects (and learned I wasn’t quite as good of a visual artist as I thought I was!) Although I did get consistently good grades.  

I graduated from the VFX school in September, and have been struggling with my job hunt since then. I don’t love my reel - I’ve had mixed feedback on it, and I can’t tell if the amount of criticism I’m getting is normal or whether I should be concerned about it. Regardless, the games industry has been going through severe layoffs, and film work has yet to ramp up again after the strikes. No one is hiring juniors right now, especially not in my geographic area - which is a problem because ideally I’d like to stay in New York, close to my family and my significant other.  

Day by day I’m finding my mental health deteriorating rapidly as I confront the possibility that I might have wasted nearly a decade of time without much in the way of marketable skills to show for it. I feel like a failure and a disappointment to my parents and partner, although they’ve all insisted that’s not the case. I’m getting to the point where I want to move on with my life and I’m getting desperate to start applying to any jobs that can give me consistent work with my degrees. I’m burned out on education at the moment so ideally I’d be looking for something that would take me on as a junior with the opportunity for on-the-job training.  

My skills:  

Standard English major package (critical thinking, reading/copy editing, creative writing, etc). I’ve written two unpublished novels and am currently working on a third.   

At my first college I did some practical effects and costuming work for student films and plays. I also did a practical makeup FX course in the UK one summer when I was 19.  

I have a bit of videography and editing experience from my job at the architecture firm, as well as an internship I did in high school. 
 
I studied CG art in LA - I would consider myself a generalist, with experience doing a bit of modeling, texturing, animation, and VFX. My reel is very heavily focused on environment art for games and cinematics. 
  
And then I’ve also done some customer service gigs and camp counselor jobs as a college student.  

I’m proficient with most of the Adobe Creative Suite - photoshop, illustrator, indesign, premier, after effects, etc  

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",Tasty_James,1,1.0,1,1703993222,2023-12-31 03:27:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18uy4w8/27_male_english_and_cg_art_degrees_struggling/,12,2023
18uxhhg,I've been searching for work unsuccessfully for 2+ years. What can I do differently?,"Hi,

37 year old here. I'm at a loss for how to proceed with my job search.

I am a self-taught software developer\\bootcamp grad (JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Java, .NET, SQL, noSQL) with a background in music business, entrepreneurship and business operations. I have a bachelors in Business Management.

I had a long running music business that effectively closed about 5 years ago after a series of unfortunate events, including the death of one of my artists and a long-term injury to another artist. During this time I also ran into my own health complications (I was in a couple of accidents and sustained physical injury).

I had spent years and years searching for full-time roles in the music industry while running my own company, but I have never been able to have luck. So I have been trying to move on.

I had an operations\\client support management role for about 2 years, got laid off when Covid broke. Have been searching nonstop ever since.

Considering a Computer Science post-bacc because I have been unable to get into grad school without it. Don't know if that post-bacc will help in the job market or be a waste of money.

I do have business management and operations skills but I have no luck applying to jobs of that nature.

I also apply to (and edit my resume and cover letter to fit) jobs pertaining to things like software and web development, IT Help Desk, office administration, arts administration, email marketing, customer service, and writing. I have applied to some service industry jobs too, coffee shops etc, and maintenance roles.

I have been unable to get a single call back or interview during this long, exhausting search. During that time I have tried:

\- Paying to have my resume done (twice)  
\- Seen a career coach (have worked with a few)  
\- Gone to job fairs  
\- Gone to countless meet-ups and networking events in multiple states  
\- Connected with and messaged recruiters  
\- Contributed to open-source and volunteer coding projects  
\- Built and published multiple independent coding projects  
\- Searched for and applied to internships  
\- Applied at temp agencies  
\- Continued to learn new technologies and improve my coding abilities  
\- Looked for freelance work (unsuccessful)

I really can't think of what else to do at this point. I tailor my resume. I don't apply on LinkedIn or Indeed, I always apply on the company site and I always send a follow-up to a recruiter (if I can find one). I would use referrals but I don't know anyone that can give me one. I am biting the dust hard, I haven't had any interviews.

I am looking at the year ahead and I'm not sure what is an efficient use of my time and energy anymore. It seems like it's all about who you know and I really do struggle with socializing, despite the fact that I've worked on networking skills in therapy and through practice. I have spent decades trying to get to know people and, well let's just say I spend holidays alone and that's a pretty good way of explaining the size of my network.

If you are interested in seeing my resume or portfolio feel free to DM!

But truthfully, I've sent out 1000+ applications... some targeted, some less-targeted (I always spend a lot of time really tailoring my resume to a job I think is a good fit). I have a tracker on my portfolio and it doesn't seem like anyone has looked at my portfolio so... I'm not sure if my resume or portfolio matters.

I already don’t make much as I live in HCOL and I couldn’t negotiate as it was the salary they gave me since I came from an internship. 

The job has been pretty flexible but frankly I don’t have that much to do and I’ve asked for more work and feedback and only received praise and been told “to keep doing what I’ve been doing”

Yesterday, I received an email that I’ll be switched to an hourly rate starting January 1st and I have a meeting to understand the changes with the benefits manager on January 5th. 

I thought this was suspicious and then I looked at my ADP and it says that I technically work 86 hours if I was hourly. Which means it would be cut down at least $200 when the move me to hourly. I also recently signed up for my health insurance which will be $100 a month on top of that.

I’m afraid I really won’t have much money left over to live after this change.

I asked my manager if my whole team is moving to hourly and she didn’t answer.

 Also I will be moving to a new role in January with new responsibilities more on par with my co-workers who get paid $130k.

18urp4v,I’m at my wits end with a challenging superior. How can you deal with someone who “kicks the can down the road” to avoid doing work themselves knowing nothing will change?,"""Cartman"", the head of data analytics, is not good at his job. All teams from across the organization are waiting on him to integrate the data sources and fix/create automated reports. Unfortunately Cartman is disorganized, a poor communicator, and lacks the skills he needs at his level, but the one thing he is good at is deflecting blame away from him and creating more work for everyone else. Oh yeah, he frequently gets a bad attitude with people too. Into 2024 he's supposed to have OKRs to get these reports (mine is allegedly in the #3 spot) done...but in the entire time I've been at this company (just under a year), no one is holding him accountable and aren't questioning his lack of organization, prioritization, etc. 

  
I've accepted that even with these OKRs in place, nothing is going to change. I've been trying to work with him on something for the past 9 months, and he'll give me a direction of what he needs, then when I give him what he asked for, he'll point me in a completely new direction. I'll ask him if something is set up correctly: Cartman: ""seems like it is"". Me: ""is it correctly tying X to Y? I want to be 100% sure before I proceed"" Cartman: ""I don't know what other confidence you need from me"". Or I file a ticket with written instructions and goals of things we've discussed and his response will be ""what do you want my team to do?""

  
It's almost comical at this point, he's like a workplace troll! No matter how much I ask him what he needs or communicate to him, he's going to deflect back onto me or avoid answering questions.

  
What can I do at this point? How do I respond to ""what do you need my team to do?"" in the ticket? I could try to passive aggressively troll him back? ""Hi Cartman, I need you to do the above, thanks!"" ""Hi Cartman, I need you to complete the report. Let me know what specific questions you are confused about!"". 

  
I've already asked for as much clarification as I can, I've documented everything, I've looped my immediate manager in on this (although I don't know if he's bringing it to his and Cartman's boss, who is the same person). I met with my boss and Cartman last week to go over the report I need from him, and even my boss was getting frustrated with Cartman's attitude and his lack of clarity. 

Right now Cartman is doing the lower work, I don't know why someone hasn't been hired to do that actual technical work. Probably because Cartman doesn't know what type of role they need.",ItsTimeToSparkle,1,0.5699999928474426,11,1703975410,2023-12-30 22:30:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18urp4v/im_at_my_wits_end_with_a_challenging_superior_how/,12,2023
18uri8c,Should I quit my job in finance to pursue medicine?,"For context, I'm a 25 y/o in the UK working in a front office role at a large investment bank. I received a 1st class biomedical degree from a top UK university.

My job is somewhat healthcare related - I was actually hired because I had studied a healthcare related degree, which has proven helpful. We focus on the healthcare space and spend a lot of time looking into medical science vs focusing predominantly on finance (to keep it as vague as possible). I've found that, since starting, the most enjoyment I've got from the job has been when I'm doing work on medical stuff (think drug mechanisms of action, learning about different conditions, how they're treated, etc...) and have found myself disappointed and/or bored when I then have to link this back to finance. On calls and meetings, I find listening to the research/scientific officers significantly more interesting than anything a CFO could say. I work \~60 hours a week which I actually find okay, though it would be made significantly better if I truly enjoyed the work I was doing.

I was advised to stick it out for two years, as the start is naturally rough for any new joiner, but it seems I simply do not have the passion for finance I thought I had. That being said, it pays *very* well - I wouldn't say I live a lavish lifestyle but I certainly don't have to worry about what I'm spending money on, which is a huge privilege. Most people I have spoken to have brought this up as the main point of argument - why would I throw away what is a relatively 'safe' job that pays incredibly well and took so much effort to get into, to do the same (if not longer) hours for probably less than half the pay, not to mention additional debt? It's a perfectly fair argument and a key reason why I'm hesitating so much... Another thing is the entry requirements for many medical universities require some sort of medical experience (i.e. work experience), which I don't have and don't have the time to acquire.

Any advice, or insights from someone who has done the same, would be helpful!!",anonymoose06,1,1.0,3,1703974925,2023-12-30 22:22:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18uri8c/should_i_quit_my_job_in_finance_to_pursue_medicine/,12,2023
18urfg5,CS Major or Finance?,"I’m currently in a Finance major pursuing a minor in computer science. I want to combine Finance with AI because I’m pretty sure every business and industry will eventually have to incorporate advanced automation to stay competitive. I would preferably want to manage the AI that can streamline business operations to be more efficient. 

Because this career path requires knowledge of Business and CS I don’t know which one to major in. The obvious answer would be CS because you learn more hard skills however I’m concerned about the CURRENT market demand for CS majors especially in Ontario where I live. Finance seems more like a safe bet as there’s always demand for analysts interns. 

In a perfect world I would major on CS and get an MBA down the line but I’m just concerned about the current opportunities for CS as I’m struggling to get internships.

18ur16k,Transitioning into Electrical Engineering,"I am a maintenance electrician/technician working in a manufacturing environment. My current employer is encouraging me to obtain my E-2 license. My job is low stress, relatively high paying ($130k+ including OT), and is allowing me to improve my career through licensure. However, I work 6-7 days per week and I find myself uninterested in the work. Most of my coworkers have worked at this company for 20+ years and I just cannot imagine spending basically every day at work and missing out on life, even if it means I earn less. I am 27 y.o. and I really would rather spend my life with my family not my coworkers.

Due to my past experience I am very interested in power electronics and generation. 

I hold a B.S. in Nuclear Energy Engineering Technology. It was a simple degree to obtain because of my schooling while serving in the Navy as a nuclear electronics technician in a reactor plant. I mostly had to finish up some general education courses and math courses up to Calc. 2. 

Prior to my current role I worked for the operations side of a modular fuel cell power plant company.  

All of my jobs have somewhat blended technician and engineer duties related to instrumentation and controls. The electrical engineers at my company don't hold EE degrees and primarily due PLC programming and machine controls upgrades in conjunction with the mechanical engineers. I think I am capable of that sort of ""engineering"" work, but I feel that I would rather be involved in more innovative projects like renewable energy and grid optimization for the future wave of electric vehicles.

Would it be unrealistic to obtain a M.S. in EE and move into a engineering role in power generation or other applicable field. I am worried that employers would not give me a chance if I don't hold a B.S.EE.   

I am interested in the FE exam in order to give myself a boost in terms of credibility.

I would appreciate insights/advice on my situation.

I’m a 26-year-old traffic engineer with a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering. I currently work for a relatively large firm and while I’m okay with my job, I can’t say that I’m passionate about it. One of the main issues I have is that I’m not thrilled about sitting behind a computer all day.

What I truly enjoy is helping people and seeing the tangible results of my work in the real world. I believe I have strong social skills and I’m good at interacting with people. I also enjoy solving puzzles, though I’m not particularly interested in designing them.

I’ve done some research, both here on Reddit and elsewhere, and a common suggestion seems to be programming. However, as I mentioned earlier, I’m not keen on jobs that require me to sit at a desk all day.

It seems it’s to monitor my breaks to make sure I’m not taking long breaks and because of rumors in the office from coworkers thinking my workload is too light compared to theirs. 

I think I’ve seen the person’s behavior and somewhat my boss’s that led me to suspect this.  I wasn’t sure though. 

But then I overheard someone in the office saying “they have an investigator on her, they think she is not doing anything”. That now makes me think I wasn’t wrong about this. 

Is it normal for there to be one? People I know personally have said they think it is abusive if true.

If not an actual investigator, maybe they just asked someone to watch. Hence why they are not very good, and I can tell it’s going on. Maybe it’s not official and being done secretly, like an abuse of power.

18ulhtc,"21 y/o in NYC with decent background, what would you tell me to do here/what would you do to progress professionally?","longer read so no worries if you don’t want to get into this haha but here:

I’m at a point right now where I think I’ve set myself up well, but I just have no idea on where I should be looking to move forward in my professional career, but it is time to get more serious.

Short backstory: I’m going into my second semester of Junior year at NYU and am 21 years old. Up till this point I’ve always been a sales guy. Opened a used car/motorcycle dealership in high school that did very well (which I had to leave behind when I moved to nyc for school) and and about a year into my studies after working in the nightlife promotion scene, I made some good friends and got myself a great opportunity to join a team at a massive residential real estate brokerage which is where I’ve been for what will soon be 2 years, started off as an assistant - got my license - they liked me and gave me a straight shot onto the team.

But real estate sales is not for me, I make good money for what it is but I really feel like i’m wasting time and my potential in this role, just overall selling myself short. I have a lot of experience in construction and real estate knowledge overall because I grew up in it. (My dad started off in construction, had is own big construction company, then moved into development and investment). My plan has always been to ultimately become a developer so my reason for working in real estate sales was to get more knowledge on the white collar side of real estate as up until then, I’ve been gaining experience and studying the blue collar side. And it has been perfect for that, but time is up here. And I’m also now open to venturing anywhere outside of real estate, kind of annoyed that I chose to lock myself into that industry (in my mind) up until this point.

My mindset has always been “I don’t want to work for anyone and want to be responsible for my own money and work” but I am prepared to toss that mindset for at least a little bit if needed because I know that working somewhere could potentially help me learn just as much if not more, definitely at this age. A bit of structure and stability also never hurt anyone.

Talking to my dad, he’s saying I should jump back into the restaurant industry for a year while i’m still in school as that is the best cash for time return on investment I can get in a part time scenario, and I totally see that pov. 

But i’d like to see what you guys would recommend doing? What industry, or specific jobs should I look into that you think may work with my background? What should I look into for post grad?

Also I’m a US and EU dual citizen, speak 3 languages, and I 100% would be open to spending some time in an EU country for work as well, so trust me, I’m open to hearing ANYTHING.

Training has been not very good and my responsibilities have become more than I was originally told during the interview.

I am salary, but I feel I should be making more based on everything that I’m doing. I found out that they have tons of turnover and was told not to quit by another supervisor right after I started. I was supposed to be a PM Supervisor, but I’m getting calls and texts all hours of the morning and night from all employees on the team.

18ughgs,Lost Motivation in Electronics Engineering Career,"Hi.

I've (25f) been working as a pure hardware electronics test engineer for the past 3 years since graduating. I've worked at 2 different companies (1.5 year in test technician in a SME and 1.5 year in hardware engineer in a big company with bias towards compliance testing). I really want to leave the testing realm and feel like I'm stuck as a hardware test engineer for the rest of my career. 

I've spoken to my manager about it and they said they're going to see if they can find me a design project which happened and then almost immediately got cancelled due to company politics which I'm not going to go into. There's no training opportunities at this big company as well due to budget constraints. I know I should be thankful I still have a job but I feel like my career is stunted. Recently, they've allowed female engineers to go to a talk for women in engineering yet refuses to provide any training in anything which I felt like I'm just a statistic to fill in their women in engineering quota. Not only that, when I mention anything about software and understanding the software behind a product I'm doing compliance testing for (self taught compliance tester with no formal training), my manager told me we're hardware engineers and we don't need to learn or care about software which is something I absolutely hate hearing. It hurts my soul to the point I realise if I wanted to do both hardware and software, I'd need to go back to a SME company.

I've been trying to kickstart projects to get my embedded C up to scratch and have been rejected to a number of entry level jobs due to lack of experience but am enthusiastic or I am knowledgeable in test engineering but that's not what they're looking for in an entry design position. I'm at that point where I'm losing motivation in going into a more design position but I also have no incentive aside from pay and benefits to stay at my current company because it's all compliance testing for me. They're over saturated on electronics design engineers so there's not much opportunities for me to get another chance in design. I didn't know to ask the right questions in the interview and the job description was a bit different from the job itself.

I'm really lost as to what I should do aside from carry on self teaching and upskilling in private behind the backs of my managers and colleagues for fear of getting disgusted looks or getting comments I don't really like to demotivate me. I've already had another female engineer call me inferior because of the university I went to. I don't really need anymore insults within the company. Whilst I can handle these comments, I'd still like to avoid them. I was wondering if anyone has experienced being stuck in test engineering and being pigeon-holed into the job role they're in and if you managed to get out of it? 

TLDR: need motivational advice to get out of electronics test engineering.",ArcticPandantic,2,1.0,2,1703945509,2023-12-30 14:11:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ughgs/lost_motivation_in_electronics_engineering_career/,12,2023
18ue3pg,Lost in life!! (Pls give it a read and share you valuable suggestions),"26M. 
Hey guys! 
Needed a life/career advice, so as to how should I approach/direct my life from the messed up position in my currently in. 

Let’s start w my education,
I have completed my BSc in Aeronautics (2018) from Mumbai University, India.
Took a break for a year as I had met w a bike accident. Pursued MSc in Aerospace Manufacturing from Cranfield University, UK. 
(2020)

As 2020 was hit by Covid-19, couldn’t land a job in the UK. Had to come back to India as it was difficult to survive in the UK without a job. 

Back in India, Covid lockdowns were in place. Landing a job in Aviation industry was nearly impossible as the industry itself had slowed down. 

Grabbed a mediocre job (Store manager) for a food outlet for time being. Quit it after 7/8months. Joined another company as a maintenance engineer (HVAC). Quit it again after 7/8 months as the work culture was too dull. Joined an automation company as a sales engineer. Left it too as achieving targets was getting out of hand. 

Fast forward to today, I m currently jobless. Thinking of doing MBA. CAT hasn’t been good at all. Not sure if it will justify the gap I took in the jobs. Not sure if I ll get a good college. Would it be worth? 

Couldn’t land a job in aviation industry rn , because of lack of experience. Should I try securing a job in Aviation or should I just switch to something more fruitful? 

Need a proper guidance, as I haven’t been so much puzzled ever and it’s just taking a toll on my mental health. Parents are very much supportive but it gets harder sometimes as they are retired. I can see things going downhill , if I don’t figure my career out soon. 

Any suggestions are welcome and would really be appreciated. 
Thank you.",Ashamed-Brief-7,3,1.0,0,1703937463,2023-12-30 11:57:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ue3pg/lost_in_life_pls_give_it_a_read_and_share_you/,12,2023

I always wanted to work in media, music, entertainment, arts, or marketing/copywriitng.

Unfortunately, growing up in an Asian household I had a limiting belief that ""you don't get to work for what you like"". I pursued the ""wrong"" degree in HR, and currently am working as an HR administrator at a bank. (making just enough to pay rent in my city and have $1980 left monthly which goes to food and all things).

It's been 1 year at this job, and I'm miserable. My performance review is coming up next week and I'm not looking forward to it. I'm good at my job, but my personality and disability holds me back. I'm highly intelligent (seriously not to brag), but only a good worker when I'm motivated and engaged.

For seasoned professionals, what is your advice here? I'm too young to know what the next steps are, and don't have family/parent/older adult figures to guide me in life (long story).

Here are the steps I've been taking for the past 5 months:

1) Applying to EVERY hr job I find in the city on LinkedIn and Indeed, hoping that maybe a different company will be better.

2) Taking hubspot courses to learn more about social media marketing and email marketing in hopes that one day I'll magically land a marketing role.

3) Posting on reddit in hopes that someone will help

18u6fc8,At a Crossroads,"I currently have a great job that’s super flexible. Unlimited PTO, 2 days a week in office and a half day every Friday. The people are great and the work is pretty easy. Can’t think of too many days where I’ve worked hard. I probably work about 25 hours/week. It’s dream. The problem is, the pay is well under the market. I’m up for a promotion in April but the more I ask around, the more disappointed I am in the pay increase. 

I’m looking at similar jobs where the pay would be 30-50k more/year than I’m making now. I make decent money (77,250 base plus 20% in bonuses). Making that extra 30-50k would help me pay off my debt which is tough to do now with two kids in daycare and costs of everything going up. The promotion would put me around 85k base and 20% in bonuses. That helps, but still feel like I’d be selling myself short. From that position, there’s not much room for growth. I’d have to become a manager and I’m not sure I’d want to be one. I’d be looking at 3% raises yearly if I stayed in my department. 

My plan is to get the senior title and see what the pay would be, but April is pretty far off and I keep seeing great opportunities pop up. Not saying I’d get them, but my experience and skills more than meet the job descriptions and fulfill some of the preferred qualifications. 

Should I start applying now or wait or the senior title so I can put it on my resume. Plus waiting until April will put me close to the 2 year mark at my company. I don’t want to look like a job hopper.

18u5ocs,Is the military right for me?,"(M27) I'm an UG student with a biology major. I spent some time after high school working to save for college. I don't think I fit well with college students and most civilian adults. I'm very structured, I have routines for fitness and for miscellaneous tasks I do, I keep a multi-year planner for college and income/work planning, and I've fit a job into my schedule. I've run up to 14 miles (though the time wasn't perfect), even with a slight foot injury. I'm very dedicated to doing 100% of what I'm asked to do at work and on class assignments, and I value learning. I engage with professors, I don't just fuck around and not participate in class like trust fund babies. I've done things that require grit, like driving to Los Angeles in less than 2 days for a delivery, and one time to NYC for a delivery in a day and a half- both from west TN. I don't like small talk; I'm direct. Most civilians I've met, of all ages, are very indirect and undisciplined, especially my college administration officers. And I love meeting foreign people and traveling,. I was accepted to a foreign university in Rome (study abroad), but I couldn't cover the required bank balance for everyday expenses, so I couldn't go. I'd love to visit every region of the world. I also like to listen to older people's life experiences and perception of historical events. And I am a patriot (though not a ""nationalistic"" kind); I've made sure to follow politics since age 15 and have voted in every election since age 18, and with the full picture of the country's well-being in mind (not my pocketbook, like most people); I'm also generally invested in donating to causes for things like the Ukrainian war effort and try to stay informed on updates on science, especially climate change. I'm inspired by famous figures who were passionate about public service, like JFK. My choice in games and movies consists of things about history and politics. I'm a hardass with passion. The way I think is very technical, unlike most civilians I know. I think of every day with goals in mind rather than being spontaneous. 

I want to be a part of a group of people who are like me- disciplined, structured, passionate, enjoys learning, enjoys interacting with foreign cultures and older people with unique life experience, has integrity, and wants to help improve society. Being around people who mostly care about each other's sex and dating lives, and who partake in office politics at work, feels unfulfilling. And I don't think like most civilians; I obsess about details. One of my professors even told me I'm the first of their students who has written and talked in such a detailed and objective-centered way. 

I am a junior, so it may be more complicated to join ROTC. What routes could I go from here to join as an officer after college?

So I have heard two very different points of view on the following question. So just wondering what knowledgeable folks in this forum think. 

Is it a ever a good idea to mention another offer to one’s current employer (before resigning obviously)?

The idea is not to force a higher salary. It is really to hope someone will at least listen to my grievances. Specifically, the fact that I have been here ~7 years and have not been promoted. Besides this one issue I am
otherwise reasonably content in my job.

Have been told this is a bad idea because they will know I am not fully invested in the long term. But have been told this is an effective means to be heard.

18u21wy,I just made a risky career choice.. advice on next steps?,"This is my first ever reddit post, so bear with me if I don't know the ins and outs of the platform yet...

I am a 28 year old in the nonprofit development/fundraising space with about three and a half years of professional experience. My first job out of grad school lasted about 2 years, my second one lasted a year and half, and the third, well.... I'll share more below. I don't have any history of gaps in my employment (yet, at least).

In June, I was recruited by a small nonprofit for a new job as their development director. The gig came with a pay increase too. Two weeks into the job, I found out that the organization was deeply in debt and had hired a full-time fundraiser as a last resort to keep payroll going. I also have since learned that the ED is a deeply difficult person to work with (she will regularly storm out of meetings, hurl insults at staff, keep routine information secret, etc).

It took only about 7 months for the stress of the new role to cause me to have a full mental break down (like was seriously looking at inpatient mental health care type breakdown). My mental health was in such a bad space that I wasn't sleeping, eating, or doing/talking about anything other than work. The day after my mental breakdown, I made the potentially reckless decision to submit my resignation without another job lined up.

I submitted my letter of resignation two weeks ago, with my final day with my employer will be January 19th. While that has given me a few weeks to apply for jobs (I've been trying to submit about 4-5 applications per week) and I do have some financial cushioning (my husband's insurance/income that can sustain our whole household for a few months), I'm worried that this may hurt my career long-term, since I know it is much harder to find a job after quitting.

To top it all off, I just learned this week that I'm unexpectedly 7 weeks pregnant. I know that will make the job search process all the more difficult.

TLDR, I need advice on how to talk about my situation to future employers in a way that won't signal that I'm flighty or difficult to work with. I do have some solid references who can vouch from me, including three of my current coworkers, but I know that isn't enough.

I am senior software engineer, have been working in this company of about 1500 employees for about 3 years. Recently I am offered to switch department to become a senior data engineer, which have similar salary range. Moving there, I will lead a team of 3 junior engineers (1-2 yoe). The data engineer department is mostly doing inhouse stuffs, which IMO are very much needed for a company of this size. I ask about my salary and the boss say he will ask, but from my experience working there, I will get at best a 3% raise. Data engineer is something in my radar so the switch will benefit my career, but not something I am excited about.  
  
And here is the catch. In my observation, the data engineer director joined the company 2 years ago, and since then 8 out of 8 team leads quit the company, in which only 2 of them quit because of personal reasons, while the rest quit to go to greener grass. The department size also shrink from 36 to just over 14 employees. Those numbers are red flag, I know. But my personal interaction with the director is good, he seems nice, the work seems challenging but not so hard with very little if at all overtime. I contacted several team leads but since we are not closed, their reasons are vague and common (no career development, no salary increase), which I don't think explain the exodus.

18twayl,Should I do a coding boot camp during college?,"Hey there!  
I hope this message finds you all well. I'm currently a sophomore majoring in Instrumental Performance (music) at a college in the United States, and I'm reaching out to get your thoughts on an idea I've been considering.  
Initially, I enrolled in college as a Computer Science major, having completed AP Computer Science courses in high school. However, I realized my true passion is in music, and I switched my major to performance. Still, though, coding remains a hobby for me, and I'm contemplating completing a Python boot camp.  
Currently, I'm a full-time student and work part-time as a delivery driver. While the job pays the bills (lol), I find it unfulfilling and was thinking of exploring opportunities in coding, even if they pay less. Specifically, I'm considering a remote coding job.  
Given my circumstances, do you think it's worth investing time and money in a boot camp while I'm still pursuing a music major? I plan to sustain myself through teaching and performing music but see coding as a great fallback option.  
I'd love to hear your thoughts, and if you have any insight, could you recommend some good and affordable boot camp options?

I have been looking into other possible career paths, but I feel overwhelmed with the amount of possible choices and I was hoping someone could give advice of a good career match for my personality if they see any possible matches.

18tuura,Trying to come up with a reasonable salary expectation,"I'm an employee of a small company that does contract work, mainly IT work the last several years.  There are only two other employees doing billable work, mainly various kinds of clerical support work, and my boss, who is the president/owner of the company. She doesn't really do any billable work anymore, just oversees the accountant who does payroll.  I'm the only only IT person, and the contracts we're getting lately are for IT work.  If I left the company, they wouldn't get these contracts.

I've worked for this person for over 25 years. I read somewhere that the pay for a person doing contract work like I do is about 1/3 of the billing rate, and that's about what I was getting.  I get slightly more now, if I consider bonuses, but I feel like I'm due more.  They've made so much off my work over the years, and now I'm clearly the one bringing in business.  We all work from home, so aside from liability insurance and the accountant, I can't imagine that overhead is that much.  I think my boss is just making money hand over fist from all of my hard work.

I'm trying to figure out what I could ask for as my share of my billing rate and be reasonable about it.  Do I have have any grounds for asking what the company's overhead is?  Last year I brought up the fact that I was bringing in the work, and my boss said she'd been thinking about that and the fact that I need to be paid more, and she'd see what they could do. I was really expecting to be blown away by a huge 4th quarter bonus this week, but it was the same amount I got last year at this time. I went ahead and acknowledged it with a ""thank you for the bonus"" text, and she replied that as long as the accountant tells them they can afford to give me bonuses they will.  Like, my billing rate went up this year and we started two new contracts that I'm busting my ass on.  

I'm trying to think of a way to bring it up with her again, but I'm in no position to negotiate since I don't know what I should ask for.",bluetantra22,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1703877246,2023-12-29 19:14:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18tuura/trying_to_come_up_with_a_reasonable_salary/,12,2023
18tunx5,Separating your work life from other parts of your personal life - How do you best balance it when it comes to social media?,"For some brief context, I am 30 years old, aspergers (diagnosed at 5), and I work as a Learning Technologist for a University in the UK. For anyone who doesn't know, a Learning Technologist is someone who assists in the design of Learning Management Systems (LMS) and teaching of these systems to academic staff and its students during each academic year.

Now don't get me wrong, I love my job and wouldn't change anything about it. That being said, I am fairly new to the role that I do now, so still a lot to learn, which is fine, because I enjoy learning.In my personal life, I play video games, watch TV and anime, read a lot of different books usually sci-fi/thriller, and try to make time for friends and family as much as I can.Naturally, I would say I am more or less content with the different stuff I do day-to-day.

However, my question is - how do you balance what you are like as a person with what you do as a professional career? Do you ever feel like you are living a double life or feel like you are a different person whether you are at work or playing a game, because you know you won't be in the same mindset depending on what you are doing in that moment in time?

A lot of this question comes down to how I feel perceived on social media - and I understand that this can feel like a toxic mindset because ""social media = bad"" I do understand that.

But, to try and explain this better - recently, I have noticed more people in the same industry as me who have, for example, a personal Twitter page, but they treat Twitter like LinkedIn - They follow their work colleagues on Twitter, they basically put their work history in their bio, and anything related to the company they work for (i.e. new job postings, etc.) they post on their page or retweet anything that the company posts. Am I the only one who thinks this is a bit weird? I thought Twitter was meant to be for your personal use, to demonstrate the things you like in your free time, but it feels like there is a quite a few people, particularly in the corporate world that want to make their work their personality.

Now I could obviously just be missing the point here, and maybe some of these people do in fact have lives outside of their job, but when it comes to social media, do you keep it as far out of your personal life as possible? As far as my social media goes, I do have a Twitter and Instagram, but I try to keep all of that away from my work, and do not even talk about my job on any of them. The most I use my Twitter for is to post about video games, retweet the odd meme, look for advice on topics when I need it and that's about it.

TLDR; I don't post about my job on social media. My social media is my own, and while I do post whatever I want on there (within reason of course) I am feeling some form of guilt for not posting about my job, or not conforming to make my profile more 'professional' like others in my 'work circle' seem to have done. Is this damaging to my career? Am I just looking at it the wrong way, and the fact of the matter is, a lot of people actually do their job, go home, and then do whatever they want in their free time, despite how social media perceives it at times?",ChocobroMoglord,1,1.0,2,1703876748,2023-12-29 19:05:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18tunx5/separating_your_work_life_from_other_parts_of/,12,2023

18tsnqj,Can boss force employee to work out of buisness hour if mistakes were made at work? (Whithout paying OT),"My sister work hybrid as a grahpic designer, sometimes when she made a mistake at work she is expected to overtime remotely and finish the day work, she's currently on probation/intern for 3 months, so her pay is already low, but they never pay her OT for the hours she spent off-site or at home, some even take her untill 2am in the morning, imo her mistakes aren't that major, cause usually it's because they were expecting her to focus on something more instead of something else without clarifying her what she actually need to prioritize on, which cost her time but in the end she is at fault because of not asking, though i think she was given vague instructions that were made to be misunderstood. But i won't debate on that. She's working on 3 projects with day by day deadline, She is issued to design something that is given to her day to day, if she fail to finish it within a day she is expected to OT, even if she din't make any mistakes they would still call her up at night to send in the day work if she haven't finished. The deadline never exceed 2-3 days within announcement. If she don't do OT would she get in trouble? Consideting they don't pay her for the time anyway? Also theres one more thing that happened to her, the ""manager"" messed up the deadline for the project she worked on and he didn't even clarified it, just deleted it and edited some stuffs to cover up the mistake and expected her to work with the new deadline, is this legal? The ""manager"" also likes to send in the working files 30 mins before the buisness hour is up.... This is her 2nd company (first hybrid) and she got loads to complain about but the driving factor that makes her want to quit is working off buisness hours (OT) without pay.

18trg3c,I (26 M) Feel stuck in my job and stagnating career/ financial growth. Unsure of what my next career move should be and how to set myself up financially.,"As the new year is almost here, I sit at my cubicle in a mostly quiet office contemplating my career and financial status.  
  
Currently I don't like where I am at and am looking for a change but don't really know where to begin/ how to move forward.  
  
  
  
I'm a contractor doing full-time low level help desk/ IT for a large company. I get about $27/h which is fine for now but after being here for 1.5 years, my supervisor let me know not to hold out hope for a salaried job and actively look for other positions as the higher ups intend to keep me a contractor as its cheaper and looks better on their budget.  
  
I have a bachelors degree in information technology with a focus on programming and 3 years overall of help desk experience, but right now the job market isn't looking so good. I have applied for dozens of jobs with no callbacks, when just a year ago, I was getting callbacks left and right.  
  
Now it has me wondering if I should double down and put some money/ time into IT certifications and move on from helpdesk or if I should even leave the profession altogether and do something else. I keep pushing myself to study after work but my living conditions in a split up unit with many room mates makes it hard to concentrate and even harder to have actual privacy.  
  
Most of my buddies who went into trades straight from high school are more or less financially stable, with one of them even buying a house at the same age as me, where I rent a figurative shoebox for $400/month as that's all I can afford right now.  
  
Trade off is that most of those guys are physically beat to hell, but maybe in the long haul its worth it? Not sure if I'm too old to start over again and if I did I'd be taking a paycut at the start which might make it harder to afford necessities.  
  
I really liked electrical work and even did an electrician training course during the summer one year of university that prepped you to take the IBEW/JAC entrance exam/ test. At the time of the physical assessment the recruiter let me know that if I was to go all the way I'd have to leave my university program as I'd have to commit to being a union electrician full time, which I couldn't do as I already sunk time and money into my degree, so I finished that up and dropped any electrician asperations for the time.  
  
Right now my biggest expenses per month are $400 rent , $25-30 on my cellphone plan, $400 on groceries, $200 on student loan payments and $300 on any entertainment/ eating out. I highly doubt any better living accommodation is within reach right now, but it seems like I might need to figure out something as it really is taking a toll on my mental health to the point where all I do now is work, come home and play video games or read until bed, rinse and repeat 5 days a week.  
  
I currently have about $20k in savings and about $10k split between a tax free savings account  and my brokerage account which is ok but I don't actively look at my brokerage account much these days. Also I'm scared to invest my savings as my housing situation is precarious and I need to be ready to bounce back if something happens. I have about 8k left on my student loan, but otherwise no other debt.  
  
I've felt stuck in this cycle of working, saving and living somewhat minimalistic for years but I don't know what to do.  
  
At this point I've even thought about doing something radical like packing up all my stuff and moving to a different state and starting again with a clean slate. I have a couple in mind where I've visited for work but have never actually lived in any besides the one where I was born and raised.   
  
  
  
TLDR: Feeling stuck with career and finances, looking for a change in my life that will set me up for success later on.  
  
Honestly any advice/ comments are appreciated. Happy new years everyone.",Emantr1,1,0.5,1,1703868447,2023-12-29 16:47:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18trg3c/i_26_m_feel_stuck_in_my_job_and_stagnating_career/,12,2023

18tpmqr,"Joined a new company, overloaded with work, communist boss?","Hi everyone. I work in tech as a PM and recently left a very comfortable (but boring) job to pursue something more exciting at a start-up. I understand that start-ups are more chaotic and I actually prefer it. However, I'm having second thoughts on joining. Care to tell me what you think?

I was supposed to join a team but they all left prior to my arrival. I report directly to the CEO because my would-be manager also left the company. My CEO has no idea what it is I actually do and all he does is give me more and more work. It's my job to say no and have him back off, but the reality is that I'm currently fulfilling two positions because it's operationally needed. They told me that they would hire someone else ASAP but after some budgeting constraints, decided to leave me fulfilling both roles for an indefinite amount of time. I'm quickly burning out and working extra hours every day. The CEO also has a habit of contacting me and my team on weekends and personal holidays. I haven't had any real training or coaching and I'm just expected to know everything like I've been here for much longer.

To be honest I wouldn't care so much except for the fact that everybody I've talked to is complaining about low salaries.

18tpmql,"Joined a new company, overloaded with work, communist boss?","Hi everyone. I work in tech as a PM and recently left a very comfortable (but boring) job to pursue something more exciting at a start-up. I understand that start-ups are more chaotic and I actually prefer it. However, I'm having second thoughts on joining. Care to tell me what you think?

I was supposed to join a team but they all left prior to my arrival. I report directly to the CEO because my would-be manager also left the company. My CEO has no idea what it is I actually do and all he does is give me more and more work. It's my job to say no and have him back off, but the reality is that I'm currently fulfilling two positions because it's operationally needed. They told me that they would hire someone else ASAP but after some budgeting constraints, decided to leave me fulfilling both roles for an indefinite amount of time. I'm quickly burning out and working extra hours every day. The CEO also has a habit of contacting me and my team on weekends and personal holidays. I haven't had any real training or coaching and I'm just expected to know everything like I've been here for much longer.

To be honest I wouldn't care so much except for the fact that everybody I've talked to is complaining about low salaries.

* **Graduate:** double degree business administration in 2 other countries (Europe and South America) 
* **Languages (fluent):** English, Spanish, German, Danish/Swedish/Norwegian

I’m 25 years into a career that has served me very well and now pays me well. 

In short, I didn’t finish high school, don’t have a diploma or a degree. 

I started my career because it was an entry to full time work that didn’t require a high level of education. 
I’ve since earned some industry specific (large scale hospitality) certifications on low level quals (vocational). 

My skills include managing large teams, development and training, budget planning and control, interdepartmental collaboration, short and mid term planning and implementation.
Strategy and diversification in production flows play a big part in my role.

18tjv1e,Need Advice - 2 Opportunities coming my way,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 28 year old who really hasn’t got his dream job or any recognition in the workplace. My background is that I worked for 3 years in marketing out of University graduation. I had a career change into recruitment and HR the last 2 + years and it has been the right decision.

To keep a long story short, I applied for a Defence/Military position for a challenge and I took on a new role on contract that got me better pay and less hours to focus on my application that will actually help gain my further advantages into consideration for my enlistment. The big issue is, my current employer thinks I’m a great worker, a good fit for the company and as I’m responsible for recruiting for my own role in February, incase I wasn’t successful, they would be comfortable with me becoming their general manager of the franchise, after just 1 month of solid work. They put this offer across as competitive against my defence application.

Why did I get this opportunity? I think I was myself and since the Franchise was only 6 months young, I wanted to give it my best and really improve in ways I felt like I could.

Both opportunities lead to that professional desire to help people develop through a leadership position and both will work within Human Resources and Management.

Does anyone have advice on how I should wiegh up this decision. It seems unfair to have 2 unbelievable opportunities fall in my lap. A good problem to have but I need guidance.

I have tried a lot of jobs but I find that I have zero interest and find my personality not suitable and cannot handle it.

But after finishing and a while of doing research before and after graduation, I find it really boring and feel like doing research or science in general just sucks the joy out of my life. Therefore, I decided that I should not do any job related to science including teaching. After that, I transferred myself to sales department but after a while I find that I am not fit for the office work and also the essence of the job, which concentrates on human. Then right now I am teaching English to students but the problem still remains. I find it really boring and  do not care overall to the students. It is like I find it really hard and usually stress myself to maintain a good energy to keep up the lesson. So right now I feel like I do not know what to do anymore. And I do not have any particular interest in public events or politics or society. My personality suits for doing science/ research but I really do not like it. I used to try to stick with science but it all ended with me being mentally exhausted and always grumpy all the time.

18tgly1,How do I transition from dead end jobs to fulfilling career?,"(27 /M/ Midwest USA) First reddit post 😀 
I live in a decent sized city in the Midwest. 
Pretty dissatisfied with my job but I'm kind of in a position where I need to smoothly transition into something much better while still retaining some schedule flexibility. Advancement at my current job is basically not a possibility. I've always felt I've just been working whatever job I had to get by until my dream job came along but I know it doesn't work like that. Would love to get into a more creative job and utilize skills I've developed through hobbies (art, digital art, some IT n diagnostic skills). 
Would love a gig as a tattoo artist, animator, or start a laser engraver business. Something where I get to draw and be creative but still work in a more technical and methodical way. 
Applied to community college; make too much money for financial assistance to be of use but too little money to pay out of pocket.
Tattoo shop market is very saturated here. I have little money available to get tattoos regularly and build shop relationships that way. No art school so not a lot of stuff worthy of putting together into a portfolio.
No animation or bigger game company to get in the mail room here as far as I know.

Currently a part time manager at a Papa John's for $15/hrs. I've been there for about 2.5 years. Ran a Handyman business for 6 months before I needed a more steady gig. 2.5 years at a Controls / Construction company before that. Been working since before I was 15yo, most of my work history being either food prep/service or construction. I believe I am a quality employee in both fields given time to learn the job/company specifics. Just bought my first house with my fiancé. Only child is almost 1 now. Cut down hours from 40ish hours to 30ish hours because the fiancé worked the ladder and jumped to her old job for better pay and position.

Working on touching up my resume and sending it around to some better paying gigs. However with limited babysitter time and no college degree I feel locked out of many meaningful opportunities. Not to mention the modern job hunt is its own bleak grind.
Feels like I squandered my free time and education prospects when I was a younger man and now I'm really paying for it. Just want to provide a good life for my family while feeling like I'm in a career I care about.

I recently graduated from Uni with a BS in Psych. I was very lucky to have a job lined up after graduation and I've been under job training for a month now. I'm training to be a psychometrist. My initial career goal was to work for the clinic during my 2 gap years and apply for grad school to become a clinical psychologist.  
However, I'm so lost and confuse with everything. I don't know if post-grad life has been affecting me. Or maybe the major changes of my routine (10+ hours work day). I started regretting majoring psych ever since I started working at the clinic. During my time in undergrad, I had this plan of going to grad school and fulfilling my dreams of becoming a psychologist. Things have changed and I want to go into Marketing or HR. with my psych degree. What do I need to go into Marketing?  
Is this normal to feel this way? I have been losing sleep, having mental breakdowns daily, losing chunks of hair, not eating well, and high anxiety. I feel like a failure since I'm 1st generation and I don't want to let my parents down. My mind hasn't been clear to even think what is wrong with me. I don't understand if post-grad is affecting me or the job in general. The last time I felt like this is when I was working for the counseling department at my school and I had to leave after three weeks since I had disrespectful co-workers.

18td32b,Can your manger force you to work six days a week if the holiday falls on a day you normally have off?,"Recently my manager approached me about the holiday schedules for this new year. Most of the holidays our company recognizes fall on Mondays, a day we are short staffed. My normal shift is Tuesday - Saturday 8:00-4:30, I am regionally located at New York and work hourly. With the new year as I said most of the holidays fall on Monday's when I normally have off. Recently my manager put out a survey of which holidays agents would be willing to work. Since I have Mondays off I assumed that I would have these days off as it is my normal shift. My manager sent another email after the survey of which holidays we'd be willing to work and cover; indicating that our normal time off would not be observed.  
My question stands as, Can your manger force you to work six days a week if the holiday falls on a day you normally have off?

18tcz7e,I'm done..............,"Hi All,   


So I was offered an oppurtunity to open a branch for the US corporate office in the Philippines to offer 24/5 Support to our clients, with the Company owners blessing.   


I started working Night Shifts in the US to start prepping.   


Plan was for me to be is to be a contractor (to limit his liability)   


I did the following to facilitate my Move in January 2024  
\- Looked and booked housing   
\- Sold most of my Belongings in the US (Cars, guns, motorcycles)  
\- Started Lining up Candidates to interview as soon as I land

\- Created Job Postings for HR and Recruitment to approve. 

\-Line up my Dog for Health Inspections (For Importation) so I can Purchase my ticket and his ticket (January 17th, landing date)

\-About to inform my landlord with 30 day notice  


Thursday before christmas, I get a call from another Manager who is also involved in this project   
saying that the owner decided to hold off hiring till a later date and (the manager) said he is cancelling his trip since he can't hire anyway. 

&#x200B;

So I just freeze up and wiegh my options, which are  


\- Go ahead on the Trip and just work it till I am able to hire (as a contractor) 

\- Stay in the US (as a full time employee) and go once I get a firm commitment. 

\- Quit and find another Job

&#x200B;

I can stay and be irked the whole time till I can go over but whats going to stop him from screwing me over when I am overseas. 

&#x200B;

By the way, I don't think they will compensate me for whatever I spent. 

&#x200B;

I might also have another client who is willing to take me as a full time hire for more Money and benefits.

18tbom0,24F who is unsure how to proceed with continuing education (MPH? MHA?),"Here is some background. I am a 24 year old with an undergraduate degree in healthcare administration with minors in business and economics (Graduated 2022). Going into undergrad, I wished to go into hospital administration immediately and pursue an MHA after a year of working. At the time, I was making about $16/hour working for a large hospital system’s finance department for my internship, being mentored by the COO, CFO, and HR Officer. However, the HCOL in my area pushed me towards a new career pat
h, as I kept being promised a full time position in that department but was working without benefits and the timeline of being permanent with a raise there kept being pushed back and I could not afford to wait. After that, I moved on to working as the assistant to an admissions director at a nursing home for a short time at $22/hour. I worked long hours and the job was high stress with an ineffective and unhelpful director that was not present. Now, I have a similar job except I am running the admissions for a nursing home and reporting directly to the administrator. The pay isn’t much better but I make about $52,500 and I am salaried with better benefits and up for performance review with a raise so I anticipate being here to at least summer 2025.

However, my end goal really is to maximize my earning potential and I’m considering going to grad school.

Now I have a few options I suppose. I can go through an AIT program and become a LNHA for a very low cost through my current job. This would cost the least amount of money and would open me up to earnings increase of $15,000 to $30,000.

However, I’ve been considering higher education beyond that and was wondering if the best way to move forward with my career is to first do that or just go directly into a master’s program? 

I am between an MPH and MHA, as the MHA mimics a lot of my undergraduate coursework but in higher detail and would open me up to more hospital administration roles. However, I am interested in public policy and program planning as it relates to the social determinants of health, which I believe points more to the MPH. I am just stuck on what to do next and would love input from people with these degrees and what their current title is and how they got there and what they would reccommend for me and my background",ravenhairedblonde,2,1.0,0,1703816519,2023-12-29 02:21:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18tbom0/24f_who_is_unsure_how_to_proceed_with_continuing/,12,2023

18ta6cl,2 Years of Hard Work Undone by One Person,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to share a recent experience I've had in my professional life and am open to any advice or insights you might have.

I work as a tax accountant and internal control leader for big multinational company. This year, I've put a tremendous amount of effort into my role, achieving every goal set in the annual plans and going beyond. I've built 22 automations, including a machine learning project, learned to code and create RPAs. I've reduced significantly the hours other areas were investing in repetitive tasks, increasing the worklife balance score because now a whole team can leave on time.

However, a recent incident has left me feeling frustrated and disappointed. During a general stock inventory, I encountered an issue with the supply chain manager. I had audited many areas, including supply chain, in recent months. The manager has expressed feeling targeted by these audits. Despite my attempts to offer help and clarify my intentions, he perceived my actions negatively and complained horribly to my manager, getting to the point that he said I slammed the door of his office on the way out.

This led to my performance review score being lowered from the highest possible rating, which has impacted my eligibility for a promotion I've been aspiring to for two years. The promotion would report directly to the supply chain manager, and given the current situation, it seems unlikely that he would want me on his team.

I'm struggling with feelings of betrayal and anger, as I've invested so much into this role. I had plans for using the expected promotion and bonus to move to a bigger house and pay off debts. Now, I'm considering how to move forward. Should I stay and try to mend the relationship? Or is it time to look for new opportunities where my efforts are more valued?

I'd appreciate any advice on how to handle this situation, especially from those who have faced similar challenges. How do you deal with a difficult boss or colleague? How do you bounce back from such setbacks?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: After two years of dedicated work and significant achievements, including creating numerous automations and a machine learning project, my chances for a well-deserved promotion were derailed by a petty manager from another area.",Snapandsnap,2,0.75,4,1703812196,2023-12-29 01:09:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ta6cl/2_years_of_hard_work_undone_by_one_person/,12,2023

18t9qjp,Time for a new job?,"I started working at my current company a little over 2 years ago as a part-time HR Intern/Assistant before being promoted to an HR Generalist when I graduated college (non-HR bachelors) about 8 months ago. When I was promoted I was trained in payroll and worked with accounting and the payroll manager to help keep things running when our other payroll person took a leave of absence. That lasted about 5-6 months until the other payroll person returned and I was moved away from that position. I enjoyed the work and felt good to be learning new, transferable skills. 

After being moved though, I feel like the work that I’m doing is very monotonous and almost unimportant. I feel like I’m back to doing intern stuff. The company is pretty large with a lot of seasonal work and high turnover, so for the last 2 months my day has been basically just handling unemployment claims, watching for background checks to clear, updating employee information, and screening phone calls. If it’s a payroll related question or something basic from the other branches of HR (benefits, employee relations, leaves, etc.) I can handle it but if it’s anything more than generic info I send it over to another person on the team who handles it. I’ve talked to my boss about either moving over to payroll permanently or training more in the other HR branches, but neither are likely to happen anytime soon. It could just be that since I’m new and young they don’t want to give me any of the more important responsibilities but I’m not sure.

I got accepted into a Masters program for HR that begins in Fall of 2024, but I’m now wondering if I should just start looking for another job at a different company to try and gain experience or more training. Or should I just suck it up and hold out until I get my masters. The job itself is cool (nice coworkers, hybrid work, good pay for a job straight out of college, not too stressful), but I feel like I’m going to be wasting the early years of my career working here and another part of me is nervous that they may just fire me one day because I’m not crucial to the team or something :(

My parents are pressuring me to go to nursing school for 2 years at my local community college, but I really don't think nursing is for me-nurses are overworked and stressed and abused. Plus if I went to nursing school, I'd have to work a part time job while in nursing school in order to pay rent. But I know nothing about money and I'm worried it'd be difficult to work and be in nursing school at the same time. I'm looking for a job right now so I can start saving up. 

I could either go the 2 year nursing school route and pay rent w my sister, or I could go to a 4 year and  try to find something I'm passionate about, because I honestly really don't wanna be nurse. But I'm very tempted by the job security and high pay that comes with nursing, esp considering that I'm homeless.

18t7601,Starting over... again,"My father was self employed and passed 6 years ago. He had no insurance and not enough savings.  After he became ill,  I took on a job with a nationwide corporation. I took care of him and his bills the last few years of his life.  He always joked and said his last check would go to the funeral home and it would bounce... the money didn't make it that far.  I actually had to borrow money from my mom,  his ex wife,  for his cremation.  

Since then I got lucky in stocks and was frugal enough that I've put away 100k.  I do have one loan, but it only cost me $130 a month.  I rent and my vehicles are old, but paid for. 

A few things I realized after he passed:  
1)  I don't ever want to be in a position where I HAVE TO work those hours for any company as a nobody slaving away my life. I still have a screenshot of my time card from that year where at one time I worked 100hrs in 8 days just to pay the bills.

2) I thought I would have had more time with him to travel and I didn't. Previously he went to Greece with my brother twice, but we were in the middle of projects and I was the one who stayed back to keep things going smoothly.  

My mental dilemma is this:
I no longer have a job, I have no obligations, and I want to travel. I've only visited a few states on the east coast never to the west coast or overseas. Last month my boss sold the property I maintained so if I want to leave... now is the time.

Interest rates are up and it may not be worth going into business for myself again until this rates drop. I would like to keep as much money in the bank as possible so I can go back into business for myself after I travel. 

I dislike where I live.  If I want to make the money I want to make,  I need to move to where people make that type of money in my field.  I can move anywhere. I can also get dual citizenship and if I enjoy Europe I can stay there.  

With these thoughts what would you do? Where would you start over?  What is it like owning a business in other countries? Is that worth looking into?

I do have a ton of free time, I probably work about 2 hours of the 8 that I'm clocked in, but since I'm required to be in-office a large majority of the time, OE isn't a possibility at the moment so I've been contemplating getting certified in different programs/softwares/etc. that I can complete during my down time at work. 
I guess my questions are, what would set me up for success down the road based on my bit of background and current situation? Is it worth getting certifications for different systems? Which ones should I be looking into? 
I would like to continue in the IT field, maybe continue as a generalist like I currently am, but also open to looking into different specializations within the IT realm.

18t5m4f,Job Offer Rescinded Out of Nowhere right before start date,"I (30M) just recently accepted a new position 3 weeks ago as a level II manufacturing engineer for a large aerospace company. Took the position because my current role does not even focus on the discipline of engineering I went to school for/what my background is in, so I decided to move on. In other words, the job was not what was advertised, and I relocated to the state over for it. Now, I was planning to come back to my home state with this offer that seemed very good, and all of a sudden, the VP of Operations emails me, and he states we need this position to start tomorrow and they then rescind the offer (they did not answer the phone call or emails I have sent on this). They offered the position to me knowing I couldn't start until after the new year (start date of Jan. 2 on my offer letter). I am just finishing my relocation and I am completely stunned. Anyone ever had this happen to them? My two weeks' notice service was completed last week with my company, so I am completely SOL with no paycheck that was expected to begin on Jan. 2. WTF!

I was thinking of bringing this up through their corporate HR to understand why this exactly happened. Any feedback is greatly appreciated on similar occurences and what you did/would do in this situation.

18t5iui,"Burnt out at new job of 7 months, what to do?","I am 31F and have a BA in Communications.

From 2016 to 2020 I was a customer service assistant and then customer service rep. To be transparent, I was terminated in late 2020 due to being late, I was struggling deeply with my mental health and looking elsewhere anyway. A year prior, they were grooming me for management but I never saw myself being in customer service forever, I wanted to get into marketing.

2021 to 2023 I was a global planning support specialist. I was hired as sales support but the role shifted, long story. I was a contractor (difficult to explain) with no room for growth. I needed more salary desperately and got my current job.

May 2023 started as a customer operations coordinator / supply chain support representative at a dye manufacturer. Role pays 52k and they said everyone at the company starts in this position and moves up or around. Read negative reviews online of insanely high workloads, overtime as a rule, not enough staff, yelling in the workplace, cut throat. It’s all true. Since I’ve been here we’ve lost or terminated three people. One person just left and another is on medical leave and we think she might quit too. Workloads are ridiculous. I was doing a “one person job” that was too much, but they just gave me more including the person who quit and the other person on medical leave, so now I have a 3 person job. I’m so overwhelmed. My role is too much, I manually enter and manage orders through the whole process, and answer questions on credit holds and shipping and more, and there are a lot of dumb processes, so many locations of this company that we ship out of and they all operate differently, our role is really involved with supply chain and I feel way overburdened. Every month people freak out because they want us to hit our revenue numbers and the stress is really really high. Unrealistic metrics. Lying management. Everything gets blamed on customer service but I feel the expectations are really unrealistic and we are doing way too much with way too little staff. Most people are new. We were supposed to have a new person start next week but they bailed. Trouble hiring people.

I’m really exhausted. It’s month end and I have people screaming from all angles at me to enter all orders within 24 hours but also respond to 100 emails and get it all done and shipped by Friday. 

Everyone here works overtime and as fast as possible. I’m getting burnt out. I don’t even know what I want to do. I feel like a failure for not being further along in my career. I don’t even care about work like I used to. To get to management I feel you just have to shmooze and lie and posture yourself to the top. 

I feel embarrassed because I know people younger than me with much better titles, I have a degree, I am a really hard worker but… this is too much. My dad asked if I got a raise yet. Company asks me what my interests are for my development but the whole company runs so poorly I know I’ll be overworked in all roles here since they run sooo lean. Ashamed to quit a job so soon.

It is hard to explain how overburdened the CSRs at. At my first customer service role, we entered orders and answered basic questions. In this role we are working with planning and shipping and accounting extensively, which management would do at my other company, and management doesn’t seem to do much besides monitor metrics and not actually help much.

TLDR: burnt out at current job but feel I should stay longer, but not sure what I want to do long term?

18t4wkv,WWYD: Charge non-billable or PTO?,"Hey guys,

I’m a controls engineer. I’m in a bit of a pickle here with filling out this week’s time sheet. My industry tends to get slow around the holidays, and so I have been light on work. Well, actually, I have no work as of last Friday. 

I am set to be married next year, and need to be very conservative with my PTO due to the events that surround that.

I made it clear to my manager that I wouldn’t be taking off any days over the holidays, and that I need work, in the weeks leading up to this one. He wasn’t able to provide me any.

I haven’t done any billable work this week, and my entire team took PTO, so I have no one to ask for work, including him.

Would I be wrong to go through with my plan of charging to an overhead code, instead of PTO? I feel justified in it because I warned him weeks in advance. I really can’t afford to burn the 3 days’ PTO. The way I see it, I WOULD BE working this week, but management didn’t come through with their responsibility, so I don’t think I should go down for it.

On the other hand, I haven’t done any work or training (none available to do), and my days have been spent as if I were on PTO. I suspect charging overhead will raise red flags internally and my manager will get questioned.

I feel I have to put my foot down early at this job (I’ve been here 1 year), so that way I don’t get taken advantage of in the future. I gave too many gimmes at my first and previous engineering job and it was a part of me feeling I had to leave (I was there 3 years).

18t4lyr,Choosing Passion Over Paychecks: A Reflection on Career Decisions.,"In a world where the pursuit of wealth often overshadows personal passions, it’s disheartening to see individuals selecting careers or college majors solely based on monetary gains. Growing up in less fortunate circumstances can lead some to envy those with financial stability, fueling a fear of lifelong poverty. While jobs were once seen as avenues to follow one’s passion, the current trend leans heavily toward chasing lucrative opportunities out of jealousy. This shift underscores the destructive power of envy driven by financial differences.  Opting for a career purely for financial reasons can be detrimental, and those who do may find that success remains elusive. True fulfillment comes from pursuing one’s passion and putting in the hard work required. Choosing a path solely for its monetary rewards reflects a desire for an easy, quick route to wealth, neglecting the value of dedication and effort. Ultimately, the message remains clear: success follows those who align their careers with their passions and commit to the journey, demonstrating that genuine effort is the key to a prosperous future.",Rich-King5464,1,0.33000001311302185,4,1703797728,2023-12-28 21:08:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18t4lyr/choosing_passion_over_paychecks_a_reflection_on/,12,2023

I have a peer/friend in my current role. She has been in the role longer, but she has been leaning on me increasingly for help. (She's had things going on at home that made her take time off work a lot, especially recently).

I need to figure out a way to tell her that I can't keep doing this - at least, not at this level.

What was once a quick question or two per day turned into every question she has, several video calls, and step by step training sessions. 
She does not try to ask anyone else or look it up using our resources anymore.

I am not a trainer. We are quota-based employees and our performance is measured by closing tickets. The more time I spend helping her close tickets, the less tickets I close.

I was patient when this began a year and a half ago. 
Now, it's just too much. She has opted to not ask our designated trainer questions due to some work drama. She also won't ask questions in the group chat we have with our peers, because she doesn't want to look dumb. 

She's had a lot going on at home so I've been trying hard to be kind. I also consider her a friend which makes this more difficult. But at this point I think I'm enabling her and tanking myself professionally.

18t0snn,"""Seasoned Employee"" Career Change","  
Hello and first-time poster here.  Let me preface my post with the acknowledgement that I've been very fortunate and have had a very rewarding career.  I don't want to sound unappreciative or a ""whiner"" regarding any of this. But I am contemplating what the next phase of my work and/or life might look like, so looking for thoughts and input.  
  
I'm a ""seasoned employee"" and just turned the corner on 60. I spent the first 15 years of my career in IT. After my company was sold and going through a transition period, I did a bit of a career change into data and analytics, which is what I've been doing for the last 15 years (primarily in the insurance industry).    
  
I'm getting burned out and really wondering what might be next.  I'm cognizant that it's hard to do a job search at my age (let's face it, ageism does exist, whether it's immediately obvious or not) and frankly I just don't enjoy this type of work any longer.   
  
So, not having the money (nor desire...) to sit on the beach full time or golf 8 hours a day for the rest of my life, I'm contemplating what might be next.  I'm honestly just tired of sitting in front of a computer and I'm searching for something that might have more of an impact on others (and myself).  
  
In my younger days, I seriously contemplated a career in finance or insurance. But IT was ""the thing"" at the time (and a safe bet...) and so I decided to pursue that field for a living. I have an MBA and I recently obtained a P&C license for my state (not appointed anywhere) in an attempt to further my knowledge of the industry. I could likely get a sales job with an agency (or possibly even start my own agency) but that might take more energy and money than I currently have.  I was also considering something like a CFP or other finance related career, but not sure what that would take or if it's even viable at my age.    
  
So specifically:    
  
1)  What's ""too old"" to make a career change?  And what's the best way to do it?  
  
2)  Any suggestions, pros, cons, on trying to get out of technology and into a more client facing role?    
  
3)  Will the near term salary cut be a disaster?  or are there other roles that might provide better near-term salary prospects?  
  
Thank you and looking forward to your thoughts!

I’m anticipating a promotion at sometime around mid 2024 but my workload covers maybe 2-3 hours of work a day in the status quo and instead of jumping ship I’m interested in exploring one of 3 potential options:

1. Go OE. I know multiple people at my company were at one point OE (bc our CEO called them out and fired them - ouch) and the role definitey supports it and we could use the supp income but im intimidated about starting the process and finding something that doesn’t make me want to jump off the roof.

2. Find a relatively chill side gig doing online work of some sort that requires low investment in setup. 

3. Start a side business that can help me make residual income.

18szbig,(26) I'm a program director at a large non-profit and I hate it. Are all non-profits like this? What can I pivot to?,"I started at this non-profit as a summer camp counselor last year. About a year ago, the assistant director of that summer camp program became a director of a different program, and in the spring, took me on as her admin because of my work ethic. The program was very small, just three employees total, and in July, my director announced to us that she was leaving in September. Afterwards, she privately asked me if I wanted the position. I took about a week to think about it as my grandpa had passed away the week before and I wasn't really confident in myself, but she was confident in me and was willing to train me until she officially left. Plus, it would be a great learning experience, so I said yes. She recommended me to her supervisors, each of whom interviewed me and eventually gave me the promotion.

Unfortunately, it wasn't a smooth process as the third member of our team wanted the position too and started to talk badly about me, my supervisor, my supervisor's supervisors, and people in other departments to anyone who would listen ever since my supervisor announced she was leaving in July. The whole office environment shifted and no one felt comfortable with her there. She was eventually fired in October for falsely accusing others of child abuse among other things.

Meanwhile in September, with my supervisor gone I was basically doing her work without proper pay. I was only officially promoted in October, and since then I've had a lot of conversations with my previous supervisor and other managerial staff about what it's really like working here. There was the one-month delayed promotion to start. But even as a program director, I haven't had account permission to hire people since this month, and I still don't have permission to purchase items. At the end of every pay period, I've been modifying my budget by moving money from personnel to equipment and other supplies, and I honestly have no idea when I'll be able to actually buy equipment. Plus, it's been really frustrating being the only one in my department.

The job itself also involves oversight from four different organizations: the non-profit, the government office that provides the program's grant, the school the program is supporting, and a third-party evaluator. It's extremely frustrating trying to meet the demands of these four different organizations, especially when they directly contradict each other. I don't know if this is a normal thing working in educational organizations or non-profits, but I really hope it isn't.

I was much happier as an admin assistant when I had much better work/life balance and less stress. My only desire for money is to pay off living expenses and save for a simple future. I never wanted to become a director for the money or power and it was a great learning experience because I learned that I don't want to/can't handle it. I sincerely love the work I was able to do to support the school and the local community, like giving out free vaccines, clothes, and food, and managing after-school programming, but having four different departments/bosses and the lack of basic support from my non-profit to enable me to do my job is draining. My heart races every morning when I wake up and I dread working or becoming one of those people that put minimal effort into their jobs. I know I've genuinely helped people and would hate to give up on that.

Is it worth the time and effort to try and find a similar job at another non-profit? Or is it likely I'll have a similar experience? I enjoy the project management part and wouldn't mind trying to develop this into my career. On the other hand, since I'm still young I'm also considering exploring different fields and seeing what other careers might be a better personal fit for me. (I genuinely was happier being an admin, but I'm a little worried AI will make that job obsolete. I've also been spending a lot of time on 80000 Hours.)",HushMD,1,1.0,2,1703784385,2023-12-28 17:26:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18szbig/26_im_a_program_director_at_a_large_nonprofit_and/,12,2023
18sys6h,My coworkers say bad things about me because I’m too formal/strict? How can I change my behavior,"
Hello, I’m a civil engineer. I work in the engineering industry, the work relies heavily on teamwork. 

My problem is, I’m too formal. I’ll tell you about my behavior with my coworkers: 

1. I use “Dear (last name)” & sign it with “Sincerely” when sending emails to the same coworkers that I’ve been working with for years. And new coworkers too. 

2. I’m the “mysterious” guy at work. Literally nobody knows anything about me, except my name, office phone & email. However, my office secretary knows a little about me, like my hobbies, favorite TV shows…etc not everything of course, it is professional of course. 

3. When they try to get to know me, by inviting me to lunch…etc I always say no (in a nice way of course). 

4. If they want to discuss a project with me, even if I have free time, I always turn it into a formal meeting, I’d say something like: “I can’t discuss it now, we’ll need to schedule a meeting & a presentation through the email to discuss it” its just my personality, I like organizing stuff. 

My office secretary heard some office talk about me, my coworkers say bad things about me, so she told me those things. 

I was quite surprised, because when I’m assigned a group project with my coworkers, everything is professional (the communication, behavior…etc).

What can I do to change my behavior? I tried counseling sessions but it didn’t work out for me.",AlAnazi-,1,1.0,1,1703783049,2023-12-28 17:04:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18sys6h/my_coworkers_say_bad_things_about_me_because_im/,12,2023

My supervisors are constantly reminding me about the language and tone of writing that I should do. I do get them, I just don't know how to write because I am worried it will not satisfy them again. I only got hired almost two months ago, and it has really good pay, but at the same time it worries me that I am a pain in the ass to them. They are struggling with their workloads and here I am, could not even write properly.
I got reprimanded earlier thrice which is making me feel embarrassed. I mean their reprimands are constructive but I am so disappointed at myself for not being able to properly work because I lack words, and no matter how hard I try, I always end up failing them.
I could not also study writing again because I am writing in the work-shift and I feel like I do not have the time in the world.

18suotg,How do you weigh quality of life versus income?,"I currently am in a role that has been fully remote for 3 years however starting Jan 2024 we are transitioning to hybrid with 2-3 days a week in office. I love my job, I am well liked and respected with 100% job security and it is extremely flexible and laid back with unlimited PTO with no warning needed. I have a LOT of free time. However, the pay is pretty low, my paychecks are $2000 every two weeks. 

I have an opportunity to take a job in a fast paced organization that is profit motivated that would make my paychecks roughly $3200 every two weeks. However that comes with a minimum hour long commute each way and is in-office 5 days a week. It is going to be a much more cut throat environment with limited flexibility. Gas alone will shave $500 a month off the top bringing my expected net increase to likely $1800 a month. 

I do think exposure to this industry could potentially be beneficial in the long term. I also know that stress levels, time away from home and my family, expenses due to commuting, wardrobe, lunches etc will all go up.

Also, I often feel a bit embarrassed when people repeatedly try, yet struggle, to pronounce my name correctly. I appreciate their effort but don’t want to cause them too much trouble.

I’m contemplating whether I should use an easier, Christian name for professional purposes. This name is part of my identity too, but I haven’t used it publicly before.

18srdfz,(Medical Student/SWE) need some career guidance...,"I'm 22 ½ yo, 5th year medical student. forced to do medicine along some other things, I developed depression for some time and in my 1st 3 years i became a video games addict and studied like 2-3 days before exams pulling all-nighters. Developed a victim mentality and very bad habits. In the past year and a half, I have quit gaming, social media, all life-wasting habits, have a positive attitude during the day, and have been studying Frontend Development/CS mainly and still go to college for medical exams/required lectures.  
  
I still have 8 months to finish school, 2.5 years local residency. After that I can go abroad for a GP position but even for countries with less stipulations, it will require money of at least 1 year of work (which i can do during residency). My medical knowledge is pretty limited, I will have to study all-day for at least 2 years to pass any abroad countries required exams and possibly 6 months for the country's local language.      
  
P.S I wont get the BSc ""cartoon"" certificate until i finish residency, but can get a temp official paper that says I graduated, for reasons that has to do with obligatory military service, most likely I wont serve, but I have to finish those 8 months.  
  
For CS/Frontend, I will say I am 6 months away from being junior SWE ready (but the market is claimed to be bad, i know basics of react, nodejs, express, ts, tailwind, sql, very basic DSA but know html, css, js very well, made a full-stack app, early in development and some other basic projs, not resume worthy).   
  
I have applied for an online degree and got a full scholarship for a Bs in CS for first 1.5 years renewable, starting Feb. Going through the curriculum, I have dabbled in half the courses while studying on my own + there are 4 math courses that will be useful if I decided to do an MS/PhD down the line.   
  
TBH, I thought I would be job ready much earlier. That's why I chose frontend but right now i think it is not very economical/fiscal to not benefit from my medical degree. No jobs benefit from knowing both. But other CS fields do.  
  
What's your thoughts on my situation, should I play the long game and get into sth that combines both but will have to drop what i learned in web (idk what, have to do some search on that, welcome to any suggestions) or just focus on SWE and what i learned in web and find a job ASAP?   
  
P.S I have no debt, medical school was free, but I'm financially dependent on my parents/broke and kind of in need for money (health \\\[teeth issues\\\], laptop in future, marriage in future, along some other things that might come up).

My previous manager did not like me and the new one never bothered to form his own opinion. He asked me what my rating was last year which was the bare minimum to begin with and has kept me at the same rating this year despite me doing a lot of hardwork. 

He told me at one point how there were no bad comments in my review because I had only added people who would give a good review and not the rest who would write a bad one and went on to tell me how he had to think of opportunities and added them to the list. He had mentioned stuff along the lines of how my work products are sub-par and only as good as someone who has just joined the firm ( I have been here for over three years ) and how I am not helping or mentoring anyone. On countering all these points he narrowed everything down to a very specific scenario and kept on narrowing it down till I agreed. 

I had an amazing review from the external reviewers and my manager refused to accept that there was anything good in it and told me how the team that I work with is great and how my work was actually not up to the mark. This I feel is incorrect as he has never seen anything I have worked on.

18sr7c0,How to quit job without being financially blackmailed,"Like the title stated I want to quit my job, but fear my boss will come after me for financial retribution. 
Backstory is that I work as a RDA at a private practice general dentist office. I have worked there for almost a year, my current boss the dentist poached me from another office after 4 months of talking to me about getting my RDA, was only a DA at the time, he was my personal dentist before I got into the field so I thought it was an awesome opportunity to have a dentist I liked as a boss and he offered to help me pay for classes. He paid for a $400 class and I was extremely grateful and happy for the opportunity. Eventually he hired me and I was very excited my prior boss was not paying me my overtime nor even for my contract signed scrub pay which was only $40 but he refused. So I was relieved to have a new boss. (Yes I should have fought him, but my dad just died and I was not in the right mindset). So cue me starting my new job and being very taken aback that not only are the staff members rude to me right away but they all warn me that he makes everyone cry their first month at least and later he states this to me too. I’m a whole hearted team player and at this point just keep my head down and do my job, so I just try to have thick skin.  The other assistants are down right mean to me and one of the three hygienist tells me that my hair looks trashy and unprofessional so already regretting my decision but now I’m stuck because I don’t have a backup job. But the first month because the dentist is a control freak I am not allowed to assist at all, talk to patient or do anything other than observe, which I thought maybe was okay because I’m used to zero training and being thrown right in. Well in this month he offers to do Invisalign for me and says I need to practice scanning and get scanned so I know, he orders them and then says that $1,200 for lab fees is added to my account and my overtime can pay for it, at this point I already feel he is very hot and cold with everyone like an abusive bf who love bombs you and then is super mean. I immediately feel he did this right away neglecting to say he would charge me and implying it was free to trap me and I figured it out after the other assistant told me he paid $26k for her extended functions class but signed a contract that she couldn’t quite.so now I feel stuck, but I swallow this red flag because there are no other job opening and I owe money. After this the first time I assist him he literally rips instruments out of my hands smacking my hand in the process and yells at me over the patient. I get through the day after crying in the bathroom and the other assistants seem to almost revel that I’m getting yelled at. But I wait for everyone else to go home and I plainly tell him if he ever does that to me again, I will leave right then and he can mail my check. So he goes super apologetic and justifies that he is very stressed and is so sorry and he needs to work on his temper. This is when I know I am quitting, but I don’t have a backup. So I have him do all the paperwork to help me get my RDA and I start working on my resume. I get my RDA and still no openings other than peanuts jobs and elderly about to retire drs. So he doesn’t have an outburst that bad to date, but he is mean, rude, trash talks everyone and still will raise his voice in front of patients, fires numerous people out of the blue because he didn’t like them. My problem now for quitting if you have made it this far is that he made me order medical loupes, I had a sit down meeting and he said they were required for the job and I need them to stay working, I told him I cannot afford them and the best I can do is a $250 over glasses pair. He said he would pay for them and I can pay back over time, I again stated I cannot afford an 1/8th of my yearly salary for them and cannot and will not pay for them. To which he said he will pay for them, he just makes us pay so we are grateful for the things he does for us. He orders them over $3k and they are custom to only you. Now this is my fear, even if I leave them he is going to come after me for the money for “crossing” him by quitting, I haven’t even finished the Invisalign trays and my teeth are more crooked  looking now than before but at least I can have someone else remove the composite buttons off my teeth, I just have no money and don’t want him to issue a 1099c after me or have his lawyer come after me since he put the charges on my patient account I checked last week. I have an interview for a new job that pays over $6 more an hour and is 40 hours vs 32 with benefits. I make less than $1000 biweekly right now and can barely pay my bills, he promised me a raise but keeps postponing it. At this point love nor money would make me stay. This workplace is toxic and verbally abusive, I just want out. How do I quit without getting the full wrath of this crazy man?

18sqjfz,Torn between two career paths,"Hello! 

I am torn between two career paths: fotography-videography or web development and I would like some outside perspectives on this.

A little bit about me, before starting: 23, M, no kids, no mortgage, stable family income, finished bachelor's in Computer Science, currently in the first year of a master's degree in management. Working as a rpa developer (sufficient salary), continously applying for web development jobs. Passionate about business and travel.

On the photography-videography path: I have started the photography as a passion 5 years ago and since then I have upgraded my equipment and skills and turned the passion into a little business, but I feel like I didn't upscale it accordingly. Three-four years ago I have bought a sony A7 III (with which I can also do video, not only photos), lights, lav mic, gimbal, a lot of equipment with which I did filmed some pretty good interviews and other videos (by my eye). I have always reinvested 50% of all winnings back into equipment/resources and a little marketing campaign last year. 

I will have a pretty big gig next spring which will give me the money to buy a FPV drone, equipment that could extend my business on this side and I have always wanted to try flying FPV.

On the web development path: I have always been passionate about computers and technology, but only last year started to learn web development more seriously. 1 month ago I also enrolled in a frontend web development course (html, css, js, react, angular). I have applied to multiple jobs for the past year, but with no result until now. I have only gotten the rpa developer offer (current job), an offer  as a web developer from a start-up company which turned down because of the pay and I didn't see any potential of developing myself there.

I don't know which one to take or to pursue both for more time and see how things turn out. The thing is that I like them both and both have pluses and minuses. If I become a web developer I maybe can have more money and also have the freedom to work remote, which is a very big plus for me, the freedom of working from wherever I want. If I continue with the photo-video business it will be more dynamic and maybe if I turn it big enough I will have the same income as a web developer, but can not work remotely.

Question is: Should I pursue both careers, like I did until now, and see how things turn out or should I cut the loss and be 100% on only one and master it fully?",chocolatechec,1,1.0,0,1703758050,2023-12-28 10:07:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18sqjfz/torn_between_two_career_paths/,12,2023
18sqcwm,I'm stuck at my job with a shitty boss and contemplate between switching careers,"Hi everyone,

  
I have been working in marketing for around 3 years. I loved studying it and loved what I was doing. But...things aren't the same anymore.

  
Situation: I'm currently working around 2.5 years at my second job in a IT consultancy firm. I like the industry I'm in and the job in general. My boss on the other hand is something else. He is someone who doesn't have a marketing background and takes more than 90% of his decisions based on ""gut feeling"" which, needless to say, brings a lot of problems and frustrations. He also is very inconsistent in decision making; switching constantly between actions, taking decisions on the fly and reversing them 10x. 

  
Asside from that: I haven't got a lot of chances or help to develop myself as was promised. I barely got to learn or apply Google Analytics, advertising via social platforms/Google, customer journey building,...The things I did learn were having (too) much patience with him and HubSpot.

  
I asked for advice from both my friends and parents and got mixed feedback. My parents advice to still be patient and hope things improve. My friends suggested to look around or maybe switch careers. Reason for the latter is because I have been developing interest in data analysis. I don't know for sure if it's because of the current situation or because it's something new that just excistes me. The only issue I have with that is that I want to avoid switching to another field and finding out later on that it was for the wrong reasons and being stukc again.

18spzdg,Should I make this decision in my life?,"Hello, my name is Casey and I am thinking about making a huge career and life decision and I would like for y'all to let me know what you think. Okay, so first off i'm 21 years old and I am very interested in acting and I am wanting to move from Ohio to California. I found a place that is only 750 a month. It's just a room and bath, but in the beginning I'm willing to thug it out. I want to save $2000 dollars and move January 31. I also have a friend I met online and have known for 7 years only 11 minutes from the place, so I'm not alone. In total it will cost 1,626 to get there and get the deposit and first months rent, but I think 750 a month is very easy to pay and I wanna spend my off time taking acting classes in person and voice acting classes online. I am working everyday right now 8 hours a day to be able to afford the move. I am excited and scared, but I just love the art of acting and think that this will be a challenging job that pushes me out of my comfort zone and would be something I wanna do for the rest of my life. I also feel that there's no time like the present and that I only have one life. I wanna start becoming a better actor and person and work hard. I haven't told my Mother about it yet, I believe this will help me feel alive and happy because I'm working to better myself and life. I know it's not all gonna be easy, but I'm willing to stick with it. Please let me know what you think or if you have any questions.

18sow77,Should I take this offer or sit this one out?,"To start, my goal is to become a tech consultant, ideally within a tech company, though I'm open to other possibilities. Currently in my third year of engineering studies (non-CS) as an international student, I interned as an engineer (manufacturing type of role) at a manufacturing company.  
I've accepted an offer to return to the same manufacturing company for a Summer 2024 analyst internship. However, I've recently received another offer for Spring 2024 from a FAANG company, where I would work as a systems engineer (non-software, manufacturing). If I accept both offers simultaneously, I would graduate in December 2025 instead of May. Additionally, my most recent internship would be in Summer 2024, leaving the following summer empty due to my school's restrictions on the number of authorized internships for international students. So 1.5 year internship experience gap when I'm in my last semester in college.  
I'm grappling with the decision of whether to take the Spring 2024 offer. On one hand, the systems engineer role seems somewhat unrelated to my ultimate career goal of becoming a tech consultant since it's mostly based on manufacturing and a 1.5-year experience gap upon graduation (which I'm not sure how ATS/recruiters would perceive), on the other hand,  I would technically be gaining experience working at a very known technology company.  
I really need advice on whether to proceed with the Spring 2024 internship, despite the potential negatives. Or should I decline the offer, graduate in May 2025 on time (unless I explore other internships more closely aligned with technology). It's worth noting that I have a data analytics research project lined up for next semester, which I would forfeit if I accept the FAANG offer.",bologn3se,1,1.0,0,1703751409,2023-12-28 08:16:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18sow77/should_i_take_this_offer_or_sit_this_one_out/,12,2023
18sow6t,"Should I leave my current job, even though the company might not survive my departure?"," Hello,  
I would like to ask for advice on what to do both in terms of career but also in terms of decency in general, because I feel a bit guilty. I will add as many details as I can, so this might be a somewhat long read.  
I'm currently employed in a very small start-up company. In total there are 2 full time employees (essentially the owner - my boss, and me as the R&D engineer), with another part time scientist and a few sub-contractors (essentially freelancers).  
The idea for the technology originated in a research lab in university where I've been studying for the past 7 years. I got my B.Sc , M.Sc and Ph.D here. I have been working on that research for some time sporadically, as this wasn't my main focus. I mention this because I'm on good terms with the professor, which has a stake at this startup succeeding.  
Eventually a marketer came, created a company, took the patents for this technology and as I was finishing my studies I was employed as the R&D engineer, to bring this tech from the lab into a prototype. My old lab is still pretty much involved in this, and I'm still working in it, since we don't even have offices.  
The funding was minimal - this was known to me - therefore the pay was also somewhat reduced relative to market average. The proof of concept stage was supposed to take 6 months, and for 4 of these months it was agreed that I will get supplementary income from university. After 6 months, on the condition of successful POC, we would get a hefty fund and start building the company, my pay would increase etc.  
Well, the POC was a success, but the funding never increased and continued to trickle slowly and we have been surviving on scraps. It has been 15 months. I did get some bursts of interesting work here and there in the last 6 months, but that is usually curbed down by limited funding and then I'm again back to limited work and progress.  
I'm salaried, the work is 10 min by car from my home, I don't have specific work time, I can leave whenever I want. No oversight (Though usually I still work at home, so the work hours fluctuate - sometimes less than average, sometimes more).  
Overall, I would say I'm bored. I'm working alone. Even when I have work, lately its often not in my field and the gained knowledge from the research into that field doesn't really increase my useful experience  
I've been trying to find other options for the last 6 months or so. Didn't put too much effort into it, but did send my CV from time to time. Suddenly a company called me for an interview, and things are progressing somewhat quick. The offered salary range for this job is \~27% more monthly income before tax, and \~18% more after tax (+pension etc). The job is a bit farther, but not much - \~30-35 min by car.  
If I continue progressing through the interviews and do receive an offer, what should I do? The selfish thing is give the notice, work the last month and leave the company. This will be for my benefit in terms of career and salary. However, if I leave this startup, it's essentially done. It will take time for them to find a replacement, and I'm not sure they will be able to clear the next funding stage. So there's a huge change they are F'ed, and I feel a bit guilty about that.

18sn3io,Completeley lost on next steps for my career,"I Am a 21M. Finished My Finance Major from the most prestigious university in mi country (Argentina). I managed to achievied the highest historial GPD for the Finance Major sin it’s inception. 
For the last 1, I was convinced quantitave finance was my call. I had good coding habilitéis and like the math. For me, quant finance just made sense AND money. 
So, I applied to work in a startup led by a physist. I heated the job. I realized that despite having an above avg coding skill in python, I hate working in deployments, platforms, projects, that min of stuff. The firm was more spyware/AI focus and not so much on markets 
I quitted. A month later, I was contacted by a high net worth individual, in order to help him with his portfolio. This was great as I managed to make complete and profound research on potential emerging countries markets and companies.  However, it is more of a on-demand thing. 
I want to get my next job, but I’m not sure which path I should follow. I’v been praised by every superior and boss I have ever had, which makes me think I could get myself together at almost anything. 
Quant finance seems extremely demanding mentally,  and I’m not so sure about opportunities to make real money
More traditional research posts in financial services companies here in Argentina are too limited by fixed income  and FX operations. I son love it 
I’v thought about consulting. Not really fond off of the actual projection of variables for a single company, but could still do it.

18slj5e,Stick with Tech Consulting or quit to pursue an engineering degree?,"In my later college days I wanted a technical job which I could learn about outside of work so my upside isn’t so limited. It felt too late to change course, so I stuck with a B.S. in marketing. 

I worked my way up to a technical consulting role where I build/configure interfaces at a healthcare IT company. It pays reasonably and I somewhat enjoy it, however, there isn’t much work these days so I am hardly learning anything.

I can’t find many similar job opportunities on Indeed and worry my advancement is at the mercy of my current company. I’m trying to think 10+ year down the road.

Should I go back to school for an engineering degree? I see great opportunity in machine learning, cyber security, quantum computing, semiconductor manufacturing.

18slj40,"Getting a late start at 28, what should I do?","Long story short, messed around too much in my 20s and have found myself in a pretty bad spot at 28. I’d like to start angling towards a career that would have me heading towards being in a good financial position. My work experience overall is very patchy, so I know I’d need to start by just taking whatever job I can get. That being said, I’d like to be working towards a more long-term career option at the same time.  
  
I finished a degree in communications (Graduated end of 2019) and never really did anything with it. At this point I feel as though a 4-year gap between graduation and industry experience has pretty much rendered it worthless.  
  
I know trades are a decent option but I have a few longstanding injuries which I’d be cornered about getting worse doing physical labour full-time.  
  
I’m open to going back to uni, but am not overly keen on doing another 3-4 years studying and adding onto my existing HECS. That being said, I’m not shy about putting in the hours to learn a valuable skill. Parents are nice enough to let me move back and take some time to figure out so at-home study is something that I am happy to commit to.  
  
With all that on the table, I guess my biggest questions are:  
  
Is it worth risking an apprenticeship and aiming to move into an office role ASAP?  
  
Should I suck it up and go back to uni and just accept some more debt?  
  
Any chance of leveraging my degree, or have enough years passed since graduating to make it irrelevant?

18sl871,Miami or D.C. for early career?,"I’m a fresh college graduate at the age of 20 having a major dilemma. I’ve never even thought of leaving miami because my family and friends are all here and I just love it here. I don’t have much family so keep in mind why I value them so much. Anyway, I finally got a job that I have been interested in doing, but it requires relocating to D.C.. This role would overall benefit my long term career goals, but requires relocation to a city I’ve never been to. Also, I don’t have any actual funds to financially afford moving(meaning i’d probably have to take out a loan with high interest since I barely have credit) and the company only gives the bonus after the first paycheck. I luckily also have a job offer around 20 minutes away from my house, but I feel that I would have no personal growth because it’s a job that I did as an intern. The company is growing rapidly though so I would most likely get a promotion within a year or two according to the manager of HR. The miami job is on-site 9-6 and the D.C. one is 9-6 but 2-3 days on-site. My internships were remote so I very much value the hybrid part as well. Also, it will be more difficult to pivot into the career for D.C. if I do the Miami job, but it’ll be easy to pivot from D.C. to the Miami job.

I accelerated through college double majoring in both information systems and finance while doing internships just so I could set myself up properly for out of college. I worry about my career because it will take up most of my week so I feel that I would rather do something that I’m interested in. I just don’t know if I want to carry that financial stress if I literally have the choice of avoiding it.

In summary, if I choose the D.C. job, I’d see lots of personal growth, but also financial stress beginning my journey with major debt. If I choose the miami job, I wouldn’t be in a position I want at the beginning, but I would have my family and friends along with no financial stress. It’s pretty even so I’m having a hard time breaking the tie. If anyone can put their input, I would seriously appreciate it!",Agreeable-Latina,2,1.0,3,1703738451,2023-12-28 04:40:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18sl871/miami_or_dc_for_early_career/,12,2023
18skvuh,Is diesel tech my way out?,"I'm 27, tried office work, hated it. Couple of years construction/concrete work, got burnt out by bad companies and horrible hours with low pay. It's what I got an Associates degree in and there is nothing paying more than $16/hr where I live.

I honestly don't mind hard labor as long as I have enough time to rest so I've been looking into trades. Electrician is off the list since a lot of my family have done it(grandpa owned a business) and I see first hand how hard it actually is to get into IBEW and it's never constant work.

I think I'm pretty smart and like working with my hands so I thought about auto mechanic. Everywhere I read says diesel is where the pay is at and I don't really care what I work on as long as it pays. I won't get burnt out on it since I don't really mechanic as a hobby. I'm just worried about starting another trade only to waste time.

There is a few truck stops near me hiring with no experience and will pay for school and starter tools. I've thought about going to them or talking to a fleet shop. Am I too old? Is this going to truly kill my body or can a guy make it if he's careful? I'm trying to skip paying for school so is this the right way to start? Is there room to make good money? I'd eventually like to work for myself and I live in an area with major interstate traffic, my own business is an option way down the rode.

What coping mechanisms do you use?,"I’ve been in the field ten years and I just started a new position a few months ago hoping it would help me not be so miserable, it hasn’t. I’m so burnt out from doing marketing. I could literally give less of a shit because I hate every minute of every day. Even during vacation time I’m dreading the emails and questions coming into my inbox and having to plan out everything in advance. I don’t feel like I do anything for society but just make everyone else uncomfortable (can you take x photo, strong arm them into delivering media I can use, nag them to get back to me, etc) and manipulate people into doing what I want. I literally feel like a parasite. Most C-suites (whom I report to) don’t even care what I do for marketing either, they literally just have us in companies as a feel-good position they use to pat themselves on the back.

Obviously I’m starting to believe I’m in the complete wrong field, but in the mean time, I can’t quit for at least a year. We are planning to buy a home at the end of the year and my husband is finishing college and we need the money too much. There is nothing else in my area that pays this much for my skillset.

18skrnm,"[Rant]Introverted Manager, Social Team","I was an individual contributor and promoted about 2 years ago. At my previous role I was also a manager for 6 months to a year and so relieved when I went back to individual contributor at a new company. Somehow I was promoted and within these past 2 years my team has doubled in size. Due to layoffs/reorgs this year, I've lost my manager and now report into my skip level (who has a much much larger team).  
From the DiSK assessment, I'm a CS type and always enjoyed independent work. I enjoy putting together documentation, wading through details, and problem solving execution work. I'm friendly, but hardly initiate conversations and not chatty at all. I've always been shy/quiet. My team and I are fully remote, though we have the option to work in the office (handful of the team lives with 1 hour of the office).  
Through a series of missteps (giving advise that wasn't well received by other teams, unable to speak up for team in the moment, missing moments of publicly being the team cheerleader, providing unclear direction etc), I'm feeling bad about not being well liked or right for this role. I think I'm fair and nice, but for the reasons above (and probably others), I don't think I'm well received on the team. From my POV, these are all honest mistakes and do feel badly about causing stress on the team. To connect with the team personally, I try to ask ""how was your weekend"" type questions/ follow up on personal topics that direct reports have mentioned in our 1:1s and shouting out individuals in writing and in team TBs, but do struggle with more social aspects of being a manager. My team is smart / kind and wouldn't say ""I don't like you"" to my face, but I get this feeling from small things like sending out personal holiday cards/ gift cards & not getting responses. Other examples include lack of feedback when sending group messages, so I feel unheard. My manager is much more engaging and at least my team is happy with her leadership, but I feel stuck in the middle, being ineffective and an outcast.  
Part of me feels like I just need to do the hard thing and force group social chats or create social activities, but I'm scared of being vulnerable, feeling rejected and feeling silly for even trying when I feel like they don't like me. Generally, I've always felt like a weirdo who doesn't belong/ loner/black sheep, so it feels uncomfortable to be put in a situation where I'm expected to rally the team, which feels insurmountable when I feel so unliked and have a low self-esteem. I also don't feel like a true leader that can motivate or inspire those around me. I want to believe it's possible to grow in these areas, but after 2 years of struggling in this role, it's hard to picture.",CompanyDirect9026,1,1.0,3,1703736973,2023-12-28 04:16:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18skrnm/rantintroverted_manager_social_team/,12,2023
18skm54,Burnt out with new job,"I'm currently experiencing burnout at my first job in information technology and I could really use some advice. I've been in this role for about five months now, and when I first started, I was excited about the opportunity and thought it would be a great fit. The workplace is generally good, and everyone I work with is pretty chill. My manager is mostly great too.

However, I've been facing a steep learning curve in this role. I primarily work with proprietary equipment that my company manufactures, so I need to receive training for almost everything I work on. Unfortunately, being a small company, there aren't many resources available for me to figure things out on my own. Initially, I had a coworker who was supposed to train me, but he was recently promoted to a different role just before I joined. He admitted that he hasn't been able to provide the best training since he had to juggle his own responsibilities, be back up in my work load (We’re understaffed), and train me simultaneously. To make matters worse, he recently went on paternity leave for a month and a half, leaving me without any backup or support for products I haven't been trained on yet.

After coming back from the Christmas break, I received a message from my boss on Teams, asking me to complete a fairly unrealistic task by lunch. This situation made me realize that I'm already burnt out from this job, which is disheartening because I genuinely want this job to work out. It's my first IT job, and I was hoping to gain a significant amount of experience in this role.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to deal with burnout in a new job, especially in the IT field.  Any tips on managing the learning curve and workload in a small company with limited resources?",KaptainScooby,1,1.0,1,1703736481,2023-12-28 04:08:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18skm54/burnt_out_with_new_job/,12,2023
18skeyy,Would you take a 'temporary' position in hopes of moving into a supervisory role within a few months?,"Background: I currently work in a big university setting (medical field) for about 10 years. While the job has become fairly easy and pays very well, I feel like I've hit a dead end in my career and I am extremely bored and unmotivated. The only way to go up is into a managerial/supervisory role. There is zero chance of that happening where I currently work. 

I was told by a colleague of mine that his friend, who is a departmental director at another facility, is  looking for someone to fill the role of a supervisor. He rejected the offer because he is not planning on staying in the area for much longer and is looking for a position halfway across the state. When I expressed my interest, he gave me his friends' number. When I called the director, he told me that I would qualify for the position because of my previous experience but the job has not been posted as of yet.

A month later, the director calls me and asks if I would be interested in taking on a role as a senior (common rank for workers with over 5 years of experience) as they have an immediate need for that right now. I told him that my interest was in the supervisory role and that there was no point of me making a lateral move. He told that while he can't fully guarantee that I will 100% get the supervisory role when it opens, he suggests that I join and learn their ways before applying for the higher position. He says it would be much easier to transition and obtain that rank once I am already an employee of the hospital/department. 

He seems pretty eager to hire me but hasn't given me a salary range for the senior position or the supervisory position. I would wager that the 'senior' pays about 10%-15% less than what I am currently making at my current job. The commute is about the same as what I am currently doing. 

The question is would you take the risk and jump into a new 'temporary' position in hopes of transition into a supervisory role?

TL:DR would you take a pay cut for a quality of life increase?

&#x200B;

I, 32m, work as a chemist in a chemical laboratory. I live in the southern United States. This past year i made 180k. My Base Salary is about 135k and the rest was overtime. We also work shift work. With no   
 overtime it  comes out to about 14 shifts a month, 7 nights and 7 days, worked in increments throughout. The job can be pretty mundane but its solid work and most people retire from this position. I work for a fortune 500 company. Great company, great benefits, very solid. 

I have a Bachelors in Chem and currently getting an MBA from LSU. I want to go more into the Project Management/Quality/Operations Managment side of the business. 

I was offered a position as a specialist. My job would basically be the assistant operations manager for the lab. Id be able to get my hands on more of the business side of the work while also being a content expert in the actual lab side as well. It is also a Monday - Thursday day position. I have a wife and 2 toddlers and it would help a lot. However, it would be a ""pay cut"". I would keep my base pay (135K/yr) but would not work any overtime. I also have been able to get a lot of my MBA program done working nights/having 14 days off a month. However, It's no rush and I still will have my fridays off.

We live within our means and 135k/yr would be more than enough for us. I would def miss the 170-180k I've been getting these past years though. I feel as though this is perfect for me because its basically a step into the type of roles I want. Would you take it? Or would you stay doing shift work?

18sdmtv,Career pivot for a STEM PhD,"First post here, so please forgive me if I’m asking repetitive questions. 

I will receive my PhD in chemistry from an Ivy League university in 2025. Before that, I worked in a lab at a top school where I managed a lot of collaborations. I have several publications (not the best barometer for productivity, but in my field it’s what counts) with more on the way by the time I graduate. I entered the degree thinking I would transition into the pharma industry, but have since decided that I’d rather go down a career path more inclined towards biopharma or healthcare finance (I.e. equity research) or consulting. I live in an area with a lot of career options in both fields. (Providing school details just because I’m told that the big firms tend to place a premium on where your degrees are from.)

As I have no professional experience in finance or business aside from writing grants and managing collaborations, the best thing I could do to get my foot in the door is an internship, but my PhD program isn’t flexible with taking 10-12 weeks off to intern somewhere full time. Other steps I’ve taken to pivot careers include learning Python (ongoing), auditing finance classes at the business school, making many appointments at the career services office, and networking with alumni who made similar career changes. However, I don’t think those alone are enough to make me competitive. 

My understanding of these industries is that the recruiting cycle starts about a year out, so in late summer/fall 2024 for a 2025 grad. I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s made the pivot from STEM to business/finance or has any experience regarding what else I can/should do in the next 9-ish months to improve my odds of not getting my resume tossed in the bin. TIA!

I’m a 32 year old female Latina in Appalachia. I’m a first generation college student and work in tech as an AE. That said, my salary is fairly low (\~65k).  
I went back to school and am doing quite well, currently at a 4.0 gpa. I want to switch careers to challenge myself and know I have the drive to push with whatever I decide to do, but I also don’t want to choose a path where I’m too late on the running.  
I initially narrowed it down to a few career options and would like everyone’s thoughts here. I want a career where I can have prestige, money, and where I can be proud of myself for my accomplishments. Main concern here is practicality and whether any of the career choices are even suitable for someone making the change with my at my age. I also am not 100% on whether any of these career options (below) would be replaced by technology in the near future.  
Top choice- investment banking/finance- checks out all choices but hours are very long, it’s insanwly competitive and I may not check out as far as my age and such.  
Second choice- medicine. Something I find more interesting, but the timing and the amount of money it can cost(which I don’t have) are concerns. Paths I considered were oral surgery and / or psychiatry  
Other considerations : Accounting - extremely dull but could be an option that leads to a decent pay and also a good job with a big 4 Law- horrible start pay but could lead to some prestige and decent salary.  
Any and all thoughts are welcome, and so are other suggestions.

18sbenf,Can you offer advice to an M26 who feels like his world is crumbling?,"
Hello everyone, at this time I am 26 years old approaching 5 years since I’ve graduated with a B.S. in Management Information Systems. I am definitely on par if not slightly better than my peers but I would say I am above average regarding pay.

I am currently a product manager for a services company and I am new to the role with only a years of experience. Previously I was in consulting for white collar automation and I was looking to pivot. The two companies under my belt are not prestigious so they don’t offer major exit opportunity.

Looking around at the current market within technology and other industries such as retail it seems to be an up hill battle AND, I am not liking the role I am in as a product manager. I was not mentored at all by my previous boss and now I feel with the year one mark I didn’t grow into the role as much as my team members have said otherwise.

My question is this (it may be left field) at what point do you feel it isn’t worth pivoting to an entirely new industry? I am looking a peer of mine and he graduated in mechanical engineering and life hasn’t been perfect BUT definitely sounds like his slower growth has been much more steady. I’m considering going into the field as well but going back to school. Any advice would be appreciated. Am I too into my head (I do think a lot about the future), should I stay the course in product, should I just take it a day at a time?

**TLDR:** 

I just started at my current employer back in May, after wrapping up my BE/ME so it's my first full time. I've been trying to put in notice for about a week now but my manager, their manager, have been WFH, or not in office for several days at a time. I was hoping to tell one of them in person, however they won't be back until Jan 2nd at this point and my last day would have to be Jan 5th for a Jan 8th first day. At this point it's not even a two week notice so I already feel bad. My boss is quite mean, and so I'm glad it's only four days of walking on eggshells but I'm really excited about the next role and there is nothing they could say to keep me around.  


Any advice on how I should let them know? What to put in this email? Should I go tell HR? Another staff member? 

Any and all advice is appreciated!

**The drama:** 

I work for a small state agency, two-person team away from the rest of the staff. It's a very in demand field/degree. I'm overcompensated by a few grand but my boss makes me \*cry\* at work. I can't WFH, don't get super great benefits, they're just alright, I haven't learned any skills, I just do busy work and tasks specific to the agency. Boss is brilliantly smart, one of the smartest people I have ever met. They should not manage anyone and frankly don't have the bandwidth to manage someone right out of college who has questions. I get talked down to for asking and berated for trying to figure it out on my own. 

I know my industry is HIRING, so I looked, and I got what would have been my dream offer out of college. I am working local, it's rewarding, and it's a little under what now, but with much better benefits. Most importantly, there are more people to learn from, more people to teach me and guide me, and more opportunity in the short, medium, and long term.

While I was applying out, my boss found out I was. They cornered me in my office about it and said I should tell them if I was looking because they have a lot of work. I denied and said I was just following up on old interviews for the sake of networking. Settled it there. It was not my future employer, but another, that reached out to let her know in some capacity. 

Unknown to me, because they don't take me to meetings, the company I got the offer from? They do work for our agency, and a lot of it. Turns out they also don't like my manager (I've seen how they talks to others outside our agency and it's \*bad\*.) So, because of this I am terrified to tell them where I'm going and them trying to cause a problem. I also feel bad because right when my manager found out that I was applying they started treating me better, giving me more responsibility, but the ship had sailed the offer was signed. 

That said, when I interviewed, they made it clear there may be an issue hiring me, and proceeded to jump through lots of legal hoops to prove it was okay if the issue comes up. They also paid me over what they said the positions rate was, I have spoken at length with my future team lead, met team members, gone to the office. I feel really good about the effort they've put in for me and I'm just excited to be on a team and not report to someone who seems like they do not like me.

I can go on for days about some of the crazy and mean things my manager has said, but the highlight has to be, ""When you resubmit your application, include Advil for the headache I got reading it last time.""",Key-Bit3377,1,1.0,5,1703709520,2023-12-27 20:38:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18sajtw/advice_on_first_resignation/,12,2023

I really don’t know if it will be worth it to stick it out this long. I’ve been dealing with depression at work for awhile now.

I think about going back to 3rd shift and just do that for the next 20 years. At least I would get that 50 cent night premium again.

18s9f3m,Failed a Biology elective in 7th semester of engineering,"Long story short, I am currently pursuing my B.Tech at a private university in India. Until now, I have maintained a clean record with no backlogs, and my grades have been consistently good. However, an unexpected setback occurred in the current semester. Despite having a variety of elective options, ranging from physics to electrical courses, I opted for a biotechnology elective called Biomedical Instrumentation. Unfortunately, I ended up failing in that particular subject. Although I performed well in the end-semester exams, the damage had already been done due to a low score of 16 out of 60 in the internals. In an effort to salvage my situation, I approached my professor and pleaded with her to grant me some internal marks. I offered to complete extra assignments, quizzes, or even additional tests. At that point, I was willing to do anything to improve my standing. However, she proved to be quite stubborn. She holds a Ph.D. from an Australian university and recently joined our college, displaying a firm stance on assignments and tests. Instead of opting for a supplementary exam for the subject, I've decided to change my elective and take a new one. My advice to people reading this is never to take electives that aren't useful to you.

18s7m5d,How to structure a convo about a raise or realignment of responsibility?,"TLDR: Underpaid and looking for advice on how to best structure a conversation with my boss about it. (Sorry for the longer post; details were relevant to understand the full picture.)

I have 10+ years experience in my field + a well known certification that requires years of prooven experience to obtain. I was in inter-senior roles for the last couple of years but ended up laid off at no fault of my own. Job market in tech is rough right now so I had to take on a junior role & salary well below market average to hold me over. The company made it clear they didn’t need a senior role and were not willing to negotiate my salary for my experience. Fair enough. I came in with clear expectations that aligned with the junior title & salary. Within my first couple of weeks I felt something was odd because team members in more senior positions were asking me for advice and saying how much they were happy to have someone more experienced to help solve complex challenges they were facing. I was being treated as if I was senior, yet my title and salary were far from. Fast forward: Because of my resume and past experience, I have been specifically asked and expected to take on senior level responsibilities and leadership over the last 5 months. Instead of being a supporting/admin role to other senior team members, I am not only being asked to take on the same responsibilities as them on my own but I am also being consulted by all of them on best practices or how to strategize and solve challenges in their tasks because I have more experience. I was asked to take over leadership of a recent major situation on my own that was the most complicated on the team to manage and required extensive experience to handle. I am also the only one with a lot of experience in a particular thing that our team requires. 

The other kicker is that HR shared where they base our salaries from. Its publicly accessible and my salary for my current title is the lowest on the market scale (15k below the median), let alone if I had the proper title for what I am actually doing. I dug deeper and found the same stats on other reputable sources. Regardless, I’ve complied with all extra responsibility so far and have exceeded expectations, and I am constantly praised by my entire team and boss. I generally like my field and I am good at it, but at this point I know I am just allowing myself to be taken advantage of without a pretty significant raise OR a realignment of my responsibilities in my current role. I’d honestly be ok with either. 

Yes I am looking for a new job. Thats a given and the best solution here. However, the job market is rough in my field right now and it could take a long time to find something else due to layoffs everywhere, so I can’t just quit. I also do not want to continue without a fair attempt at initiating some change, because I am already starting to feel exhausted due to frustration of having to take on senior level responsibilities/leadership for low pay. My only way to navigate this for the time being is to have an upfront convo with my boss. 

My current plan for the convo after the new year is to:
- Review my initial list of responsibilities in my EE agreement and how they have evolved and shifted.
- Highlight very specific examples of senior level work I have been asked to do and how I excelled in and it how it has brought value in some way to the team. 
- Provide the salary stats from the source HR uses along with others to help support my case. 
- Ask for either the significant raise (we’re talking 30k just to get to market median average of what I am actually doing) to continue doing the senior level work OR a realignment of my responsibilities back to my EE agreement.
- I am 99.9% sure they won’t be able to meet the fair salary so if they can’t, it’s totally fair — but I am going to then request to my boss that they need to realign my responsibilities and expectations to that of my true title & current salary, which is a very junior role. It would mean a huge shift in the team’s expectations of me as well as they are not aware from Day 1. (Side note: I do fully agree that doing senior level work is what earns you a raise and promotion but in this situation, I have been for months already + my current salary is even below the junior average + they were fully aware of my experience and skills prior to being hired. It’s not a matter of proving myself; it’s a matter of them not wanting to pay for it.)

My only fear is they are going to come back with a salary of like 5k higher and try to negotiate and I can’t accept that in exchange for keeping up with the same expectations. I’ve never actually had to turn down a raise that was not up to par and I don’t know how to navigate that or what happens in that scenario. If anyone has any tips, suggestions or thoughts on how to structure my conversation I am all ears.

18s7akf,Stuck on a decision to move for a new job or not,"I (29) have a job offer in a new city be about 8 hours away from home. The job offer would be about a 40% salary increase in a cheaper COL city (City A). The job would be in my field and the team/role seem to match my experience well.

The challenge I'm facing is if it is worth moving from my current area. I've always seen myself setting in a different, larger city (City B) closer to home that has a lot of opportunities as well. I would not know anybody in City A. City B, and where I currently live now is in the Northeast so I can get to friends and family all through the northeast. I probably end up going home to see my family about once a month now, which would be much more difficult with the new job. I also am single currently, but have always seen myself settling in the Northeast. At 29 I feel like I am running out of time to do so, and even just moving for a year for a new job would be a stop gap.

So, my challenge is if a good opportunity is worth moving from where I want to be. I've been seriously job searching for about 2 months now and have had a good amount of feedback. I have a decent job now, I am just sick of it and ready for the next thing, but not a huge rush. I am thinking that there may be even more opportunity with the new year. I am also fortunate to be in a healthy financial spot so there isn't a ton of urgency there.

18s6vzj,Big career decision - any advice?,"At the moment I'm at a crossroads. I am a single person in my late 20s. On the one hand, I have an option to continue my private sector career paying $120k. On the other, I have the option to enter a career which deals with my dream subject matter in the public sector, though it pays significantly less at $76k.

A key relevant factor is I have a mortgage with repayments costing me $2,700 per month. I'm currently living in my property. Renting it out would mean that I would likely pay $2-3k per year out of pocket, though I haven't found a tenant yet. I would also pay strata out of pocket at $1800 per quarter. Currently, due to the mortgage pressure, I don't have a lot of savings.

The new job would require me to move cities and I would have to pay rent which appears to be quite high, or alternatively live in cheap sharehouse accommodation for a while. While work life balance would be much better, career progression would probably be slow, and I would be at $74-80k for at least a few years, whereas the private sector option offers substantially quicker career progression and financial benefits if I perform well.

My parents have offered to let me stay with them for a while to save money if I pick the private sector option, as they think it is the best one for my career and financial wellbeing. They fear I would not be able to meet my mortgage repayments if I chose the public service option.

I would not say I am a star performer in the private se job and the hours are long, but I do enjoy being paid and I am learning. I would like to find a partner and settle down hopefully with kids in the next few years so a solid income seems important. I suppose my regret is if I don't take the opportunity to enter what I thought about during college was my dream career.

18s6tw8,Should I leave my Masters course in construction and project management?,"Hey Reddit community,

I’m currently at a crossroads in my academic and professional journey, and I could use some advice. I am on the fringe of turning 25 and hold a first-class honors degree in Architectural Technology and Project Management from a UK university. I’m employed four days a week as an architectural technologist, and I’ve been pursuing a Master’s in Construction and Project Management part-time at a Russell group university, dedicating one day a week to my studies.

As of May I will have completed the first two years of the program, and now I’m faced with the decision of whether or not to complete the final year, which revolves around the dissertation. If I decide to leave the course at that point, I would be awarded a postgraduate diploma instead of a Master’s degree. If I leave now I will achieve a Postgraduate Certificate, I am also currently on a distinction/ first class grade.

The unique aspect here is that the Master’s program is covered through my work, making it essentially free for me (minus the days work) and the course would usually cost £7300. However, I’m contemplating whether it would be more beneficial for my career to leave the program now and focus on seeking a job in construction project management.

I’m torn between the potential benefits of completing the Master’s and the practical experience I could gain by diving into the field. Has anyone been in a similar situation, or does anyone have insights into the value of having a Master’s in construction project management versus gaining more hands-on experience?

18s66fb,Computer Science career,"Four years back, I got admitted into the Memorial University in Newfoundland, Canada. However, as soon as I got admitted, I went into a culture shock. Few months later Covid started and the rest of my journey hasn't been that good. I will be very honest about my academic journey here. I went through depression, did not want to complete studies and almost gave up at times. One of the Computer Science courses I have complete have grades below 60%. Most of them between 60-70%, and only a few of them have A. I have failed a few math courses, as well as one intro to logic for CS courses. I am finally graduating in April 2024. However, my cumulative average would be around 65% and CGPA around 2.6 out of 4. I have barely completed any projects, except a few group projects regarding software engineering and cybersecurity. I was wondering if I have barely any hope in getting a job in CS when I graduate in April, if it is still a good idea to try and finally start learning about game development. Or if I should focus on something else, specially due to the recent job crisis.

18s4mde,How to handle getting interrupted?,"I'm at a large corporation. There's this lady, ""Amy"" (late 50s F) that's been with the company for 30+ years. She hasn't moved up presumably by choice since her job is low stress with good benefits. This company values tenure, the lifers are looked at favorably. Amy is married to a guy who also has been at the company 30+ years. She's well-connected, knows *things* , does her job well, is a fountain of knowledge which she's happy to share and is respected because of all of the above. While Amy doesn't get invited to leadership meetings (that I do), at the smaller team meetings and moreso in social conversations she has the habit of talking over people and interrupting. She even does this to the manager that she reports to (age 42) who has been with the company for 10 years. No one stops her. I heard a different manager (age 48) with 5 years tenure, joke ""Oh I don't argue with Amy"". She interrupted me a few times which I allowed because everyone else seems to. I don't like this behavior. During a lunch I was mid sentence, I decided to finish my thought and maintained eyed contact with my colleagues while doing so, which she noticed and stopped talking over me. I got some *looks* from others including managers who were shocked I didn't back down. She hasn't interrupted me since.

On a later occasion during a lunch she caught herself interrupting someone and said ""oh I'll stop, I know I interrupt sometimes"" allowing the person to finish their thought. The comment however felt like a jab at me. Amy doesn't appear to like me and makes efforts to exclude me where she can. She does so diplomatically so it's not something I can complain about. I don't care that she doesn't like me, but was it a mistake to go against the grain? I find it disrespectful to be interrupted, how would this situation have best been handled? I'll undoubtedly run into other company lifers.

18s4aub,"CS Degree, currently am a software engineer but HATE sitting at a desk all day what should I do","I recently graduated college with a CS Degree. I originally thought this is what I'd want to do as I loved computers, tinkering with them, coding things, etc. Then I fell in love with cybersecurity concepts and hacking.

Well, near the end my junior year I started to think maybe I should have gone into an engineering degree so I could do more with my hands as I liked doing stuff more with my hands then sitting at a desk. I decided to tuff it out as maybe it wouldn't be that bad and maybe I could find a job with just my CS Degree where I don't have to sit at a desk for 8hrs+ a day. Sort of wish I had switched to computer and electrical engineering when I had the chance.

Anyways, I'm currently a software engineer, I have been so for 6 months. While I do enjoy the work I do and the people I work with (100% in office unfortunately) I HATE sitting at a desk all day. I also have a 40 minute commute, and honestly I just feel like all I do is sit at a desk/down for my entire waking hours and I hate it! I need to get active but I rarely have time to... I rarely have time to hang with people outside of work. With my commute, I'm technically working 7-5.

So anyways... I'm wondering if yall could help me figure something out.

18rzu01,How do I approach my first annual review & potential raise?,"24m I work at a local business in IT, I'm currently one of two tier 1 support people. I was hired on at the end of June to be an addition to the team, a 2nd tier 1 guy, but no long after I started the other original tier 1 guy (an older guy, not very tech savy, he was a major pain to everybody in regards to effort & knowledge) retired, so I was left as the sole tier 1 for a few months. We recently hired a new guy to take his spot just earlier this month.

I'd like to say that so far I've more than exceeded their expectations. Their original benchmarks/goals for me were met very early, ex do 30% of x tasks by my 90 days, I was nearing/exceeding 40% by 60 days. I like to think that there was minimal disruption when I was the sole tier 1 tech. I know for a fact that I was handling the sole tier 1 job much better than my predecessor. I could go on a little bit more on this topic, but I don't want to come across as tooting my own horn. I'm mentioning this for the sole purpose of providing the context that the helpdesk in general has been highly improved since I've came along.

Additionally, this business operates on their own paygrade scale. I'm currently a pay grade 3, and I make $25.80 an hour. I can't remember the exact range of this paygrade, but I believe it goes somewhere along the lines of $23 - $33, with the listed median at $28.35. This information is available on the intranet, so these are exact numbers (+/- 50 cents as I'm not actively looking at them while typing this)

I apologize for all of the context I'm sure some of that is unnecessary.

We all have our annual reviews coming up. I am extremely confident that a raise will be brought up, which leads me to my questions:

If a raise is not brought up, how do I go about bringing it up?

If a raise is brought up, how should I go about that conversation? What if it's brought up but in a way that makes it the amount seem non-negotiable?

Would asking for a (honestly slightly above) 10% raise to $28.50 be absurd? I feel like I've contributed a lot towards the team, the state of the help desk before & after me is very different. This has been directly communicated to me by damn near every single person on the team. While it's not ""important"" access, additional access has been given to me that the previous tier 1 did not have due to the gap in technical knowledge & trust. I know that 10% as a number seems like a lot, but 10% would take me from the the <25% of that paygrade to the middle. It's less than $5,000 a year. It's less than half of our last shipment of monitors. It's a couple hundred dollars a month.

I guess I should add to my last point that based on the bonus that everyone gets, this is more of a ""down"" year for the company. The bonus is looking to be about half of what everyone got last year (maybe slightly more than half, we'll see how Dec. goes). I'm just hopeful.",aosnfasgf345,1,1.0,0,1703680863,2023-12-27 12:41:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18rzu01/how_do_i_approach_my_first_annual_review/,12,2023

* Global markets are complex. For instance they will go up and down based on varying factors including price of commodities, global Oil, wars in Ghaza, Ukraine  
* Multinationals try to look for cues from global markets since their sales and operations grow or contract accordingly
* Multinationals are customers of global IT organizations including outsourcing to India 
* So, what does it all mean to you and me and our jobs?

   * You may have a good or obnoxious boss

My wish is to work in a lab, and I'm not quite sure if I will be able to do it with the environmental degree. It is possible, but rarely in my country ( im living in the Balkans ). I cannot find any interesting info on the internet regarding this career outside my country.

Does anyone know more about this career and how it is in your country?

18rxowg,LEAP OF FAITH?,"Growing up in New Delhi, India, as a teenager from a financially stable South-Indian family, the pressure to have life's path mapped out was a constant weight on my shoulders. Renowned for my knack in extracurriculars like singing, theatre, and dancing, I was the child others' parents admired, was always ""better"" (not to brag), be it in school etc. I was academically strong until the 10th grade, I opted for science in high school, believing I could effortlessly balance studies and my other passions like I did till 10th Grade. However, reality proved otherwise—I became an average student, struggling to juggle my studies with my varied interests. Consequently, I drifted away from academics, increasingly drawn into my extracurricular pursuits.

Fortune smiled upon me, granting opportunities to work in short films and web shows, primarily in the South Indian industry. It was during these shoots that I discovered my calling—acting. Even amidst the chaos of an imperfect shoot day, I found solace in the filmmaking process, embracing both its highs and lows.

Fast forward to the present—my parents are less than enthused about my aspiration to pursue acting or filmmaking. Graduating high school with an 82% mark, considered subpar in their eyes, I compensated by grinding hard for college entrance exams and getting admission in one of the prestigious colleges in Delhi University. Despite my passion for Mass Communication or a secondary interest in psychology (I have good communication skills), my parents steered me towards a Bachelor's in Science. Now in my third semester, I've come to the realization that this isn't the path I want to follow. Despite this, the university environment offers diverse exposure and interactions with individuals from varied backgrounds, providing invaluable learning experiences. Some even motivate me to pursue what I love, when I see them taking risks in their life to do what they love.

So, the conundrum stands—should I power through my undergraduate years or chart a different course? I won't dropout. But maybe in choosing my masters, I could make things right. The thought of pursuing my passion in acting seems daunting, lacking the courage needed for such a leap. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a masters degree that allows me to explore my interests while ensuring job prospects. Perhaps pursuing my master's in South India could increase opportunities in my chosen field. Deep down, I know, I have the ability to make it big, to take that leap of faith. I seek fresh perspectives and guidance as I navigate this pivotal crossroads.",Legitimate_Dish986,1,1.0,0,1703672771,2023-12-27 10:26:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18rxowg/leap_of_faith/,12,2023

I am currently an imaging assistant for a children’s hospital and am learning so much on the job. More specifically, I’m an assistant for the MRI modality while being in MRI school to become a tech. I love what I do, and I can’t wait to conduct scans when I’m a tech. While juggling both a job and school curriculum that revolves around MRI, I can’t help but wonder what it would be like to have another job that allows me to “have a break” from the MRI world. I’m trying to prevent myself from burning out, so I want to expose myself to something that isn’t medical or MRI-related. My current job has me lined up for an amazing opportunity to extern with them, which would set me up for success in the long run. I need advice.

18ruram,"Quit, use the energy to find something else?","Title. Basically my job is sucking the life out of me. It’s soul evaporating tedious work, and the hours are horrendous. Close, then open 7 hours later, back at 10am, okay now 8am, actually make it 12, back at 6am. It’s all over the place and it’s killing me. I’d kill for one 7 day stretch where I get to go to bed and wake up at the same time.

Anyway, the company also convinced me to take a demotion about a year ago with the idea being that the new role(and this schedule) would have overall more potential for growth as my previous department went into a full hiring freeze. Sadly that hasn’t been the case at all. 

Truth is, I’m 29, making 21 an hour. I get by, I save, and I do what I can to spend time with my wife and keep that relationship healthy. We have nice things and we’re stable. I should be happy, but I’m miserable. I’m also terrified for the future. I live in a very large city and things are getting more expensive by the day it seems. 

Im wondering if I should just quit now and spare myself the headache of holding out for any longer than I have while I look for other work, commit the rest and the extra energy towards finding something else while I float on savings for a month or so, maybe two. While my current job isn’t rocket science, im not unskilled. And I think with enough time I could get into the field I want to be in, it’s just shown to be really difficult after months of applying every day.

* There are too many opinions on ""Macro vs Micro Economy""
* Global markets are complex. For instance they will go up and down based on varying factors including price of commodities, global Oil, wars in Ghaza, Ukraine  
* Multinationals try to look for cues from global markets since their sales and operations grow or contract accordingly
* Multinationals are customers of global IT organizations including outsourcing to India 
* So, what does it all mean to you and me and our jobs?
   * Your first job will make or break you 
   * You may have a good or obnoxious boss

18rmqv4,English Teacher Interested in a Change,"(TLDR: main points are in bold)

**I am an English Instructor at a University in the USA. After 5 years at my present job (full-time,) I make 42k a year.** Like any job, it has pros and cons. **The pros include a very flexible schedule,** which I am eternally grateful for- I only physically go in to teach a few days a week. Outside of that I have a lot of work to do (tons of grading research papers as well as lesson prepping, e-mails, meetings, etc), but I am able to do most it on my own time, without needing to report to anyone. I work very independently and have a lot of control over when I do my work, and I love that. **However, teaching itself has become extremely stressful and exhausting,** and the time it takes to do it well often consumes my entire life, in exchange for pay that is simply not sustainable for me in the long term. Increasingly, we are also seeing a lot more behavioral problems in the classroom that I find to be quite alarming, including a whole new level of **disrespect from students that is beginning to take a physical toll on my health** to deal with this on a daily basis. Overall the job is not what I thought it would be. I was very passionate about teaching when I began, but like many others I have become burned out and disillusioned due to being overworked without being compensated in a way that feels fair. 

So, I am considering my options. **I am** **open to any ideas overall of what I could do with an English major and two MA degrees in writing, as well as teaching experience**. **I am willing to put in the time to develop skills or gain a certificate, but am not willing to go into student loan debt for another degree.** 

**One option I have been considering is getting a certificate in library sciences**\- I am pretty sure I can obtain an online certificate in this for free through my current job, and this could open up doors for me to work in either education or public libraries in a range of capacities. Doing this, I could likely make a little more money than I am now, and would not have the same levels of stress from students, although I am fairly unfamiliar with what the work would entail, what the job market is like etc, and I would need to do more research to better understand the details and if it might be worth it. 

**Another skill I could invest in that might help me professionally: I have always wanted to learn Spanish** (I took a few years in the past but am far from fluent), and I have heard that speaking both Spanish and English has the potential to open up job opportunities. One option could be teaching English in countries that predominantly speak Spanish, which I would be very interested in (I am open to teaching in other countries if the conditions are better there than where I currently am), but I'm sure there must be opportunities outside of education entirely that I may not even be aware of. 

**Teaching fully online** would honestly be a dream job for me, since it would keep the pros and radically reduce the cons of my current job. However, there do not seem to be many full-time fully online positions available (plenty of part-time opportunities but I definitely want full time and health benefits). 

Like I said, I am definitely open to other ideas outside of the ones I named as well; this is just what I have come up with so far as I am trying to gather my thoughts and to understand what the options might be. 

If anyone has any thoughts, advice, or experiences to share regarding any of this, I would sincerely love to hear it. 

I am willing to relocate, both within the USA as well as internationally.  I'm open to both remote / online or in-person work.

18rm6zq,Why do companies have such a shitty view on Bonuses?,"The real straw that broke my back was the end of the year bonus was brought up. The last 2 years we got a sizeable one and naturally guys had brought up the chance of us getting one. I pulled my supervisor to the side and asked if we were getting one and he had to ask the owner. Later he pulled me aside and explained that we as a company are down 8 percent this year and the bonus money just wasn't there. Which is fine, I get it and I think the majority of guys would understand that, but the conversation continued with first asking me who has been talking about it like its some witch hunt and then going on about if someone wants to know why, they can go talk to the owner about it and he'll explain but if they just want money, then he can't really help them. That gave me a sour taste in my mouth, like the workers are greedy for wanting a bonus?? As a company, this year we moved out of our old warehouse into a 6 plus million dollar new site on the other side of town. The whole month of October, the company worked every single day moving and was basically mandated to move 5 million in inventory and equipment and be up and running in a month. Knowing that, of course everyone knows what's coming next. "" Well that whole month of October there was a bunch of overtime that was made and that's expensive to pay that out and we also had to buy new forklifts and machinery as well and that was expensive too."" I just don't understand why companies think that overtime is such a perk that it would replace a bonus. It wasn't made mandatory only because it was made very clear that we had a month to move and if we didn't then it would be mandatory. When companies talk about buying equipment that helps your job as a plus for you, I can't drive a forklift to work or tell my bank that they bought new drills so I won't be able to afford my mortgage this month. 

&#x200B;

Sorry for the rant but just with the way the economy is on workers, its shitty to see that the same old word play is being used by people that make a million dollars a year and are worried about paying less than 2k bonuses to 30 people when they do and buy these things to help their bottom line and disguise it as helping you. Making you work a month straight and pay you overtime over 40 only because that its illegal if they didn't so they can move their company so they can make more money. I fully understand that as a business owner you have to do certain things and make certain decision to make sure you still have a business and you should be making money, you took the risk and are managing a bunch of jobs. Its more just the thinking and word play that they continue to use to make it seem like you are lucky that they pay you and that its not mutually beneficial.

18rm0xt,"Working 60 hours a week, making good money without a degree, is this worth it?","I have been in the auto sales industry for 8 years now. I’m 29 going on 30. My role is sales manager , I was a sales person for 6 years .

I hate the hours and always have. I’ve never really had a life. My schedule is this:
Monday:830-8 
Tuesday:10-8
Wednesday:off
Thursday:12-8
Friday:830-6
Saturday:830-6
Sunday “optional” :10-5
We get a Sunday “premium” if we work. Which is basically an extra percentage of pay. This kind of forces me to work Sundays 

The market is fluctuating. My pay this December has been awful due to it. However, I would say I average $130-150k a year. Which is good! But, I also live in New England and cost of living and taxes is high

I also got spoiled with making a lot of money at points. So I feel as if if I were to make less money at a new job, I would have a hard time adjusting and have to eat my pride.

The career is really demanding and can be toxic. We have very little time off. 2 weeks max vacation time , 1 week of sick time. That’s it.

We also don’t get our 401k matched.

I’d really like to have a healthy work life balance, but I have bills that need to be paid and I need money in order to cover bills and have fun. 

What should I do? Is there a better career out there that’s better on flexibility and good pay? Should I just take a pay cut and find a different job?

I’m writing here today because I’m feeling professionally lost. 

Here’s a bit of context :
I (M26) was born and raised in France. I am in my last year of Masters degree in apprenticeship in digital marketing. Once the degree done, I’ll have less than 2years work experiences in an office but have been working since I’m 16 and various different part time/extra work (cashier, waiter, salesman on the food market)

- 2x 6months in a startup company as a business developer / chief project officer in apprenticeship

I’d like to move in an English speaking country as I’m half French/british (2passports) and so I’m fluent in both language. 

Would you have any advice on a sector to work and where to start to get going?

18rkza0,How do I know if I'm heading in the right direction? Sometimes things workout great and I think I'm making progress but most days I just don't know,"I currently make $30 an hr. I work part-time for two companies. One I have more of an assistant type role. The other I do odds and ends video edits, website updates, partner outreach and soon I'll be working on a grant we got approved for. Both companies are non profits I have known both employers for years from another company I used to work for that unfortunately closed down as of last year. I should be getting more hours since both companies were approved for similar grants. I am treated very well I set my own schedule and pretty much do whatever I want as long as work is getting done. Both employers are wonderful people and have been mentoring me and know I eventually want to have my own business similar to theirs. 

I honestly don't know if I'm on the right path however because I'm at part-time hours. All of my friends make good money the least makes $52 hr and the most makes $99 an hr. They all have degrees and are very focused on what they specialize in. I only have a high school diploma. I don't specialize in anything but people usually bring me on because they like me or they know someone that knows me because I've done a bunch of random things in my career since I have only really ever worked for a startup. I've done projects management, program managing, operations, socal media, sales, event planning and coordination, and community engagement. 

From the two companies I work for I've made good connections. I have a really good network of friends and business professionals that I can tap into. I've been short on bills recently and my friends let me borrow money with the mindset that they know I'll pay them back eventually no time frame given. Sometimes I meet people and they connect me to more and more people higher up in the community I'm working in. I've been doing this for about 2-3 months. Mainly waiting for January to come so I can get more hours and start working on grant funded project. 

I'm also trying to start my own business that is focused on innovation through education for entrepreneurs. People are willing to help me with it and what not so I can get started. I'm not sure if I'm on the right path. I have a brother that is autistic that lives with me. I support us both. Currently I have no saves and bills are piling up I'm not super behind but it is getting nerve racking. 

Since the two companies I work for our so flexible I have time to also work on my business idea and get that moving forward. 

For career I've never had a focus. I don't even know what it would be since I've done so much random stuff. I don't know what the signs should be in regards to throwing in the towel and trying to get a career to focus on and how I would even do that. So how can I tell if I am on a fools errand?

18rjk3h,Change in Career Advice,"Backstory: worked for a company for 8 years and worked my way up to Director of Customer Service. There was a month long transitional/training period with the old director and myself. Two days after completion, the company cut my department in half without any head ups - said there were budget cuts and it had to happen. Taking on additional ""help desk"" wasn't an issue for me as they promised it was temporary. I held interviews and scouted for new help or outsourcing within the budget provided. However, it was never accepted or approved. After months of meetings and fighting over additional resources, over 70+ hours a week (literally working at 2-3am and then back in at 9am) I decided to leave.  My mental health had declined greatly and I didn't even recognize myself. 

Due to the market and needing to find myself again, I decided to take a position launching a new program for a company as an Account Executive Manager. I went through 5 interviews and I thought it was a great fit. I clicked with those I met and the board seemed genuine. They have great benefits, work/life balance, bonus structure, hybrid and director or senior manager to expand the team was possible within a year. 

Sadly, I did not get the director or senior manager in writing. 

Although my hours are great and I'm enjoying my hobbies again, I don't see any room for growth. My ideas to improve business ops (in order to successfully launch) and spearhead initiatives, despite my expertise, are not reciprocated and instead met with ""misguided"" and ""this isn't your old job""(even though I have never compare them to it). My improvement plans are standard processes and metrics with growth and marketing plans. 

Hybrid was removed from the entire company a month in as well. I'm also now being asked to take on building a new customer service department (since I have experience) without any additional compensation because I need to ""prove myself"". 

I want to leave and find a new job, however, I'm worried when I enter to job market, my director to account executive (I've only been with them 6 months) will look terrible and I won't be given a chance. However, I have a passion for advocating for others (customer, business - finding a middle ground based on information), which is why I excel in customer service, so I'm thinking of switching to HR or people ops. I have no degree either - just some collage and hard work.

18riv25,Cowboy lost in the city.,"I used to be a rancher out in Centerville, Texas -- born in Dallas but spent a long while out there ranching. I loved the cowboy lifestyle.

But eventually I came back to where I was born (Dallas) to pursue education at the request of my grandfather, the ranch owner.

He died and the ranch fell apart; no one knew how to run it from a financial standpoint.

My family has some benefits tied to having a career at the age of 37, and I am 30 now. But I can't seem to find what I want to do. I'm working in the food industry.

I am 2 courses away from an Associates in Science, but it doesn't seem to do much.

Much of my job opportunities are limited. I have been claimed ""physically unfit"" to handle my past 3 jobs because I have a hard time with air-borne chemicals. Would love to work some sort of construction that doesn't have them, like landscaping, but my biceps have been inflamed for 2 years now and show no sign of healing.

My mother offered to pay for me to take a philosophy course this upcoming semester as a gift. I am really good at philosophy; but with the intentions of getting married and having children later  down the road it just doesn't seem like a viable option.

I am not sure what to do. I am sitting on Indeed right now and feel stuck. No real skills outside of ranching (which didn't pay well as a simple ranchhand anyways) all alone in the middle of the city.

I get 2 weeks PTO, only  6 holidays a year, 401K 5% match and decent health care. The bare minimum. Like I said, I’m in the midst of planning and having my wedding and earning my bachelors. This job that I currently have allows UNLIMITED flexibility; I can show up and leave whenever, nobody necessarily cares since I work by myself. I can work from home when there’s inclement weather or if I’m feeling under the weather. I can wear whatever I want and listen to my music all day. BUT there is no growth. Absolutely no growth horizontally or vertically. I’m literally stuck here. Now if I was 60, that would be fine. But I’m 28, and I have a whole life to establish a decent high paying career, especially in accounting.

The current job is planning on paying for certifications for me in January/February. I’d like to quit before they spend more money on me, but the new job doesn’t start until mid January so I’d be going two weeks unemployed. The current job will have me leave on the spot to avoid further training which is understandable.

So I guess if I quit this week, I feel it’s the most considerate thing to do. But my family keeps saying to stay at the job until the new job starts. I have enough money for January bills but I’d probably be slumming it pretty severely for those two unemployed weeks.

Hi all, 

I am a full time software engineer in Canada, doing my bachelor’s degree in CS part-time. It will take me 2 more years to finish my degree (which I am funding myself). However, my company is having lay offs and I might lose my job in a few months.

18rfxoo,I'm pretty sure I've screwed up - IT stuff,"Here's a not-so-quick rundown of my history:

* Straight of high school I went into IT, building and repairing PC's
* Didn't end up going to college
* Moved on to phone support-type work
* Moved on to systems admin work. Mostly Windows products, some Linux.
* In 2018 I jumped on an opportunity to take a junior DevOps position at a startup. I enjoyed the work but had problems grasping writing code. The job lasted less than a year, so I didn't have enough experience to move on to another DevOps position.
* Fell back to a traditional sys admin job and stayed for a 2 year contract
* Currently two years into a new startup doing manual and automated QA. I'm doing ok with it but I don't care about the work but I'm making good money. It's not exciting and I feel mired in procedure.

Other info:

* Over the years I have had lead and managerial positions.
* I enjoy working with people.
* I enjoy educating people.

The problem is I don't feel like the product we're making at the startup will take off and I will need to find new work in the next six months. I feel like this QA position is going to fuck over my resume. I don't think I want to go down the QA path so the logical step is to go back to systems administration. But I've fallen behind on more modern sys admin tech (stagnated since 2018).

I started college and working full time at 16, but never got around to finishing my B.A. in Business Economics due to burnout and a rapidly deteriorating mental health. 

My major concern is the fear of falling behind without a bachelor’s degree. However, I'm hesitant due to the significant stress I experienced previously, and the prospect of taking on substantial student loans adds another layer of uncertainty. Furthermore, I feel as though my career is picking up a lot of momentum and I want to focus primarily on growth / real world experience.

I’m torn between these options: 

1. Delaying my degree until I feel fully prepared.

2. Easing into pursuing my degree by taking 1-2 classes at a time.

3. Not pursuing a degree at all. 

Is my current experience and head-start in the industry sufficient for now, or should I listen to my family and prioritize my degree while I’m still relatively young?

My IT career started back in 2020 as an Exchange Online support engineer at Microsoft where you could only take care of cases regarding that email technology or mixed cases as long as the issue is taking place in EXO/Outlook.

Now, since 2022, I´m a level 2 infrastructure engineer in another company. Managing servers of client´s organizations,  but in the team specialized in email servers (Exchange). WIth a bit of Sharepoint and Teams.

Currently, I´d like to move to another country in my EU zone, but all the positions are asking to be specialized for all kind of technologies: SQL, Azure, Intune, Switches, Routers, Linux... And even if i got the Azure Admin/Azure Security certifications, I can´t even get an interview for these kind of junior positions.

What path should I take in order to get a new IT job with new areas?

I did some math and came to the conclusion that if I put in 8 hours of overtime, every week, which is in abundant supply (the other shift always asks me to stay over, and I am on good terms with everyone), then I will not only make my supervisor's salary, but surpass it and land around 62-64k a year.

I am 24F, I feel like I’ve been bouncing back and forth on career ideas for awhile, but I can’t make my mind up. When I was 19 I went to trade school for welding, from there I got into the union and I am not a 4th year apprentice… catch is for the last 6 months I have moved from the field to the office as a “field engineer” but I am still not happy. I hated being in the field and I almost quit so many times, being in the office is a bit better but I feel stir crazy sitting around all day. I don’t get a lunch break, I eat and go right back to work. I feel like I am a glorified admin. My company I believe wants me to be a project manager eventually but that’s not a dream of mine at all… I don’t want to bring my home from me, nor do I want to answer to anyone on when equipment will be arriving. Sure I can do it, and I am lucky considering I have 0 college education but I want more of my life. I commute around 3 house a day for my job as well and I’m seriously over it. Some career options I have considered switching to for awhile now are law enforcement, paralegal (not so sure, I don’t want ti sit all day but I do believe paralegals have to run errands for their lawyers?) I have also considered a career in physical fitness…? Not sure what one but that division, I have always been into fitness, I go to the gym 5/7 days a week and I eat very clean. I am good at history & English. I am not good at science or math… to give some more info on who I am as an individual I am quiet, I enjoy working alone, but can work with others. I just end up doing most of the work, so I like to get the credit. I am well at communicating, I am a very hard worker, and honestly when I find passion I enjoy working. I am a go getter and I know whatever I want to do I will 100% be successful, that’s never been a problem for me. The only problem is knowing what I need to do.

18racx9,Potential career options for me?,"I have no idea in which direction my life should go.

I'm currently 21 years old and have no idea how to continue my path. I successfully completed my high school diploma at a business administration the year before last. Last year I also did my voluntary service (which is credited like a substitute for enlisting in the army since I did not want to do that) for nine months as a carer in a dormitory for disabled people and a three-month job as a temporary helper at food delivery. Both were pretty fun jobs.

I planned to study artificial intelligence at the university in my city because I have been interested in computers since I was a child and the industry offers extremely good career chances for the future. I started this course in October, but I underestimated the demands of the mathematical subjects extremely and therefore failed the first exam. I've barely passed the recovery exam, but I'm already toying with the idea of ​​dropping out of this course after the first semester, because the math is quite overwhelming for me. 

Now, of course, I've thought about what to do next. I still live with my parents and am therefore financially dependent on them. But I would like to move out as soon as possible and stand on my own two feet, but I don't know what is right for me. I would really like to become a journalist in the gaming sector, but that's a job that almost everyone wants and if I'm already overthinking it before I even tried it, it is hard to think that dream could come true. 

It wouldn't even matter to me how much I love the job, as long as I earn enough money to live independently and not getting home sick and tired from work every day. 

What I definitely don't want is physically strenuous work or work in retail. I've also thought about a gap year and know that you need a plan for it, but would that really be of any use in my situation? I could imagine myself then acquiring journalistic texts and learning about them, possibly opening my own blog and perhaps even starting to freelance... but I also could go into sales since I have heard a lot of good things about it and graduated from a business administration… I could also look at other courses to enroll in the university but I have no idea which…

I hope this text summarizes my hesitations and thoughts about the future and appreciate everyone that took their time to read my concerns. I would be very happy for any comments, food for thought, suggestions and any other opinions!

I filled out the questions, emailed them back and sent an updated resume as well. I got a response back about 5 days later saying that the team decided to offer me a position as a junior software developer there. I never spoke to anyone the entire time and never had any tech interview of any sort. I feel like this may be a scam, but I can also see that the company has a website and has reviews on Glassdoor.

However, sometimes when I tell them about something I am doing or has happened, and how I solved it, they tell me ""why didn't you tell me about this?""... And usually is because I didn't see the necessity to tell them as I could solve it, or I didn't think it was really important... and sometimes that put me in problems with them.

26 y/o making 80k with a degree in Biochemistry, currently working in biotechnology wants to make more money. Seeking to leverage people skills and open to grad school or pivoting away from science. Ultimately seeking jobs that pay >150k after 3 years of experience.   
  
Hello,  
  
I am a 26 y/o living in the Bay Area of CA in the USA. My background includes a BS in Biochemistry (3.8 GPA) in 2019, a few years of healthcare work (Front Desk to Medical Assisting), and currently spent the last couple years in biotechnology (Synthetic Bio). Currently I work in roles that lead to Bioprocess Engineering/Process Development positions. My salary projection is about 80-85K for 2024. I am pretty good with people, and I have solid leadership skills. I know that scientists and engineers tend to lack the desire to be in positions where they have to leverage people skills, so I expect my trajectory to go towards those positions (Program/Product/Project Management). I enjoy working on different projects with different people and feeling intellectually stimulated. Here is my dilemma - I want to make a lot more money. My reasons have to do with supporting my parents, and I have some ballpark figures I would really like to hit >150k within 3 years. I am willing to pursue graduate school, and to pivot away from my current role - I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions or ideas for types of work I could look into?   
  
I'm aware of moving towards tech, but I worry there is an oversaturation for post-bootcamp software engineers. I don't know too much about sales, but I have heard very little good things about it. I don't mind doing side-hustle type stuff either, learning more about day trading or anything like that.

18r0pnr,What should I do when I’m pushed to change job scopes that no one wants to take up and has significant impact on my career?,"I’m working a corporate 9-5 in MNC.
I’m accounting graduate and joined the company 8 years ago to do accounting.

This year, I’m pushed to give up 70% of my original accounting scopes and replaced with digital transformation projects to help digitalizing the entire department processes.

My boss told me that these projects are important and I’m doing a great job recently.  This really got me negatively.  I was actually quite depressed to be pushed to take up this when he told me during beginning of the year.
The great challenge to me is the projects require many members to work together and it is always ended up being my top priority and everyone else’s least priority.  Furthermore, no one wants to be involved and always tried their best to dodge when asked to help.  Deep down I know all of us here are working for accounting, finance, tax career, who the hell seriously want to risk that career and got into an ‘IT’ role (though not much programming involved).

I tried to talk to my boss a few times about my career concerns and he often dismissed it by hinting me I’ll get a promotion next year.

I feel like it’s a death sentence to my accounting career if this goes down the road.  I asked about the career prospects after the projects and he couldn’t even tell me.  Recently he also purposely excluded me from involving the department’s accounting operation plans which I used to be involved in.  I felt like I no longer involve in core accounting functions and I’m not a IT professional who can transfer to IT department after.

18qzsok,Negotiating a “stay” contract?,"Honestly I’m not even sure if this is a thing but basically here’s the short of it:




I am a senior administrative worker at my company that I’ve been with nearly 5 years, and an EA on my team has put in their notice and will wrap up mid-January.



I have a sneaking suspicion that I may be promoted to backfill their role, and they currently support an executive who plans to retire in the next year or so.



The promotion would come with a raise, but I know this exec is bummed about not being able to finish things out with their assistant. To be completely honest, things haven’t been great at the company in the past year or so, and I’ve been putting my own feelers out there. However, the benefits are pretty decent and I am able to work remotely full time. 



I’m wondering if I accept the role, could I also negotiate a “sign on bonus” and offer to sign something official that I’ll stay with the company until the exec retires, or if this would be in poor taste? 



Honestly I would take the promotion for the title alone, but with how things have been going, it has started to feel like a good time to move on. This executive is also the only remaining company founder and he could possibly help unlock more career prospects for me, but at the end of the day I’d like to do what’s best for me and my career, and to be honest the best incentive for me to stay would be more money.

18qzbky,Army Reservist- Lost in life I don’t what to do any advice would help pls,"
Good evening, y’all everyone I don’t want to take up much of your time but pls advice would be appreciated it pls. I’m a 28 year old army reservist that came from AIT, training in my MOS (job), when I came home I tried to take difficult classes to try to get into the Army PA program or PA school only to be rejected by multiple schools. Then I tried applying to nursing school as well to be rejected by my top 5 nursing schools. I don’t know what to do right now, I feel so lost with life. 

I am thinking of applying for warrant officer with the Army and try to become a pilot. But I failed the HT/WT portion of the Army standards by 2%, & I can’t apply to any Army schools or programs because of my weight and body fat. 

What should I do should I go Active Duty Army and forget about Nursing after working on my prequisites for more than 4 years ? I don’t want to lose all the money I have saved up. I have only 20k and I don’t want to lose it. But I’m lost right now with life. 

My questions with you guys is this 
Should I go Active Duty army and change my job from medic to military intelligence (interpreter)? 

Stay a reservist and try again to get into nursing school with a chance I can hopefully get into nursing school? 

Try to apply to a job  police department or fire department even though I was rejected by 7 departments? 

Try to apply to warrant officer and go for Aviation school? 

Switch branches from Army and go Airforce? 

Would I be able to use my 20k and buy a quadiplex and hopefully make income ?

I’m so lost because I don’t know which path to take and my father is so hard on me. I don’t want to do Better in life but I don’t know what to do exactly 

The ultimate goal is to eventually become an officer in the military and retire as a General. I know it’s a long way to go and I’m going to keep fighting as this is something I want and I will keep going. I’m just lost at the moment.

The biggest thing what should be my first step ? for the 2024 pls I feel as lost pls",ruffruffman1,1,1.0,2,1703563752,2023-12-26 04:09:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18qzbky/army_reservist_lost_in_life_i_dont_what_to_do_any/,12,2023
18qyqht,Career suicide to go back to IC at pre-seed startup?,"Hey all, I'm currently a younger Engineering Manager at a large startup. I got to my position through a couple of wild factors, luck being a big one, but generally have been an extremely high performer at every role since I went full time at 18.

I recently interviewed with and got an offer as the first hire for a media and publishing startup. I'd be coming in as a Founding Engineer, basically going back to an IC role. However, I'd be working with the Head of Eng as well as a couple to be hired positions. They are closing their seed next month which would at least double my RSU's value, and they are matching the comp I have at my current role. Lastly, the founder is an A-list celebrity, so it should be very easy for the company to get funding and their feet in the door. Overall, I'm incredibly bought into the vision.

The new role genuinely excited me, as I'll get back into the grind of building from 0-1. However, is it career suicide to go back to being an IC, and at a small company at that? Being an EM at my age is largely unheard of, and if I stay, I sense a promo coming as well as me generally being on the fast track, and having great relationships with the VPoE/CTO. Lastly, I bet its easier to hop to a bigger company already being an EM, rather than flip flopping back and forth to/from. I don't really enjoy my job, there's an incredible amount of bureaucracy and incompetent people I have to deal with every day, and I'm basically in meetings from 9-5. Yes its what I signed up for as an EM, but it feels overkill.

tl;dr - Is it career suicide to leave my somewhat cushy EM job to be a first hire IC? The pay is the same, I get 0.5% RSU at new place, and work with cool people, but not sure if I'll ever land a leadership role again, especially as I don't want to be an IC forever.",spare-82,1,1.0,1,1703561846,2023-12-26 03:37:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18qyqht/career_suicide_to_go_back_to_ic_at_preseed_startup/,12,2023

18qy3op,How to stay organized at work ?,"Merry Christmas Everyone,

I'm in a bit of a bind at work and could really use some advice. I work in an environment where the workload is intense and tasks keep piling up at a rapid pace. The main issue I'm facing is keeping track of everything I need to do. It's gotten to the point where I often forget many of my pending tasks.

&#x200B;

I've tried using sticky notes to jot down my tasks and cross them off as I complete them. However, my role requires me to move around the office a lot, making it easy to lose these notes. Plus, it's not the most efficient way to stay organized, and my colleagues often have to follow up with me for updates on various tasks. 

This disorganization, combined with the stress of work, is really taking a toll on me.I'm looking for a solution, perhaps an app or a system, that can help me keep my tasks organized and allow me to prioritize them as needed. Something that's user-friendly and adaptable to a fast-paced work environment would be ideal.

Have any of you faced similar challenges? What tools or methods have you found effective in managing your tasks and staying organized, especially in high-pressure jobs? Any suggestions or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Technologies at my disposal:

1. Phone
2. Apple watch

We were in the same club, I had the same opportunity as her from a scholarship and choose not to go, after she took the scholarship for a women's conference where you can get internships, her success began from it and she began to have opportunities from even NASA and went twice, the next one was a big company (Apple) and then she got a full time job with Google. As of right now I feel that she is better than me. I did nothing with my bachelor's. Even If I choose to go to the scholarship I couldn't because I wasn't qualified (I was In a student visa while she was US resident). I got my green card until the last year of my graduation as industrial (which I couldnt do internships anymore) and I have been wasting my time thinking of maybe going back so maybe I hopefully one day can get a job in Google as she did. I feel awful and so sad. I couldn't let this out of my head. She is doing very great and traveling around the world while I am doing nothing with my life.

18qxgwa,Quitting College B-Ball Coaching for..?,"I (f28) have been coaching women’s college basketball for 5 years now. I have worked my way up from NCCAA to NCAA D2. The coaching career is inconsistent, unpredictable, and A LOT of work for little pay. For a while, I prioritized work and education and lived for the grind and the never ending rat race. However, within the past year, I feel as though my values have shifted and I want to actually live a normal life and possibly have a family. But I am not sure what route to take now. I would like something 9-5p, remote, and have my weekends off. 

I have my Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology and my Master’s Degree in Business Management. I have no debt. I am rewriting my resume to make it seem more businesslike rather than sport oriented. In coaching, I did a lot of scheduling, budgeting, excel work, organization, fundraising, running big events, worked with ALL types of people, conflict-resolution, and other types of admin work. 

For the business people, would my resume seem appealing to you? Do I have a chance to “start over” with something new? Is networking key for me right now?

I would love to hear any and all input concerning what I should look for or what to include in a resume.

18qmk80,Am I making a mistake by considering to change my career?,"Hey, I'm a 24 year old from a backwater state in India. I've completed my Masters in Mathematics Major this year in June. And now I'm preparing for CSIR NET exam (for PhD and Lectureship).

My problem is that I've always wanted to go for Computer Engineering since 5 years back before I took up Mathematics. But my super strict parents (and relatives) forced me to take up Math instead. I was okay with it because I thought I'd use math in computers anyway. But now I'm being forced by my parents to either go for PhD/Lectureship or Civil Service. I don't hate math but I really don't have a passion in teaching mathematics or solving random math problems without a goal. I want to be a software developer instead.

I found out that a local university offers B.Tech in CSE for only about $180 per semester. So I thought, maybe I could tutor kids and do it. But what I'm worried about is that, by the time I finish the study, I'd already be 29 or 30 years old. Here at home, the only thing I'm allowed to do is to study. I can't tutor kids and earn money, leave home without permission, can't draw (I love art) or game or watch movies, etc. So I'll have to make a big leap of faith by disobeying all written rules - start searching for kids to tutor, move around town by myself, start handling money with my own hands, etc.

Am I making a mistake? They have invested a lot of money into my education - even hiring a private tutor (one-on-one) for my entire Bachelors and Masters degree, and now for the CSIR NET exam too. I know none of my friends have received such great support.

I've been trying to convince them for 5 years now. But they seem to be oddly set on having me become a lecturer in Mathematics, which isn't a bad job when it comes to salary. So I'm afraid I'm leaving such a secure position and thinking of something else. Jobs are scarce where I live in. And I'm scared of travel.

Can I be sure I'd get a job as a software developer?",Pale_Sand8406,3,0.8100000023841858,3,1703524155,2023-12-25 17:09:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18qmk80/am_i_making_a_mistake_by_considering_to_change_my/,12,2023

Quick profile: I’m a final year Portuguese undergraduate student in a Portuguese double bachelor’s program in law and business management. I’ve had some finance courses but, in my opinion, not nearly enough to break it into the IB/PE scene without first having a good master’s education from a top European business school. I am yet to have any internship experience in a relevant sector (only did a corporate tax internship at a Big 4 in Portugal). I am inclined to return to Portugal for work after the master’s, mainly for personal reasons but also because I have a bigger chance of landing a good position (especially in PE) that gives me decent responsibilities from an early stage.

My perspective is that LBS is more pratical and getting-the-job inclined, while Bocconi is more academically rigorous and demanding. I do feel the need to have a very strong education in financial topics, and I do not completely push away the possibility of doing a phd in the future (although it’s not a main goal), which is something that makes me lean to Bocconi, but I also feel that the extra year at Bocconi might be 1 year of work experience that I lose.

I would appreciate any help regarding this subject, thank you!",Ok_Elephant_3652,1,1.0,2,1703503566,2023-12-25 11:26:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18qgx56/lbs_mfa_vs_bocconi_master_in_finance/,12,2023
18qge45,"Is it possible to pursue a career in Machine Learning, AI and/or Data Science this late ?","Greetings, I am a 27 year old male, currently working as a software engineer at a startup company. I have two engineering degrees in two different fields : 1) ""Industrial and automatic computer science"" and in 2) ""Electronics and digital technologies"" with a specialization in Real-time and embedded systems.  
In my current job, I develop embedded software for different kinds of systems and sometimes work on user interfaces. I have been at this job for two years now and I have not been happy with it lately. I find myself bored, not interested and not enjoying working on some of the projects and to be completely honest, I don't feel like I'm fully competent in this field.  
Also I'm not very passionate about embedded systems and this kind of software development therefore I would like to change to the field of AI. I have worked on a Data science - Machine Learning project in the past and I found it very interesting and very appealing to me.  
I would like to work in this growing exciting field in the future but I don't know where and how to start.  
Is it possible to shift at this point or is too late for me ? If it's possible then what are my options ? Is considering a master's degree in AI a good idea ? Or is a phd a better choice ? Has anyone been in this situation before ?

I told her this and she kept insisting I needed to make the change. I called HR again, and frustrated reiterated I could not. I then reached out to our Director asking the change be made. She circled back in a meeting with me and my boss and asked me to call HR after telling them multiple times I could not make the change. In the meeting with IT, my Director talked about how this shouldn't be something my manager needs to do, when this is a basic job description. They complained the whole time about how difficult it is with the new system.

I made it abundantly clear as multiple HR people said I couldn't make the change and it was my manager's job for a reason. Even after this, my boss and Director kept insisting it was my change or not my manager's job.

18qbukf,Retail Management,"Hey,

I've been a retail manager for over a year now. I'm 26 years old. I'm focused on the job most days, and I usually don't deviate from my responsibilities, but sometimes, we get very talkative in the back room and on our sales floor. Our reviews haven't tanked, and we are still a solid workplace.

 My issue is that there is this 21-year-old worker who has given me mixed signals. We tease each other inappropriately sometimes, and we get into extensive heated discussions at times. I don't mean to engage, but sometimes I can't help but give my opinion. The job involves much talking but is not constantly filled with tasks. The downtime can be dull, and we fill it with conversation often. 

She touches me sometimes, too, often without my consent. I'll admit I once put my hand on her shoulder, but it didn't mean anything, and I did it to reassure her at the cash wrap. Since then, it's been nothing but intrusive thoughts and touching on her part. I matched her energy, and then, one day, my energy shifted. 

I couldn't take the pressure of potentially being in an inappropriate relationship with this person or being seen as having done anything wrong. So, I decided to move her off the days I work, and I informed her each time. This wasn't just because I didn't want to be put in compromised situations, but because I realized her availability was open on other days and she could keep her hours. 

Should I stay the course? I think the energy between us has changed. She seems bitter, and neither of us responds well to the teasing. She got visibly mad at me for no apparent reason one time at the front. I can't take this anymore, and I give her “passes.” I wouldn't call them passes, though, because I train and give advice to everyone in a fair way. She's just making it about herself. I'm trying to increase efficiency and ensure we are all on task. 

It's not easy, and our policies suck on workplace harassment and fraternization policies.",Pale-Strawberry-180,1,1.0,0,1703480684,2023-12-25 05:04:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18qbukf/retail_management/,12,2023

On Friday, our President called me and told me that he will be letting my boss go in a few weeks and he is only telling me because it will impact me the most and he will need me to help minimize fallout with our team and with our clients.  It is uncommon and a big deal for someone at his level to be fired.

They are not replacing him and it sounds like the plan will be for me to train up to his position over the next year or so.  Although it is daunting, I am up for the challenge.  I am still transitioning into my new role and now it seems that it is going to grow significantly to fill my boss’s role as well.  What questions should I be asking when the President is in town in a few weeks to make this change?  

My main concern is that I am already spread too thin and now will be taking on more responsibility and under even more scrutiny as my office’s performance will be a direct reflection of how well I am growing into this role.

A little more background - I was very dissatisfied with my recent raise. Although it was a somewhat significant promotion, the raise was minimal due to “current economic conditions.”  It did not get me to the range that I understand to be average for similar roles in my field.

18qa903,How do I let my old employer that I would like to return?,"I left my role in June (6 months ago) after 3 years at the company. I was appreciated as a hard worker, reliable, and knew the job well. I wanted to get a different job title to reflect the duties I was taking on but the company dragged their feet on it, so I eventually accepted a higher job title at another company. I quit that job in September after 3 months as it was toxic and they misrepresented the role immensely. I regret leaving my old job as the new job was not represented properly. 

Since then I have been working part time but have been unsuccessful in landing full time work. I am in touch with a direct coworker who mentioned that they may be looking to hire for my old job again. I was never technically replaced, they gave a part time person full time and hired a part time student. Then a past coworker was fired for poor work. I have emailed my supervisor to grab coffee but time got to us and it didn't happen. I then reached out a few days ago about doing a freelance project for the company which won't be happening, but I emailed before I was told a position may be opening up. 

I tried out a new job and it didn't work. At this point, I rather go back to what I know. My main reason for leaving was I was working as a specialist but was called an assistant. My coworker stated that they restructured things after I left, so it sounds like even though the opening is for an assistant, that I would have better luck only doing the work of an assistant. Though I am hesistant on how to say I would come back, since i stated in my exit interview why I left.

Is there a way that I can say over email that I would be interested in returning if a job came available? Should I push to grab coffee? Any advice for how to approach this?

18q6xqm,Is it a good idea to try to break into music as an 18M college student?,"Hey y’all, this is mostly a repost from a post in r/singing that I made. I just want to get this one non-music focused perspective as well. I’m an 18M in college with an interest in the music industry, but I’m not sure if it’s even worth trying.

I am very passionate about it, especially my specific talent: storytelling. I’ve won poetry awards and book awards. They are part of what really helped my Harvard application. Songs are my favorite place to story write. I either come up with instrumentals in my head (which I can’t write down cause I forgot how to read music over HS) but I hum the instrumentals and write the lyrics of these personal stories thru the music in pop song structure (verse, chorus, bridge…). I can also take existing instrumentals and write over them. I’m no Celine dion singer but I’ve done enough choir that I can control my voice and make it sound decent. My goal would be to be a pop artist. I will note my idea for my first album is entirely HS related, so in theory I’d love to enter ASAP before I get too old and that idea goes from teenage angst to adult-who-can’t-move-on.

Now, here’s where my doubts appear. I go to Harvard where everyone seems very focused on a low risk high reward career like consulting, investment banking. And I know for certain I could also do this, and just get money fast with lots of labor. Probably be setup for an MBA and then a high exec position. I’m not really sure how much going to Harvard would even help in music if at all. I know there are many record execs at the top label companies who got undergrads at Harvard but I feel like it would look kind of awkward to reach to some Harvard alumn at UMG asking for a record deal… 

I also just kind of feel delusional. Like who really makes it? Like sure I have a marketing strategy, and business understanding, and entire albums written in a relatable way that could be produced but also so many people want to do the same thing. I think I have an interesting and marketing story as a son of immigrants from a not so great neighborhood in a major city in the US, who achieved academically but also has a lot of gripes with the education system and former friends etc to release through music. But it still seems impossible. 

I just don’t want to feel like I wasted all my time to just… end up being laughed out of rooms. At the same time, I don’t want regrets and I’m always coming up with songs in my head on a weekly basis that I don’t want to go to waste. I’d be so much happier if I had success in music rather than being another McKinsey cog. Still, I don’t want to end up being the starving artist who wasted their Ivy League degree.

18q3ijw,"32, Video Editing career feels at a standstill, what should I do?","For context, I'm 32F in India with 8+ years of experience in Video Editing. I chose this field because during my internships, I enjoyed the process of creating videos but didn't have the skill or confidence of taking up other roles such as of a director or a writer. Editing seemed like a good starting point to get into the field while I explored other roles.

Now I've been into this for 8 years and it has been okay. I've learned a lot and made decent progress as well. Mainly worked in short-form Youtube content like sketches. Also did corporate videos on the side.

About a year back, I tried to make my way into long form and worked as an Assistant/Associate Editor on a couple web shows. They were extremely challenging and I felt exploited as well because a lot of the times, I was doing the work of two people while struggling to deliver quality work for both roles. I've realized that I need to work in this role for a few years more until I can take projects independently, if at all.

&#x200B;

The problem is, I'm feeling that I'm not made for this and I don't really have the motivation to deep dive into it, which I'd need to if I want to take up independent projects. Moreover, the industry feels very limited and there don't seem to be that many opportunities. When there is a vacancy, it's not posted anywhere and senior Editors rely on personal networks to find people. Honesty, it seems like an unstructured industry that's running as much on personal networking, as it is on talent and skill. The timelines and budgets are getting stringer, while the scope of work that's expected has increased manifold due to inexperienced directors and digital cameras making it easy to record videos at scale.

I want to switch careers and move to an industry that's more structured and stable than this. Has better scope, pays better and treats people with respect. But I don't know how to really go about it.

Would appreciate any inputs, if someone has gone through something similar or has an insight that could be helpful.",ChaoticPeace13,2,1.0,0,1703450837,2023-12-24 20:47:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18q3ijw/32_video_editing_career_feels_at_a_standstill/,12,2023

18q1nge,Struggling to Chose a Career Path.,"Hello everyone, My name is Badie and I'm a 19 years old Computer science student based in France, facing what seems to be the biggest challenge of my life (and I'm probably making more out of it than I should). The challenge is choosing the appropriate and most fitting specialization to continue my career.

Notes: 
+ The post is quite long, get your coffee ready :)
+ I tried to make it as structured and organized as I can, I hope It's clear and not so messed up.
+ I'm not a native English speaker so excuse the mistakes.
+ If you can't help, please leave an upvote for better reach.

### Background

A little background about myself, I was born and raised in Algeria, a relatively poor country in the north of Africa, I was my entire life a grade A student who thrived academically, and with minor efforts, but not for once was there a subject or even a talk for proper career orientation or college major choice during my 12 years through primary school, middle school, and high school. We were expected to figure it out on our own, by the time we get to our last year in high school and before passing our BAC exam. Most students were either forced by their parents into a college major, chose one randomly, or took another person's experience as a reference that is always true. The average on that BAC exam is what decided The choices you're offered and the priority you're given to get into one of the majors you chose. For top notch students like me it was always between medical school or engineering in one of the prestigious institues of the country. Anyway, when I got to my high school graduation year and before passing my BAC exam I started conducting some research and I finally decided to et into Computer Science as my college major, and I'm glad I did. I joined one of those prestigious institues I mentioned earlier (Higher School of Computer Science), and in my first few weeks I faced two main problems:
1. Academic difficulty gap between high school and college, so suddenly it required much more effort to be one of the best student in my batch.
2. Noticing the talent gap between me and other extremely skilled students who seemed to have started playing around with computers and code editors since the age of 10.
These two problems led to a lot of stress, feeling of being late in my career advancement, fear of missing out on things, and a lot of self doubt, which I now know was all unnecessary and ridiculous. I also started being biased by those extremely talented people, in other words, if that person was good at something, and was good at making it seem cool, I would think to myself that hell yeah, this is what I'm doing with my life, which was where I fucked up the most.

I eventually started experimenting with some specializations like web development, cyber security (mostly by playing CTF competitions), and graphic design.

The self doubt and bias I encountered were some of the reasons I kept jumping from one thing to another, without actually getting a deep view into any of those fields, just to satisfy my need to be as good as other students. This led to two things:
1. Wasting my first two college years in jumping from one thing to another, without actually fully experimenting and getting a deep understanding of the field and building real projects in any of those things.
2. Delaying the talk of what I ACTUALLY want to do with my life, so there was never an unbiased opinion in my head of what specialization I want to get into.

Now I moved to France, and I'm actually redoing my 2nd year in college in one of the french universities (which is something you have to do, you can't continue to 3rd year directly), and I'm still facing the same struggle. Fortunately it's in a much less severe way, I overcame the feeling of having to be as good as everyone else in my batch, and I'm also conducting a lot of research, asking a lot of people, about the potential career paths that might be good for me.

### Things I believe to Be True

1. In order to stand out in the job market and be one of the best people in what I do, I have to start learning, practicing, and building projects from now.
2. I'm pretty damn late regarding the first point, given that I haven't started building a profile and a name yet.
3. Most of my time should be dedicated to learning things about that one particular specialization, because it will give better results in the end. Which leads to me thinking that I should have as little hobbies as I can.
4. Sometimes, even when you do everything the right way, you still don't get to where you want, which is quite scary.

### Important Things to Know About Me

I believe myself to be smart, creative, innovative, and a very fast learner (sorry if this sounds like I'm bragging or something because I'm really not). I like to be recognized and appreciated for the good things I do. I am quite biased when it comes to this particular struggle (choosing a career) by my close friends and the people I love. I have a huge fear of missing out on things, for example in this case, I tell myself what if I choose this path but in reality the other path was more fitting for you?

I am a bit of a perfectionist person (which is why I'm struggling anyway). I want to find the absolute perfect thing for me to do, which I know is impossible but also fail to believe.

I want in the future to lead my own projects and startups.

I like to manage and lead people. The ideal thing that I see myself doing in the future is leading a group of creatives and developers to solve everyday problems, using my creative and technical skills.

I have a small experience in brand identity and visual identity design, I have been doing it intermittently in the past two years and had some clients. For someone who hasn't dedicated so much time to doing it I'm somehow good at it, and I really like it. I don't consider design a career path but more of a side hustle, and definitely a skill that will help me in the future, when it comes to building brands or launching startups. It can also be my creative gateway when things get too technical in my everyday life, or some tool I use to express my ideas.

I studied some web development concepts and built small projects over the past two years, so far I have dealt with HTML, CSS, JS, Tailwind, React.

I played some CTF competitions (3 or 4) and done good in most of them.

I want to start making money through freelancing or part time jobs in the next 1-2 years.

### Main Point

After doing some research on the things I have discovered so far, I found myself leaning to one of the following career paths: full-stack Web Development, and Cyber Security engineering or Pentesting. I will in the following sections discuss what I like and don't like about each of those career paths.

I was introduced to web development before joining college with a month or so, I was moving slowly but steadily in one of the online courses I found (freecodecamp). I liked it, but soon after I started focusing less on the course. In the months that follow it was an on again off again type of thing. I made some small projects in my first two years in college, and I really enjoyed it. Web development is much more available for freelance opportunities than most other CS fields, and companies also hire remote workers frequently, which is an advantage in my opinion. Skills acquired in web dev are applicable in many other software engineering fields, or even entrepreneurship. I can create a website for any idea that I get, making it a very creative field which suits me pretty well. Simply my heart leans to web dev than any other field. BUT, I still have some problems with it. Lately I have noticed that a lot of people have been getting into web development and not so many positions are open, which increases competition and make it harder to get an entry level role. The rise of AI and drag-and-drop website builders may impact heavily the need for big web development teams in the future, I'm not saying all web developers will be replaced by chatgpt, but the number of devs required per company will drop. It's not as exciting as cyber security roles (offensive side), and not as mentally challenging, meaning not everyday is an opportunity to learn new things. Not something I see myself doing for the next 10 years, at some point I would like to either switch careers, to something like AI or cyber security maybe, or move to a management position. Doesn't offer opportunities for academic research.

For cyber security I was introduced to it by one of those highly skilled people I met during my first year in college, ironically I discovered later that the guy was just trying his best to look talented while in fact he really wasn't. Anyway, I started by solving chalenges in platforms like PicoCTF, and participating in online CTF challenges, which I loved. CTF competitions made me realize that the person in me that likes to solve puzzles after being mentally challenged  and after doing a lot of research and learning so many things was really drawn to cyber security. Maybe that was a mistake, since most cyber security roles aren't really similar to CTF challenges (maybe only the offensive roles but still not as similar and exciting). Another thing that I like about cyber security is that it's really technical and mentally challenging, and it presents new things to learn everyday. There's a big skill shortage in the job market, and not enough talented people to fill in those gaps, so with enough effort put over some time, it will be easy to land a high paying job. It will acquire me skills that are really cool and allow me to do great things, but can't be used in other fields. Moving on to what I don't like about cyber security. Fist thing is that there's little to no coding, I've seen many videos on YouTube for cyber security analysts that insist on the fact that they're not coders, and I particularly don't like that because coding is one of the things I enjoy the most about CS. Networking is big a part of cyber security and unfortunately I find it really boring and not enjoyable. It's more of an IT subfield than it is a CS subfield, which I don't like as well. Less opportunities for remote work and freelancing than web dev. If I specialize in cyber security I would like to be a Pentester, which is not really available for entry level jobs, unlike roles like Cyber Analyst. The biggest advantage I'm seeing for cyber security is how unsatisfied the job market is and how much talented people are needed, so given I put enough time and effort in it I will land a high paying job in a short time.

### What Do I Want to Know?
+ Am I being too hard on myself? and making this problem bigger than it should be?
+ How real are the things I mentioned about both web dev and cyber security?
+ How real are the things I stated in the ""Things I believe to be true"" part?
+ I've seen a lot of Linkedin profiles for people with cyber security roles who started their journey by being web developers, is that a common thing?
+ What do you believe is the most fitting specialization for me?
+ What are your insights and advice on this topic?
+ Can I combine the two and still be really good at both of them?
+ Is it a good idea to specialize in web dev and keep CTF competitions as a hobby?
+ Should I still discover more CS fields before I make my choice?
+ If anyone has had the same struggle before, I hope you can share how you overcame it.

18q1iky,Career Crossroads: Burnt Out and Considering Change - Seeking Advice,"I've been working at my current company in program finance for nearly 3 years. While I appreciate the overall company culture and the WFH option I negotiated, I'm feeling burnt out after being passed on a recent manager role and receiving an average year-end review.

Considering a switch to departments like FP&A, accounting, or overheads, and wondering about the best approach:

1. Should I wait for my 401k to vest in 3 months before applying for positions outside the company?
2. Is it a good idea to apply internally for a new position without informing my current manager?
3. Should I discuss my career goals with my current manager, hoping for support in transferring to a new department?
I believe I'm below market pay by around 10% and could potentially land a $125-$130k position outside. WFH is crucial for me, and I'm concerned about losing this perk in a new role.

18q08ch,"Should I stay or should I go now...? Like my team, but new position pay raise.","Hello!

I am at an internal cross-roads now.

My team is great. I love my team and am excited to work with them. Of course I have my issues, but for the most part I always planned to stay where I am.  Issues arise from interacting with my boss - he is great as a person, knows what he is talking about, but has some things to work on and in 4 years still has these issues. The entire team gets the same type of stress from it. Its valuable insight, but oy. Finally, my skills were noticed by a very high member of the company board and I know, if our department were to be liquidated tomorrow, I am 1000% sure I would be saved.

Well my team is transitioning to Scrum and I am to be the acting Scrum Master. I got my certificate, so great. But this was something I did on my own time, and does not mean I get any increase of pay or anything like that. I honestly didn't expect it.

In our company, there is a Scrum Master, and he is leaving soon. I now have an opportunity to apply to the position. It is fairly different than what I am doing now with my other duties (which I enjoy doing). It is a different team. And it is, at a *minimum*, 10k more as a starting salary. I've been with the company for 10 years and have made good compensation, especially from when I first started. This amounts to roughly almost $5/hour raise.

My husband is starting his own business after being laid off in the summer. I know he will do great, but it hasn't been profitable yet. We're not *hurting* for money at the moment, but we know it is there. Because of this, and the stress of my boss and how I vent to my husband, he is strongly urging me to apply. I don't know if or when I would be able to get to that level of pay in my current role. 

Then there is the position of Scrum Master and I am not sure how solid that is. Companies are downsizing, and I don't want to get this role to lose it at the end of the fiscal year.  We're not a tech company, and Sprint is primarily a tech thing. The experience I think could let me transition to a new company, perhaps easily (or not - in a couple days of being posted, the position had 500 applications!), perhaps with even more money. I don't think I would have the failsafe anymore as I do now, since I would be in a whole different department with overhead of a different board member.

Does anyone have any experience, good or bad, with transitioning like this?  Leaving or going, the current market and job security, the bump in pay and when is it worth it?

18pzygi,How valuable is being a student athlete to employers in STEM fields?,"TLDR: Im about to graduate as a student athlete in college but I am really thinking about quitting my sport, which my dad thinks I’ll regret heavily 

I am about to graduate as a student athlete in college. I have lost my passion for my sport, but my dad insists that I stay for the final few months despite it not really being that fun for me anymore. (For context, it is at a high level but offers no financial rewards)

If I quit, I may have time to help do enough research within my lab group to be able to present at a conference by the spring- which I think could be a very valuable and relevant research experience to put on my resume.  My dad argues that this is something I’ll be able to do for the rest of my life, but the sport is not- which is of course true. He thinks there’s a lot of benefit in lettering in the sport and completely finishing my degree as an athlete vs not lettering and ending the sport a few months short. 

I frankly think nobody will really care if I did it for 3.5 years instead of 4 years or if I lettered. However, I am  young and naive, which is why I’m asking for any wisdom or insight on what people would do in my shoes?

18pwnhh,Resilience in Transition: A Tale of Career Ups and Downs in Tech,"The journey began at 20, and now at 26, having completed a B.Sc. in Electronics and Communication in May 2017. Post-graduation, I delved into a 3-month stint as a system support contractor at a private bank from June to August 2017. Simultaneously, I pursued a 6-month networking course from August 2017 to January 2018. Unfortunately, despite completion, securing a job as a networking engineer proved challenging due to the insistence on B.E/B.Tech degrees by most employers.  
In an effort to navigate the situation, I explored opportunities in electrical electronics companies, but the demand for B.E/B.Tech qualifications persisted. Facing mounting frustration from my parents, I took up a role as an office boy from February to June 2018 for financial support. Following this, I secured a position as a junior service engineer at a private treadmill showroom from July to December 2018. However, due to financial and business complications, the shop closed, leading me back to the job market with limited success, despite earnest efforts and minimal assistance from friends.  
Recognizing the need for a shift, I ventured into the IT domain, enrolling in a Java course at ABC for Technology in Bangalore in 2019. Despite assurances of job placement for candidates with any degree, the reality was different. The year 2019 was largely lost, and by January 2020, I found myself disillusioned with the job market's preference for B.E/B.Tech candidates.  
In a turn of fortune, I secured a role as a junior Java developer in a startup company in February 2020. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March disrupted the project, leading to layoffs, and I found myself unemployed again by August 2020. Seeking advice from colleagues and friends revealed a recurring theme – my bachelor's degree was a barrier to securing employment. Many suggested pursuing a master's degree, prompting me to enroll in an M.Sc. in Data Science with an internship from October 2020 to August 2022.  
Despite completing the course, the challenges persisted, with a recession limiting job opportunities. Companies sought experienced candidates, and the bias towards B.E/B.Tech qualifications in the Data Science field further hindered my prospects. Nearly 1.5 years later, with dwindling hope and mounting financial problems, I am contemplating a career shift, ready to embrace any job opportunity. The substantial career gap adds to the complexities.  
During the period of 2017-2023, I acquired a diverse skill set encompassing Electronics, Operating Systems, Firewall, DND, DHCP, Network Virtualization, Hardware and Software Troubleshooting, Networking, Java, Python, PowerBI, Excel for Data Analysis, Data Analysis, scikit-learn, Machine Learning, TensorFlow, QlikView, SQL, Google Cloud, Linux (Debian, Fedora, Arch, Ubuntu Server), Windows Server 2016, and Jupyter Notebook. Despite these skills, my efforts have seemingly gone to waste.  
I am now seeking advice and suggestions from the community. What are the changes I should make in my career strategy? What skills should I focus on to stay relevant in the dynamic job market? Any ideas for upskilling or alternative career paths are highly appreciated.

18pvvuo,"Joining the tech industry as a graduate software engineer at 28 years old, am I too old for entry role?","Okay so its Christmas and I want to be honest, so just a bit of background, I worked in healthcare for a few years and realised there was no career progression and low wage regardless how long you work in healthcare.  
  
So I went back to uni and studied bachelor of computer science and I was able to land a graduate software engineer position here in Sydney in a fairly big tech company. I start late January 2024.  
  
One HUGE problem I am facing is I am so nervous and insecure about my age. I am 28 years old and when I start my graduate software engineer position I am going to be part of other grad engineers that are in their early 20s like 21, 22 and 23. I have met them throughout company networking events and parties but no one knows my actual age, I think they just assume I am the same age as them since I technically did ""graduate"" the same year as them. Honestly I am sweating and anxious and this is getting worse and worse the closer it gets to my starting date. One of my lab demo in one of my subject at uni actually referred me into this graduate position and even he doesn't know my age. Also I am positive I am actually older than him by a couple of years...

18ptrnt,Career Advice / Name of it,"Hello everyone! Hope you are doing well :)

I wanted to ask a question here because it seems that I can’t find exact name of the profession that I’m dreaming about so I was thinking maybe one of you can help me out.

Maybe it is important to mention that I have great technical skills and that I am a fast learner.
Because of all of my interests I know how to work in Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, Video Editing and Music Production Softwares, etc.

After talking to myself, I’ve came to conclusion that I really enjoy part where I’m doing online research and making comparisons for all sort of things (when I’m choosing what to buy, watch or read for example).
I’m very organized and systematic while doing it. I like to make spreadsheets to keep every valuable information neatly stored, to conclude what’s important and what’s not. After collecting all necessary data I like to make comparisons and decide what is best based on my needs or what is best, overall.
The end product is very informative and concisely made so it is crystal clear and easy to understand.
Often I even dig into the history of topic to be sure I’m collecting all valuable knowledge.
So as not to prolong, you can get a picture of what I’m talking about.

Is there any career path that would suit me and if yes, please tell me the name of it
(bonus is if it’s a good wage as well haha)

18psxzz,Animal Science Jobs,"From the UK,

So I have an Animal science degree and I used to work as a licensed animal technician looking after research animals ans supporting researchers (who were mostly PhD students) with their studies. I did it for almost 4 years but left it last month as its very mentally and physically draining and I also got bored even though the pay is very good, it was messing with my mental health and also we got a new manager and senior who made my life hell so I had to leave.

So now I've been at my NHS job for a month as a sterile service technician and I know its not for me and want to leave as tbh not only is the job not for me but the training that I'm getting is not great since they are short staffed and extremely stressful that its affecting me physically.

Does anyone have a good idea of animal science jobs I can do? Whenever I search it comes up with Veterinary jobs or the industry I just left as an animal technician as its a struggle to get a job outside of animals as I think all these employers see is that I have experience with animals and think I can't apply what I did to people (which I very much can and explain that in my cover letters)

I just don't know what I want to do job wise anymore but I do want to put my degree to good use.

I'm also intrigued by fields like chemical and renewable energies.

I have always struggled with science and I never understood it. I always avoided to pursue any science courses so I majored in health science finished my bachelor and not interested in it. Dental hygiene came to my mind because I love working with my hands, flexible hours, good pay. No weekends or night work. I see myself working in healthcare. Dental hygiene was my passion until I started reading dental anatomy and didn’t understand anything yet if I did pursue it it will be 5-6 classes per quarter and I do well with 2-3 classes per quarter only. But I see myself as dental hygienist but I don’t think I’ll succeed at it. I like flexible hours no weekends or night work. For interior design it’s all art so it may be easier for me but I’m not crazy about it. I can take 3 classes per quarter which is easier but eventually I’ll have to work nights and weekends to finish projects.

18pqs44,Did I choose the right job?,"
This is kinda long so bear with me. I need some advice here and I'm feeling weird/bad/stressed and like I made the wrong choice. 
 I recently moved to a new city and had to find a new job. I guess it's not super important what kind of job I get because we are only going to be in this city for the next 6-8 months, so the job isn't forever. After weeks of applying, I finally got two interviews- one at a guardianship service (office work helping adults with disabilities get Medicaid, care, help pay their bills, etc), and the other interview was a basic customer service/data entry/office work at a corporate office for a vending company.
Both jobs offered the same pay.
The guardianship interview went really well. The office and the people were warm. I knew the job would be challenging but also it would be a meaningful way for me to spend 40 hours a week and make a positive impact in people's lives doing something that I feel is important and impactful. 
My uncertainty comes with the second job. 
Like I mentioned, it's a corporate office job for a vending company. Not terribly important or impactful work. But, during my interview, a weird thing happened. I didn't think much of it in the moment because I get nervous and can be kinda awkward in interviews and am trying to put forward my best most confident self, which is challenging as an introvert. Anyway, the interviewer paused the interview because she said she needed to fill me in on some stuff and then see if I wanted to continue with the interview. She said the company has grown so much in the last two years, and it was so unexpectedly successful that they had to do some restructuring which resulted in downsizing throughout the country (it's national I guess). She assured me that as the corporate office we have 100% job security. She also said that often times when taking calls at this job we have to deal with people who ""want their invoices"" and are ""upset because they want to get paid and aren't getting paid"" and that I need to just forward their information to accounting and ask for them to advise, and tell the customer that their invoice and money is out of my control. I didn't really understand most of this but I really need a job so I continued with the interview even though I felt a bit weird. At the end of the interview, she said I would be eligible for a raise after 90 days as well as the option to transition to hybrid or remote work. I also thought since it's a national company that perhaps when we move in 6-8 months I could transfer which would make our second move transition a bit smoother. 
I was offered the corporate office job right at the end of the interview and felt really good. Both women who interviewed me were so positive, friendly, and warm. I felt good about it. An hour later, the guardianship place called to offer me the job there. I panicked, and told her politely that I was grateful for the opportunity but that I accepted a job elsewhere and I was thankful for her time and energy, etc. She seemed kind of upset and flustered on the phone. 
Anyway, ive lost sleep over this the last two days and I don't know if I made a mistake. This office job seems low stress, it's potentially temporary, but also... Are there red flags?? I feel like there are but I'm just not sure. 
Id really appreciate advise, experience, guidance, anything really. Thanks in advance.",Sauntr_sweet,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1703405066,2023-12-24 08:04:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18pqs44/did_i_choose_the_right_job/,12,2023
18pn0bt,I need help identifying a fulfilling career path to pursue.,"I have, since as long as I can remember, been naturally good at art and taught myself since a young age. I have a lot of really advanced skill sets to do with drawing and painting, and am in third year of art school. During my degree however, I realised the prospect of doing any kind of Art for a career is almost impossible. I never wanted to be a gallery artist, I always wanted an actual paid job. Unlike my course mates, it isn’t the conceptual side or the challenging society side of fine art I enjoy, it’s the technical side. The challenge. The realism. I for a while was going to aim for a concept art job, or at least work towards it in the industry. Although I still want to do it, the difficulty of doing so makes me want to not try at all. Google it. Read other Reddit posts. Everyone just talks about how incredibly difficult it is. 

I need a Plan B that is good enough as it has a 90% chance of becoming Plan A. Some people can make the trade of doing a really bad day job that allows them to do what they want after. I can’t. I need something at least in the middle. I can’t spend half if not more of my waking life for the next 40-50 years doing something I seriously don’t like or at least care about. It doesn’t necessarily NEED to be art related, although that idea rn seems so wild. I’ve taken art so seriously and worked so hard at it, and will have a degree in it so it’s just gonna feel like a huge waste if I didn’t pursue and succeed in it. I just need something I can get fulfilment out of. My Girlfriend works in primark, sometimes 10 hour shifts and comes home feeling so depressed, so drained and feels like she’s wasting her life. I did the same last summer. I don’t want that to be my future. 

My best idea is High School Art Teacher. Because 1. I enjoyed a lot of aspects of at least the high school environment, I can’t identify it exactly, but for some reason I miss it. A lot. 2. It’s the only job that makes my degree not utterly useless. 3. It is a professional career I can advance in and be proud of. 4. I come from a rough area, so would be more attuned to rougher schools than a lot of people. 5. Is broadly art related even if it doesn’t involve really a lot of actual drawing or painting. 6. This is double edged for me, but I get to teach kids art. Obv. I say double edged as I don’t want to teach them art and get them into the situation I’m in rn. I don’t want them in art school realising their job prospects are extremely confusing and anxiety inducing. Even then, I don’t know if teaching would provide the sense of fulfilment I need. I miss high school a lot for reasons I don’t know. I don’t know if it was the dynamic, or the fact I got on well with the teachers, or what it is. But being a teacher is very different to being a pupil, and it probably wouldn’t be in the same school or with the same people. So who’s to say it would even work. I know you’re not meant to have your life planned out at age 20, but I can’t go on with this feeling of falling off a cliff after I graduate. Like what am I doing after I grad. 

So tl;dr, I’ve spent nearly 20 years gaining a lot of technical skill in drawing and painting. Got to art school, realised even though I enjoy the degree, prospect-wise other than the simple fact it’s a degree, doesn’t provide any prospects like many other degrees. Am considering being an art teacher for various reasons, but that worries me for other reasons. And really just need help in planning my future.",ThrowRAcokecan,1,1.0,1,1703390666,2023-12-24 04:04:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18pn0bt/i_need_help_identifying_a_fulfilling_career_path/,12,2023

18pja14,"Need a career reset, not sure what direction to go in. Advice?","Long post sorry in advance. Never posted anything like this before, just looking for advice because I'm not sure what direction to be going here. Here's my situation. I am in my early 30s, male, married, no kids. I currently have a senior level role (non management) at a major US Insurance company. I've been in my role a little over 5 years, prior to that I was a restaurant manager after finishing college.

My bachelor's degree was kinda a useless one looking back, just a liberal arts degree from an overly expensive school, I didn't take college as seriously as I should have because I didn't know what I wanted to do at the time, sort of caved to family pressures and just took path of least resistance. I think the college I went to still has a financial hold to not realese final transcripts cause I still owe around 9kish from my last semester, it's been over a decade so idk (3.4gpa). Still paying down the student loans which I took I have around 38k left. Otherwise I have no cc debt or anything like that, just my mortgage.

My spouse and i bought a house last spring which needed way more work than we anticipated, it was a fixer upper to begin with, cheapest house in a nice area. The reno we did really went way over budget, a lot of issues we found along the way we didn't expect, and having to switch out a bad contractor part way thru didn't help. We're finally moved in and all now, 90% of the planned work is done but it definitely did a number on our savings, we pretty much have like 12k left in our savings now. Hoping the fact that we completely flipped the house at least means we have a good bit of equity now.

My current job I've moved up pretty rapidly these past 5 1/2 years, my salary more than doubled since I started, I now make 103k/yr. My spouse makes similar to me, her job is in tech and 100% remote, she can work from anywhere. As for my job it used to be a good company but things have changed, a lot of management changes has made it completely toxic, ever changing metrics, layoffs, no bonuses anymore, they put employees against each other which has turned it into a pretty cut throat environment, coworkers that used to be friends are rivals now. I've been having to put in a ton more hours and it's really affecting my mental and physical health, I can't focus anymore, get anxiety often which i didn't used to do, I've put on a lot of weight. Generally stressed out and looking to leave the company. Especially with us going to a more hybrid in-office structure starting Jan 1, previously we were mostly remote.

We live in an extremely expensive area. Northeast US. A lot of my friends have moved away, either abroad to europe or to cheaper states down south, they went into mostly business or tech. Kinda regret not going to school for one of those honestly. I guess idk what I want to do, I'm really burnt out for barely taking any time off for more than 5 years, it helped me get where I am in the company but I honestly don't know how much longer I can keep doing this, I basically just work, eat, and sleep, I rarely see the few friends who haven't moved away anymore. 

My spouse and I have a good relationship which is a saving grace here. I would like to get a job that is less customer facing, something more internal and fully remote so we can potentially sell our fully renovated house and move abroad, or at least to a less expensive area, I just don't know the path here, I'm really burned out of insurance, idk how well my skills would transfer to other fields. And I wanna try to not take too big of a pay cut of possible. A lot of the people I know have done very well for themselves because they have taken a good salary and moved to a low cost of living area working remote.

I figured I'd just air my existential crisis out here on this burner account and see, any constructive advice is very appreciated, I feel like I'm in an okay spot but just floating and need a reset to get us to where we want to be.

I have also been working part-time as a substitute teacher (was there every day on Monday and Wednesday for a full 7 hours and sometimes worked Friday if needed, worked a little more often this week and last week since my courses ended.)

I’m finding I really like my job, officially started on July 31st, and still don’t know what I want to major in. I should have about $6,000 saved the next time I’m paid for December. I actually almost think I’d prefer working to attending school but I also feel like it’s probably not wise to just drop school even though I really like my job

I make $17 hourly but *may* ask for a raise after more time has passed

18pfb56,"Folks in non-profit - coping with the corruption, system, and feeling jaded","I started working in non-profit/social justice. It is taxing - even giving me dreams and nightmares, endless thoughts cycles, thinking about work during my off time… all of that! I work with youth. Often it one to one sessions. 

There are two profiles generally:

1. Some of them are very SJW type who are so eager to change and transform the world. I don’t fault them as they are 17-21 and probably haven’t been tainted yet. But I’ve seen and been through many burns from systems (especially work, legal…) that I am so jaded. Here I am underpaid in my role (with zero security and benefits) expected to mentor these youth and “inspire them to make the world a better place”. I feel bad for saying that I see this job just as biweekly amount to pay my bills and survive. I don’t have much “meaning” whatever that means. It feels transactional but they are keeners and are determined to solve every global issue. 

2.  The other type are the opposite. They often don’t show up or communicate. It’s like pulling teeth to get them to attend and engage. Again I don’t blame them because economically, politically, socially the world is a difficult place. They are withdrawn and I get it. The hard part is when my supervisor probes and makes it seem like staff (my) incompetence is the reason why the youth act like this. And our numbers are low because of staff skill set not because youth simply don’t show up. Sigh. 

For those in non-profit and social impact, how do you come? I feel like a fraud because I have so little energy and battery for myself, and I’m expected to give 150% to my job and participants. While being underpaid and no benefits.

18peckl,How to use my experience going forward - RN with Project Management and Quality Experience,"I would like some advice. I have what I think is a unique skillset and I just can't figure out how to make it work for me. 

I worked in accounting through my 20's with an Associates in Accounting and then went back to school in my 30's to get a Bachelor's in Nursing and now have a Master's in Nursing Healthcare Quality Management. I have been a Registered Nurse for 10 years now. I keep my ACLS/BLS up to date and I just went and got my PMP Project Management Professional certification. I have experience in ICU, nursing education, quality, program management, process improvement. I currently work in the quality dept of an insurance company and I can't seem to break out of the 80k income bracket. 

I understand that there are plenty of people that make less than that and I don't want to make it sound like I am somehow poor. But, I do have this feeling that I am not being paid what I think I should after working for 30 years. Maybe I am wrong. I live in the Midwest in the Kansas City area. I feel like I am being paid this way because of the nursing degrees... like if someone was just a random any other degree holder with this experience they would be paid more but because of the terrible state of nursing, I am paid less. Everyone is trying to get out of bedside nursing right now and the pay for nursing is becoming predatory for non-bedside roles in my opinion. 

I have moved jobs just about every year for the past 4 years. My pay is not due to me being stagnant in a job. I am really good at making metrics move in the right direction and that feels valuable. This is why I got the project management certification thinking it would help me legitimize myself, I don't know where to go from here. Any advice of what to try next to get into the 6 figure arena? I would rather not manage individual humans. I am great with managing a project and I know that is also people but I don't enjoy the direct report situation.",Maleficent_Truth_60,1,1.0,9,1703363520,2023-12-23 20:32:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18peckl/how_to_use_my_experience_going_forward_rn_with/,12,2023
18pdcnd,What’s the short rest you can stay at a job and keep it on your resume?,"Sorry this is long but I wanted to be detailed. I started a job almost 2 months ago as a financial analyst in a regional office and I really don’t enjoy it at all. The hours are long, I just stare at a computer all day and my pay isn’t great for having a Masters in Info Systems from a top 20 University in August. I didn’t love coding and my undergrad was in Finance, so I went back to that route and because I wasn’t getting any responses to job applications so I took it. I know a lot of people hate their entry level job so wondering if I’m overreacting. 

The job title is really good for having no other financial experience on my resume, and it’s at a big company, so I know it will pay off for as long as I can get through it. I’ll be able to describe things I did well on the resume, but a lot of my day is having to ask for more work or figure out how to do something with next to no guidance and it feels silly having to continually ask for more work. 

I know a lot of financial analyst roles are spent on the computer all day, but I am not sure I can keep doing that for 10+ hours a day. I’m not the greatest at Excel so I’m learning to be faster (much more than in school), but I feel I need more of a balance of social interaction in my work to use my strengths as an individual. 

I’m not looking to stay in this industry long term, and I’ll be expected to take over someone else’s role who works even longer hours than me. I don’t want to leave them high and dry then, but that would happen the longer I stay to gain experience and I don’t want to ruin a potential reference, even though it would probably not be great at the moment if I left so quick.

I spoke with my cousin who’s a Credit Analyst at a bank. While it’s not much different in terms of being on the computer, he’s learning about people applying for loans for their business/real estate to use later on when he has money to start his own business, which I’m also interested in doing. It has me considering cutting my losses and looking for a new role, and for hopefully more pay. 

Should I look for a new job already? Is it better to get more experience in the position? Would switching to something like Financial Planning, Software Sales, Consulting, being an actuary or something else in finance be a better option? I’m not against working hard or long hours, it’s just tough staring at a computer endlessly. Even coding with less hours would be better. 

One thing deterring me is the job market hasn’t been great but it seems to be becoming better. I would either stay til a new job or could go back to an old job making even more money now, but doesn’t have the long term progression. Please help with some guidance.",mbrizzle6,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1703360664,2023-12-23 19:44:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18pdcnd/whats_the_short_rest_you_can_stay_at_a_job_and/,12,2023

18pb6fc,"As a manager and supervisor, how do I keep hybrid work fair when employees cite issues for needing to telework more often?","I have a couple supervisees who are part of a larger team officially supposed to be working 3 days office, 2 telework. These supervisees are often telling me that they have very serious issues going on outside the office and/or they are physically incapable of coming to the office. The ultimatum is that they can work more days telework or they will take personal time off. One of those supervisees does not have any PTO left, so they must telework or take off unpaid.

I believe that they legitimately are unable to come to the office: forcing them to be in the office is off the table. The problem I now have is that their work needs to get done and they're able and willing to do it remotely, but letting them take the extra telework days creates resentment among the rest of the team who are covering the office in the meantime. At least one of those team members is very quick to go to HR if they feel anything is unfair: they reported this same issue before and the employee taking extra telework time was cited.

Despite the HR risk, my boss and the higher-ups continue to take a slackened telework stance of ""it's fine as long as I don't know about it."" This is what they tell all of the employees. It's fine. Just ask your supervisor. Don't tell me.

On one hand I don't want to be the asshole who tells a supervisee to take no pay instead of teleworking when the higher-up bosses don't have a problem with it. My boss' boss legit sat down and told me to not be so strict. On the other, the team morale is suffering, certain employees are getting saddled with the office work more often than others, and I risk the teleworkers and myself getting reported. Again.

I am a mechanical engineer (mid 40s) currently working in the aerospace sector. I enjoy my place of work but am somewhat frustrated at the slow pace of promotion and the small raises. 

 I get contacted often by recruiters for new job opportunities. Job opportunities that offer more money and often times are higher up the engineering organization. 

Initially it is exciting to be contacted!However, my anxiety goes through the roof if I take any action to explore any of these new opportunities. I start wanting to cancel interviews (or not show up to them) or send excuses to the recruiter about why I can’t suddenly change jobs even after they set up interviews.

My feeling is that it all based on something from almost a decade ago. I was laid off (completely different industry). In the ensuing chaos and pressure to stop bleeding out $, I found a job that proved to be a terrible fit. Lasted only a few months there. It was humiliating, financially painful, and embarrassing. It also threw me into a deep depression. Left by mutual accord. Joined present employer shortly after. 

I think this mental block is me never recovering from the one-two punch of the lay off and that terrible job. I am afraid it will happen again …

18p7lyo,Exploring Career Paths and Interdisciplinary Shifts,"Hey everyone, 

I've been pondering some aspects of career trajectories lately and wanted to get your thoughts. It seems like individuals from diverse fields like economics, mechanical engineering, etc. can pivot into data science roles with relative ease, while someone with a more traditional programming-focused background may face challenges entering other fields. I'm curious to hear your perspectives on this—why should one need to study CS if anyone can become a software engineer, data scientist, etc. then?

I came across someone with a master's in ""*Statistical Learning and Data Analysis""* which I couldn't find on Google, and their bachelor's is in a different field altogether (mechanical engineering). What are your thoughts on individuals from non-CS backgrounds landing jobs in fields traditionally associated with computer science?

On a related note, I've been reflecting on my academic journey. After all, if anyone can do what I am doing without a degree, why should I spend more time studying it academically, burning myself out, and learning mathematics that won't be used outside of ML or similar? Unrealistic deadlines, stupid assignments—the list is long. The only benefit I've had here was networking opportunities.

18p5par,How to deal with jealous and petty behaviour in the workplace as a new joiner?,"I recently joined a company I was excited to join after leaving my previous role after 3 months. I am someone who is experienced but always looking to challenge myself in a role, and unfortunately, my previous role didn't offer the challenge; however, I had a great team and a wonderful manager which I knew would be difficult to let go of. I started this new role, and within the first week, I experienced awful and passive-aggressive behaviour from a co-worker who is on the same par as me in terms of title and experience. He would deliberately raise his voice so everyone could hear to point out mistakes or something wrong I did (which is natural in your first week). This was on my third day! I would get eye rolls and huffs and puffs if I asked valid questions. By the end of the first week, I started to question my decision and had a chat with my manager about the behaviour. He was very positive in his response and said he would speak to the co-worker. I was quite disappointed to have experienced this in my first week but decided to stay to give the place the benefit of the doubt. While the behaviour has improved I feel there is a sense of jealousy and competition from co-workers in the team. I've been deliberately cut out of workstreams and meetings, and it feels like a high school environment and feeling like this is hindering my development. Yesterday, said co-worker was going on an extended break for a month and deliberately cut me out of his handover email, which he sent to the entire team except for me, despite the fact that I would be covering aspects of his work while he was away. I was really disappointed by this and sent an email to him with my manager in cc asking him why I wasn't cc'd into his handover email despite the fact that I would be covering some of his work. He sent a very snarky response telling me that I am in cc in all his workstreams so I should just trawl through email chains to glean the status on matters and that he had already tried to explain these to me before. He was trying to imply that I didn't understand the workstreams, so there was no point in cc'ing me, which was uncalled for and I really didn't appreciate it. I also have never experienced being deliberately cut out of a handover email as usually this is sent to everyone in the team. My manager called me into a meeting with HR today reprimanding me for the fact that I shouldn't have sent an email in the first place questioning said co-worker about why I wasn't cc'd in his handover email. I am quite shocked by this as I sent a very polite email requesting the handover list and received a snarky and rude response which was defended by the manager. I stood up for myself in the meeting and questioned the motive as to why I wasn't cc'd in the first place and that I was being deliberately cut from communications and told that I don't deserve a handover email but that I should look through emails if I wanted to glean status on matters. Unfortunately, my manager wasn't showing me much support despite the fact that I wasn't in the wrong. He said that I should have spoken to him face-to-face about the issue rather than initiating a chain of petty emails! I am not sure what to make of this. Am I in the wrong here? I feel like my manager didn't like the fact that I called out bad behaviour in my first week, and now I've been dragged into a meeting with HR, basically reprimanding for something as basic as asking to be sent an email handover list. My manager admitted the said co-worker was wrong for not cc'ing me but that I shouldn't have sent an email in the first place as I have now caused a chain of back-and-forth emails. I've only been at this workplace for a month and so I feel really let down by the whole experience. I've never had this in any workplace I've been in, and it feels like I don't have much support from my manager either, as bad behaviour is being excused and now I am being blamed for sending a simple email. I am not sure what to make of this. I have a really important exam coming up in a month so I could qualify in a higher position. Should I leave this job and focus on my exam until I find another job or stay at this job and look for somewhere else? I am just concerned that they're setting up a story against me to use as the support seems minimal at this point.

I never followed any of them on social (Insta) to respect that boundary. I have followed others in the office (peers and people at my DRs’ level). To be honest I didn’t want/expect to become friends with them outside of work but it has honestly made our team stronger.

They’ve all worked here a year or two now. It’s a very social workplace and I know all of my DRs follow each other. I’ve also noticed most other managers follow their DRs and vice versa.

It would be nice to follow these people I care about, but I don’t want it to be weird.

I’m torn between this, on the one hand you’ve worked hard and earned your medals, shine, polish and show them off! 

The other is it a passive brag that could be seen as a negative ? 

Personally I get really impressed when I suddenly uncover a persons achievements without them mentioning it. For example seeing a phd listed on LinkedIn that they never mentioned. 

Interesting thought if they did add for example their phd to their email sig, would this have helped their career or opportunities when sending out communications across departments or different levels of a business?

18p38y9,My aspirations are making me want to move constantly,"Context / stats 

Location: Uk
Education: BSc, MSc & MBA 
Experience / currently role: grad ops manager 

Small disc of role: manage 90+, 4 departments, production company. 

I 100% love what I do, I’ve been in my role for the past year and I’m itching to gain a real leadership role (ie director) not just simply a manager. 

My current senior leaders have been in their role for years and I see failures from them daily.  My current place of work values time spent in the org from what I have learned (non of the directors have a formal education - apart from the ceo) 

The issue I have is that I’ve obliterated my objectives this year (in a good way). But as I speak to the other managers it seems year on year salary doesn’t get significantly rewarded nor promotion. - to put it into context another manager only recently got promoted to senior manager (not director) after 7 years….. this might be situational of course. 

I don’t think my aspirations will let me complete another year without a promotion. Is it really wise to jump ship? Or given the ageing senior leadership team, would it be wise to stay and weather the storm? 

I understand part of this may seem silly, here’s a person who’s been in the company for 1 year and wants to take on a director role. To be specific the current leadership team have serious failures that seem to go under the radar - I assume anyway, surely if the ceo knew heads would roll. 

I guess to further add to my question in a more sensible way if I was to stay - how would a low level manager like myself highlight my skills to the CEO, and almost proposition myself ready to be “groomed” into the “backup” once one of the leadership team drops out ? The ceo would be 4 levels above myself so communication isn’t something that would happen naturally (ie meetings with me or dept walk around - he tends to be static in his office)",MrChewio,1,1.0,0,1703328751,2023-12-23 10:52:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18p38y9/my_aspirations_are_making_me_want_to_move/,12,2023

18p21vn,Software Engineering(Tech) vs Medical School vs Dental School vs Law School ?,"Out of these 4 options, What will set you up with the best future? Financially, stability-wise, job satisfaction, life-style, work-life balance?  
From my understanding they all have some awesome pros and rough cons. Currently going through life crisis. Seeking guidance.  
Software Engineering:  
Pros:  
\-Potential to work from home  
\-AVG Salary: $136,288+/ Depending on Location  
\-Considered pretty relaxing / Not High Stress  
\-Typical work week: 40 hours - Great work life balance.  
\-No additional education necessary  
Cons:  
\-Random Unexpected Layoffs at any given time. Leads to inconsistency. Many people get laid off and end up job hunting for months or even years. I've heard people lose their job and be forced to drive Uber, work retail, or take massive pay cuts.  
\-Oversaturated job market. Too many people want to be software engineers, with bootcamps, computer science grads, and self taught developers, leading to thousands of people fighting for 1 job.  
\-Ageism. Many people struggle as they get older working in tech. Unless you move into management-which isn't always easy- you can essentially be replaced with a younger recent college graduate who will work for cheaper.  
\-I've heard AI/automation can have a severe impact on the industry in the future.  
Medical School:  
Pros:  
\-Arguably the most stable job in the world. You can move to any area in the country and have a lucrative job waiting for you that will pay at least 200k-250k.  
\-Recession Proof. You'll never get laid off and you won't ever worry about money again.  
\-Depending on your specialty, you can work anywhere from 40-80 hours/week, whether your a General Practitioner or a NeuroSurgeon.  
\-Not a boring desk job. Ability to go to work and save someone's life.  
\-No ageism. Physicians work their whole lives.  
\-AVG Salary: 265k+ / Depending on specialty and location. Higher if you own practice.  
Cons:  
\-7+ years of grueling school/training, Ruthless exams, sleep deprivation, etc.  
\-Hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans. Usually easy to pay back due to high salary.  
\-High Stress environment. Dealing with life or death situations, possibility for lawsuits, etc.  
\-Possibility for a toxic work environment. Many doctors are unhappy.  
\-Some specialties come with long grueling hours.  
\-3+ years of residency, where your being paid 50k-60k for 80+ hour work weeks.  
Dental School:  
Pros:  
\-Just like being a doctor, Arguably the most stable job in the world. You can move to any area in the country and have a lucrative job waiting for you that will pay at least 200k-250k.  
\-Unlike medicine, No residency. Able to work as a general dentist after 4 years. If you decide to specialize and do residency, you will earn a much higher salary.  
\-Normal for dentists to work 3-4 days/week.  
\-Great for business-minded, entrepreneurial people. Opening a practice can be very very lucrative.  
\-No ageism. Dentists work their whole lives.  
\-AVG Salary: 217k+ / Depending on specialty and location. Higher if you own practice.  
Cons:  
\-4 years of grueling school/training, Ruthless exams, sleep deprivation, etc.  
\-Hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans. Usually easy to pay back due to high salary.  
\-Medium Stress environment. Not as stressful as being a doctor, but certainly not easy. Possibility for lawsuits, unhappy patients, etc.  
Law School:  
Pros:  
\-Owning a practice can be very lucrative.  
\-Your helping people on a regular basis. You can save someone's life, and or get them out of terrible situations.  
\-AVG Salary: 127,990+ / Possibility to earn more if you make parter/ work in big law /own you own practice(can also earn less).  
\-No ageism. Lawyers work their whole lives.  
Cons:  
\-3 years in school.  
\-Not a great job market. Not very stable.  
\-High stress environment. Your job is to deal with other people's problems.  
\-Possibility for a toxic work environment. Many lawyers are unhappy.  
\-Most lawyers work many many hours, and are many are not very well paid.  
\-Bimodal Salary. Many lawyers make between 40k-100k per year, while the top lawyers make 500k-Millions per year.  
\-The lucrative salaries are in Big-Law. Which usually requires you to attend a top 14 school, and to have very high grades. These jobs have a salary range from 200k+ but typically come with 60-80 hour work weeks, forever.  
\-High Student loans. Difficult to pay back unless you land a big-law job.  
\-Very political. Who you know as a lawyer can be detrimental for your career.  
\-Hypercompetitive- Everybody is competition, and there are lawyers everywhere. if you decide to go solo and don't get cases, you won't make any money.  
\-Every state has it's own bar exam, so your pretty locked down in the state you want to practice. Moving would require studying the new state's laws and passing their bar exam.  
Everyone always says, ""Do what you see urself doing most"". To be honest, they are all just a job to me, and I get my satisfaction in life outside of work.

I've applied to tech support roles, customer service roles, sales roles, inside sales roles, customer success roles. Don't get any call or email back, it feels hopeless.

The city I moved to when I was 18 is fast-growing and thrives off of the service industry and currently I am in a restaurant where I have the ability to make quite a lot of money. But if you are in the industry you would know all of the cons of working as a server. No benefits, no consistency, social battery depleted. I struggle with pretty bad anxiety too which makes it impossible to work this job sometimes (i will literally call out if it’s bad enough). I also don’t have very good money management skills already and with the sporadic and inconsistent income I only feel more lost. Before covid my plans were to grow my brand as a makeup artist. I even paid for schooling in tv and film makeup artistry to have more credibility in my craft. Since the pandemic I have given up that path due to feeling overwhelmed by the logistics of it all which in turn turned me away from that passion of mine (and haven’t felt a spark for anything since).

18ov7a7,Take new offer or stay in current job?,"
Had a recruiter reach out to me for a new role and I always entertain them since it never hurts to see what’s out there. The new offer seems nice but not sure if it’s quite worth it?

Currently : Sr Analyst 
Salary 81.4k. Bonus is 6-12% but usually 6-8% 
401k Match is 75% of 8% of my salary 
PTO 25 days 
Fully Remote. 
I’ve been with this company for 6 years since college and it’s pretty cushy. Boss is chill and I work 20hrs a week. I can probably internally apply to a similar role as the new job in 6 months and stay fully remote but the raise will probably only be 10-15%. This is a large Fortune 500 company and is stable. 

New Offer : Principal
Salary 100k bonus is 5-15% 
Match is 50% of 6% of my salary 
PTO is 15 days 
Hybrid 2-3 days in office. A 40 min commute. 
It’s a smaller firm with a smaller team working under a C level officer. I feel like I can learn and grow a lot but it will def be more work. Less flexible time in order to meet market hours. They also want me to obtain two new licenses within 6 months but will give me a 5k salary increase. I’m afraid of taking this role only to work 50 hour weeks for a not so great raise. This firm is smaller and has a new CEO and has rebranded in the last year due to what they say significant growth. 

When I compare the total comp the difference doesn’t feel to crazy since I really value the wlb of wfh and my PTO. But I’m 30 and this could be a good way to increase my skills.

18opdl7,Interview/Offer strategy—looking for feedback.,"I'm getting into the late stages interviewing of a Pre-IPO tech startup. IF there is an offer, I'm still on the fence. It's 20% more money per year, plus; 401k, benefits, 20 days PTO, potential bonuses (but they seem hard to attain), and 100% remote work. 

I'm on the fence because I currently control my schedule and have flexibility for my family. But I'm a 1099 contractor and there's a certain kind of pressure that comes with it.  

I left my previous job because I was working more hours than I wanted and I was burning out. The (in-house) recruiter is promising me a pie-in-the-sky schedule but Glassdoor reviews say otherwise. So, I think the truth is somewhere in the middle. 

Is it possible to make a counter offer with an employment contract that I write (or my lawyer) that stipulates my hours and availability? I'm not worried if that's accepted or not. I'm also going to ask for stock options, which they haven't brought up yet. Frankly, I don't care if this makes them pull the offer. I'm just trying to have best of both worlds.

I was really excited because it was going to be 4 interviews but it was a company I dreamed of working for - not only that but I had a referral and my referral was speaking internally to the teams encouraging my candidacy!

This was amazing for me but after I got to my 3rd interview - they decided I was overqualified for the role and asked if I could interview for another position. At this point I had another offer on the table and needed to make a decision fast. I let go of my offer to keep pursuing this dream company.

Well, I received the call today that although I was a great candidate - I was in between the two roles in terms of experience and they just need someone qualified for the position. This hurt but my recruiter said after the holidays they will get me into another interview for a similar position just a different section.

For context - I work in digital marketing and advertising. (If this helps at all)

The first role was entry level while the second position was more experienced. I’m 3-4 years into my career so they weren’t wrong to think I’m in between.

I have no other choice but to wait til after the holidays to see how the next round of interviews will go. The recruiter said I would have 1 or 2 more interviews max and I just feel really fatigued. I want to continue and I’m going to do it. But what more can I do?

The recruiter said the hiring manager was on my team - up until I guess they found someone with more experience. The other team members I interviewed with loved me and my recruiter is really trying to get me in..

But does anyone have experience interviewing for 3 different positions for one company? Moving in between teams and just trucking through? I want to keep a healthy level of positive energy but realistic expectations but it’s so hard with this process..

I’m still applying to roles but the market is so rough right now. And with all the layoffs - I feel I’m against people with years over me.",MonMiow,2,0.75,0,1703279531,2023-12-22 21:12:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18op2fi/recruiter_keeps_having_me_interview_for_different/,12,2023
18ookh3,Did I mess up trying to negotiate?,"There’s this job that I really wanted. Despite it being an entry level position I have more than the listed experience and the listing said $22-$24 an hour. They offered $23, and I asked for $24. The recruiter said she’d ask, so I guess $23 wasn’t firm. It’s only a dollar difference and if she had said $23 was firm I would have just taken it. I figured it was worth a shot though.

At my last job I didn’t negotiate at all and discovered new hires with less experience were paid more, and google has convinced me most people negotiate to some degree.

18oo2he,Is it possible for me to continue working/living with my chronic illness?,"I appreciate any and all advice from my question. Sorry if this post is a bit long, but I'll try to keep it as brief as possible.

  
  
I am a 25 year old male and for the past 5 years I have been working as a voice actor. I have a decade of experience with various digital media fields such as camera operation, video editing, audio editing, photo editing, video production, and most of all... voice over. I started my first ""real job"" at 15 years old and worked as a editing assistant and camera hand for a small video production company. As soon as I turned 16 I got a cheap car and began my own business. I was hooked on the industry and started off as a wedding/portrait photographer. I wasn't great and overtime I started honing my skills more into the video aspects of my field and transitioned to working in video editing and producing small video productions, mostly music videos. I had always been fond of voice over and was excited to implement it into my work when I had the opportunity but it wasn't until around covid that I phased out all of my work to solely pursue voice over. I had been doing it mostly part time for a couple years along with the video work until then.

  
  
To backtrack a little, during all this time being self employed I never was able to work just one job. I was a real estate agent for 4 years, did landscaping, doordash, whatever was needed to make ends meet in hopes of being able to provide for myself solely off what I enjoy doing one day. Throughout my life I have always struggled chronic pain. It wasn't until a few years ago that the pain was becoming debilitating and I started really seeing specialists to work on getting a grasp on my situation. It's a bit too convoluted and long winded to explain fully here, but to put it simply, there is something wrong with my nerves. Any contact with heat or water like a shower, sweat or the rain makes my body feel as if it were set on fire. It also happens right as I wake up and go to bed. It's agony and I've been working with many many specialist for a while now, all with no answers. We mostly treat my symptoms just to keep me able to exist day to day. With medication I'm able to not be in constant pain all day, but I have to take things slow and avoid stimulants such as the water or high temperatures. On top of this I was also recently diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. Something that, while looking back, always made school very difficult for me.

  
  
Voice over has treated me well, but I still was never able to achieve a level of success in the industry where I could support myself full time with it. Up until last month I had a work from home gig soldering small electrical parts for a lighting company but was laid off in December due to budgeting. I'm also an author and love to write creatively but have yet to pursue that industry fully as I know the amount of work needed to succeed and fear I don't have the time or resources at the moment. On top of all of this I also make YouTube content on the weekends. I am experienced and familiar with editing and producing videos and have a nice small community of around 1k people and average 2k views per video, occasionally hitting 50k-60k. As of now it's mostly a hobby but if it ever pops off, then I'm happy to devote more time to it.

  
  
The dilemma I'm at now. My condition is slowly getting a bit worse and making it harder for me to get around and be as physically active as I'd like. I'm not eligible for disability because I'm not technically diagnosed with anything. Even if I was, I would still want to work. Voice over was expanding well for me until the AI voicing hit my sector extremely hard this year. I've lost a lot of my clients due to working primarily with overseas studios who prioritize the dirt cheap prices and versatility of AI. I can't blame them to some degree but it does suck. I'm becoming more and more tired and feel like after a decade of working for myself, trying to maintain a job and run businesses, I may be nearing the end of my rope.

  
  
I have a lot of work experience with voice over and audio editing and would love to find work that allows me to continue pursuing what I'm best at, but I know that may be a bit of a pipe dream. Im a hard worker and don't mind going to a job if it comes down to that, but my health and body definitely thrive best when I'm able to be completely remote and somewhat on a self decided schedule. Obviously that's like searching for ice in hell, but I at least figured I'd mention it. I have no formal schooling after high school, aside from real estate school, as I went straight into the work force. I don't have ""job"" experience to put on a resume as I've been self employed in a variety of seemingly broad work for the past decade.

  
  
Are there any reliable paying jobs that you would recommend someone with my skillset and life situation to look into? I have a complete, broadcast quality home studio, and I work well with audio, creative writing, and all forms of editing. Finding consistent work is just becoming to difficult for me and I think I may be ready to throw in the towel and reside to working under someone else.

18omxq7,Found out I was almost fired earlier this year. Completely blindsided. Is my career at this company over?,"Found out during performance review I was almost fired earlier this year. Totally blindsided

I had a really toxic boss earlier this year who had fired someone before. When I got assigned under her, I was optimistic if I worked hard, it would all work out. She micro managed everything, grasped at anything to complain about my work and what my new boss told me, was building a case to get me fired. To quote him, ""I was at deaths door"". It was not just her. Her boss was in it with her preparing to get me fired and involved his boss. So this was in very advanced stages!

Now I'm disturbed because I completely did not see that. My previous performance review was above average. She had negative feedback but nothing dramatic that would warrant a dismissal after 5 years in the company.

It seems her boss reassigned me under another manager who the boss trusts more and I recovered. The problem is now I'm unable to work properly and second guess everything. Am I doing good work? Am I on chopping block again? How can you do your best when they might be unhappy again and not telling you anything? The trust is gone. I'd have expected a PIP or at least a formal meeting telling me work isn't up to par. But it seems my management operates differently. They just don't tell you. 

Has this ever happened to you and how did you deal with it? Is my career here over since I have probably a draft dismissal on my file? I'm weighing options if I should actively look to jump ship.",whyamiherewhatawaste,1,1.0,158,1703273517,2023-12-22 19:31:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18omxq7/found_out_i_was_almost_fired_earlier_this_year/,12,2023

18olji4,Would you sign a non-compete?,"I survived several rounds of layoffs at my current company and after the most recent round, I realized that my role is no longer what I initially signed up for. My current manager also seems to be making decisions on my role (and team) with minimal to no input from me. I've attempted to communicate with her, but I have not been able to speak her language yet, because the things she's asking me to do are not aligned with my strengths/experience. Thankfully, we have a good working relationship, and I'm thinking I just need to work extra hard on my communication. 

With that said, because of the uncertainties, I decided to casually submit applications, and very recently received an offer. **But** there's a non-compete clause. It's with a startup with lots of funding. The base pay is 6% higher than my current role, the benefits are not as great as my current company's, and they don't offer a 401K match (yet, but was told there are plans to put this in place in the next year or so). The non-compete is pretty much saying I can't work in my current domain for 12 months after separation. With that said, I'm currently in a manager/director role, and this offer is for an independent contributor, which I don't mind at all. I'm actually look forward to taking a break from politics and people management, and focusing on hands-onwork. 

The non-compete is really sticking out as a sore thumb. 

I'm thinking of the following options:

* Decline and use the offer to negotiate role and compensation in my current company
* Decline and use the offer to negotiate with the 2nd company I'm interviewing with (my recruiter indicates I could get an offer after the next interview scheduled next week).
* Decline and wait for a better opportunity. 

I'd love to get your thoughts/feedback.

18olhc7,What career can I choose?(please read the description),"Have y’all watched stuff which makes u want to do that? Well I really want to get into a field like a crime scene investigator or a criminalist. You know stuff which involves an adrenaline rush type of thing. Like with guns n stuff which I’m interested in. I’ve wanted to have a job which you’d see in the show NCIS/CIS. ’m already halfway through my A level course and I realised I messed up with my subject options. 

I need atleast biology or chemistry in alevels to major in forensic science to get into a university and then those fields. I had biology in GCSE and got a B in it, but for my alevels I’d chosen English literature, psychology and business studies( the subject options were limited, and by then I had wanted to do criminology). 

Now that I digged further deep into criminology I kinda don’t like how much it focuses on the social context if Ykwim. 

I really want those fields but ik I messed up pretty bad. Is there any way I could become a crime scene investigator/criminalist with another degree other than forensic sciencej. 

Or maybe I should opt for criminal psychology/forensic Psychology because after all I have Psychology in alevels.

Oh and I’d really appreciate if you’d tell me which degree from criminal psychology or forensic psychology involves interrogating criminals more?

18ol513,Coworker handing me his work,"A coworker of mine seems to have begun trying to give me work that I was asked to hand to him as his responsibility.

I know for a fact he doesn't have any work other than the few tasks I was asked to assign to him. I'm not happy with the fact that my manager expected me to give work to someone who's in an equal role, but let's ignore the manager's limp wristed, poor management style for now.

At the beginning, I was willing to help my coworker with a few tasks but immediately got the impression that he either lied about his work history or lied about graduating college, because he performs and asks questions more like an intern than a seasoned professional.

Lately, he's come up with excuses and reasons for why he can't complete a 10 minute task and asks me to handle it. The first time I said I'm too busy, I'll try to get to it, and he took it back. Mind you, this is a task that I also did and know how to do, and back when I inherited the task, it took much longer. The excuse for why he couldn't perform the work is the exact same situation I was in, and I still got it done - when it took two hours and not ten minutes.

The second time, he asked me in a public email during my time off to do a task for him at the very last second, and used a system outage as an excuse for why he couldn't perform the task - a task that does not require the system he claimed he couldn't access. He might need one component of the system to finish something, but he didn't ask me via chat or anything to run that one thing - he tried to dump the entire exercise onto me when I know for a fact he has nothing else to be doing.

The tasks he's trying to get me to do are literally ten minutes. What would you all do in this situation?

I don't want to seem like a mean girl who doesn't want to be a team player, but this isn't someone asking for tag in for help. I know he's doing nothing all day, is pretending to be busy, and trying to make me do stuff he doesn't want to do. I also seriously doubt this person's competence or ability for the job, and I already know from a few conversations he has a severely overinflated ego which leads him to being willing to act confident when he really shouldn't be. 

I suspect this person already shit-tested me twice with some small level tasks which I did for them while under the guise of training them. I regret it, but I was trying to be helpful because they were new. Now I get the feeling he thinks he's above me (and other conversations suggest, as I mention, a massively inflated ego), and he thinks he's above the more repetitive work we all have to roll up our sleeves and do. 

How do I make him stop trying to dump things on me the second something is remotely inconvenient for him? How do I maintain my boundaries without looking like the person on the team who doesn't want to help? 

From my perspective of this person's workload, it isn't reasonable for them to ask me to do ten minute tasks simply because they encounter a mild inconvenience. When I was doing the exact same tasks, I never in a million years would have even considered asking someone else to do them. It's ten minutes of effort. The public email situation seems like he's getting more bold with trying to throw me under the bus or make me look bad or assign work publicly as if he's above me. Any advice appreciated.

18ohit7,Doubts about continuing university,"So, the thing is pretty simple. I study Physics, and to be honest I have not been doing as well as I would like to. The main problem is not the learning, but the exams. These are not hard per se, but I always find a way to screw up and do things wrong, ex: do things way too fast and have anxiety and pressure to pass to not let me check before handing over the exam. I know that I should work on these problems, but I'm in a position where it's now or never.

I have some definitory exams in February that will decide whether I can do the next courses or if I have to do them again (which I have done twice already) and I can't think to believe that perhaps either college or physics is not for me. On the first one, I kinda have a history of problems with the current educational system, but also I know that I'm no genius either, so I'm doubting whether to quit college but keep attending classes while I can (I can do this in Argentina) and the rest of the time to work or to just keep going at it like now (and find some work as well). That is: **to do college and work or just work (and college informally)**.

I know that this latter plan would not allow me to do anything in academia, but I am not even sure I want to do so. At most, I'm interested in positions in R&D in the private sector, but when it comes to academia, I would rather try things alone (that is, work alone).

I need you, people, since you are emotionally separated from this situation, to help me think about all the pros and cons, possible futures, etc, if I go down that road. I'm young and I aspire to take more risks in my life, but I must know if this one is a worthwhile risk to take. The only thing I care about the most is to have the knowledge to be able to understand the world and, if I can, use it for some good.

Hey guys. My supervisor encouraged me to apply for a better position, so I did. A few weeks went by and I didn’t hear a single thing, didn’t get an interview or anything. I saw him yesterday and he informed me that he didn’t hire anyone for this position and he reposted the posting. Should I send him a follow up email just asking for him to re-review my resume and cover letter (I updated them) or is it best to just accept the fact that I won’t be getting a call? I really have no idea what to do here. Any help is appreciated. I can’t reapply online as it says I was already disqualified from the position, which is why I’m considering asking him outright to take another look. Also, I’m really not qualified for this position, but I’m a good employee and several people have told me the supervisor really likes me.

18ofq69,Leaving the job I enjoy for another with higher salary?,"I like the work I do, and there's endless things to learn. Some of my coworkers REALLY annoy me though, and I know I can get higher pay. My company unfortunately doesn't have room for higher salary unless I higher my education and take on more responsibilities. I already work 60 hours a week so it seems as though I'm gonna be stuck where I am. Upside is it's very large so I will likely never be fired, just ""moved"". 


The other company I just applied to is much smaller, says they could offer me up to 30k above my current salary (I know a lot of people there already) and the benefits are generally the same. I've done the work before and it was enjoyable, though not nearly as challenging. They also offer raises every year based on time in the company rather than additional responsibilities. I would work about 50-60 hrs a week here, so not much different. This company has been wanting to hire me for a year, and finally there is an opening. I'm not sure if that's a good sign that they care about their people?

18od9ab,Sales: can’t decide between a management position and an individual contributor role,"I (26M) have 2 offers on the table and am having a very hard time deciding what the right move is for me.

I am currently working as an Account Executive (AE) at a large tech consultancy; I’ve been at the same company for 3 years, the first 2 years I spent in Client Success before moving to Sales in my current role. Within my first full year as AE, I am already one of the global top performer’s and have reached our “President’s Club” for overachieving.

I am taking out a mortgage starting early 2024, and my current base salary (£45k) is a bit too low for my monthly repayments should I not close a deal in a specific month (commission is payed oit monthly).

I now have 2 offers on the table.

Offer 1: Sales Manager at my current company 

- offering £65k base salary + commission structure TBD
- managing team of 4-5 associates 

Offer 2: Senior Account Executive at Saas Startup

- offering £75k base salary + uncapped commission (10% on every deal I close, deal sizes vary £20k - £150k)

On one hand, the Saas startup seems exciting and fresh but comes with a lot of risk as startups can fail easily.

The role as sales manager seems a bit less exciting, but it’s in the company I’m familiar with as I’ve been there for 3 years, and I think the narrative of being promoted to a management position only a bit over a year into my Account Executive role is a nice narrative and might open more doors for future opportunities.

My manager is aware of my situation and obviously biased, but I’m also good friends with him. He’s strongly advising me to take the management position as with a mortgage I need the stability, and that Saas Startups come and go, so if I don’t accept this external offer, I can always find a different company later down the road that will probably offer even more money once I have management under my belt at a well respected company like my current one.

Frankly, my goal is to have a long success career that will make me as financially successful over the long term.

18od8nh,"I used to love my job, but after work environment is getting toxic I’m not sure if I should quit for my own health?","TLDR at the bottom

I (20F) started working here in April 2023, I’m the only woman working here if it matters. It’s a very small restaurant and from April to now we have retained 7 workers with the 3 managers, and 1 owner. When I first joined, they kept hiring 2-3 people a month who kept quitting very quick.

Our retention rate is kind of poor and I’m starting to realize why people have ghosted the job, no call no showed, and never came back. I also have a 2nd part time job 25 hours a week as an office receptionist, so if I quit I already have a back up.

Earlier this month I took a blow to the head and back from extracurricular activities at college. I provided medical records to my work. I let them know I can work since leaving urgent care they prescribed me medication, but I was advised to be careful and take it slow at work. Yesterday I got called in and they knew fully well that I wasn’t feeling good, their scheduled guy was at the hospital too for dehydration and vomiting. 

They said I had a team obligation, I was able to work but let them know again and with medical records that I wasn’t going to be feeling well. They promised me they wouldn’t ask me to do much etc, well I ended up being the main server and it didn’t help at all that they kept throwing tasks on me, overwhelming me, not helping me, yelling at me, and berating me for not moving faster. Worked 10:30 am to 8:45 pm to cover the guy’s shift. After much reconsideration and a long day, I decided I would let my boss know I’d work til early January any availability, but would either go full time at my office receptionist job, or find another part time one. 

TLDR: Has a bad shift yesterday where I was treated poorly, I am reconsidering going full time at my other job or finding another one. Gave boss a 1 month notice. My boss is now panicking, stating how I was one of the best and only employee they have had, good attendance and work ethic, etc. He doesn’t want me to quit. 

This restaurant has been opened for 3 years and he states has never employed any women, so blames his staff’s poor attitude on the fact they never worked with a girl before. I find this as a poor excuse, but I think after working in the food industry for 3 years I am burned out.

Long story short, not sure if I should quit my job because of a toxic work environment?

18ocukj,I'm lost and can't seem to get past a mental block I've been having for the past couple months,"For context, I'm 24 years old with almost two years of experience working in a recruitment agency. After graduating from university, I thought that getting into a recruitment agency would be a good way for me to jumpstart my career in HR, but felt later on that was not something I should have done. Where I worked, all I did was make job advertisements and call up candidates in the pre-screening stage, but never had the opportunity to participate in any interviews with the client and candidate. I was losing motivation to continue working with the agency so I started looking elsewhere but got fired (due to poor performance) before I could land another job.

I know how difficult it is in the current job market, especially since I work in the Middle East, to find the job you want.

18ob57r,Need help on a complicated work relationship with my manager,"Hello everyone,

I started a new job 3 months back in a small, quiet company. I’m currently in my late 20s, so still in the earlier side of my career. It’s a rather aggressive work environment where they rarely hire people early in their career and I’m among the 2 fortunate enough to get hired. Despite being in a rather small, quiet company where people have their own obvious cliques, I’m fortunate enough to fit myself with most of my colleagues and have gotten invited to quite a few personal/family events outside of work. I’d like to think my personality fits extremely well in this small company.

However, I have one big problem. My manager hasn’t taught me anything in the company so far. I tried to ask him questions, send him emails, or go to his desk to learn how to perform my tasks. Often times, it’s just a result of me either getting ghosted (emails) or telling me that it’s a difficult task that I should learn for myself to truly make it mine. He said that’s the work ethic he himself followed. 

I changed my plans and have been seeking help from other colleagues in my team to get by tasks I never learned. It’s not often, so they teach me nicely and I get them lunch here and there to thank them. As a side effect, this behavior kind of also gave an impression to my colleagues that my manager hasn’t been training me or giving me useful tasks. They asked why (which I shouldn’t have answered) and I told them why. I am not the type of person to talk of anyone in a negative, personal level, but I did say I don’t have enough knowledge and manager rarely responds for my help. 

My manager invited me to a walk (which we planned),and in mid conversation, asked if I had any concerns or honest complaints. I didn’t say much. He then proceeded to say that he hasn’t paid much attention to me and wanted to say nothing was personal. That’s how he learned and grew. He then said he’d change his way of managing if it makes me uncomfortable (all of sudden?)I’m still not 100% sure if someone ratted me out or if he just genuinely wanted to check up with me since it’s been awhile. Regardless, I’m just worried since from my experience words get twisted when they get transferred from one employee to another. I’m a brutally honest person and while I won’t put someone down to hurt them, I would not sugar coat facts to make situations look better than they are.

My questions are, do you think my colleagues ratted me out? What are your thoughts on my choices of action here? If you were a bystander situation, would you have done things differently?

TLDR: didn’t  learn anything so far at new company, told coworkers about my work relationship with my manager.

18oaaj0,PM - How can I make the switch?,"Currently an 3rd year analyst at a top tier investment bank (in sales/trading, not traditional IB). I want to make the switch to PM preferrably in tech. I personally think the process of building and launching products is a much more exciting role vs printing trade after trade and you're done for the day.

Obviously the hurdle is the lack of technical background (undergrad degree in business/finance) and my work exp isnt the most relevant either. So one option is to get a masters in business analytics now to fill this gap.

Second option is possibly trying to get a PM related role in my bank, gain some experience there, and get an MBA thereafter to pivot into tech PM. It's a safer option than getting a masters now, but I don't know if an MBA would help me gain the technical expertise required to be a tech PM. And by that time I think I'd be too old to get a masters in business analytics.

18o81xh,Seeking process engineering work with no experrience. Will working as a technician help,"  
<Duped on r/askHR because I am a noob.>

I was trying to get my PhD in 2019 and made some plans to out of it in 2021. Due to unforeseen events, that did not happen. I lingered in the program because there was nothing else for me to do and I eventually took a job with an auto lender for a year before getting canned.  
  
I have been out of work five months and do not have experience in an engineering role. I have a bachelor's in mechanical, but it's almost a decade out of date, and a master's in biosystems engineering, which frankly does not match many job descriptions. I have recently changed it to biochemical just to better reflect what I do and hopefully tag for chemical engineering jobs (is this even advisable?).  
  
I have a family (likely why I did not finish my PhD, but I made the right choice) and I do not care about moving up any ladder or retirement, I just want to make enough to get out of debt and leave my children some money. The only thing keeping me focused on engineering is just the comfort that the time was not wasted. Maybe it was, however.  
  
Before I commit to working as a technician, I want to know some things.  
  
Will applying to the technician and the engineering role at the same company hurt my prospects?  
  
Considering the widespread data sharing from ATS and the like, would applying to any technician role negatively impact my scores (may even have already affected me)?  
  
Would any experience as a technician count towards experience in a ""manufacturing environment"" for some engineering positions?  
  
Would any experience in another field lead some to think I was not interested in engineering?  
  
If the questions are negative, I will close the engineering chapter of my life and move onto other things. I just need a better idea of how I look on paper to HR reps.  
  
Trust me, mistakes were made and definitely by me. I just need some help figuring out if there's a way out.

18o5wq2,Am I falling for the carrot?,"Bear with me it's a long story...
I've been with this company for 7yrs and have loved it up to about year 5. I came up through the ranks always learning and striving for more skills and knowledge. And have always seen ample encouragement even being pushed by my supervisors. I was the employee whose performance stood out so much division leaders noticed and suggested higher roles and talent development. 
That brings me to year 5. I took on the GM position after a lackluster training period. Unfortunately I (and no one else it seems) was aware the training wasnt up to par until I was in role and struggling. My biggest frustration wasnt with the near constant critique, but in the fact that it was always vague and even if a asked more pointed questions I never got more useful feedback. 
I did what I've always done and searched out advice and training to help supplement the training and help me succeed. Except I was scolded by my immediate supervisor for not ""being on the floor"" and was never offered any support even when I was pulling 18 hr shifts sometimes 5-6 in a row and rolling work weeks of up to 48 days. 
After two bad storms where I was forced to drive in dangerous conditions to get to.store when we knew the power was out, I was forced to admit that my inexperience wasnt the main issue, but my supervisor. So I applied for amd was granted a transfer. This change dmy supervisor and saw a much improved performance and a learned a lot in a short amount of time. Well lucky me, due to restructuring I got the original supervisor back.
With better training and better base to work off of I was able to succeed despite the change and began to love my job again and quickly became a top store in every Metric (not exaggerated, I mean every). Yet a few months ago there were some higher level turnover due to some of our leaders transferring to another division and we got new leadership who changed up the direction and priorities, even some policies. And I am finding out about them by tripping over every stone. I get irregular visits from my supervisor and when they do happen they're short and usually good if shallow feedback. 
Well last night the company president showed up for a surprise visit and apparently a few we we running the store the complete opposite of what they wanted us to prioritize. And since priority one wasnt perfect it didn't matter that the store over all looked great because we had ruined it by falling short on this one thing. And even then the feedback was vague and when walking the store the supervisor was just trying to get me to blame one of my subordinate managers. I kept deflecting, but  I was blindsided. 
He straight told me I was the worst store in the whole division over this one issue. Spoke to me like I was fresh faced kid just learning not an experienced, high trained, and high metric manager. I had an interview for another role scheduled and it was cancelled over this visit. I've been past over thrice now for other positions, I feel like I'm always getting the direction and expectations aftwr I've failed to ""guess them"" and instead of anyone focusing on the 98 wins they focus and exxagerate the 2 fails, and then when I try to speak about it anyone I'm flat told all other stores managers have the same struggles. 
I've loved this job and the pay/benefits are great, but I feel as though Im wasting my soul on a job that will never be anything. I was told that they want to work with and develop me to be ready to ""next in line"", but at this point it just feels like a line. 
I'm not sure if I should try and endure beyond this supervisor as their close to retirement, bring up the issues to higher MGMT, or just start looking for new jobs. I nearly rage quit today and barely fought back tears all day. And now my leads are aware of this since the supervisor made it no secret and are furious on my behalf and I've got nearly half the team threatening to quit over it and I don't know how to deescalate it. And a part of me doesn't want to.

18o5t6q,I need you!,"Is there anyone who feels stress all the time? Is there anyone who knows that taking stress won't help, but it will make one wary about things and make you start doing things someday if not today? I don't know how my brain functions, but I feel like I'm an energy person who acts according to the vibe around me. If someone achieves something, that will hit me, motivate me, and I'll start on it. But lately, I've been procrastinating a lot. Maybe it's already developed into a habit now, as I'm not working at the right pace for whatever I've been doing for the past 1-2 years.  
I have all the motivational things in me; I know all the consequences; I know what happens next, but I never seem to be serious about my work anymore. I know I'm not a loser. I'm a person who is mentally trained, but these days I'm mentally lost somewhere else. I forgot to focus on things. Everything has changed me completely. I'm in the US right now, and when I came here, I added a few more pounds, and it all started from being lazy to mentally drained, and my lifestyle became inactive. Anyway, I knew that I needed a solid, right day to jump on, and I trust myself that I'll never let go of things I mean to work on.  
After days and months of procrastination, I jumped into weight loss and cut off 25 pounds within 2 months during the summer break. I was disciplined at that time and started listening to podcasts related to body functions, brain functions, and the general way people look at things. I also used to do some meditation to keep myself mentally strong. After the summer, when I landed in a different city at a different university, I was here with the motive that now I'll be disciplined, and everything will fall into the right place. But different things distracted me, and the whole process seemed scattered. I started applying for internships, then got a car, stopped properly going to classes since they rarely took attendance anyway, and became more undisciplined.  
With some undulating ups and downs, I ended up the semester with a 3.9 GPA, which is not that good since most people easily hit 4. In the midst of everything, there was a time I kept myself motivated and was on track with a disciplined schedule for 10 days, with everything sharp and fine, but again, unfortunately, I had a toothache. It ended up taking a different route, causing pain for several days to weeks, and I had to consult a dentist and spent $400, and I still have to fix it, which is around $1500 easily.  
Trying to get out of it and somewhat pushing myself, I looked for days to change, and again, recently I faced a car breakdown, and the estimated cost is around $2.3k. I'm stressed, but at the same time, I know this is not the hardest time I'm dealing with since I have to go through more things that will shatter me. I think in multiple ways, and I don't know if anyone does the same. I know I'm having bad days and a bad time. I'm stressing a lot, and I was hit with the definition of what to expect from something, while I know how everything works, as I'm the person who has contemplated thousands of steps forward since my childhood and spent countless hours thinking about the next.  
I know and can easily influence anyone, but I myself don't feel that pain to gain, even after all this. Everyone is ramping up with internships in big tech, and I'm just left in the corner, not in any position, and I know I'm not that excellent to deserve either way, but here, somewhere, it's the play of luck since I'm in an HBCU college. I feel like I'm not having a hard time, but it feels like not holding the grip of discipline. I know I'll bounce back, but me knowing there is no right time is looking for the right time.  
Life is all of this, but what are the things anyone would take care of? It's about knowing that the journey of easy success will end if I don't start now, but still, I don't feel that pain to cry out and work?""",letsgrowgood,1,1.0,1,1703217160,2023-12-22 03:52:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18o5t6q/i_need_you/,12,2023

18o5ova,Negotiate relocation and remote work while working for a hybrid company,"I am working hybrid at my current company and I come in office 2 times a week. Our office has a hybrid work policy, but we also have employees working remote in other provinces (mostly engineer and devs). 

I don't mind the hybrid schedule, but I plan to move to another province next year and I want to negotiate remote work with my manager. Our team is small and everyone works hybrid. I am worried that if I ask for relocation I would lose this job because I am the only remote member in the team. Even though I got very positive feedback from management and colleagues about my performance, nothing is guaranteed. We do have members working remotely, but they do so as a whole team, and there are also some sales people who work remote. They have good track records and have been with the company for a few years.

Is my worry unnecessary? I am afraid that if I bring up the topic to my manager and they are not happy about it, it will be awkward moving forward. Another thing I can do is looking for another job as a back up and only bring up the topic if I am very close to a job offer, so that if the negotiation fails I still have another job.

18o4zgj,"Architecture is killing me, art or IT?","I was always a diligent student, but architecture has been absolutey kicking my ass and it’s making me rethink the course of my future. 

I’m currently in my second year of architecture at [insert college name here] and I’ve been able to maintain a 3.0-3.5 gpa for the most part, but it’s been nothing short of a battle for me for a number of reasons. A toxic relationship (that I ended), a toxic home environment (that I moved out of), got diagnosed with resolved depression (with lingering suicidal urges), an adjustment and a panic disorder (started seeing my school counsellor), but at the end of the day, no matter how many problems I managed to “solve”, at least for the short term, the base problem remained that I grew to detest the grind culture and had barely any interest in construction. 

The reason I took architecture in the first place is that it was my third option. I had applied to art-centred courses in other colleges but gave Interior Design a chance for one. I filed for a course change after my father (also an architect) talked me into it. This college just turned out to be the most convenient fit in terms of location, money, and community so we went for it.

In hindsight, I took it to get closer to him. Severe daddy issues and whatnot, stupid ik, but it did genuinely sound like a perfect compromise between art - my lifelong passion - and money at the time. Little did I know, the encouraged 24/7 grind was something I could barely keep up with, especially since I grew up as the honor roll student that lived for grades with a deadly work ethic. I genuinely wanted to live and experiment with who I was for the first time instead of making grades my entire life again. Over time, it felt like the only way to keep grades that wouldnt disappoint was to either be at least a little naturally passionate about buildings or to be down to make the work a significant portion of your life. 

I was neither, but I did my best at the latter when after a year of failing to find the passion. I pushed myself to work, pushed myself to stay social to manage the lonliness, pushed myself just to eat and sleep the bare minimum amount, pushed until I burnt my entire figurative candle stick into a waxy puddle of exhaustion. I’m aware it was all self-inflicted, but it produced results and they would be the only things that prompted my parents to compliment me or tell me they loved me, so it became addicting. (Def need more counselling)

I felt the pressure of being the eldest, being told I was the one to fix the family’s financial struggles, the one to rescue and bring us abroad, and the pressure of hiding a new (note: healthy) relationship. For context, I’m not allowed to date yet because they insisted it’d be a distraction. I even told myself that I’d be able to come clean to my fam about us if I maintained decent grades (Asian parent things), that way they couldnt claim it to be a hinderance.

At this point, I wanted to find myself again.

I joined a comic production org, made the effort to practice networking/socializing in art discords, and even began freelancing commissions again. On top of that, I started codeacademy in hopes to move onto The Odin Project, since high school IT classes were never a struggle for me, I thought it’d be a good backup to explore. This was all towards finals and it’s what I’m doing this Christmas break. I feel more like myself again. 

However, I’m at a crossroads now. I’ve spoken with my guidance counsellor to underload this semester to allow myself to think about things. He suggested I either shift to interior design or go all in with Multimedia Arts since it may be better for me. But now that I’ve done some rudimentary research, I’m beginning to think IT courses may be better for practicality. (I’m eyeing Information Systems and then a continued studies course in UI/UX design atm)

“If I’m gonna suffer, I might as well earn more money doing it or enjoy the suffering doing something I love,” was my thought process. 

To be extra clear, my practical dream is to move abroad (maybe Canada?) for good and be independent, to break free from my fam. My actual dream was to work as a video game concept artist or 2D/3D background designer, but I’m honestly scared I might not make it or it won’t get me out of the Phlippines, although I desperately want to. 

So there you have it. 4 options.

a) Stay with architecture until grad and lean into counselling to cope (god help me)
b) Pursue passion in Multimedia Arts
c) Pursue money in Information Systems 
d) Drop out and take a gap year to allow my family to save and experiment with freelancing (they’re against it)

I checked and there were no courses that combined tech and art besides Interactive Entertainment which is essentially video game design. It feels too risky though, as the careers are more diverse in IS and MMA. Also parents probably won’t allow unless I throw an adult-tantrum about it, which I can guarantee won’t happen any time soon.

I have until the end of my second year when shifting opens again, but it’s likely best to decide before the third term so I can take all my General Ed subjects right away.

I don’t know. All I know is how tired I am lol, but that’s no shocker

If you’ve reached this far, big kudos. This was more of a public rant than anything but I’d love to hear your opinion while you’re here.




TLDR: Burnt out in my second year of architecture. Thinking of shifting but dunno if I should go for money, passion, or a gap year to let my family save up funds.

18o4tv0,Car accident while on the clock + sexual harassment. Illinois.,"I am going through an incredibly difficult period of my life. Over the past nine years, I've worked as a pricing coordinator/sales assistant. However, due to the departure of our sales representative, her responsibilities have been assigned to both me and another colleague. In addition to our usual tasks, we are now required to visit customers at their offices, take them to lunches, and more. Although I wasn't keen on taking on these additional duties, I felt obligated and couldn't refuse.  
Unfortunately, my first office visit ended in a car accident, resulting in my recently purchased vehicle being declared a total loss by insurance. Forced to buy it at scrap value and drive it, I'm now in debt on the loan, driving a totaled car, and only covered by liability insurance. Next year, I've been asked to drive all over the Chicago area for customer visits, one day a week. Due to the trauma from the accident, I don't feel safe doing this, especially without collision or medical insurance. The stress from these circumstances has taken a toll on me, and I'm upset that this happened while I was on the clock. Online articles suggest that the employer might be liable for property damages in such situations, however, I am reading mixed opinions, and some users in other subreddits stated that since I am not at fault, then insurance pays and my employer would only be liable for medical injuries.  
To make matters worse, I recently experienced a sexual harassment incident. I was told to ""fuck \*the owner of the company whose installers we hire on projects\* and to send him naked photos to supposedly enhance our company's chances of winning projects."" along with many other things which I don't remember because I was too shocked and appalled at this level of mistreatment. I've reported this to the company, and an investigation is ongoing. I am not incredibly hurt, humiliated, and powerless, in addition to being burdened by financial issues and the pressure of driving a damaged car without insurance.  
I sought advice on employment law subreddits, and unfortunately, the consensus seems to be that there might be little I can do to receive compensation for my car or ensure proper consequences for the harasser. I'm contemplating refusing the new duties as I don't feel safe driving a totaled car without insurance for work assignments. My concern is whether they can force me to use my personal car, and if I can be terminated for insubordination. While I understand firing me after submitting a sexual harassment report is employer retaliation, which is illegal, I'm worried that I could be fired for refusing these new duties. I feel like from now on I will be constantly monitored and nitpicked, and they will look for any possible reason to fire me. At this point, I'm unsure if there's anything I can do other than endure the situation or start looking for a new job. I am told that while this sucks, there isn't really anything in my story that will stand out as a potential lawsuit. I cannot get over the fact that I lost my savings by putting money down on a car that got totalled in an accident, I am now in debt, driving a totaled car, have no insurance, and have been publicly degraded and humiliated at work and there is no help, no support and no justice for me. Can that really be?",december_sun,1,1.0,0,1703213941,2023-12-22 02:59:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18o4tv0/car_accident_while_on_the_clock_sexual_harassment/,12,2023
18o4b17,Seeking Advice,"I'm 24 and now am two years removed from earning my BBA majoring in marketing. Since graduating, I worked in a door-to-door marketing gig and was severly underpaid so I decided to do a quick turnaround in careers and find something that would pay much better.

Fast-forward to now, I'm dissatisfied with my current position at the bank and feel like there is no upside to the position I'm in unless I want to work numerous years doing the same old thing. So, I'm in the hunt for a new position and have thought marketing might be my best option since its what I studied but I really don't have the passion to pursue it any further. Instead, I'm discovering that what I really enjoy is working with technology and providing technical support. But without certifications specific to IT I'm finding it difficult to make myself attractive to employers hiring those positions.

18o32sb,What is the likelihood introversion/social awkwardness causes an employee to get fired?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 30s, first gen graduate in (what I consider) a boujee corporate job. My coworkers are all outgoing, have healthy self esteem, grew up with supportive parents, went to college right after high school... they've hit all the 'normal' life milestones. In contrast, I've had to claw my way through life. I struggle with mental illness including ptsd, I'm really reserved and awkward.

I busted my ass in school to land a job in a competitive field and bust my ass in the job I have now. I graduated college a year ago and got this job shortly after. I work hard to produce work for my company that is at the quality they want. I actively look for feedback that might suggest the contrary because I'm eager to improve on any areas of weakness. I think I have The Work of the job down. My weakness is having easy breezy, friendship like relationships with my coworkers. Before this corporate environment I've found myself in, I supported myself by owning a small business where I worked independently for 10 years. It's wild being a 30 something woman with cptsd who already had issues understanding the nuance of relationships now try and decipher corporate relationships as well.

My cptsd makes it hard for people to get to know me-- especially when we are in a big group and doubly so when we are in a group on zoom. We work mainly remote and when not remote, we are in groups. So I worry the perception of my coworkers is that I will never open up, or maybe they think I'm boring, or worse, that I'm stuck up.

I'm so self conscious of the way I'm perceived because I care alot about this job. How much do you think this will affect me in the long run? Will companies get rid of me because I'm the quiet, weird girl?

Neither my boss nor my senior have said anything bad about my work, in fact I often get praise, but I'm still paranoid they are unhappy in someway with me. This is a symptom of my trauma, but also, I know being a 'bad culture fit' has often been a fireable offense for many people.

18o2pi1,Should I call out my manager on his just recent email?,"I currently have the only manager I've ever directly argued with because he was very hostile over any tiny mistake for a very long time. Mistakes he himself makes regularly just like everyone else because we're all human.
Personally I think as co-workers we should point these out but nicely as in to help, like if someone had spinach in their teeth and didn't know.

I told him and our CEO that I'd rather be fired than be treated like that multiple times.
Despite that I have worked as hard as I can and pulled many late nights to get the work done.
The CEO is actually pretty cool but he does have a couple people around him, including my manager, that are making the company more adversarial than it used to be.

I think my manager pretty much ruined the person who held my position before me.

I've ended up pretty much just trying to stay off his radar as much as I can until I can get enough experience to get a job somewhere else.
I'm having to restart my attempt at a career at 40 after the last job I had pretty much destroyed me mentally and physically, though they said I'm the best they ever had and I had good relationships with everyone there. (Life got in the way of finishing degrees needed to progress. Partner sick, parents sick, family on meth, etc).

So my manager sends me an email today saying basically I should tell him more of my plans for my day because it's for him to plan.
Which I totally understand. Problem is he blows up at little insignificant things with no impact on anything at unpredictable times.
I don't know if I should tell him the reason I don't tell him everything is because I never know when he will blow up.

Before even I was new I didn't care as much about getting fired but now I'm more invested.

Personally, when I've trained people I found that they progressed much faster when I told them not to worry about mistakes, that it was normal because they were new. So they knew they could come to me if they made a mistake and I'd help them fix it and not penalize them unless they had a bad attitude toward me about their mistake.

I saw people's confidence and also competence grow so much faster with that approach.

Another problem is when I have confronted him about his abusive attitude he started making things up and saying I was out to get him and a bunch of other stuff. Traditional narcissistic behavior.

Problem there is what he says about me to the CEO and upper management affects my current job and future career.

So idk. Not sure if I should tell him the truth. I'm pretty sick of pretending to be dumb and not calling out things he does but calls me or for in a rude manner.

That being said he's much better because I eventually kind of got through to the CEO.

18o1il9,Principal not handling apprenticeship properly and other stuff.,"To make a long story as short as possible, I work in a field where an apprenticeship is required is some states but not all. I went to a 50 states school so my education transfers everywhere. The person I'm doing my 6 months under was the only person in my area who would take me on, but he has refused to do all of the paperwork so I can get my full license and has been screwing around for months ( I'm at month 10 right now and essentially running one entire side of his business for him.) He's screwed me out of about 20k so far by working me at the same hourly rate he pays everyone else, expects me to supervise them, etc instead of paying the commission rate I'm entitled to get like we're contracted, and he knows going to court will get me nowhere because he has half them in his pocket, as well as renting our office from court officers, etc. 

&#x200B;

Here are my options: One option is to basically pester the daylights out of him every chance I get to get the paperwork done then quit and move 100 miles away (he made me sign a 2 year/100 mile non-compete,) then move back in 2 years and re-establish myself here. Option 2 is move back to my hometown which is over the distance requirement, and that state does not require an apprenticeship so I could just transfer my stuff there, pay a fee, and get to work. Option 3 is ride the Titanic to the bottom of the ocean where I'm at.

18o11rd,"Recruiters, is it true that most advice about personal branding sucks?","I wonder if recruiters and experienced hiring managers agree that most advice about personal branding is kind of useless.   

I think [this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/some-actual-personal-branding-advice-new-graduates-mark-williams-hyguc/) is 100% correct.  Do something only an overachiever would do. 

When you look online for info about how to build a personal brand for career opportunities, the advice sucks.  

Nobody ever tells you what would actually show employers that you're a good person to hire.  It's always about covering the typical bases -- build your network, join professional networks, gain more skills, etc.  

Here's some actual advice I just got from chatGPT: 

>*""Personalize Your Approach: Your personal brand should be a reflection of who you are. While it's important to maintain professionalism, adding a personal touch can make your brand more relatable and memorable.""*

That's not how to do personal branding.  The best way is to do something only an overachiever would do.  Do something only a ""company guy"" (i.e. company *person*) would do.  

Some things can't be taught. They need to be recruited. Intrinsic motivation, consistent focus, and the personality of a team player who legit enjoys contributing to an organization.

18o08b3,Should I quit my job as probation wraps up?,"Hey all, I'm seeking advice as it's the first time I'm THAT unhappy with a job.
Essentially I made a big decision to switch from a job I was sort of unhappy at that left me burnt out, to a job that is much worse. 
I signed a 4 month probation and I'm nearly halfway through out but I think I should start looking for something else instead.

When I joined there was 0 onboarding, they left me to fend for myself, gave me impossible tasks, no support for setting up anything, having to read their minds to understand lacking story descriptions and 0 documentation. Everyone works overtime and over weekends. Constant calls all the time, constant meetings. No team spirit, when we have to meet in person once a month it's the most awkward thing and I genuinely feel so drained and depressed. Anything i do is always corrected because they have a very very specific way of doing things, even all the scrum ceremonies. If i slightly mess up they are quite stuck up about it and even laughed at me today. They act like ive never done scrum though i have for 5 years even led teams. I'm always interrupted and questioned. 

This job has made me suicidal and I've never had such imposter syndrome. Im so drained I cant even do any productive work, I'm barely keeping up. It is also just so complex so I keep blaming myself for it...

Thing is they have started handing over all the scrum to me and doing the large high level planning so it seems they want to keep me after 4 months but I've never left a job at this stage.

Does it make sense to find something else or should I try to push through?

Edit: I have had maybe 1 day out of 2 months where I was not miserable at this job.",DemetraMillennial,2,0.75,7,1703200471,2023-12-21 23:14:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18o08b3/should_i_quit_my_job_as_probation_wraps_up/,12,2023
18o02x2,Considering 2 Offers: 50k + 2 days WFH or 55k + 10% bonus fully in office,"Hi friends, I'm a recent college graduate living in Austin, TX and I have been fortunate enough to receive two offers for vastly different entry level roles. While the salaries are not that different, especially accounting for the WFH option for the lower salary, I just need a sanity check to make sure I am making the right decision. Austin is a bit of an expensive city to live in, but thankfully I have no debt so I would only need to pay rent (\~$900/month) and other personal expenses (food, utilities, etc).

The 50k + 2 days WFH position is essentially a business intelligence analyst position for a multimedia advertising company (TV, mobile, internet) that consults with clients across a wide number of industries. This would involve mainly analytics work, execution of advertisement campaigns and strategy consultations with clients. Honestly I'm kicking myself a bit, because the CEO told me to name a salary and I gave a conservative number of 50k (this was before receiving the 55k offer), they gave no salary range and I didn't want to risk going too high and having it be out of their budget.

The 55k + 10% bonus fully in office is an insurance underwriting position. Commute would be 20 minutes to the office, 20 minutes back for 5 days a week as there is no work from home option. While they do pay a higher salary, the work seems less interesting with a much more limited scope of optionality if I want to move to another company or industry. 

Negotiation at this point is risky, as the 55k offer expires tomorrow at noon essentially, and I already verbally accepted the 50k offer and the CEO indicated that the salary number is not open to negotiation. I have not received the full offer as of yet to learn if the 50k job offers any bonus for performance or merit, as that would impact my decision. I have been asking for this information since receiving the 50k offer last Thursday with no responses as of now.

I guess the question is, would you take 5k-10k lower salary to have 2 days WFH per week, plus being in a more interesting industry? Being that this is my first full time job, this would likely impact my earnings going forward for future careers. Thoughts are welcome, thank you!

18nzpyt,My chronic illness is getting worse and I need some job advice [LONG],"I appreciate any and all advice from my question. Sorry if this post is a bit long, but I'll try to keep it as brief as possible. I'll start with some background on myself, qualifications, etc, and then my goals with work.

  
  
I am a 25 year old male and for the past 5 years I have been working as a voice actor. I have a decade of experience with various digital media fields such as camera operation, video editing, audio editing, photo editing, video production, and most of all... voice over. I started my first ""real job"" at 15 years old and worked as a editing assistant and camera hand for a small video production company. As soon as I turned 16 I got a cheap car and began my own business. I was hooked on the industry and started off as a wedding/portrait photographer. I wasn't great and overtime I started honing my skills more into the video aspects of my field and transitioned to working in video editing and producing small video productions, mostly music videos. I had always been fond of voice over and was excited to implement it into my work when I had the opportunity but it wasn't until around covid that I phased out all of my work to solely pursue voice over. I had been doing it mostly part time for a couple years along with the video work until then.

  
  
To backtrack a little, during all this time being self employed I never was able to work just one job. I was a real estate agent for 4 years, did landscaping, doordash, whatever was needed to make ends meet in hopes of being able to provide for myself solely off what I enjoy doing one day. Throughout my life I have always struggled chronic pain. It wasn't until a few years ago that the pain was becoming debilitating and I started really seeing specialists to work on getting a grasp on my situation. It's a bit too convoluted and long winded to explain fully here, but to put it simply, there is something wrong with my nerves. Any contact with heat or water like a shower, sweat or the rain makes my body feel as if it were set on fire. It also happens right as I wake up and go to bed. It's agony and I've been working with many many specialist for a while now, all with no answers. We mostly treat my symptoms just to keep me able to exist day to day. With medication I'm able to not be in constant pain all day, but I have to take things slow and avoid stimulants such as the water or high temperatures. On top of this I was also recently diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. Something that, while looking back, always made school very difficult for me.  
  


Voice over has treated me well, but I still was never able to achieve a level of success in the industry where I could support myself full time with it. Up until last month I had a work from home gig soldering small electrical parts for a lighting company but was laid off in December due to budgeting. I'm also an author and love to write creatively but have yet to pursue that industry fully as I know the amount of work needed to succeed and fear I don't have the time or resources at the moment. On top of all of this I also make YouTube content on the weekends. I am experienced and familiar with editing and producing videos and have a nice small community of around 1k people and average 2k views per video, occasionally hitting 50k-60k. As of now it's mostly a hobby but if it ever pops off, then I'm happy to devote more time to it.

  
  
The dilemma I'm at now. My condition is slowly getting a bit worse and making it harder for me to get around and be as physically active as I'd like. I'm not eligible for disability because I'm not technically diagnosed with anything. Even if I was, I would still *want* to work. Voice over was expanding well for me until the AI voicing hit my sector extremely hard this year. I've lost a lot of my clients due to working primarily with overseas studios who prioritize the dirt cheap prices and versatility of AI. I can't blame them to some degree but it does suck. I'm becoming more and more tired and feel like after a decade of working for myself, trying to maintain a job and run businesses, I may be nearing the end of my rope.  
  


I have a lot of work experience with voice over and audio editing and would love to find work that allows me to continue pursuing what I'm best at, but I know that may be a bit of a pipe dream. Im a hard worker and don't mind going to a job if it comes down to that, but my health and body definitely thrive best when I'm able to be completely remote and somewhat on a self decided schedule. Obviously that's like searching for ice in hell, but I at least figured I'd mention it. I have no formal schooling after high school, aside from real estate school, as I went straight into the work force. I don't have ""job"" experience to put on a resume as I've been self employed in a variety of seemingly broad work for the past decade.  
  


Are there any jobs that you would recommend someone with my skillset and life situation to look into? I have a complete, broadcast quality home studio, and I work well with audio, creative writing, and all forms of editing. Finding consistent work is just becoming to difficult for me and I think I may be ready to throw in the towel and reside to working under someone else. Thanks and all the best, I appreciate you hearing out my incredibly long message.",helpmeworkthrowaway1,1,1.0,0,1703199136,2023-12-21 22:52:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18nzpyt/my_chronic_illness_is_getting_worse_and_i_need/,12,2023
18nzgxu,I'm I the investable talent?,"I recently found out my former boss will be leaving the firm shortly.   
Two weeks ago, I was asked to come into my former boss's office to sit down and have a conversation with his boss.. During the conversation, with his boss, I was informed my former boss would be leaving and was asked if I was interested in the position, saying he wanted to ""invest in talent."" The conversation ended with him stating he would get ""more feedback from \[my old boss and another employee\].""   
The other employee, a buddy I worked with in the past, was technically being groomed to be the replacement when my boss decided his time was up and was the first to know my boss would be leaving. He also indicated that he was interested in the job.   
It sounds like a stupid question, but did I just get offered a job? Has anyone been in this situation? I reached out to my old boss and told him about the conversation, telling him, ""I'm shocked, and I don't think I'm ready."" He replied, ""You'll have x to help you out.

18nybua,What Path Should I Take?,"For context I just turned 24.

Back in 2021, I was in college full time for a degree in electrical and computer engineering.
I chose the degree path initially because I had a desire on working with computer hardware, although part of it was not knowing specifically what I wanted when the  time came for college.
When I was younger I wanted to design video games, but I had a shit guardian until I was 15 that kept encouraging me not to go to college.
Luckily I left them at 15, caught up in highschool, and graduated with a decent GPA.
I started college in 2019, but had to take a break from the 2022 Spring semester due to family financial trouble (mom had cancer then lost job)….which kept getting worse.
What was suppose to be a single semester break ended up lasting from spring 2022 - winter 2023. I got a part time job working technology support for a school district, but things got even worse and my part time job turned into my family’s only stable source of income in 2023. I tried a few times to get full time (runner up 2nd time), but kept getting beat to the punch after 2.5 years there. Now I’ve lost that job due to living complications (we lost the apartment, had to stay with family out of state, and I was told to submit a resignation because HR doesn’t like a part time employee off payroll for a month). Now I’m trying to find a new job in another state and I have no idea what I’m doing.
I do not have any certifications besides one to work on HP computers (forget name).
I’ve worked Helpdesk, I’ve worked with ticketing systems, I’ve troubleshot hardware/software issues, I’ve worked with Active Directory, I’ve imaged devices, I’ve preformed device repairs,
I have some experience……but I don’t know where I go next and how to improve my standard of living. Worst part is that if I did get full time the last time I applied, I would have been financially stable and able to go back to school without an issue.

18nxjho,How to approach a career pivot through education with my boss?,"I am a mid-level data analyst for a medium-sized organization in supply chain management. Nothing we do has any true urgency. However, my boss is very intense about work and an extremely toxic leader. He has been with the company for 2 years and 6 people have left his small team. He pushes the limit of what is legal citing the fact we are salaried employees and this is an expectation as a reason to make us work after hours and even some during PTO. I have been with the company for about a year and looking to leave but the job market is tough. One thing he does have a soft spot for is education. 

I was still finishing my bachelor's degree up until October and studying was truly the only reason he seemed to find acceptable to not work a ton of extra hours. Now that I am done, I no longer have that protection. I have tried ""managing up"" and he has proved to be unresponsive to feedback to improve the situation and other employees who have gone to HR have gotten no help.

Off probation my friend will be making 2,000 EC and he recommended that I apply to his firm since I'm doing more files over here than he is currently doing and getting paid less. 

After probation ends should I ask for a raise? This would be a 53% increase if I asked for 1,300 to 2,000 which would match my friends pay off probation. Should I negotiate my pay before applying? Or should I apply and negotiate?

18nvzzz,Understanding Recruiters,"Over the past year or so, I have attempted to work with MANY recruiters.  I have also been contacted by many using no special communication.  I'm sure that y'all have seen this particular gem:  


""Hello, My name is Recruiter X working for some company and I excel at placing people in this types of jobs.  I have a role that I think that you would be perfect for {insert bad job here}.""

I've asked very nicely and politely, something like, ""Thank you for reaching out about this job.  What on my profile and/or resume caught your eye and got you interested in my candidacy for the role?""

Regardless of how nice or professional I word that or any question, the recruiter does not respond, or if they do, they copy and paste their initial statement back to me.

Is there a reason for this behavior? Is this such a taboo question to ask? ",Alyssa-Goodwich,1,1.0,0,1703189275,2023-12-21 20:07:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18nvzzz/understanding_recruiters/,12,2023
18nvlxb,Got offered a job back at my old company after 6 months away,"To give some context, I worked at my old company for 2 years as an Implementation Specalist. I started off as a junior and got promoted to Senior 1.5 years in. The comapany had a highly configurable software that specialized in Risk Management for Utility companies. My job was to become familiar with this complex software to help implement it for clients and provide support in addition to UAT whenever they would update the software. 

 I left the job this year and decided to take 6 months off to travel.

After coming back from my travels, I tried searching for a new job and put in 400 job applications and never got past the HR interview for the ones that gave me a chance. 

During this time I also got involved in a Task Scam and had nearly all of my savings taken away from me. 

My old boss then reached out to me and we got on a call where he explained they are looking for a technical project manager and would see me as the best person for this role with my technical knowledge of how the software works and my good communication skills. I would be making quite a bit more than I did before I left and getting experience in Project management. 

My main concern is the thought of coming back to a company I had no plans of returning back to seems like i’m going backwards rather than forward. I didn’t necessarily enjoy the work I was doing and know that with this new role, I would have all the responsibilities I had before and new ones working with various clients.",throwaway1273892,126,0.9200000166893005,89,1703188282,2023-12-21 19:51:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18nvlxb/got_offered_a_job_back_at_my_old_company_after_6/,12,2023

Strong Title, I know. But I’m in a consulting  bubble, as I worked there as a working student.

I find the work itself rather boring as juniors mostly work on powerpoints and don’t have too much responsibilities. 

Regarding the work itself I would take the other offer but I have strong FOMO the learning/growth opportunities, networking and exit options.

I found him to be very resistant and often gave out negative comments whenever I attempt to work on something that he used to. He would say stuff like this is pointless, our clients wouldn’t need it, there is no point,etc.
Now I dont report to him, and frankly I dont give a shit about his opinion but Im sick of his negativity and even if I try to be rational and be neutral, I feel that dealing with him drains my energy. I have been very successful so far.

Pros: higher paying, MCOL, good company, WLB

Cons: somewhat unrelated to desired future career path, undesired location, poor culture (atleast during internship)

Offer 2: small company data analytics, ~65k

Pros: great city, opportunity for growth within company, interesting work, potential for developing career in data science 

Cons: very small company with unpredictable hours, no direct programming (could change with role), low pay in HCOL, far from home

Note that the analytics job is for a very niche domain that I happen to have experience in. Otherwise my data analytics qualifications aren’t all there.

18nr780,23 and Directionless,"BACKGROUND, SKIP IF YOU CARE TO:


I’m 23, I graduated college last April after doing an HR internship and completing my bachelor of social work. 

I got a job as a refugee case manager 2 weeks before graduation, but there was no training besides hours of recorded zoom calls, many of which were not intended for my specific role but instead other somewhat similar roles.  I learned very little regarding things like how to do the required paperwork, in fact the trainings on how to do the paperwork did not apply to my role so i was expected to go in blind.  I was also given 4 months to complete the year end goal for the fiscal year, because the previous person quit.  I ended up leaving after 3 and a half months.   I failed. 


CURRENT SITUATION:


I quickly found a new job, and I am now a bank teller and have been for about 3 months now.  Most people are nice to me, but yesterday I just had bad luck and had customer after customer try to bully me to the point where I was crying most of the day.  

According to my boss, in bank settings it is very common to remember the first customer who made you cry and it is like a rite of passage.  I was ashamed to show such weakness at work, but also comforted by my boss and my coworkers kind reactions.   

What my boss said did make me feel like there is not a future for me here, because I don’t want to be bullied this way on such a consistent basis and it seems like a problem that people are frequently breaking down emotionally in that role (potentially why there is such turnover).   


FUTURE CAREER PLANS


Since I left my previous job in less than a year, I feel that for this one, as much as I feel afraid and anxious about this job, I should wait at least a year before looking for something different.  Maybe I will pursue something related to my HR experience, I can get a reference from the boss during my internship who I had a very good relationship with, and if I continue to make it in this job long enough, I think my current boss will also vouch for me very strongly as I actually have a perfect record so far in terms of customer reviews and not making any mistakes (he has even given me a raise already).

Am I a young spoilt kid who can’t stick to anything?  Should such an emotional person as me be trusted in such a serious environment?  Will any future employer want someone like me?   Is my plan realistic or will I still be seen as someone who doesn’t stick around based on my resume if I only tough this one out for a year?",Muted-Requirement-53,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1703176822,2023-12-21 16:40:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18nr780/23_and_directionless/,12,2023

18nmvmi,Help with decision on offer,"Hoping to get some feedback on whether to accept an offer for a new job or stay with my current job.

Current job: 

Current company is in tech with fewer than 200 employees. Job has a very senior title and pays roughly $240k total comp. The company announced forced RTO where we will have to go in a few days per week, and I have been planning to move out of my city for a while now so that sucks. Started in this role a year ago at the company I have been with for 8 years. Midway through the year, scope of role contracted significantly--it is a really easy job now, almost too easy. Company isn't doing great financially and had layoffs in the past year; I feel like I have a target on my back because of the high salary and role changing. CEO said I would always have a job but not sure I can believe it. My direct manager is an oblivious micromanager in a time zone across the world. The person I work with the most is her husband and he is not great at his job, and it's not going to change. They're always trying to drag me into drama between them and the company and it is awkward. Other people in the company that I have to deal with are awful and annoying, while some others are fine. I have had frustrating issues related to not getting my full pay on time. Company has excellent benefits like lots of PTO and good insurance. I have also earned trust and freedom, and am respected in the org.

The potential new role:

At a tech company with 10,000+ employees. The job has a worse title (manager level) and only pays $150k total comp. 100% remote. My partner and I can afford the drop in income, but it's painful for me to accept the drop mentally. The job itself is much more interesting and has a global strategy focus, something I have wanted to do and that I will never be able to do at my current job. There would be a lot more room to grow. It's a brand new role, so there is a bit of risk that the company does not entirely know what it wants out of the role, but there's also an opportunity for me to define and shape it. After the interview process, it seems like the responsibilities aren't matched by the title--this should probably be a more senior level role. I feel worried that I would do a bad job, but I think it's just the fear of change talking. Potential manager and peers all seemed really nice, smart, and professional.

18nl1zk,"Coworker will get frustrated and make ""jokes"" about suicide. What is the best approach? Long post, tl:dr at bottom","Hello all, I'm not sure if this is a good place to post this but I'm curious how to handle this from a professional sense. This is someone I work pretty closely with and talk to regularly. He's only made these comments to me as far as I know but I'm not sure if others have overheard when we are in office. I want to maintain a good working relationship with him and don't want him to feel embarrassed if he really is having issues.

He's junior to me in our roles and this has now happened a couple of times where he asks me for help with a problem he is frustrated with solving. I usually provide suggestions but a lot of the time I'm not going to know the answer unless I work through it myself. He gets frustrated at having to work through things. When we troubleshoot his problems, he will get more and more frustrated and eventually make comments like ""well how about I just kill myself"" or ""This is so hard I'll just kill myself."" 

This guy can be pretty crass. He swears way more than anybody I know. He doesn't have much of a filter in what he says although admittedly outside of the suicide jokes and the heavy amounts of swearing, I've never really heard him say anything that was offensive or not office appropriate. Like he just uses expletives as exclamations a lot, he's not running around telling inappropriate jokes(outside of the suicide ones). 

I feel like this is a delicate thing to handle and I don't want to do it the wrong way. I know him well enough that I thought maybe I could talk to him one on one about it first, and really just more to check in and make sure he is okay. I feel like my other options are to go to my boss or to go to HR, but knowing him I'm not sure if he would react very well to either of those. 

How the heck do I navigate something like this? On a personal note, the little brother of one of my best friends growing up committed suicide and I remember neither us friends nor his family having any real warning about it. It just seems like one of those things that if you're on the outside can come from nowhere so if you see even the slightest warning sign it is probably better to say something. 

Tl;Dr - Coworker makes suicide comments. Should I talk to him directly first and then go to my boss/HR or just go directly to my boss/HR?",crippling_altacct,5,0.8600000143051147,10,1703158655,2023-12-21 11:37:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18nl1zk/coworker_will_get_frustrated_and_make_jokes_about/,12,2023

18nkwg5,Any tax lawyers here?,"Howdy all. 

I’m 28, and have been working as a solicitor in a top 6 firm for about a year now.  I work in the very niche area of Commonwealth procurement and I’ve increasingly been losing interest in this area of law. 

During my undergraduate studies, I undertook some tax law courses and really enjoyed this area of law, but since I went to a regional university the remaining course offerings weren’t that great and I could pursue this area any further.   I have now been accepted into a Masters of Tax Law at UNSW and have decided to take the risk and study part-time. 

I’m going to balance domestic and international tax law course enrolments to keep my career horizons open, but I was curious as to the overall job market for tax lawyers in Australia as I suspect the everyday person thinks about seeing an accountant rather than a lawyer when they have a taxation issue.  

Additionally, keen to hear opinions on whether striving for a Chartered Tax Advisor designation is a worthwhile pursuit.

Context: I’m a m22 from from Australia and I have just finished a bachelors in business and I landed an 80k a year job on the federal government working in HR. Although I don’t enjoy the office environment or HR as I find it very draining as I don’t get to see my results I also don’t enjoy sitting at a desk for 8 hours. Also looking at managers or directors they seems to have no life outside of work and to be miserable.

I’m thinking of changing careers into something where I can see more tangible results and work with more people also have more of a creative side. I don’t enjoy sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day and I want to be able to look back on mu career and be able to see what I have done. 

My questions, is this a dumb idea as I’d have to take a significant pay cut. Although my parents are happy for me to live at home rent free while I try and work out what I enjoy.

My dream is to work in a job where I can -Become an expert in

18nfhx2,"Pivoting into new field with a masters that requires an ""internship"" - how to avoid entry level pay and ""intern"" title for short term role?","After 8 years of work, I've started studying a masters degree in a new field (and new country, France). After enrolling I found out that doing an internship between year 1 and 2 is mandatory for this degree.

I was browsing internship roles and found one that was labelled ""competitive salary"". The salary was 1/5th of my previous salary. It wasn't an outlier. Most internships are that amount.

For a student with no work experience, it's ok. But I feel like I can offer more value than my classmates. Obviously if I'm pivoting I'd expect to take a step back in pay. But not _that_ much.

I've found plenty of good paying roles in my new field that I reckon I _would_ have a good chance at getting based on my experience, but they're all permenant. I need something a few months long. The finite time constraint really eliminates a lot of options.

I'm also worried that when I apply for my next permenant role after my degree, employers will see ""intern"" as my most recent job title, and that will be a liability, not an asset.

What are some other ways of finding (or ""job crafting"") a short term role? E.g. I'm guessing smaller companies will be more flexible when it comes to defining a bespoke contract for a bespoke role. How can I get hired as a short term ""contractor"" instead of an ""intern""?

Since I'm in a new country, I don't have a network of people I can rely on.

I recently graduated in computer science, and with the market as rough as it is, I'm beginning to consider more business-esque jobs.

I always have heard you can get a lot of business jobs with whatever degree, but I'm not entirely sure how to tailor my resume to these positions, and what job titles I should look for (or what's even out there).

I’m just not sure what I’d be qualified to get into at an entry level and I haven’t been able to find something that would take the time to train someone like me to do the job well and excel (or at all). Do companies hire people to train in house for their needs or is that too expensive/risky? What could i look into to find someway to get my foot in the door? I think I could do most jobs that require a bachelors/associates degree but I just don’t have the paper. I’d love to just find a career path, preferably in tech(but not necessary), to move toward so I don’t feel like I’m spinning my wheels. Any advice, pointers or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

18nc0j2,What to pursue with Finance and Chemical Engineering experience?,"I am a 24M with 2.5 years of experience at a Fortune 300 company in corporate finance. I have a B.S. in chemical engineering from a well respected university. Separately, I own 8 apartments that I operate as furnished rentals and plan to start a flipping business in 2024 for median priced single family homes. 

Real estate investing is just a hobby for me right now and I’m not trying to replace my income with it. As I’ve seen already, monthly profit is pretty volatile and I wouldn’t feel comfortable going all in without a significant buffer. Not to mention losing the benefits of a W2. One day I’d consider quitting and just flipping/managing rentals but this won’t be for 10+ years down the road. 

I feel like I’m at a bit of a crossroad in my professional career.  I took a finance job out of school so I could learn about how large businesses operate (and model my real estate business after it) along with learning core financial concepts (income statement, balance sheet, soft skills etc). I liked the rigor of chemical engineering school but don’t care much for solving real life engineering  problems. 

I’ve been at my current company for 2.5 years and have another 6 months before my stocks vest (so will stay along until then). At that point I feel like it’s time to make a change. 

I like the company I work for but corporate finance is not for me. I don’t find it challenging enough and don’t see myself growing into an FP&A leader or something of the like. I have very good performance reviews and have become well respected in the finance department. At this point, I’ve learned the basic concepts and see that senior leaders essentially are better at leading people, have more experience, and are more bought into the corporate jargon. 

I’d like a more technical position that blends what I’ve learned in finance with my technical background OR a more intense finance position that I can grow in. Ideally, I’d like a high paying position so I can continue to fund my real estate portfolio (true passion). Some positions I’ve considered: Product Management, Private Equity, Asset Acquisition in energy sector and Tech Sales. Not sure if I’m completely qualified for any of those sectors. 

In the next 5 years I plan to continue growing my real estate portfolio, get married, and potentially complete an MBA. 

My personality lends itself to liking to be challenged but only in areas I think are worth over coming the challenge (hence the real estate, along with being an active runner/weight lifter etc)

What would you do in my shoes?

18na7b3,No response for spring co-op before the holidays,"So I spent 3 months interviewing with various teams at Apple. I completed the finals rounds with one and started an initial interview with a second team. My recruiters are typically communicative although sometimes very vague. But for the past 2 weeks(after the initial interview) I haven't heard back. No response to my emails except an out of office automated response from one of my recruiters a couple of days ago.

I want to believe that I atleast got an offer from one of the teams but it doesn't feel like I did. I think a recruiter will try to let a candidate know asap right especially if the start date is so close. But then again, during one of my interviews, I asked about the start date and they said it was flexible. That I could start anytime in January. 

It's frustrating because I just recently came back from a fall co-op with a different company and I need to get an apartment, part time job and tell my university to re-instate my scholarships before January 10th. But I can't do any of this till I'm sure but I don't know when they'll reach out...if ever.

18n9gmy,What would you do if you knew you were losing your job 6-9 months from now?,"Howdy y’all. I work in a rapidly shrinking industry that largely doesn’t produce new jobs. You sort of hang on to the job you have for dear life until it’s gone. Well, a bit of industry gossip today suggests my time might be coming. It has nothing to do with me specifically, just corporate maneuvering that feels likely to lead to layoffs in my specific area.

However, that’s almost certainly months away. My work is somewhat seasonal, and the spring/early summer are insanely busy, so I’m almost certain it wouldn’t come before the expiration of my current contract in August.

So basically, that leaves me a bit less than a year to prepare for the serious threat of unemployment. If you had that kind of time to prepare… what would you do with it? Is there a way to use that time to make myself more appealing to possible future employees in new fields without decreasing my output at my current job?

18n8802,My Manager is very very rude,"So I work in a support analyst team, I come from a highly educated background with masters degree, so I am all about giving my best. I followed my senior colleage what day do so that I get accepted as one of them.

Few months went by I noticed, I am the only one who is going above and beyond. There was only 1 pro guy, he went to another company. 

It's been two years I couldn't move up the ladder because company stopped growing and they started laying off.

I was assigned a new manager by my previous boss who got promoted. 

This guy was just a level above me (nothing fancy) he started behaving in a rude way as if he own the company.

I give my best of and he always is out there to see my flaws constantly, his attitude feels like he doesn't respect me at all. It's not like a relationship of a team leader more or a dictator.

I thought of it a lot, I realized we are in the same team doing exact same job, its not like he is only a manager, he is a support analystas well, just a level above. My previous boss was very kind and respectful.

If I ask him anything he gets annoyed, if I go to him for help he doesn't know the answer.

Last week, I asked for a day off, he cancelled it, I asked him look I take least amount of vacation, he got angry and told me how do I know if I take less vacation than others, do I have a chart?

I explained him that I still haven't 5 days of vacation left in my HR software (please note that my company has unlimited vacation)

I told him look since its end of next month, as far as I know there will bel less pressure that day and there will be other agents to cover the shift.

He got offended and told me not to tell him these things and not to meddle with management's decisions because they have the information I am taking about.

I was surprised, I cordially apologized and said look my intention is not to meddle with your decision, I am just making my case so that you understand that I have a urgent meeting that day.

This is just one incident, every time I  go to home gor advice, he talks in a way to find if I did any mistake, I can't go to him for anything

18n815j,"I ""can't"" work normal hours","NOTE: I have ADHD and Crohn's, which I think have some influence on why I feel this way. 

&#x200B;

I naturally stay up late and wake up late. When I don't have external demands on me, I tend to sleep between 2am and 4am and wake up between 10am and 1pm. 

  
Obviously, when I was in school, I had to be there from 8-4 ish every day (well, excluding the large amount of days I skipped or left at lunch or showed up after lunch). I honestly can't remember how I did it. I think I was usually just groggy and annoyed for a few hours and then felt better as the day went on. 

  
After college, I tried to work various jobs that started in the morning, around 8 or 9. I quit all of them relatively quickly because I just hated getting up so early. I hated feeling rushed. I hated not having time to eat breakfast or have coffee or tea. I hated driving to work in rush hour traffic. 

  
After a couple years I went to Korea to teach in an afterschool English academy. My hours were 3pm-10pm ish. It was awesome. I'd get up, enjoy my morning, go for a hike or something, eat lunch, and head to class feeling good. My job was fun and I was good at it. Then I'd relax at night or walk around or whatever I wanted and just go to sleep when I felt tired. 

  
The problem is as I'm getting older I'm a bit stressed about money and the future and all that stuff. My job in Korea provided a free apartment, but the salary wasn't much. I could save a few hundred dollars a month if I tried. I came back to the US after 2 years with about 4 grand. 

  
I applied to a bunch of jobs in the US. The two interviews I got were car salesman (which sounded terrible and would have me working like 10 hours a day) and concessions at the movie theater (which I took and I'm enjoying, but obviously the money is very little). 

  
I've thought about ways I could make more money and I basically came up with 3 options.   
1) Do something online like writing or making videos or learning to code- This would be good because of flexibility, but it's hard to predict whether you will be successful. Also, I tend to get down if I don't socialize for awhile. I get energy from being around people and I don't know if I could be happy sitting in my room for 8 hours a day. 

  
2) Become a ""real"" teacher- This would require me to get a teaching license and/or masters degree. I could potentially end up working in international schools, which sounds cool. They also get paid a lot better than academy teachers. But from what I've heard, you generally have to spend 2 years teaching in the US or an undesirable country before you get a job somewhere I'd want to live. I really don't want to do that. And honestly, I don't want to go back to the school schedule, waking up at 6 or 7am. And I don't want to teach big classes, like 30-40 kids. The max at my old job was 12 and even that felt a bit much to me. 

  
3) Go to law school- I did well in debate, majored in philosophy, and got a good score on a practice LSAT. I think I have the skills to excel in this. But working as a lawyer requires a 9-5 type job (or worse if you want to make a lot of money). And also I think a lot of it will be boring and tedious and ethically grey, which I don't like. When I think about it, I did well in debate, but it also stressed me out a lot and I could get mad when judges were stupid or people were mean to me.   
So, as you can see, I have no idea what to do next haha. I think two of the biggest things holding me back are not wanting to work a ""normal"" schedule or live in places I don't want to live in. To be honest, what I want to do is go back to working in an academy in Korea. I think I was the happiest I've ever been there and I miss it. But I'm scared of not making much money as I get older. 

  
I don't really care much about money myself. I really wish I didn't have to think about it. I kind of hate thinking about it. But it's important for security, in case of emergencies or what not. And I'm worried about my ability to date or get married as I get older if I don't start making more money. Most girls I dated in my 20's didn't seem to care, but will they if I'm in my 30s and still not making a lot? 

  
Anyone relate to this or have any advice? 

  
My dad wants me to go to law school and I think my mom wants me to get a masters in education, but I think I might end up hating either one. I want to go back to teaching in an academy, but I'm worried and feel I might be embarrassed to still be doing that in my 30s. I turn 30 in October.

18n6um9,A bit lost,"I Tried for several years getting an apprenticeship in Mechanical engineering but couldn't get one. I went to college and got a degree in mechanical engineering instead but after 2 years I realised I hated it but it was too late to change. Got a degree and went straight into work at a desk job in Mechanical Engineering. Done it for 4 years but really disliked it. 

Now on a gap year travelling but really don't know what to do after it. Got plenty of hobbies, love local history, love diy, anything old, particularly antiques, old cameras, photography. Really like heritage crafts.

Trouble is none of these things can make much money and are incredibly niche. I have made quite a bit of money as an engineer but did not find it helped with the job enjoyment, so think id rather do something i enjoy than make tonnes of money. As long as its enough to survive.

18n6b27,Is this a red flag?🚩,"I accepted a new position in my dream location and it is literally my dream job! As I am preparing for the big transition, 3 months in and multiple offers on houses keep falling through. I’m still packing up by stuff prepared to start on my intended start date in the New Year. Where is the red flag you may ask it is the lack of communication on the employer’s part.

 I interviewed back in October and was offered the position within a few hours, already on the drive home. They would need me to come back down for some Onboarding ( paperwork, fingerprints) I scheduled for December in hopes that I would at least have a house on contract under way. Well my luck sucks and offers fell through. December rolls around,  I went to my onboarding appointment, my supervisor was very surprised to see me. I’m not sure why she was cc’d on the appointment confirmation. She asked if I received the email about pushing my start date. To which I replied ‘yes’ she sent an email end of November saying that I they would be happy to push my start date. At the time, I didn’t think it was necessary because I had a lot of offers in for houses. I thought at least one would turn up. I found out through HR that my start date was pushed back a week( that’s fine) but I never received an email. She claims she emailed me directly but I don’t have anything. ( I checked Spam) My supervisor also asked why I had a lot of questions for HR. I explained my situation of getting outbid on all the houses. I was inquiring with HR if they had any contacts for hotels within the area or temporary housing. Some places in the line of work that I am in (Marketing & Education) have that. She seemed offended that I didn’t ask her that question. It was a more spur of the moment question. After my appointment, my supervisor called and emailed stating she was concerned about the miscommunication between us and the questions I raised to HR. She was also concerned that I hadn’t found a place yet and if I was really committed to the job. 

I have been soooo stressed the last few months. I can barely sleep. All of this has me feeling like I jumped into it way too fast and should be consider something else. But this company is the only one who has really given me a chance to get the job title and move.

18n5487,Manager / supervisor at new job does not seemed interested in managing / supervising.,"Basically the title. Started a new job about a month ago. It’s supposed to be B2B sales in a niche industry. 

Most of the team is remote. This guy is supposed to be onboarding me and preparing me to make about a dozen sales in the first 90 days. 

I need to learn all the different platforms we use, the products we sell, connect with the suppliers and prospects. I’ve gotten pretty for being self taught. 

Now there’s some things I just need someone to show me how it’s down here. And my manager is hardly in the office. He’s hardly responsive online. He’s terrible at communicating. All he’s done is ask me to clean, organize and upload data that he did a shitty job upkeeping over the last year. And these tasks are fine but he doesn’t give clear instructions and I’m constantly making errors and wasting time correcting my mistakes. It also doesn’t necessarily feel like I’m taking steps towards my goals. 

I don’t feel like I’ll be ready to make 12 sales in my first 90 days on this trajectory. 

The president is who hired me. It’s who I spoke to during the interview process and why I joined the team. But they’re remote and I haven’t had much contact with them since I’ve started here. I want to go directly to them, but I certainly want to tread lightly in my new gig and not make enemies or appear like a drama case . 

I’ve certainly hinted that I need some help with things. That I’d like to schedule some time for us to review XYZ. Asked how we do XYZ. But this guy just doesn’t seem to care. He’s like emotionless. It’s weird actually. 

Outside of work I can shoot the shit with him about sports or whatever. He’s a decent guy but yeah, doesn’t seem to give a fuck about onboarding someone.

18n50sn,Career advise for my husband?,"Ok, so, this is more of a question for my husband.

His background: 42, has about 7-8 years of experience as a manager at a pizza restaurant, makes $62,000 plus quarterly bonuses, he is very intelligent, has good computer skills, & has a bachelor's in business.

My husband has been working at his job for around 22 years now and is currently a store manager. 

When he took the place over, from what I hear, it was a disaster and going downhill. He managed through hard work to turn the place around.

However, due to the store being in a developing area full of college students, (students that go home for part of the year) his store doesn't do as well as some of the other stores in nearby cities. 

My husband struggles with this and is always comparing the numbers and how well his store is doing to the stores that are doing better. 

Due to the difference in those numbers, his bonuses are much smaller.

Lately, he's been struggling all around with his health. It's difficult to maintain a healthy weight when you work around food and it's affecting his blood pressure.
We also have almost $100,000 in debt, which as you can imagine is not easy to pay off.

We tried to get a loan to consolidate it, but we were given the run around and he's lost hope that we'll be able to do that.

We just got married in April and I already had a 9, now 10 year old child when we married, so having all the new responsibilities that come with that are extra stressors. 

We also just lost our child through miscarriage at the beginning of this month which has been difficult on him.

He's at his breaking point right now where he just doesn't feel like he's enough. He is so stressed out that he feels like locking himself away in a dark room with no light or sound and he wants to disconnect from everything.

He also hasn't been able to take care of my needs right now with everything going on, the stress, and the exhaustion and he feels guilty about that.

It hurts, but I understand he needs time.

He's so stressed out that I worry about his health. I worry that he'll either go off the deep end, or that he'll have a stroke and end up dying.

 Surviving a stroke would be even worse for him mentally.

We were talking today and he was so angry because no matter how much he does at work, his employees seem to need their hands to be held on most things. 
Employees make mistakes left and right and it seems like they don't care. One employee is emotionally sensitive and easily gets offended at everything and has meltdowns and cries all the time, He's gotta deal with an employee older than him that's hitting on an 18 yr old coworker, and making her feel uncomfortable, and another employee that took 17 pizzas to the wrong school because he wasn't paying attention so he has to remake and deliver it himself to the right location. It's all a lot on him right now.

He was talking about finding another job because the one he has now is too stressful and doesnt pay enough, but he feels like he can't even think rn.

I want to help him find another job that pays just as well as the one he has, but is less stressful than the one he's got.

I'm not sure what kind of job that would be though.

Based off of the description up top, what kind of job do you think would/could suit him? 

I actually went back to school and got trained in and got licensed for massage therapy because of similar levels of stress in the past and it's completely improved my life and changed it for the better.

18n4tmq,Is my boss gaslighting me?,"I (23F) started a new job just under two months ago, and have felt like my boss (30sF) hasn’t liked me from the start. I am new to a company where everyone has been here for years and knows everyone else personally. I have AuDHD, but haven’t told my job because I know how negative the stereotypes can be. I am very shy and awkward and will have long breaks of silence in conversations because I can’t think of anything to say. I can tell this rubs my boss the wrong way, but I’ve been trying so hard to be social and ask friendly questions here. 

I have a hard time remembering details and connecting the context of how those details work together. There were a lot of things I was told in my first week that I’ve had to ask for clarification on or ask again, and every time my boss seems annoyed at my questions. The first month was spent preparing for a massive project that the company does every holiday season, and the second month producing the project. I am the new supervisor to a department that both manages company property and works with contracted workers. Important context is my boss previously held my current position for six years, until moving up to her current position. Last year, she quit because she was overworked and the person in my position left unexpectedly. The company convinced her to come back a day later with promises of splitting her job between multiple positions, but they took a few months to fill them. Fast forward to now, she’s having to teach two new people how the company works. I understand that’s very frustrating for her. 

However, she told me there are important things to focus on during the project and is now telling me I am focusing on the wrong things because the workers either don’t like that I am new or that I am enforcing rules. To be clear, the workers who are annoyed with me don’t bother me. What bothers me is my boss telling me I did the wrong thing when I was doing what she told me to do. There have also been numerous situations where she will tell me something, then I repeat it to someone else. But once the other person tells her what I said, she pulls me aside to say she didn’t say that and I’m misunderstanding her. Instead she tells me said something with a similar meaning but softer word.

For example, last week my boss pulled me into a small room to talk privately and told me the worker’s union rep emailed her with complaints about me on the project. However, his complaints were about things she had asked me to do. She told me in this private meeting that what I was doing was completely justified, but she would come to observe for a day to make sure. While she was observing, the same worker was disrespectful towards me in front of many other people because I had asked him for piece of the company property, as I was told in the private meeting was completely justifiable. My boss pulled me aside immediately after to tell me I need to learn to pick my battles and not engage when the worker fights back on something. This felt wrong to me, but I am still new and want to do a good job, so I agreed and stopped asking that worker for that piece. 

After thinking about this for a few days, I started to feel angry and feel as if my boss was telling me to bend the rules for someone because they don’t want to comply and are disrespectful. A few incidents happened later in the week where I was disrespected by other workers, and I started to feel like they had lost respect for me because of the one public incident. Some of the other workers on my team who had seen how I’ve been treated recommended I should email the project manager, who is a step above my boss. This isn’t uncommon in this type of work, and I thought he should at least be aware of the issues I was facing. I only discussed the disrespect from the workers, and nothing about my boss as I knew she would eventually be sent the email. 

Today, she showed up to the project and asked to speak with me. She saw the email, and was angry about it. She said by emailing the project manager, I was ignoring the chain of command and should’ve instead emailed her. She then told me why all the examples of disrespect I’ve been facing were situations I brought upon myself by worrying too much about the wrong details of my job, and that I should focus on other things instead. She told me that people being annoyed with me is inevitable because I am new, and that unless someone is verbally disrespectful that nothing will be done. She kept quoting things to me that I said in my email to say “I don’t understand why you said this/felt this way because that’s not what happened. Can you explain?” She told me the worker’s union rep never filed a complaint with her, he just emailed her with concerns about me as the union rep. She said the company doesn’t even take official complaints so she doesn’t understand where I got that from. To me, this is arguing over semantics, because whether it was a “formal” complaint or not, it was still a complaint that she felt the need to talk to me privately about it. There are so many moments like this where she changes the wording and tells me I’m misunderstanding. 

I don’t know if she’s jealous of me coming in as a new person, or if she’s angry she’s still working at the company, or if she just doesn’t like me personally, but this is fishy, right? She keeps telling me I’m the problem when I was just following her directions, but apparently in the wrong way. Am I the problem here? I know I’ve had to ask her to repeat herself a few times, and I’ve made some mistakes, but this is a massive project that she knows like the back of her hand. I’m still learning the basics and meeting new people at the company. Other people on my team who I work with on the project site are telling me I’m doing a great job, and that they like me more than the person from last year. I am trying so hard to remember all the details and make the right decisions, but I keep being told conflicting things. I’m open to hearing if I am wrong, but please be kind with your words.

18n4oxi,Manager taking her time rarely teaching me my job,"Burner account just in case.

So I'm in my first job out of college in a job adjacent to my career interests. I'm doing the job I want to be doing but in an industry I don't want to be doing it for. I've been in this position for 4 months and it feels like my manager has little interest in teaching me the tasks I should be doing in this position. At this point I probably know and am comfortable with about 25% of what I'm slated to be doing. I've asked to be taught more but she just pushes it off. She's also my only point of contact for the job/tasks I'm doing as it is a small team. I don't want to go above her because I also don't want to create any drama in our team.

I don't know what to do because I want to learn more about my job so I can be useful for my team but she's just not helping me out with this. I'm holding off on looking for a position in the industry of my interest because I keep seeing people saying to wait a year after your first job out of college to apply to others.

18n3bev,Employee is recording others // playing Game of Thrones,"I work at a large professional services company that is mostly fully remote for workers. We are based out of “hubs” located in 29 states and reside within 1 hour of each hub. I have a team of 10, and we’re all remote.

There’s another team that has been playing “game of thrones” with mine bc the areas of coverage significantly overlap. We hired one of those team members a year ago bc they applied for an open position and we were desperate.

It turns out this person wasn’t a great fit and is very technically limited. I’ll call them Mike. So instead Mike tends to focus on office politics and gossip. I found out he’s been recording phone calls with someone I’ll call “Steve”. Steve works on his old team and Mike is very jealous of him as he was just promoted.

Mike pretends to be bff with Steve and milks him for tons of info he then shares with me and another manager on my team. 

However I suspect the only reason Steve is giving Mike information is because he is talking badly about me and the team. Eg I think Mike is disloyal and trying to take down both Steve and I. I certainly assume I am always being recorded. I’ve noticed Steve keeps coming out ahead of us on deliverables any time I mention them to Mike.

HR wants me to pretend the recording never happened and not mention it. How can I ruin this fake bond between Mike and Steve and ensure Mike’s manipulation doesn’t work out? I am close with Steve’s boss, but if I tell her, HR may find out too.

18n36o7,Career advice needed: responding to why I am no longer apart of x company an interview,"Background:I worked for the last 9.5 half years at a large warehouse company as an operations manager. I was let go in June of this year after being put on a PIP that was very unrealistic and out of my control of improving . I have a mortgage, two kids with a 3rd on the way so I did what I felt was best at the time and took the severance package and voluntarily resigned. Since then I’ve had several phone interviews but seem the to fail the video/in person interview. After talking with a friend I realized I seemed to stumble when asked why I am no longer with my former company and have since been unemployed for the last 6 months.

So my question is how should I respond when asked about this?
Previously I had said the company had laid off a large number of people and the lack of promotional opportunities was severely reduced so I decided to look elsewhere but my friend noted that this could make me be seen as non reliable.

Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",mrbickyrobby,6,0.8100000023841858,14,1703101086,2023-12-20 19:38:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18n36o7/career_advice_needed_responding_to_why_i_am_no/,12,2023
18n35ov,Job recommendations to move on from a specialized retail store job?,"Hello, I (26M) am looking for recommendations and advice on where to go from my current job situation.  
I am currently working in a firearm store in California for almost a year and a half. I want to move on from it because it's a high-stress, minimum wage job that requires lots of knowledge on firearm laws. I love the job and my coworkers, but I feel the skills I built up from the job can be applied somewhere that's more challenging, more impactful in the community, and with better pay.  
I'm looking for suggestions where to go from here if there's any other job that rhymes or is parallel with the job skills I'm using now. My education background is a BFA creative degree, but after getting the job after the pandemic I've been exposed to a lot more law enforcement figures that's making me rethink my future career paths and personal goal. The general idea of skills we use in the store are these skills:  
\- Learning and expressing federal and state firearm laws affecting the everyday California resident.  
\- Review, cross-reference, and collect information regarding given legal documents such as IDs, birth certificates, peace officer/military/fed credentials, FSC cards, naturalization papers, name change/marriage docs, green cards, work/student visas, etc.  
\- Inspect, build, and demonstrate safe firearm handling while recording required information of the make, model, serial number, type of firearm, caliber, and barrel length  
\- Adhered to Federal and CA firearm laws on selling and delivering firearms to civilians, peace officers,  
\- Double-check with compliance officer and manager for situations such as refund/exchange inspections, status on delivery of firearms and other items, and second opinions on customer-provided paperwork to start background check/deliver firearm to them if it's sufficient or not  
\- Calmed down disgruntled and possible firearm-ineligible customers with pose and courtesy  
\- Lifted and transported firearms and other gear weighing up to 40 lbs  
Also want to add that I have a COE (Certificate of Eligibility; California-specific requirement to work in a firearm-related business) that required passing a Live Scan so I have a clean record with no criminal history.  
I'm currently looking to dip my toe in a possible law enforcement career, specifically in the non-sworn capacity for now. I'm looking forward to take classes at a community college in the Administration of Justice program to learn about investigation methods, police writing, and fingerprint classes. I am slightly hesitant if I'm going in a path that ends up nowhere though since I'm not from a background where my family worked for law enforcement of any kind and it's not like I originally studied subjects that would be preferred for it, so I feel I'm being too late to change career paths. I'm open to suggestions if there are better jobs to aim for or if there's more I can do in my situation.

18n2218,Tips for Tough Career Decisions - Do you agree?,"Having spent some time offering career advice here and at work, I've identified some recurring patterns. I've a few tips that I believe would be beneficial to share. Here's some candid feedback – consider this a friendly heads-up.

  
**1- Prioritize What Truly Matters:** Often, I receive questions like, ""What should I do IF I receive multiple job offers?"" or ""Should I continue interviewing with Company B if I had a good interview with Company A?"" These are what I call non-decisions. Focus on securing those offers first. Once you have tangible options, decision-making becomes more purposeful.  
**2 - Criteria Over Choices:** Many people dive straight into comparing job offers and career choices without establishing decision criteria. Instead of fixating on which job to choose, consider first nailing down and ranking your personal decision criteria — factors like compensation, promotion opportunities, company culture, and learning prospects, etc. Everyone is different, and your decision criteria reflect who you are as an individual. With these criteria in place, evaluating different options becomes a more objective process.  
**3 - Dodging the Sunk Cost Fallacy:** people often stick to a decision just because they've invested time and effort into it, even if it's no longer the best choice. When making a decision, avoid clinging to the past “investments”; consider the current and future costs versus the benefits.  
Do you agree with my points on dealing with tough career decisions? Let me know your thoughts.

18n1rzc,Anonymous feedback drama - advice needed from from senior people in tech,"(Bear with me because the situation has become a bit of a Mexican telenovela.)

## Context

I'm at month 2 of a 5-month remote internship at a tech company and we regularly have ""anonymous"" feedback forms, which I never reply to because obviously they're not anonymous.

## The anonymous form

Well, last week, the PO asked us to answer another feedback form and this time she made it clear that this one was actually anonymous and begged us to be honest, because not a lot of people were answering the forms. So I did fill the form, didn't say anything negative about anyone because my experience there has truly been great. Only thing I suggested was that they'd give more behavioral feedback during our internship -- mainly because I got feedback that I should interact more with the team in our dailies, which is fair, I have a bit of trouble being more extroverted in big groups.

## The backlash

The other day the PO told us that some people wrote in their forms that they think there is too much off-topic conversation in our daily meetings (in which SM and PO are present) and that from now on, we will go straight to giving each squad's progress update and everybody that doesn't want to chat can get off the call. So now everybody is feeling self-conscious about leaving the meeting early and trying to joke their way out of the calls saying things like ""well, I'd love to stay on the call but I have xyz to do, but I wasn't me who complained haha"").

## Me being socially inept

Thing is yesterday everybody was again joking and laughing about having to leave the call and I said something like ""whoever said that kinda put everybody that doesn't stay too long on the call in a tight spot because people will naturally think it's us"". In retrospect, this could be interpreted as something a ""guilty' person would say. But what made me say that was because I took that behavioral feedback seriously and want to socialize more with the team but not in a forced way, like I \*need\* to stay on the call. Before all of this, our dailies lasted like 15-20 minutes and most people were chiming in and having a good time.

I know a big part of my problem is because I care too much what people think of me but in this scenario, I feel like it kind of matters because I'd love to be part of this company after the internship ends, it's been an awesome experience up until this hiccup. I also have a bit of social anxiety and I'm an overthinker so I don't know how to act now.,after I made that comment I feel like my SM and PO got the wrong idea of me.​

18n13bj,Higher Salary or More Long-Term Growth Opportunity,"I have been with my current company for 7 years. During that time I have been promoted 4 times, going from an entry level engineer to managing a large production team. The work environment is great, I love the team I work with with, am passionate about the product, can work remotely when needed and I have a great commute when I need to come in. My manager is good and we have discussed future career opportunities. If I stay here I would expect to continue to grow at a similar rate, or at least have options available. The company is large and has seen consistent growth YoY, so there is really no limit to the number of opportunities, though nothing is guaranteed. However, the pay increases have been typical of what most people experience when they stay at a company for a long time-fine, but not great. Currently my base is around 115k, with bonus, 401k, etc. my net comes out to around 140k. 

A recruiter reached out and has offered a job in a similar role with a base of 150k-160k (still being negotiated) for total comp 175k. This feels significant to me, as its about a 25% increase. However, the company makes a much more.. boring? product that I am not passionate about, and it's not as clear to me on future growth opportunities, or future growth of the company. The company is smaller, and more decentralized, so while I could see some potential opportunities, I may hit a ceiling much sooner at this company. 

I normally read other's posts on this subreddit and the answers seem so obvious. However, now that I'm in the situation myself I find it much harder to know what to do.

18n0q4f,Close Protection Operative without military background,"Hi everyone! I‘m currently working as a CPO in a security company in Switzerland. I went through a training program, which was organized by my company. It contained shooting training, combat training, TCCC, escort protection and security driving. There are 2 tactical shooting and 4 combat courses each month. It is mandatory to visit 6 tactical shooting and 6 combat courses every 6 months and then pass the tests, to keep the qualification as a CPO. 
I have to say that I love my job and want to get better in every aspect of it. This year I got a licensed federal diploma of higher education as a security specialist in close protection.

Now I‘m proud of my achievements, but compared to other CPO‘s I‘ve no military background. I did the basic training in the swiss army when I was 18 (now i‘m 30), but got send home after 3 months (it took 10 months to complete the service), cause of skin issues, which I had to treat in the hospital (for about 10 minutes, 2 times a week for 2 months). I begged them to stay back then, but they refused and told me to join the army after a year. The problem was that I already applied for my law studies at the university (I had other career plans back then). So I basically went to the recruitment center of the army when I turned 19 and told them they I can’t rejoin, because it destroys me mentally when I risk to get these skin issues again. They then noted that i‘m not fit for service. This was a move, which e deeply regret rn…

When I‘m in contact or have special courses with other CPO‘s or police special forces, I realize that i‘m the only with no military background, who was declared not fit for service. Even if I‘m better than some former lieutenants in combat shooting or self defense, it somehow gives me the feeling to be inferior to them. I somehow feel that I missed an important education and my work is less respected than other CPO‘s with some special force training. I feel like even when I‘ll apply for a Job as a security director for example, they‘ll always prefer the guy with the military education. Luckily I have a bachelors degree, that might help me compete with them.

I sometimes think about to leave my current job and try to persuade the recruitment section of the army to join again. The problem is, that it will throw me years back from my current career path (also lower my salary). But it gets me every time mentally that I cowardly quit when I was younger…

At first i really wanted the PM job because it seemed related to my field, but I went to the engineering subreddit and everyone was talking about how ""there's nothing worse"" than a new grad PM because ""you lose all your technical ability over the years and because obsolete"". and it pays a good 10k LESS than the admin job. i also like the benefits of the admin job better (insurance, uni will pay for my grad school fees if I decide to go which i want to at some point in the future). 

I'm taking one of them for sure because I need money.. I just don't know which one is the better career move. I guess I'm just worried i'll impact my career negatively in the long run.. it's been very hard finding a job because all jobs want you to have 5+ years of relevant field experience so I'm worried about switching back to engineering work later on.. any advice would be greatly appreciated!

18mzpjl,How to proceed when my job is forcing me to travel for work under new management?,"Hi, not sure the best place to ask for advice so I hope I’m in the right place. Also, the title isn’t completely accurate, but I had trouble shortening the issue down to a sentence.  

Basically, my company was acquired by a new company and the new company is not a good fit for me at all. My boss is the same from the previous company, but his boss is new and she’s kind of horrible to deal with. 

The worst part for me is that my job was previously 90% remote. I spent 20 hours in office last year. However, my job isn’t labeled as remote. But the office I work out of is like 10 mins away from my house, so I don’t mind going into that office every once in a while (one of the reasons I started working at the company 3 years ago was because the office was so close). But, my boss’s new boss works in the city about an hour and a half away and expects us to be in that office once every other month. I know this doesn’t sound like a lot, but I have a medical condition that prevents me from driving long distances, and I’m really not interested in a job that requires me to go into to the city. I was offered a job during the acquisition, but I would not have accepted it if I knew this would be the case. It’s an entry level job that doesn’t really pay that much, and I also accepted the job before I knew how bad the new management is. They told me my job duties and mostly everything else would remain the same, but it hasn’t at all. 

Needless to say, I’m looking for other jobs and sending out applications every day. We had to go into the city office this month, so we don’t have to go back until February, but my boss already told us to make sure we have it marked on our calendars to be in the city on a specific day. 

Tbh I’d rather be fired than go back to that office. I’m hoping I can find another job by then, but if I can’t, what should I do? How should I proceed? My boss already knows I’m not keen to go in, but he’s more focused on pleasing the big boss. 

Any advice would be appreciated. I really don’t get paid enough to be stressing about this, but the idea of quitting my job without having something else lined up and not being able to get unemployment is terrifying to me. The job would be bearable if it continued to be 90% remote as it was at the old company, but the new management has made it very clear that things are changing and it seems like it’s very much not for me.",slinkman05,1,1.0,1,1703092494,2023-12-20 17:14:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18mzpjl/how_to_proceed_when_my_job_is_forcing_me_to/,12,2023

I’m bored to death at work. I’ve been doing the same tasks for 2 years and I very rarely get an error reports. It seems like over the years my responsibilities at work have actually lessened. 

There was literally no difference between being an Eng II and Eng III. 

I’ve asked my leadership half a dozen times to be looked at for project manager and every time I ask I get dead end answers like “there’s definitely steps to take to get you there” and then the conversation ends and I go back to my hole.

Last couple weeks I stopped using the tracking software and started putting times manually ( coz I hear someone who was working for 2 years doesnt use it coz its micromanagement and they dint like it). I dont its optional and stopped using it but I did work about the same effort. 

3 weeks later I get a mgs from the HR with some pto rules that also mentions about using the productvity software as a compulsion and no manual entry. I started using it again but now feel my comoany doesnt trust employees. Even 10 minutes the notification that shows that a ss has been taken is like a knife on the chest.

I’m trying to get some professional advice here, and I appreciate all opinions either in my favor or not. It is a big text, so I’m also giving a summary:

Summary:
_______________________________________
I am a 12 years experienced engineer/project manager, internationally trained, fully licensed, mba, pmp. I’ve been working for 1 year at a given company. My leadership has changed and now I am working under some pretty stupid people, who are less qualified than me and do not seem to have a clue of what they’re doing.
However, the company has made accommodations for me due to an unexpected health condition that has left me temporarily unable to drive, climb ladders, and work at heights. I do not know if I should make a move and look elsewhere or just chill and handle all this bs, the stress of a toxic, unhealthy, unsafe, dirty workplace, feeling that I’m not getting any professional development whatsoever.

Any advice?
_______________________________________

Full story:

A brief description about me: I’m an internationally trained Engineer, I’ve been residing and working  in Toronto, On for 4 years now. I have a total 12 years of engineering experience in Manufacturing, Oil and Gas, and Project Management. I’ve got an MBA, PMP Certification, P.Eng and all that good stuff. Now, here we go:

I’ve spent my first 3 years working at a shitty company, not officially as an engineer, unfortunately, but performing and acting as one. The hole COVID uncertainty kept me from looking elsewhere. Now I’ve been with a new company for 1 year, a larger one, as an Engineer, got more money and more benefits. However, the plant I work at, has recently been acquired by this big company, and this place has proven to be just a disaster, such a toxic, dirty, unsafe, and problematic environment. I do not usually say stuff like this, and I feel like I sound arrogant but:

Most of the employees at this location (just over 60%) have been here for 20+ years, most of them are approaching the age of retirement, no knowledge was retained, meaning: No documents, no drawings, no formal procedures, etc. Obviously a cultural change must happen.
The original leadership is being replaced and there seems to be a hiring problem at this company. They only hire people who do not seem to know what they’re doing. (I don’t like saying this, as stated before, but I have no other way to explain it.)
My manager was changed as well, and he was an exception. He was an engineer with around 25 years of experience in this industry. Great mentor. Now I am under a lady who is younger, less experienced, and with less qualifications. None of it is an issue, honestly, except for the fact that she’s proven to have no clue of what she is doing with constant stupid requests.
Her boss (associate director level) was also recently hired and, once more, I don’t like saying this, but he is just a talker.

Having said all that, I do know that this is not the environment I want to work in, and the decision seems to be easy: “Just look for something else, and leave”. But, unfortunately, I’ve been through some health issues this year that have temporarily limited my ability to drive, work at heights, and climb ladders. This company made accommodations, providing me with Uber commutes daily, for example. I’m not sure If I would find the same elsewhere right off the bat. So my dilemma is: “This place is sickening me, I currently hate my job, hate my bosses, and the workplace as a whole. But, at the same time, I do not know if I will find an equivalent position with equivalent accommodations having these temporary issues.”

Any advice?

18mwu7d,Seeking advice: how can I put together a performance review for my supervisor?,"I work for a big retail company most people have never heard of. I'm at the low end, just an hourly worker one level below supervisor. I'm like the #2 person on the team, one step above everyone else and one below my boss.  

This year HR accidentally assigned everyone performance reviews for us to fill out for ourselves in a site called Pathways. We weren't supposed to get them but we had to fill them out anyway. They're mainly for everyone above us in the company, like my boss. 

My boss has one every year, filled out by her boss. 

My boss is new to being a supervisor, and while out team is #1 in our division, I receive complaints from my other employees about her. Sometimes they call me just to vent about how frustrating it is to work with her. 

These are things her supervisor doesn't know about because no one has the balls to call our boss's boss because she's really detached from our work and only interacts with our boss. 

I think boss's boss needs to know these things, and they never presented us with any sort of performance review from the employees on their boss for us to fill out. 

Advise I'm seeking: is there a way for me to approach my employees and record their complaints and then compile them in a performance review for the boss's boss to look over?

18mwmjn,Interviewed with a dummied down resume & I was over qualified they said,"  
TL;DNR - I applied to a lower role in May, I was overqualified. Now they have a director level role open, which is more at my level. 

  
So in May I was unemployed and I created a second resume dummied down to analyst level vs Manager / Sr Manager to get something quick. I interviewed with the F500 hiring manager and the recruiters came back after with ""they said you're overqualified"". I've been consulting since then, but they ended it the day before Thanksgiving.

  
Part of the reason I did so well in the interview is that 15 years ago I did a contract job for them, which I can't disclose as I was fired. It's not even in my resume, so I know the business, department heartbeat, etc. I think that's one of the things that threw myself under the bus during the analyst interview as I ""knew too much"" ,not talking about proprietary stuff, just they style they operate the area and that's what I followed in my interview.

  
Yesterday an Associate Director role came open; FML.... It won't report to the manager I previously interviewed with. Her role reports up to this new role (she's been with the co. 1 year). They created this role in 2022. I can check off all the boxes in the required field.

  
I'm going to apply to the new role via their normal channels on the portal, but I'm thinking i have to give the manager i interviewed with some type of head's up... I don't want to be eliminated b/c I obviously reverse lied (new phrase lol) on my prior resume. I'm sure she will be one of the parties doing the interview besides the Director of Accounting. She might not even see my resume, but I'm thinking they will want me to interview with her before I interview with the Director who comes from EY. AM I fucked?

I (F32) have been working in tech for over last 8 years. Last 3 as a product manager in larger companies. It took me a lot to get there and money's been great. I don't suffer any mistreatment or any particular thing but I feel a ton of void since I moved onto this career path. It hasn't been rewarding even a bit except for compensation part. I tried switching companies (been to startup, been to a silicon valley giant), domains, didn't help. Still hate the idea of doing the same, boring stuff everyday. Perhaps I've been naive but I hoped for some impact, sense of accomplishment and I got none of it so far.

I'm a 30-year-old Italian guy currently based in Italy, but my journey has taken me through four incredible years in China, where I became fluent in Mandarin.

The role is as an executive assistant to the managing partner, who has recently acquired an Italian luxury business. He's optimistic about growth and hints at the potential for me to return to Italy in 1-2 years or for my girlfriend to join me in Hong Kong.

The salary increase is substantial, and the opportunity in Hong Kong is promising, but I'm grappling with whether I might be overlooking crucial aspects in this evaluation.

I had an in-depth conversation with the managing partner, and while he seems promising, I'm conflicted about prioritizing my personal life and well-being over my career ambitions.

18mus93,Could you help me decide between two internships?,"Hello everyone. I have gotten two offers from two very big companies in their respective fields. One is Ericsson for account manager position and one is Roche for technical operations analyst. I am studying industrial engineering. I would really appreciate help.  
  
**Ericsson:**  
  
Pros: More friendly managers, More flexible work, pays 8k more per year, direct interaction with VP of sales  
  
Cons: Smaller company (still global 500), Sales job (I might want more technical position)  
  
**Roche:**  
  
Pros: Third biggest pharma company in the world, Technical job with exposure to many departments  
  
Cons: Less flexible work, less pay, work duration does not fit me fully so I might leave earlier",Standard_Ad_8327,1,0.5,1,1703079474,2023-12-20 13:37:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18mus93/could_you_help_me_decide_between_two_internships/,12,2023

18mreg3,I was lied to about a secondment opportunity and now I have to go back to my toxic old role. What should I do?,"I’ve worked at my corporate job (in Melbourne Australia) for just over 2 years now, in which I was completely and utterly depressed, drinking heavily mainly major mental health issues from some seriously psychotic micromanagement management.

Throughout this I pulled through and outshined everyone in my team, my KPI’s were at 55% above what is considered “high performance” as I just wanted to get the f*ck out of there as I had friends working in other parts of the business having a completely different experience, so it was not a company wide experience.

There was an opportunity for a secondment role for 3 months, in which I went through the interview process and ended up getting, I have been loving it & have also been high performing and have achieved great results and implemented processes saving the business money and time, that was well received by a lot of people, and my manager.

I really wanted to make this permanent and I was told in the interview this secondment can be extended if I’m enjoying it and performing well. I was never told a guarantee of permanent role but it was possible and depended on budgets, understandably as it was in an area that I’d call “product development” or “strategy” for future products, generally an area that’s got low profit and high budget for what we are doing.

I continued through learnt so much new information and skills through the role and loved it, and have a great team, I made who I have been reporting to aware I want to stay extend the secondment or be made permanent. I received a coded response that didn’t indicate anything, but they’d mentioned they want to keep me if they can, and they’d have to confirm later on. 

*note that the person who’d interviewed me wasn’t my direct manger I reported to, however they were assigned to project taking them off this team after 2 weeks of me being there*

I started to feel very uncomfortable about going back to my old role given the management being psychotic and my mental health, I emailed the head of our department stating formally I want to extend and or be made permanent, over email. I didn’t even get a reply from them or any in person acknowledgement. 

I did bring up this with my direct manager a few times again stating I want to stay etc.

Today I was saying goodbye to another employee as they were taking extended leave over Christmas and they were coming back after my secondment was ending before they got back. I said something like “I may or may not be here when you are back, have a good break” my manager overheard me and yelled out “your secondment is ending though” (in a manner like I should have known, not in a rude way) and I looked shocked and embarrassed, as this was the first I’d heard it. Then they looked embarrassed and said “xxx person said they told you, I’m so sorry bla bla bla” 

I was really upset and angry this is how I found out, as there were a lot of people around and everyone I work with knows how much I want to stay. I got home and I go ahead and check emails from the manager who’d left for a project and had interviewed me, finding a thread I never looked at about my bonus and pay, them clarifying this with management from the original role, basically saying I still get the bonus, which they forwarded to me for clarity.

This email thread had started a very long time and was well before my interview, including all comms about the recruitment. 

This info was definitely not meant to sent to me, she clearly made a mistake. There was a lot more details I wasn’t meant to see basically saying there was only scope for 3 months and that they need me to come back to my old role and they don’t have any opportunity to extend the secondment. And no mention of a opportunity to be made permanent in this role.

There was also emails confirming from the hiring manager stating this seccondment role was only created due to some extra tasks others had taken on for the next 3 months, while I’d be there.

I feel so disrespected and lied to at this stage, and I’d rather be unemployed than go back to my old role, I was so suicidal and depressed and I just feel like I was told this information so the secondment sounded more attractive and so I’d “work hard” for a role that wouldn’t exist or had any opportunity to be permanent.

I don’t know what to do anymore there’s no paper trail or me being given an option to “extend” a secondment as it was noted to me in person on multiple associations. I was also offered another job at another workplace that my friends work, which I turned down. There was also many other jobs I would have liked to have applied for at my work.

And now it’s Christmas, a time no one is hiring. my secondment ends in 3 weeks, I’m being forced into a job I fucking hate and was miserable in. Is there any corporate crap I can pull to get out of this? I literally am at the point I’m going to quit my job if I have to go back.

18mr5xh,Career dead end?,"Hi all. Im 29M, a Landscaper in Melbourne Aus.
Ive been landscaping for almost 14 years, didnt do an apprenticeship but rather got my qualification through having 10 years experience and still did all the test, paperwork and everything a regular apprentice would of done.
I started off in domestic work and very quickly transitioned out of that in to Commericial. After doing that for a few years I moved more into the Civil/Infrustructure and Hardscapes space where I really enjoy and I think I thrive.
I worked my way up from Labourer to Leading hand/Juniour Supervisor.
Now after very unfortunate timing and circumstances in October last year when my Father passed away from a short and incredibly awful battle with Lung cancer.
I found myself losing my (at the time) 3 month old supervisor position on about $100k a year at a new company and failing around trying to make any job I could stick.
For a few months I bounced around from place to place until I ended up back working locally for a guy and I am now the only employee besides himself the Boss.
We get along pretty well, he does look after me and we dont work too hard and do do some cool stuff.
But as a married man with a Mortgage, a widowed mother and a wife who would like to start a family, the $1000 a week after tax isnt quite cutting it. Not compared to when i was able to make overtime and being paid more to begin with.
Ive got a Diploma in Building and construction Project Management, Qualified Landscaper, Skidsteer, Excavtor and Heavy Rigid truck Licence.
After falling out of the big infrastructure spaces, should I try to refocus my career amd get my way back into it? Should I try to get into High end domestic work (although ive never really felt domestic was the place for me) or should I look at switching careers entirely and moving to one that has better pay and oppotunities for advancement and securing fa family future?",Vraska28,1,1.0,0,1703066529,2023-12-20 10:02:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18mr5xh/career_dead_end/,12,2023

18mpxy4,What type of workplace politics is this?,"I passed my interview smoothly for a company but the supervisors in charge of me were different people from my hiring manager. On the first day of work, I did not receive any information from supervisors on what their current project is about and what are my clear tasks to complete. I got all of the information from my colleagues. The supervisors would individually assign tasks for every member, including the interns, except for me. 

Despite not being informed by supervisors, they would reprimand me very harshly for not being able to contribute to the project and for not being able to understand about it in depth. This is despite me getting most of the information from my colleague who might not be clearer than the supervisors about it. They were also rather rude and cold to me, behaving as if they never wanted me there in the first place. I felt extremely left out and isolated because of how this is arranged. 

Thankfully, I was able to do tasks because I asked my colleague to share some of his work to me. Thus, I still was able to contribute despite my supervisor's treatment. However, I was still treated harshly by my supervisor.

My supervisors justify their treatment by saying this is the norm for most companies and that they have intentions to let me leave because of how awful my attitude is.  Their treatment of me made me extremely down and depressed. It makes me feel like I'm not wanted at all, and makes me feel useless despite the fact that I was never given any clear

If they wanted to hire me, why would they behave as if I shouldn't be there? Is there some workplace politics that has nothing to do with me, but somehow I got entangled into it? Let's say, the Hiring Manager has a rivalry relationship with my supervisor, and they wanted to pick on my hiring manager by behaving terribly to me, this is so as to force me to resign or mess up, giving them more excuses to pick on the hiring manager. What other politics could there be?

18mojf0,At what point should I quit my job and dedicated myself to full time job search.,"I graduated as a mechanical engineer in May 2023. I began working for a relatively small company in Orange County, California 3 months before my graduation. I was hired as a mechanical engineer but my tasks are pretty broad from sometime making tool path with MasterCAM for machining aluminum parts, to coding for internal projects, and most recently began doing electrical design work and even PCB Design. As much as I enjoy what I do. I can't shake away the fact that what I am being paid is very low.  
When I was hired we agreed on a salary wage of 52K per year before tax. I only agreed because I was told after 3 months( once I graduated) we could renegotiate pay. That said, When I approached my boss he pretty much told me to wait more time. I did as he suggested. However it appears to make no difference because after an additional 5 months I have not been given a pay boost.  
Recently I have began applying to jobs in and out of state because I realize the company does not appreciate me as an engineering and instead just want to milk me for as long as I let myself. The issue I find is it is hard to set up interview hours because I still work and I don't have the work ethic of just answering calls while im on the clock. I find asking myself when should I put in 2 weeks+ notice so I can focused full time on job search again.  
  
TLDR:  
I currently work for small company, although I enjoy my work a lot I hate the very low pay(52k gross salary/ year). I have been applying but its hard to set up time while I also work so when should I just put 2 weeks notice and dedicate to full time search.

18mmhzj,Should I (21M) quit my job and go to college?,"TL;DR: My job is draining, I don't really have a career, and I am considering dropping it all and going to college.  
  
I had to stop myself from writing out my entire life's story for this because it all feels so relevant, but also because I have also never really spoken about this with anyone. I ended up condensing it into two \*brief sections: '""The Past"" (for the context I think you need) and ""The Present"" (for the context you actually need), the latter of which is comprised of two sub-categories: ""My thoughts"" and ""Reality"". The result, I think, is a rough synopsis of the last 3 years of my life, and a cross-section of my thought processes that definitely highlights my worse qualities. Feel free to skip around and read what you think is necessary. Okay here we go:  
  
The Past (very, very abridged):  
  
I narrowly graduated high school with a 2.1 GPA. I ""decided"" not to go to college on account of a few different factors:  
  
\- None of the adults in my life had careers related to their degrees (if they had degrees at all).  
  
\- My closest friend decided not to go to college (it is important to note that, thanks to his parents, he will likely never have to work a day in his life if he doesn't want to).  
  
\- I did some research and read about all the ways people have succeeded in life without degrees, as well as some articles on the declining value of degrees. Yes, this research was absolutely biased.  
  
\- I was/am lucky enough to have the opportunity to work for my mom's company, which is part of an industry where a degree is not typically required.  
  
\- I had no clue what I would major in, as I had no passions or specific career aspirations.  
  
\- I loathed school (hence the 2.1 GPA).  
  
I ended up taking a job in my mom's industry, and have sat in a cubicle 9 hours per day, every weekday ever since. The next couple years after this were wildly enlightening - among other things, I discovered that I was not the sharpest crayon in the shed. Fast-forward through the subsequent journey of self-discovery, and we arrive in the present.  
  
The Present:  
  
My Thoughts:  
  
Through my lengthy \~1 year journey of self-discovery, I have now reached my zenith as a person, and everything about myself, my past, and the world is perfectly clear to me. Just kidding. After working in a few different entry/intermediate level generic office-job roles, I have realized I cannot do this forever. Do you remember that scene about the cover letters on the TPS reports from the movie Office Space? That's basically what my work is like. I have discovered that I really want to do things like make a comfortable wage and feel fulfilled, and neither of those things are anywhere in sight down the path I am currently headed. This quarter i began to pick up an interest in programming, and despite the seemingly horrific prospects of landing an entry level developer role any time soon in the current market, I have been giving a lot of thought to the idea of going to college for a software engineering/cs degree. I feel that it may not only aid in progressing (or rather, creating) my career, but also give me a few more years to be a kid while I still can. Perhaps most enticing, is the opportunity to have a high quality education and actually learn things - something I now crave (not just CS and programming, but also music, math, psychology, etc.).  
  
Reality:  
  
I have a job and bills. If I decided to go to college, it wouldn't just mean I take out student loans - it would also mean  
  
\- I quit my job - even with a couple months of notice, they won't be thrilled about this. I also worry it may reflect poorly on my mom.  
  
\- If things don't work out, my current job likely won't be available when I come back.  
  
\- I sell my car to get rid of the payment (this isn't a big deal but there are some more family politics involved).  
  
\- I would end up having a resume with a rather odd looking timeline (Is this off-putting to employers?)  
  
\- The four points above are really the only changes/conflicts worth noting, but there are enough smaller things that would need to change as well that this decision would basically amount to a complete shift in lifestyle which, frankly, is a scary thing.  
  
Am I blowing things out of proportion? Maybe a little... anyways - what do you all think? Is 20 too late for college to be worth it? Am I in too deep? Am I trying to keep? Is CS/SWE even going to be worth it as a major? Would it be smarter to stick it out the office gig until I land a better management role, and then just enjoy life through my hobbies outside work? Tell me anything that comes to your mind, please. :)",rainsttormss,6,0.8799999952316284,11,1703048577,2023-12-20 05:02:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18mmhzj/should_i_21m_quit_my_job_and_go_to_college/,12,2023
18mmdzl,Is it normal to check emails outside of work hours?,"I currently work in a small logistics company, standard 9-5, M-F, and I am going on my 5th year at this company, I am 1 of the 2 hourly employees (9 total staff, not owners). It seems that there were expectations that I was not aware of, as recently I have recently returned from a 3 business day trip, and an Email came in Friday after 5 PM, and the emailer asked for updates on Saturday, and Sunday. 

When I returned from my PTO, my boss had a 1 on 1 with me to go over things, and brought up this email and why no one responded to it. I explained my manager didn't get a chance to look at it due to them busy with their stuff, and I was on PTO and it was over the weekend. He then explained that it was a expectation to check your emails outside of work hours, however I was only asked to check my emails on my extended vacation not my recent trip. He then explained that i may lose my bonus incentives since i have not been checking my emails outside of work hours, which was never brought up as a condition for this incentive. 

Additionally since my time at the company the company shrank in size, and have been passing former worker's workloads to other people with no replacement. Since my department has been slowing down he did bring up that i may also need to switch to part time since, my work obligations are only tied to the company from 9-5.

18mlvxm,Old Boss Wants Me Back...,"This is a lot to digest so I'm going to break it down the best way I could:

I (27/F) used to work for a small company a little over a year ago. The reason I left was because I wasn't getting paid enough ($56K) and disliked one of my coworkers (who still unfortunately works there). Yesterday, I got an email from my old boss (also the owner of the company) asking me how I am, and if I would be open to have a conversation with him since they have new projects that will kick off in the coming year and they are needing a Lead Designer, which would then be a higher position than when I used to work there. I liked working there because I get to work from home 2x a week, and our office is just 2 blocks away from my apartment so I would just walk there. I also get a lot of flexibility when I need to run errands. The issue I'm seeing is, I don't really see or hear about people going back to their old companies and it worries me a bit to even entertain thought of it.

My current job though was good at the beginning, as a Design Project Manager I was getting paid way more ($80K), worked in more upscale projects that are out of state. Recently however, we got fired from one of our projects, and after that my boss started to nag me saying that I should be more proactive, and so I started to hate the job. I felt like I was being blamed a little bit and I feel like I'm not being given new projects due to that. Another thing too is this job requires me to be at the office 5x a week, and the drive time which takes 1 hour each way for 10 miles is starting to get to me.

I guess I'm needing advice because I wouldn't know what to do in this position... what would you do?",honeytauri,5,0.8600000143051147,5,1703046550,2023-12-20 04:29:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18mlvxm/old_boss_wants_me_back/,12,2023
18mktsr,I have no idea what I am doing on my new project and want to cry.,"I work in consulting and just started a new project. I essentially onboarded myself yesterday. I am on the verge of a huge breakdown because this is the first time I have felt truly incapable. 


There’s a ton of people on PTO for the holidays. On my day to day team (which will just be me and my manager), my manager has been OOO for a week. Someone was filling in for them but now they are OOO. This leaves just me and our senior manager in the interim, who I have been communicating with directly.


For context, I have minimal experience communicating with someone so senior regularly and I have struggled with how to approach them. I feel like my reputation has been tarnished for my lack of communication. 


For example, today I reached out to the senior manager in the morning and asked for where I can support. He connected me with the person who was filling in. I messaged the senior manager after and said I was reviewing our initial materials. Later in the day, the senior manager told me to start on a task (that should’ve taken ~1 hour IMO). I felt frozen, didn’t complete the task, and didn’t send a follow up on where it was at. 


I care *deeply* about doing quality work and the lack of clarity is killing me. My manager will be back later this week, but until then I am on my own. I plan to message the senior manager tomorrow morning with a draft of what he asked for. However, I’m not sure how to proceed after that. I benefit a lot from live conversations and it’d help me to talk to the senior manager live for clarity on his priority items before my manager is back, but I am not sure what the etiquette is on this. I was invited to a client call tomorrow as well.

18mjaqq,I need advice on choosing a career path.,"I can't choose a career path.

So far, I've narrowed it down, and using reddit as a last resort. I can't choose between being a lawyer, or a civil engineer. I plan to do atleast  6 years of military services out of high school (for the benefits), and then enroll in a good college. Here's my dilemma 

- I've wanted to be a civil engineer for as long as I can remember,  no matter what, I've always circled back to it. (Except this time ofc)

- I want a high paying job, and don't want to be bound by long contracts.

- I'm an argumentative person, and have good debate skills. 

- I'm bad at math, which is a core foundation in engineering. 

- I'd enjoy working on cases, as they seem so very enticing 

- I've always wanted to build a house,  or big memorable building/monument 

- I want to get a masters, PHD, etc, abt actually use it. I want it to serve a purpose besides bragging rights. 

- I want to have time to travel the world,  abt not be working 25/8

I could cruise into retirement at a job I dislike, or I can retrain for a job I am certain I would enjoy but would have to work for much longer.

I will not regain my current income for a minimum of 5 years. However, after several years (in my HCOL area) I can expect to earn over $100k. My current job is dangerous and increasingly hard on my body. On the other hand, a person can work as a counselor well into their seventies.

https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/s/1q6IHuwBZK

Here's my previous post. 

I had asked hoping for growth ideas, as well as what I should do next. It's been almost 3 full weeks. I've already applied for unemployment, figured out health insurance, applying for positions, etc. That stuff was fairly easy for me to figure out. My vague post was left like that to see what kind of advice I may receive. I've had several phone interviews, 3 in person interviews. But I'm realizing I don't have a good answer why I am gone as I don't know what I did wrong. Here's some more info: I was never written up, I was never given a PIP, I never had called in or missed work, I never had an official or unofficial conversation with my supervisor for improvement. I had asked my supervisor for goals, directions, feedback, etc. Was never given anything except a vague BS answer for something I was already doing. ""Lower turnover, hire more people"" was the answer. I hired more people than they have ever hired 1 year, more than doubled the number from the previous year which was the highest amount. 

I believe I know why I was let go, which was lack of a good relationship with 2nd in command who was om the same level as me. However, I don't know. I tried to call THE HR Director to receive feedback but no response. 

Issue #1 with a half solution - I have applied to several positions, no feedback on why I was declined even for a phone screen for positions I feel I am qualified for. Maybe it's my resume? If so, I will post here for resume help (my half solution). Any other ideas why I may not receive a phone call? 

Issue #2a I don't have any real skills outside my positions i have had, so applying for something not HR won't get me far and I need to make XYZ wage. How do I grow and improve myself while not working? 

Issue #2b I have an idea for HR growth which is get certified in PHR and SHRM-CP but those cost money, that I don't know if I can afford because I don't know if it will help. 

Issue #3 I lost my job probably due to a bad relationship, how do I become more personable and grow if i know that much but don't have a foot in the door to have a learning and humble mindset for the next position I may have?",sirspike345,1,1.0,0,1703035564,2023-12-20 01:26:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18mi9gf/next_steps_after_involuntary_term_for_hr_manager/,12,2023

18mgaur,"19m, college sophomore, undecided major, need advice","I am a musician. That's what I want to try to do with my life, and I believe it's possible, but I don't think it's a good college path. I was thinking about transferring to a more expensive school and going for their audio production/engineering but I'd have to take out at least 30 or 40 grand in loans and that seems... ill advised, for what I'd be getting out of the degree (essentially just connections. An audio production or engineering degree don't really do shit for you in the music industry; I have basically a full ride to my current University.) I am a talented writer, I love writing, but getting my degree in Creative Writing or English also seems ill advised for lack of career opportunities.

I was doing research into freelance writing, and how a big part of freelance writing is copywriting (writing the text for ads and company social media posts and such) and making brochures, etc. which all seems to go hand in hand with marketing. So I'm thinking about doing marketing, which my University offers a B.S. in. I'm going to try to talk to some department people and maybe my advisor and see if they think I could kind of like combine my writing with marketing. My girlfriend majors in Digital Advertising and minors in marketing at the university I was thinking about going to audio production for, and her program seems like something I would be good at.

I'm also just worried that my dreams of a music career will die when I declare as anything other than music and I'll get caught up in working and school (I currently do not work). I know, this all sounds immature and like ""yeah no shit that's how life works"" but my parents have always fully financially supported me and I've never had a reason to get a job until now (wanting to get my own place other than the dorms at University).

18meqqi,Conflicted between staying at my new job or accepting the other job offer,"Hey everyone about a month ago I interviewed at two different companies for two different positions. 

Job one is a HR generalist at a nursing home for 25/hr 

Job two is an employment counselor for a stable  non profit 24/hr 

Initially I wanted the employment counselor position more because it felt more meaningful working in the community and with immigrants. 
 
The nursing home offered me the HR generalist position and start day sooner then the other job so I accepted and Ive been working here for a week. I like this company bc they really compassionate towards the residents & employees. Leadership is open minded here and willing to cross train and let us be involved in different aspects of the business. I have my own nice size office for the first time & the pay here is $1 more than the other. I also like the facility bc I really enjoy elderly people and the residents make the job feel more meaningful then I previously thought. I’m still in orientation so I haven’t done my actual job duties or experienced working directly with my manager . It’s only me and her in Hr so that might be a lot of pressure to be perfect vs jobs where there’s multiple ppl in the department.  I am  a little concerned about being micro managed or it being a bigger deal if I request vacation or call out sick ever since it’s just us two. My other concern for now is it takes me 3 buses to get to work. I have to wake up at 6am to be at work by 9am. Two of three of the bus rides are only 22 mins a piece & one is 5 mins. It’s only a 22 min car ride from my house however and I am working on getting a car. When I get paid I will even Uber some mornings to have less commute stress. 

The employment counselor position con is only that is $1 less in pay.  And of course I’d feel bad leaving the company I’m at because I like the ppl here. But job 2 has a hybrid work schedule. For two weeks of the month, you go 3 days to office, the other two weeks of the month u go to the office twice a week. Id be saving money staying home & less stressed. I also would have a less chance to be micro managed since I’d be apart of a larger team, and meeting with clients outside of the office sometimes. Leaving the office to work in additional locations during work hours is refreshing sometimes and I like the variety . This position starts in January . If I take this position I will have to let down the team I’m with. And one last point is I’m worried about how far could my career go as an employment counselor, as I wouldn’t transition into social work they don’t really make good money. I asked the company where do you go from starting as an employment counselor & they basically said you’d go into leadership or another department. 

Benefits aren’t too different for both.  

HR seems more easier to move into 80-100k salaries if I became hr manager or he business partner eventually. Job one will pay for my hr cert..

18mem1h,Quitting job to study a Master,"I am a Mechatronics Engineer and currenrly I am working in a university as a laboratorist in a Robotics laboratory. However I have been planning my studies abroad for almost 2 years, because I've always wanted to do a Master in Germany. 

When I gradueted it was very difficult for me to get a job, despite I am on the top of my class and I have pusblished an article before grad. I searched a lot and applied to many places. Then, one day it was lucky that I found that in my mother's town rhere was a Robotics laboratory in a university (I lived in another city). I've always been into researching and academic life and this was perfect for me. 

I wrote an e-mail to a professor that works in the laboratory. He never answered. So I tell my mother that and then she asked her friends if there is a place available there in the laboratory (she did that since it is a small town and everyone knows each other). The fortune was that my mom's friend's husband is the  director of this laboratory and was needing someone who works as a laboratorist there. My mom sent him my CV. This was February 2023. Her friend told my mother that they need me. Then in March he told me that I have to applied in a online hiring room. I did that. Just in May they called me to an interview which I think I did really well. Then I get hired. 

I have been working since May 15th there. People are excellent, starting from my boss (my mom's friend's husband) and the other professors. However, I do not do a lot of work here. Almost I do nothing. I just help students when they need assistance, but I do not contribute in any research or similar. This lab is underutilized and so do I there. 

As I mentioned at the beggining I have always wanted to do a Master. I applied and I got admitted in a university in Germany, so I have to quit my job in February to prepare my way to Germany and start my studies in April. 

The point is: How can I tell my boss? Since he was the same person that gave me a hand of help to get hired. It's been just 8-9 months since I get hired.

18me686,I have a gaslighting manager and I don't appreciate his manipulation efforts,"Hi everyone,

I work for a start-up in a 100 year old company. We're relatively new but we bring a lot of income to the business. I am not part of the sales team but I essentially create the ""product"" that is being sold. It is a quite toxic team - we have scaled our revenues by at least 4x in the past year but my team count has stayed the same, so to keep up with demand we work a lot of unpaid overtime. BC my direct team doesn't directly bring in revenue, we are often deprioritized and the sales team gets more resources.

Whenever something wrong happens and we troubleshoot (and to my POV, progress from the situation), my manager comes back and says that the entire department is blaming me and he was trying to defend me. He's even gone on to say that he spent his entire day in meetings just defending me but when I asked other people who were in the same meetings I was obviously NOT the topic of discussion. This has happened multiple times where it turns out that no one was blaming me and everyone was just trying to problem solve.

Recently, my team has gone through some organizational changes. My manger claims that he is the reason for these, and is asking for my undivided and vocal support (note: he is quite incompetent and does not have any understanding of any of his direct reports jobs, but often speaks up for us and introduces new useless processes that only add to our workload, despite how understaffed we are. he constantly embarrasses himself by his lack of knowledge in our field. i could speak about his incompetency for days but won't lol). He even went on to say that again the entire department was blaming me for our latest P1 and told me to not trust anyone else outside of our direct team. I proceeded to then speak to my coworker (who is not part of my direct team, but we work very closely together and have a great relationship). Apparently my manager said word-for-word the same thing to him (just switching out some details to make it more relevant) and pretty much told him not to trust me not to repeat this conversation to me, as well that my coworker that was being blamed for the P1 again by the entire department.

I have been battling these kinds of conversations and toxic conversations for the past year since he joined. Now I have proof that I am not going crazy and he is trying to manipulate me or scare me. The last time he tried gaslighting me, I told him I flat out don't care if the entire company blames me and that it doesn't bother me. I am invested in improving and growing with the team. He was shocked and told me I *should* care and otherwise, it would impact my career.

I would love to do something petty that puts a stop to this. I am tired of him creating all this drama when I'm just trying to keep my head down and do my job. Any suggestions? I am considering talking to his manager about this, who he seems to have some sort of vendetta against. He says that she is the one who is constantly blaming me, despite the fact that she recently put up new guidelines for working that clearly states that a) feedback is always welcome b) there is no blaming others and c) hierarchy must be abolished and we must come through with an open-mind.

18mdi9z,Can my significant others beliefs affect my career as an up and coming writer?,"I female 29 am a published author. I write primary children's books, short stories, and poems. I am engaged to a very loving and nonviolent 54 year old man who has been just absolutely amazing to me. 

My belief systems are more central thinking. I'm not a conservative nor a liberal. I see good and bad with both sides. I pick the lesser of two evils or try to at least. When I was younger I was very very very liberal but as I grew older, I realized they're not all that great either. My fiance is nazi but in the white separatist, under the radar, doesn't go to rallies, doesn't have any form of social media, doesn't bother anyone sort of way. He just has some very hateful views towards a few groups of people but he doesn't bother them or is mean to them. In fact he has Spanish friends. The only marking on him is a couple small burned on swastikas on his arms. Only one is truly noticable if you're really looking. But no tattoos. 

In this cancel culture where anyone can be canceled for anything nowadays. How could this affect my career if it were to get out that my future husband was a Nazi? 
Remember, I am not a Nazi, I am not racist. I teach lessons against racism in my childrens book series. I believe everyone is entitled to their opinions, no matter what they are, as long as they aren't physically harming anyone (which he isn't). I love him, he is good to me, he doesn't try to sway my beliefs nor do I try to change him. 

But the general public, primarily the left, who would have more of an issue with this when it comes to me writing children's books, even though I talk about love, peace, understanding emotions, respect and kindness. I'm not JK Rowling making millions of dollars for my company. They'd get rid of me at a whiff of hot topic trouble. 

What do you think the cancel culture club would say if something like this was leaked or found out? He isn't hiding it, I'm not hiding it. But we're not loud and proud about it. I'd just like to know what the general public would think of someone who's not a Nazi married to a Nazi? 

I know if this was widely found out, one of my illustrators would quit for sure as she is a hardcore liberal. I'm not sure if my youth art program would launch or if schools would even want me to attend. I want to work with PBS and I'm not sure if that would be possible if it was found out in today's climate. 
What is the general opinion on this? Reddit users tend to not hold back. I just need to know what I'm up against.

18mdabn,Is it normal to get fired after the first 4 days?,"So I just got fired from a job I just got, it was very sudden and I can't even begin to understand why.

I seemingly made no major mistakes and I was always on time willing to learn everything I could, it was a custom cabinet place and my job was to sand/prep doors for paint. I've never worked in a setting like that but I believe that I am a hard worker and I tried really hard to get along with my co workers.

My manager was a 19 year old female, and I'm 20 (f) so I thought that it would be perfect because we hopefully had things in common, and I thought things were going great. I really thought they liked me, I worked with one other girl around the same age and we talked a bunch and they were teaching me how to sand properly. We didn't have any disagreements that I could recall, everytime they told me I was doing something wrong I thanked them for helping me. 

It wasn't my manager that fired me, it was the boss, but he said it was her idea and that I wasn't a good fit. I asked why, but he only said that my manager believed I wouldn't work out in the long run. He refused to give me any action, or reason to why that is. Im honestly so baffled, I can't think of any reason why I would have gotten fired so soon into a job, I barely had time to learn the ropes let alone mess anything up that badly. 

I didn't fool around and I honestly kept myself very busy with sanding, my boss and my manager never told me I was doing anything wrong or gave any sort of warning. 
I feel so stupid because I have to have done something wrong, there's no way that they fired me for no reason but I genuinely cannot think of what it could be. Even right before the boss brought me into the office I was chatting with my manager and coworker with seemingly everything fine. 

I have social anxiety and ADHD so sometimes I can be a little bad with socializing and understanding other people's thoughts, so I might be missing something big but I care about work, when I commit to something I put my all into it.

18mcybs,Weird problem but I’m struggling with public praise at work,"So, first of all, I know it could be worse, but this has been affecting me even though people’s intentions are good/nice.

As a content, I get a lot of public praise from my boss as if I did all the work myself, but he developed tools so I could do that work as efficiently as it is, and sometimes he also helps a bit. So it is not like I did it all by myself. On top of that, it is always portrayed as if the quality is amazing and I honestly just find it pretty normal. As a result, I tend to blush when these situations happen.

And recently I received a lot of praise at work that I felt wasn’t “honest” or deserved - and I really struggled with that.

This latest public praise came from a colleague who was praising my presentation on a project with a client - but actually my explanation during the presentation was wrong (they invited me to this minute without any notice, and I didn’t know what was going on) and this colleague helped me out. 
I thanked him in private for the praise but said I felt like I didn’t do well on the presentation. Then he said the work I did in the background was amazing, so I deserved the praise nevertheless. 

But I felt so bad because I felt like a fraud and more, that I made myself look dumb in front of my colleagues when presenting to the client.

I don’t know, perhaps part of this is impostor syndrome and maybe because I grew up in an environment with very low or nonexistent praise. In addition, my previous jobs were quite toxic too. 

I’m not really sure how to react to these praises or deal with them. 
Any thoughts? Am I overreacting or is it normal to feel this way when the praise is not 100% genuine?",Mysterious-Box4124,5,1.0,2,1703021063,2023-12-19 21:24:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18mcybs/weird_problem_but_im_struggling_with_public/,12,2023
18mcbk0,Master of finance vs Juris Doctor?,"

Hi all,

I have recently finished my undergraduate bachelor of commerce with a major in accounting and would like some guidance as to which postgraduate would be ideal for me.

I’m in my mid 20’s and don’t know exactly where I want to end up after doing a postgraduate (I know that doesn’t help) but was hoping to see if either one could be more beneficial than the other.

I currently work in banking & finance and have interests in being in finance/investment roles and I would imagine thats where id like to stay in the future.

Some have said Juris Doctor qualification will give me a wealth of knowledge witch can be leveraged to many finance and banking jobs due to the content and the fact that ‘law’ can be heavily applied to finance roles.

Others say Master of finance provides the technical knowledge needed for said finance roles.

I’m stuck and have no one around me to ask, so any help is greatly appreciated.

- I live in Australia for any relevance 

- also would love the opportunity to work overseas whether either of these would help with that",d1amiri,1,0.9900000095367432,1,1703019469,2023-12-19 20:57:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18mcbk0/master_of_finance_vs_juris_doctor/,12,2023
18mca7p,Started new job after graduating college and already wanting to quit.,"I started my first full time job yesterday. The company has great culture, diversity, motivation, professionalism, and a welcoming community so far. Many of the employees are around my age (23F) , some a few years older or younger. Therefore, I can easily feel comfortable to engage and introduce myself with them. Everything including the first part of orientation was really educational and well, until what happens next.

The main manager of the company then explained more of the company and what we (I was with 3 other newer employees having their first day as well.) going to usually do in order to make money. Basically the position I’ll be working in commission based and that I have to drive around areas in the city where I live to sell products and open markets. I would have to knock on doors to promote the product. Although it would help me gain my confidence in communicating, it sounds dangerous. Plus I don’t get any benefits unless I’m at one of the higher-leveled managerial positions. Though I’m getting a nice amount of money for the week, I don’t think this is going to work for me. I should’ve been more thoughtful in understanding this company when having the interviews; but I was desperate since I was finishing college. My mom’s been pressuring me to find a job with benefits especially college and this doesn’t have it.  

Before I went home, I had to buy khaki’s and light colored polo shorts for the attire since I can’t wear black. Once I arrived home, I told my sister and mom about my first day. My mom immediately doesn’t like what I’m going to do especially going to random people’s houses by myself (especially being a woman) to sell products. She recommend me to continue searching for other positions that have benefits while working in this position. Once I got hired to another position, I can quit that one. I don’t disagree with her at all, my sister gave the same advice. 

So right now ever since last night, I’ve been really worried about this job and I want to quit right away to prevent myself from danger and suspicion. I regretted my decision to work there already. If you have any other advice for me, that’ll be great.

Thanks and wish me good luck!",APGalore21,1,1.0,0,1703019378,2023-12-19 20:56:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18mca7p/started_new_job_after_graduating_college_and/,12,2023
18mc927,Where did I go wrong? Managing Director rejected me after calling in twice.,"A little context I am currently teaching myself how to program and have been doing so for a little under a year.

I live in a small city and not many apprenticeships are available in software development so I thought I would try my luck in trying to succeed in this one.

A little over two weeks ago I called in to try to speak to someone regarding the role as I was getting no response from the actual apprenticeship provider and wanted to know more about what the role entails and what kind of experience they are looking for since it is an entry level position. I ended up speaking to someone who we shall call John. John seemed like a decent guy but wasn’t very talkative but still gave me a little insight into the recruitment process and told me he managed that department. We spoke a little but not enough for me to really understand anything regarding the role as he never really touched on specifics.

Today I called in again to ask if the position has been filled as I was looking to build a specific project tailored for this specific job role and didn’t want to waste 2 days if they already had someone. After having no luck in reaching someone I decided to send an email in hopes of connecting with someone whom I could speak with regarding the role. I finally received a reply and it was this the following pictures. Where did I go wrong? I was advised to contact the companies to show my interest and to get to know the recruitment manager.

Please advise.

Me: Good morning,

I hope you are doing well!

I have been trying to get in touch with someone regarding the level 3 software development apprenticeship supplied through (apprenticeship provider).

I have had no luck in connecting with xxxx from (apprenticeship provider), however, I have managed to get in touch with Grant who's been amazing at giving me the right information. 

Despite this, I still feel some sort of inadequacy in regards to my confidence for my application and was wondering what I could to do improve my chances at being successful in attaining this role.

I have been self-teaching myself for a while now, through a variety of different resources such as Freecodecamp, the Odin project as well as reading books and watching lectures. I have not built anything as of yet, however, this is one of the main reasons for my application. I have a real passion for software development but have not had the opportunity to build my skills in a professional environment. Despite this gap, I am desperately seeking knowledge and experience from experienced professionals.

If I am not successful in this application, I am more than happy to be considered for any internships or unpaid volunteering opportunities to gain knowledge.

Kind regards,
OP



—— To which I was met with this reply tonight. —



John managing director: 

Op

Unfortunately you would not be suitable for the role. We look for people with a keen interest in software development which would have already produced at least a couple projects.  

Also just as advice for the future it is not a good idea to ask a company tips on how to look good in their recruitment process in your covering letter, as well as call and email the owner numerous times. (Which I have not done twice over the span of two weeks an email isn’t that bad is it? Especially if I only spoke to him once)

We will not be taking your application any further.

18maq8a,What to do…stay longer or leave now?,"Hi all,

I (27M) am at a bit of an impasse as to what I should do and thought I’d get some advice. Let me give a brief recap of my experience / resume and then explain my thoughts. The overall problem is that I haven’t stayed anywhere too long but know I’m going to leave my current job as I don’t want to be in the field (institutional finance). I’d be happy to hear suggestions of what people think, especially those in finance. 

Undergrad in Mathematics, CS minor (3.7)
Master’s in Statistics and Probability Theory (4.0)

Graduated during pandemic, got a job at Goldman Sachs in compliance doing some automation stuff. Intended to stay for at least a year or two and then go into banking / hedge fund. Only there 9 months. 

Offered “dream job” at a notable hedge fund (hence leaving earlier than anticipated). My salary tripled. Didn’t mind working a ton. Did a variety of stuff on the acquisitions / deal team. Was there about a 1.5 years. Job overall was fine, actually. Got unlucky with the team I was on. Most teams were normal / intense but my boss was special (hit things with baseball bat, lots of physical contact, watched women across the street with binoculars (I swear it’s true. I have photos.) and would have us tell him what we thought about the women, definitely used employment entrapment to keep people, blatantly sexist, frequently drank in the office, of course screamed at us, lied in investment materials, etcetera). I decided I didn’t want to be associated with that in my professional career. I left. Did not give notice. I still have positive recommendations from the place. Basically, everyone there knows my boss is/was nuts. I can have credible people speak highly of me. Before you ask why he’s still there, my old boss is good friends with a head of the firm and brings in a lot of money — he’s never getting fired. 

I took a job at an endowment. Pay stayed about the same (overall earning potential definitely dropped). Responsibilities increased (instead of analyst level, I’m about senior associate / VP level in finance world). I now oversee the diligence process for our portfolio (optimize processes, assist in portfolio reports, go to board meetings, help select managers, draft the overall diligence procedures, etcetera). It’s a small team. I don’t work as much (which is actually part of my problem). They’re paying for me to get my CFA. I took L1 in Nov. and am confident I’ll pass (though I could be surprised. Confident candidates have failed in the past). I have been here about 1.5 years. I don’t want to stay here in the long term. I would rather be doing deals, if I’m in finance. 

As for what I think I’d like to do, I think I want to do one of two things: help start a hedge fund / get in really early and help build one; or I’d like to launch a fintech company (I have an idea. Am currently outlining business methodologies / how to launch a startup / networking / putting together an MVP / legal stuff). Basically, I like to work, am a little greedy, don’t break rules, and need a stake in something to stay interested / motivated. 

It’s the end of the year, so recruiter emails have been coming in and job postings are starting. My temptation is leave for another “high finance” transaction-based role. The benefits are more money and on a more “stable” path to wealth. Problem is that I’d most likely work for someone where I don’t care as much / have a stake in the firm. I also don’t have very much experience so, at best, I probably could only argue my way into an associate / senior associate role. A BIG issue here is that I haven’t stayed anywhere for at least 2 years. I’m afraid of looking like a job hopper but I’m also getting older and switching roles / specialties becomes more difficult, making me not want to stay where I am for much longer. 

With the startup idea, benefits are the ability to create something, manage my workplace, and huge potential upside. The cons are that it’s risky, costly, and I’d have to stay where I am for a while (at a job I’ve realized I really don’t enjoy until I think I could get funding / it takes off). Financially speaking, I have a small student loan but could pay it all off tomorrow. I just get a better return on investments than the interest that’s accruing, so I’m just doing the amortized payments. I have about $50K I could use to start launching my company. I’m doing alright in my retirement funds. I’ve maintained my grad school lifestyle (mostly) so I’ve been lucky enough to stash a lot of cash. 

With helping start a hedge fund, this is more contingent on networking. I definitely don’t have the capital / connections to start my own. The biggest issue is I don’t know how I’d get to meeting people who are launching one / I feel have a good probability of succeeding. I also don’t feel that they’d be incentivized to hire me even if I did. 

So, with all of that in mind, what would you do?

The piece of software we managed was node.js web application. I left due to many problems at the startup and the fact that I didn't feel that I was growing or learning. Since august I left the startup and decided to pursue some AWS certs and study up on concepts and start looking for another job. Since then I have gotten 2 offers which I will explain below. I'll also attach my resume so you guys can get a good idea of my experience.

# My Career Goals:

  
Before I go into the two options I have I wanted, to explain what I want out of my career. In a 5-7 year period from now I see myself working in a DevOps, Infrastructure Architecture or Cyber security role making (120k to 150k). I understand these roles demand years of development and IT experience, but those roles are my goals down the road and I want to make sure I am making the right step early in my career to achieve these goals. I have already had exposure to quite a bit of cloud, CI/CD, and general SDLC processes and am learning more everyday. No debt and don't have to pay rent at home right now and have about 2k that I have been living off of along with a part time job to recycle my money.

# Option 1: NIWC - Naval Information Warfare Center Atlantic

  
Offer: 47k base + 7k locality pay as a Systems Analyst (2210 IT specialist). I will be coming in on a federal payband starting off as a NO-2210-02 (corresponds to GS 7) with a full performance level of an 05 (corresponds to GS 13 (85k -105k). What this means for anyone unfamiliar with fed pay scales is that during my time at the agency I will be eligible for non competitive annual raises until I reach my full performance pay band. Apparently this agency works off of an STRL (science and technology pay band) as opposed to the regular GS scale. Id be coming in as a part of the New Professionals Program

  
**Pros:**

* Federal employee = phenomenal job security
* I get a security clearance
* Its a new professional program so for the first 2 years I get to rotate between projects every 6 months and get some mentorship
* I will get to be exposed to alot of cool things, and was told by my HM that there is room for me to get into different projects that interest me (especially cybersecurity as thats huge in the gov)
* The ability to get raises I don't have to compete for and are just performance based till I reach a certain cap on salary
* Good benefits for the most part
* I think with the experience I get here, I could easily transition and go work for a large contractor like Boeing, Northrup Grumman, or Lockheed
* Hiring Manager was really nice and actually contacted me 9 months after meeting at a college career fair, because he had saved a picture of my resume
* Work life balance at fed jobs is supposed to be great
* Tuition Reimbursement (If I wanted to do a masters or any certifications I may want to get)

  
**Cons:**

* The low salary. Despite the promotion potential I still feel compared to my other offer this is a relatively low salary and I don't wanna get stuck on a certain salary either
* I would have to move out my parents house, where I don't have to pay rent, to a high cost of living area and with my salary, after 401k (TSP) contributions most of my money would go to rent (avg $1200) and I would have to live off very little and not have much to save.
* Heard about red tape and just how much bureaucracy slows things down. I would definitely be putting in my best effort to learn and stuff, but don't want to be put down. I want to progress at a good pace.

# Option 2: Medium Sized Tire Company (250 million annual revenue)

  
**Offer:** 70k as a systems engineer, I would be on a small team maintaining several internal applications and working towards implementing CI/CD, containerization, and automation along with assisting with cloud operations.

  
**Pros:**



* They're using a tech stack that I am familiar with and have had experience working with
* This is a local company, I would be able to work at home and commute not having to pay any rent (20 min drive)
* The team was awesome, really nice and seemed welcoming, mentioned that there is much opportunity to explore things I may interested in working on.
* Great benefits
* 8-5 workday which includes lunch (not bad considering I came from an 8-6 at the startup which made me burn out)

  
**Cons:**

* Is a smaller company and not as big of a name as NIWC
* No security clearance
* I don't know how the room for growth is at this place

# Conclusion:

  
Honestly I see both of these as great entry level opportunities to my career. I just want to make sure I am making the right decision for the future, considering how saturated the market is at the entry level and the overall economy. Money is a big deal to me, as shallow as that may sound. I realistically want to be able to put down for a house in the next 3 years or so. I think it comes down to what's really going to propel me towards my career goals 5-7 years from now. Whatever I do end up picking I want to be there for at least 2 years before thinking about the next step because I really want to build a foundation for my experience. Honestly looking back at college, I wish I did more instead of just passing my classes. I did work an IT job for 1.5 yrs and had two tech related internships, one at a large insurance company (large for my state) and the other at the startup I quit at. But I still wish I had tried to maybe get internships at larger companies, had completed my CS degree, and just been significantly more active and invested in my future.

  
I would appreciate any advice and if you need a little bit more insight in to my experience I am free to answer questions.

18m9trf,I need to make a move to a more profitable industry,"Hey everyone. I'm 37m with an MBA from a mediocre school (accredited, not BS for-profit) and make \~$60k currently at a low-stress job. I've been working in the coffee industry as a manager, trainer, etc for 10-ish years. I love the world of coffee and my customers but I've gotten to the point where I need more. More growth, more money, not managing people who don't take things seriously, not spending most of my time behind a bar. You get the idea. 

I'm feeling the pressure hard these days. I'm married, and I really want to start making more money. I want to buy a house and eventually have a family through adopting. I also just want to give my wife the life she wants. She makes about the same as me but she's \~ 5 years younger than I am. We live decent, but always on a budget.

What would you all suggest for someone like me? I love learning but I want to be realistic with what I can do. Obviously I'm not super young anymore but I'm also aware that I'm not old either. I live in a major city so there's opportunities out there.

18m9huw,Data Engineering or Product Management internship?,"Hi Guy,

I recently got two internship offers. One is a data engineering internship offer in Swiss Re and a product management internship at a startup company.

Before continuing further, I'd like to share a little bit of my experience. I have worked as a data engineer for two years. The first year was backened pipelining work and the second year was building analytics features for our clients and internal stake holder. So, summing up, on papers, I was a data engineer but my job ranged from data engineering, to project management, product design and business intelligence and data visualization. It was a start up company. 

I believe, because of such experience,  I probably was able to get these two internships. 

Now, coming to the question. The product management internship is very interesting. The work they do is innovative and since it's a start up, I feel if I take up this internship, It will be a great opportunity for me to break into product management. At, the same time, I also think product management should be something I should get into organically. So, taking up data engineering would also be a great thing for me. 

Now, I don't know if I should explore product management and see how the work is? Will it be a risky decision? Or is data engineering a better option because it's something I want to grow into. I find it much more rewarding. I can't say about pm because I don't know the actual work. 

Regarding other aspects, the data engineering internship pays slightly more and it's close to my place. The pm role, I have to fly to a completely different city and find a place to live. 

I am also an international student pursuing master's in computer engineering in the US.

Some fresh perspective would really be helpful.

18m8dl9,Need Career Help in IT Industry,"So I was enrolled into an Indian Govt. very poor college's in 2015, and I graduated in 2019 with my B.Tech Degree. The engineering branch is an uselss (it doesn't have it's own GATE).As there was an extreme recession in my sector, I joined a small project management and execution firm as a trainee executive in New Delhi. My job responsibilities in my first job were to identify potential government of India bids from the GEM portal, then go through the RFP document, and connect with the relevant suppliers. Then prepare both technical and financial bids. Also, I used to connect with relevant sellers for materials and was involved in negotiating timelines, and supply of products.  
  
As my salary was very low (INR Rs. 22,000 per month), after working there for 3 months of 2019, I left the job and then joined an IT company in 2019. In this firm, they gave me the designation of management trainee in the business analyst division. The main work in this new firm involved visiting the company's clients and staying there for a long time. In this new job, my responsibilities involved analysing the operations going in the sea-port, starting from the trucking operations where they used to bring trucks to deliver cargo, after that how they used to pass through the weighbridges, then how they used to deliver it to jetty or warehouse, weigh out and exit from the port. I also learnt the complete end-to-import operations of coal, limestone and fertiliser in bulk and break bulk cargo form. I also learnt export of roro and liquid cargo but to a very small extent. My role as a business analyst was to understand all these operations and then customise the ERP which we were implementing in their premises. I worked on gathering their exact requirements, communicating and getting them developed by the developers and then conducting User Acceptance Testing. Also afterwards I was involved in the full rollout of this ERP. The rollout happened on their premises Aug 2020 and after that, I further helped get all the other requirements getting developed and worked in a support role until Dec 2020 for this client.  
  
Also, I forgot to tell you that from Oct 2019 to Dec 2019 as soon as I joined my job my company posted me at an Indian Steel Company's small port in Odisha, most of the things I performed in my later part of the job were learnt from here only. Whatever things I did inafterwards was learnt here only. In my job, my salary was INR Rs. 25,000 Per month, but the food, stay and transport were being taken care of by the company.  
  
Then my company moved me to a new project with Ad\*n\*, there the job was to implement the only truck transport module of the ERP, whereby the ERP was implemented but with this truck module, ERP would be able to keep a track of all the truck coming in and out from the port. This got implemented and I was facing very high work pressure I fainted around July. Due to constant work pressure, and working 6 days a week, 12 to 14 hours I was frustrated so I decided to appear for the Common Aptitude Test CAT and pursue MBA. Apart from being frustrated by the work pressure I realised I was unable to change my jobs due to very niche and specialized experience and also my bachelor's degree which was very specialized and less known. Infact major Indian IT companies were declining my applications. Final CTC was 4.39. Deductions only Rs.4000 per month.  
  
So I thought an MBA would be the best way to open new avenues and also increase my salary. The total fee for the MBA course is INR Rs. 20,00,000  
  
Afterwards, in June 2022, I got admitted to the MBA Programme of a non BLACKI IIM, specifically baby IIM in the first year of my MBA I did exceptionally well in the courses of operations, IT, and strategy but was performing poorly in the marketing, HR and finance.  
  
For the mandatory summer internship between for 2 months, I got placed in Accenture Technologies (ATCI) as a Level 10 Senior Analyst (Business Analyst) in their Centre Of Innovation located in Pune India. My stipend was INR Rs. 60,000 per month. I was working as a business analyst for a project. It was really great. But somehow I felt I'm unable to contribute much in the project maybe due to the 8 week.  
  
As I came to now 2nd year of my MBA in Jun 2023 I chose 5 courses of Operations Management, 3 of Marketing Management, 3 of Information Technology, 2 of HRM & 2 of Strategy Management. I am really frustrated by my studies, I'm doing really well in courses in Operations management.  
  
**I'm really confused about whether should I add 2 more courses in marketing and make my MBA as an Operations and Marketing major. Currently, my degree is counting only as an Operations Majors. Although I'm not good in marketing in case there is an Indian Government Job vacancy I will be at least eligible to apply. I really don't know what should I do.**  
  
**Currently, due to my excellent performance in Accenture India Technologies (ATCI) as a Level 10 Senior Analyst I got a job offer from them with a monthly pay of FP 11LPA + 2.5 LPA VAR + 1 JOINING BONUS. I will be joining the same in Jul 2023.**  
  
**At the same time, I'm really interested in Data Science, but I never did it, also I never did coding. My age is 26 years. I'm feeling really feeling frustrated that till today I'm unable to master anything and I'm just surviving.**  
  
**I also feel like going into management consulting, but always get discouraged due to everyone's profile being way too good.**  
  
**Also if in Accenture I will be probably given a choice to choose my project and location. Can you please help me in choosing the same, it will be great. Or atleast a guide if you guys have worked in Accenture.**  
  
Kindly guide me on what should I do, and help me in the best possible way. Give me a complete roadmap. I really feel lost...",helder_shah,1,1.0,0,1703009554,2023-12-19 18:12:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18m8dl9/need_career_help_in_it_industry/,12,2023
18m89bv,Internal transfer salary?,"Hi all! 

I have been at my job since September 2022 and currently hold a coordinator position

However, a managerial version of my job has been posted and vacant since this past June, and finally my supervisor has encouraged me to apply for it

This wouldn’t exactly be a promotion as I still have to apply for the job and interview etc. 

The first interview is with my supervisor, which i’m excited about because if anyone has been a witness to the growth that i’ve made, its her 

The salary range for the position is 78,000-90,000 

Is it tacky to ask for 90? 

 I already pretty much preform most of the required responsibilities for the position and have good relationships with everyone else on the team

I’ve never had to do an internal transfer like this before, so I’m just not sure whats kosher etc.

Anyways, during my undergraduate degree I worked at two different banks 1 regional bank and 1 community bank totaling 2.5 years of banking experience. In July I got an internship at a top 25 public accounting firm and I did well and received a full time offer. My role is staff accountant but I strictly do audit specifically on Financial Institutions and some Government work. My internship rate was 27$/hr.

18m8980,Start up. Toxic boss. Misaligned priorities,"Posting from my alt acc cause my manager follows me on my main.  
  
I work at a Sports startup. We got funded 6 months ago. Ever since then, there has been a constant cash burn and almost no revenue generated.  
  
I joined at the same time the funding happened.I was shown the promise of a bright future with a startup and I fell into the trap. While I initially believed int the vision, I do not think things will work anymore. There is no singular focus and pivots just keep happening every month.  
  
I was a fresher with just 6 months of internship experience as a BDE and hence I get paid way below the market average. I joined as a BDE but soon I got my hands dirty with all things startup. Suddenly, I found myself having zero BDE work and all the operational load on me. The COO, who has prior operations experience, started getting very toxic with me. He is very abusive verbally and told me everyday multiple times that my work was not good. I was trying to figure things out as i had no experience doing any of the tasks and he started giving me lectures every day about how startups are supposed to be fast-paced and everything has to get done quickly and how I'm incompetent for not getting things done quicker.  
  
While I agree with my manager about the slow pace, my goal has always been to get an MBA. That was also one of the reasons I joined the company as I would get to learn as much as I could about businesses, which would further help me in my MBA. The prep for MBA exams takes time and while I do not mind working long hours, the toll on my mental health from listening to my manager yell at how incompetent I am every day does not help me get things done at work or outside of it. It even affects my MBA prep, and I feel like I am compromising on my future.  
  
My co-worker, who is a lot more experienced than I am, tells me most managers are the same and they all treat their employees the same way and I should just learn to deal with it. He also suggests me to look for a new job in the meantime so I can switch as soon as I get a job  
  
Here are a few options I can think of.  
  
A- Quit job and prepare for MBA  
  
B- Look for a new job while working the current job  
  
C- Deal with it.

I started teaching right when covid hit when I was laid off from my corporate job. Teaching was something I had always thought about doing and had some experience with as I had taught summer school at a private school and been a TA throughout college. 

After 4 years, I can honestly say that the job was absolutely not what I thought it would be. I can manage okay, but I have realized that I work way harder than I ever did in corporate for way less pay and way more disrespect from students, parents, and admin alike. 

I feel burned out and stuck. 

The original plan was to teach for 30 years and retire, but with how expensive everything has gotten and how crappy teacher retirement is, I'll be lucky to retire in or near poverty after working for 30 more years. 

I want out but I also feel guilty leaving the profession. 

That being said... even if I do decode to leave, I have been out of the corporate environment for almost half a decade now. I'm rusty and out of practice...

18m6xk9,Considering Computer science.,"
Hello all, I am a Registered Nurse, and I've been working in a ER for 10 years. To be honest I love my job, I see so much and have had many life changing experiences. The problem is that this job is extremely physically demanding, and emotionally taxing (I work in a trauma center) I don't see myself doing this as I age.

I am considering going back to school, and lam interested in computer science. i don't see technology devolving any time soon and from what I can see it is a very necessary job and is in demand. I have a few questions for all of you:

How is your work life balance?

Do you feel like you have pay ceiling? Is how well you do financially dependent upon how much work you are willing to put in? For example as a RN I have a seriously pay ceiling that will only advance by less than 1 percent per year if I stay at the same facility.

Is it common to work remotely?

Did you find it difficult to find a job upon graduation?

He asked me to call IT and said we would need to keep track of this ticket. I tried to reassure him I was not avoiding messages or going anywhere else. I feel like he does not trust me, and having two months at this job I’m worried that I will need to change departments once I reach my probation.

I am currently attending a T30 MBA in the Second Year, but had to take a medical LOA. I only need 3 terms to graduate, but live across the country from where I am attending. 

I am planning to get a Master Degree in Accounting that may start this May, but that would mean that I may not be able to complete the MBA at the T30 school. I would have to withdraw from the program instead of completing the final 3 terms. 

I perhaps if I withdraw from the MBA at the T30 school would be able to get into a better MBA after getting the Master degree in Accounting plus work experience.

18m5tya,"Started a new job, and the onboarding has been slow. I fear it will interfere with my performance.","I’ve started a new job in sales. It’s a small team within a large company targeting large accounts across the nation. 

I like the team. Everyone is friendly and loves what they do. The issue is that I’m reporting to one guy (again, friendly, knowledgeable and passionate) but he seems disengaged as a manager. 

Most of the team is remote except for us and an admin assistant in the office. I haven’t developed relationships with anyone senior due to that. So it doesn’t feel like I can go to others for help. When I have, they similarly have seemed preoccupied when i speak with them. It’s like they’re not invested in teaching a new guy all of their systems and processes. 

Even my manager is hardly in the office. it takes him a while to responod online and when he does I get sent on some goose chase. 

For instance, I need approval for access to dozens of different databases and platforms. Each of them are managed by a different team. I’ve been reaching out to these teams and they all just redirect me in circles. That’s if they respond. It’s taken weeks. 

In the meantime, they’re just having me enter data into excel sheets for hours. 

All of this is fine, but in my 90 day plan there’s a goal of closing 10 deals. I’m 30 days in and at this rate, I don’t see myself reaching this goal. If I hit the goal, I get an instant $10K on my base salary. 

So yeah, I’m feeling a bit stuck. I don’t know how to navigate these conversations and with who. I don’t want to appear needy.

18m5glb,How do you check your fit for the role you are applying to?,"How do you check the fit before applying? Just by mentally crossing out the requirements?  
The alignment of personal skills and experience with job requirements is a critical factor in the job application process. This alignment not only ensures that candidates are applying for roles that are a good fit for their skill set but also significantly enhances their chances of being selected for the role.  
According to a study by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, HR professionals prioritize candidates who can demonstrate they have the skills and experiences directly related to a particular role. Furthermore, a report by TalentWorks highlights that applicants who match 50-60 percent of their skills and experiences with job requirements are twice as likely to be shortlisted for an interview than applicants with a 40 to 50 percent match.  
This highlights the importance of tailoring resumes to each specific job, emphasizing relevant skills and experiences that correspond to the job’s demands. Such a strategic approach to job applications not only streamlines the hiring process for employers but also guides candidates towards opportunities where they can thrive and contribute most effectively.

18m2xon,Currently have 3 jobs... Should I leave 1 and walk away from Manager promotion?,"I've been having a really hard time figuring out the right move. My gut tells me I should leave the one I've been at the longest but I'm having a hard time pulling the trigger .. especially since I'm so burnt out from this past year l... Let me explain.

I've been at the first job for 3.5 years as asst manager. It's been a great fit during that time, provides alot of flexibility and I have a lot of freedom at the job. 6 months ago the manager left and while I had the option to take over his position at the time I decided not to because I've been trying to propritize work life balance and I knew taking his position would afford me the opposite of that. Someone else who was relatively new to the company took over his position  and a month ago left without any notice, for many of the same reasons the original manager left. The company is independently owned and the owner is absenteee and when he is present he's frustursring to deal with and has a lack of understanding of what's best for the business. He pretty much bank rolls the business with his primary job as the business has been in the red for the last few years... Mostly because he pays his brother who has zero experience a ridiculous salary and let's him work from home with zero accountabilty. He brother also acts like he is the manager while really he is just a glorified salesmen who is getting paid way too much for the value he brings to the table... It's honestly offensive that he makes more than me when I've pretty much kept the place afloat the last few years.  I should also mention he beother has a very troubling criminal past which I found out about a year into working here and it hangs over everything the company does... Long story but everyone who works here or has worked here has found out about his past and it really bothers everyone. It's a big reason both managers ended leaving as not only is his last troublesome but he also is just not a pleasant person to be around I work with. It's troublesome to have to interact with him when he is here and to have to run descions by him even though he's absentee for the most part and has zero experience in the field but acts like he knows best. At the end of the day the job is what it is though and I know it gets a little tricky when working with family members. All the bad aside there is plenty of good, mostly the other people I work with and the freedom and flexibility the job provides. If I decide to stay I would be expected to step into the manager roll. 

About 6 months ago I got a side job at a local concert venue (one of my favorites) which was mostly motivated by needing more balance in my life in terms of the fields im working in. Music was my first passion and as I've gotten older I've had a strong desire to work or be involved in this field sone how. When I was younger I went to school partially for music business (although I ended up not finishing the program) and used to be heavily involved in the local music scene. Anyway, this job Ebs and flows... There are busy seasons and slow seasons and when there aren't shows there isn't much work for me as my job works on show nights. That to be said that this could never really be my full-time job (the salaries positon s the compaby has are few and far between) but at the end of the day it doesn't feel like work, is fun and I get to work with some of the friendliest people. I do it evenings, often time after working during the day and it has been great supplemental income. I also love down the road from the venue now and if comes with great perks. No matter what happens i plan to keep this gig as it's also flexible and honestly is a dream come true to be involved in the place in any capacity.

Back to job #1... At the end of last season I almost left because I felt I needed a change. I even put my 2 weeks in but the job I thought I had secured fell thru and I decided to stay another year. All this in mind I went in circles figuring out if I were to leave what job I could get that would be similar pay. I felt maybe I needed a break from the industry or at least a break from the sector of the industry I was in. I found a job a few weeks ago that I feel fortunate enough  to have found. It's in the same industry but is something I've never done before, is easier on my body and mind and luckily work with an amazing group of people. It pays $3 less an hour but for how much closer it is to my house and easier it seems negligible. At the end of the day long term I know I need to make more than either of these jobs can provide but I'm not sure how to get there... But this new job can afford me 30-35 hours a week with potential for full time in the future. With how burnt out I am it seems maybe the best move would be leave job #1 and just do the end job 30-35 hours a week and the theater as well. Most weeks I'd easily be at 40 hours if not more anyway and I feel I need to take more time for myself to reset and I can't do that anymore working all 3. During the year I'd be working 60 hours a week between job 1 and the theater and I just can't continue to do that. Job 1 is slower this time of year but I'm having a hard time leaving that money in the table... Not to mention I'd be walking away from a manager position and would plan to ask for a quite significant raise to do this position. Part of me feels maybe I should try to get the raise and somehow make all 3 work... I feel like job 1 is in a tricky spot because it's hard to explain but it wouldn't be the easiest job to bring someone new in with how everything is set up and run. I know I'm rambling now but what do y'all think?.

Walk away from a manager position for less pay but more personal time and mental clarity? Id also have to live much more frugally which I wouldn't mind if I'd be in a better place mentally.

Basically I’m working a mall kiosk. I don’t believe in the product, like it’s nice but something incredibly irrelevant to me as a person. Corporate life is also incredibly confusing. The fake nice has my guard up everyone I talk to a superior, I’m also neurodivergent and just don’t understand corporate talk. Restaurant talk is direct and efficient, corporate talk is long and drawn out. Every conversation I have feels like it should’ve ended 5 minutes ago.  At my actual shift, I stand at a table for six hours, alone, and just get told no over and over and over again. One appointment is pretty much the standard per shift in this time of year. So I end up just sitting (standing I should say) at a table alone in a mental spiral. I want to quit and go back to waitressing so bad.

18m12pv,Final Interview with Team I will be Managing,"I am interviewing for an analytics manager role, which will be my first official role in a managerial capacity. There have been 4 interviews with the analytics director and other managers, a case study, and the final step is an interview with the team I would be managing. That interview is in a few hours.  

I’ve tried to research how to approach this as best I can. The team is made up of analysts who have all graduated in 2020 or later, and I’ve done some basic LinkedIn scouting to get some basic talking points.  

There’s no clear guidance on what the format will be… if it will be structured or more of an informal conversation to get to know one another.

I did my B.tech in cse from a good engg college in Noida in 2015. Got placed from campus and did job at IBM india pvt ltd. Bangalore for a year. Left my job to pursue my dream of clearing upsc. Couldn't clear it. Being from a middle class family, had to do something to get employed. 

Tried my hand at ssc cgl 2017 exam in 2017. The very first exam I gave landed into controversy for paper getting leaked. Case was filed in Supreme Court of India. The case took good 1year. The entire process till final result took 3 years. I could get my first govt. job in Income Tax Dept after 3 years in 2020. 

Meanwhile gave other ssc exams also. Cleared 2018 ssc cgl exam(held in 2019), got Min of Defence in 2021. Had to leave income tax job since it was in pune and my girlfriend was employed in govt. Job in delhi. Got posting at Delhi in Min. Of Defence. Got married to my girlfriend in 2021. 

Cleared another ssc cgl exam with a gazetted post in CAG of India. Couldn't join it, as it was in Nagpur and my wife in Delhi. Now, I am working in the same Min Of Defence and the job and people are pathetic. Also the job is all India transferrable, which is an all time headache. 

Being from Gen category, crossed 30 and have exhausted all my attempts for govt. Exams. I want to leave this govt job to do something better with my life. But I have no clue where to go, what to pursue. 

I still like coding and programming. Also, learning Technical Analysis and financial programming in stock market. Want to go for GRE and GMAT but my wife doesn't want to go abroad due to her parents. Please suggest what can I do with my life. I am not okay wasting my life in this govt job.

18lxjsp,Network engineer vs FPGA engineer,"Hello. I have graduated in July this year and I'm a telecommunications engineer. For the bachelor's diploma project I have created an emulated network, where I implemented OSPF multi area, IPsec, PKI (winsrv), using Cisco Routers, Cisco ASA firewalls and Fortigate firewalls.

For the last 5 months I've spent half of the time working as a network engineer doing troubleshooting oriented work like giving access to resources using firewalls, routing and switching, so it's more administrative work. The other half of the time I've been in another department oriented on FPGA programming (it's like a type of internship, where you are assigned in another department to see if you like it for 6 months), but most of this time I've spent learning for the JNCIA certification, which I passed in the meantime. I have the most basic knowledge about FPGA because some of my friends have had diploma projects involving them and if I hadn't gone for networking for my project, I probably would have gone for a FPGA project.

I have 2 more weeks to make a decision: which department should I choose?

The main reason why I am very confused right now because although I like networking very much, this department is based on taking calls from people that need support and solving problems, not on implementing stuff (even though once in a while you get projects like that).

18lwsr3,26 years old needing financial/career and general life advice,"Hello everyone,

I would really appreciate some serious advice on how to navigate my life as I don’t know where else to seek it. I just want to talk about myself and if you have any good advice for me I would really appreciate it. 

I’m turning 26 years old in a few weeks and I feel like I’ve messed up so much already and finding it hard to figure out how to dig myself out of such a deep hole. I spend my time depressed in my room on my phone in bed or sleeping. I sleep a lot and I just feel a general sadness most days. I live at home with my parents. I moved out twice during COVID by myself but just ended up coming home. I work as a supervisor at Starbucks right now. Mostly for their benefits as I’m planning on getting double jaw surgery and going to ASU. I’m currently in college studying full stack development at ASU hoping to find some secure remote tech job with a salary that I can actually live with on my own and so that I can travel. I dropped out of college 3 times now majoring in: general studies, business, and fashion design. I immigrated to the USA when I was 6 and I didn’t know how to navigate the school system. I didn’t do much in school growing up and didn’t development any actual hobbies or interests in anything athletic, academic or career wise. I grew up in Texas and always dreamed of moving to NYC and working in the fashion industry since I was in middle school but didn’t know how to navigate my way into that world. I tried some failed internships in the fashion industry here in Texas during my time studying fashion design at the community college. I found out that the curriculum for fashion design at my com college was extremely slow paced and easy. I also found that  I’m  socially awkward and get really anxious making connections at fashion events. So I dropped out of that.
Financials wise, I have $30k in student loans and $40k in credit cards debt. I am planning on bankrupting my credit cards debt and start tackling my student loans now. I make roughly $800 every two weeks. And I don’t really have any bills but still manage to spend all my money anyways and I don’t knows where it really goes. As I mentioned earlier, I am studying full stack development hoping to find a decent “grown up” job in tech so I can move out to nyc to finish my studies in fashion design or find some job in the fashion industry that pays well and that I enjoy. I’m studying full stack develop cause I have an interest in fashion tech as well. I would also like to try modeling as I’ve been told that I should try it by many people. But I gained like 50 lbs these past 2 years since moving back home.

 I feel like I’ve been talking for a long time now so that I guess that’s all that I will say.

I belong a function to business function within this community and my new boss knows members of this particular business function within this community. I am 2 days into my new job. Another member of this community has setup time to interview me not knowing that I have accepted a role with my current employer. Should I be forthright with the company that wants to interview me and let them know that I now work for their community member ? I was not previously working for this employer when I agreed upon the interview. I know that I do not have an obligation to let the company interviewing me know about this but will they find out should I be hired or even can my employer potentially terminate me ? 

These members are not competitors by the way.

18lu5wh,Need advice regarding this AI course,"Hi, I have 14 years of experience in the marketing domain (brand strategy, content, social media). Quit my job 2 months back and am working as an independent consultant right now. However, I also want to utilize the spare time I have to upskill myself and the one skill that seems to be trending everyday is of course AI/GenAI competency. I definitely want to prepare myself for the new world whenever I step back into a full time role.  
I have already started looking at the free courses and Youtube videos, but I feel something a little more immersive.  
Here's one such course that I have come across. It does seem quite comprehensive and a little bit technical too. Hence I'm not sure if it's the right course for me. Would love to get some advice.

My educational background: Engineering (Electronics and Communications), MBA (Marketing).  
I did learn C++ during my schooling and graduation. However, all my experience has utilized my marketing degree rather than my engineering degree. Having said that I do experience working alongside product development teams, and enjoy the tech side of things.

18ltemm,Resignation Advice,"So , I got a big certification in my industry HR shat on it. Essentially, not seeing the value cause and low balled me with what will maybe be about a 12-13k raise, according to my manager. I verbally said okay thank you (in my mind something is better than nothing.) (It was the only option I had on the table)

Deep down, I knew I was worth more with my experience education and great work ethic... I've always worked hard and literally crush goals and make my bosses look good...

Started applying like mad man and at first no calls, and now I'm getting interviews and recruiters reaching out. I have received an offer for 70k more than my current employer. Onboarding paperwork took alittle longer than expected with new job, and I gave a week notice today at full-time capacity (with part-time after hours for a couple more weeks if needed), and my new job wants me to start next week. (I didn't wanna open the resignation talk until onboarding started... as everything was verbal offer wise up to that point so being a skeptic I waited until it felt safe to give my resignation and all I could do is a week now (I've been burned in the past so now I'm all about looking out for myself and being cautious) 

I really didn't wanna burn that bridge, but it was an awkward conversation manager seemed like I blindsided them but I'm like hey this is just the way it worked out... not to mention they lowballed me in the first place or else I wouldn't have started looking. Also made a weird comment of not wanting to pay me for part time and would rather have two full weeks and if I can postpone the new job. (Mentally I was like uhhh no) I'm starting next week. 

I thought I was being nice by offering a couple more weeks at part-time to create transition documentation, etc, and he basically shat on that. With the ""I dont want to pay for part time comment"". Which made no logical sense (they're technically saving money as no one is replacing my position yet), but whatever. I was looking for that job to be a reference. May not be realistic anymore... or maybe I'll just use a peer there and not my manager idk. 

At the end of reading this, I'm just looking for advice from others on what maybe I could have improved on or if I just did everything right to the best of my ability. Any advice is appreciated. I'm sorry for any typos I typed this all out on my phone.",JGFX1,1,0.5,2,1702960831,2023-12-19 04:40:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ltemm/resignation_advice/,12,2023
18ltehs,How to get a job with no experience?,"Hi! I know someone who's currently living in the US, California, and has graduated from college in Creative Media.

His university doesn't provide internship as a necessary thing to take and the pandemic probably didn't give him those opportunities (He studied from 2020-2023). He's stuck in a limbo living with his parents being unemployed and no income.

18lt8w1,Miserable at new job. Is it worth sticking around?,"Started a new job 3 months ago, the pay is wonderful but the job has not aligned well with my experience. 

I loved my past job for a few reasons. I had a team that was so friendly, there were opportunities for mentorship, and the job could be really fun at times—plus the hybrid schedule was where I thrived. But the overwork and extremely low pay prompted me to search for something else.

This new job is fully in-person in an office over an hour away. The pay is great, but I’m realizing that my skills are not fitting well with the role, and I will have a lot to learn if I choose to stay. My work style also does not fit in well with the team’s, which lacks a lot of formal processes I swear by. 

I was recommended this job by a good friend, and the thought of disappointing him is terrifying, even though he’s no longer with the corporation. I’m just not sure I can live like this. I wake up at 5am and don’t get home until 7pm, where I’m so tired I can hardly move most evenings. My anxiety has also been so high I’ve almost fainted in the office on several occasions.

I was just offered another job with better pay, flexibility, and more aligned with my experience, but don’t want to to ruin a friendship and burn the bridge with leadership at this job, since I was hired on his recommendation.

I just found out that I am pregnant, and I am not sure how to go about it, I am an immigrant and not really sure about “Corporate America” or what should I do or say? 

Should I say this when I’m in the interview process? Or should I keep it to myself until I get hire? 

Now that I am pregnant I feel hesitant about leaving my current role, I have job stability and I don’t do much, plus I WFH but unfortunately I don’t get paid enough and I don’t see any career advancement there for me and my HR goals.

18lrsti,Any advise is appreciated!,"I have been with my company for 6 years and 5 months. For the first 6 years of my time with the company, I was in a position classified as a career band 2. The starting rate for that position is posted as $31-$36 dollars an hour. The position does allow for an annual merit increase so, depending on your time with the company, you can exceed that range. 

I promoted to a career band 3 in June 2023. This position serves as the direct resource for my previous position and clearly outlines increased responsibility requirements. This position is a definite “promotion” and one that I would not assume is as easily filled as my prior role. As an example, there are approximately 300 roles filled for my prior position and only 2 for my current role. 

The band 3 hiring rate was for $31-$47 dollars an hour. When I accepted the position, I accepted an initial salary increase of 3% with the idea that there would be salary adjustments upon reevaluation. I am currently earning in the lower portion of that salary range (34/hour) and was just informed that Career band 3 would now cap the merit increase at 3% while my previous position will cap at 6-7%. The rationale for the cap is that career band 3 is less impacted by the economical state. People in Career Bands 1 and 2 make less, therefore, deserve more. While I don’t disagree with that ideology, a difference of less than $1 dollar an hour for a senior position seems insignificant. After calculation the merit increases, I confirmed that, if I did not change from my Career Band 2 position, my base pay would be higher than what it will be once the merit increases are accounted for.
All of this information to ask… do I have enough rationale to ask for a salary review or base pay increase?",RemoteRN1523,1,1.0,0,1702955883,2023-12-19 03:18:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18lrsti/any_advise_is_appreciated/,12,2023

18lropf,unintentionally quiet quitting,"I am currently a senior data analyst and been with my company for almost two years now. Due to internal restructuring, I've had to switch areas of responsibilities. Before my manager went on maternity leave, I went on an ""informal rotation"" to help out another team because we had layoffs and the larger analytics org was trying to spread people around. So the work I used to do was transferred to another colleague. I have been back on my team for 6+ months now and have yet to carve out meaningful work I can be the go to person on. I can't try to take back my old work. There's not enough work on my team to go around and my coworker seems to be in a good groove.  
Our team stand ups are usually <15 minutes in total and we have \~8 people on the team. All of us feel siloed and everyone just says what they do during standup, without understanding how our work ties together. We don't even have a roadmap that the entire team is familiar with. I definitely think the context of the team has contributed me to feel like I am unintentionally ""quiet quitting.""  
I have been trying to find another job for the past 6 months also which is why my focus is elsewhere and I was trying to lay low. But I am taking a break since it is end of the year and jumping back into it mid January.  
For half of the year, I am not even at 50% capacity. I had communicated to my interim manager that I want to get involved in X area and I am slowly ramping up in that area now, but the tickets I am assigned to are small -- which I can understand since I am still gaining footing in this area. Besides this area, I don't know what else I'd want to get involved in. I am tired of trying to find something I am interested in here because ever since I joined, I've felt like a floating ball.  
My manager who came back from maternity leave is also very hands off type and she isn't very involved with any day to day work so I don't know what to say when I meet with her. She is a great person, but not a great manager for me. And I don't know how to communicate how she can help...  
I guess my question is, what should I do to improve my current situation until I can switch jobs? I'm already taking time to upskill and trying to snoop out work that is closer to what I am hoping to do in my next job.",Mission_Peach_2473,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1702955536,2023-12-19 03:12:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18lropf/unintentionally_quiet_quitting/,12,2023
18lrkwu,Failed nursing school twice. Not sure what to do.,"So basically I failed nursing school some two weeks ago and right now I'm living with my parents (who are also nurses.) One of the biggest problems I've had with nursing school is that I am not entirely sure if this is the best career for me. I've gone through clinicals, shadowed nurses as well as seeing patients sick, has given me some anxiety because I realized how much care and work you have to do when caring for patients.  
  
I tried explaining to my parents about what is going on but of course Filipino parents can be stubborn and emotional when they don't like what they hear - which is me not being sure about becoming a nurse.  
  
The only positive things I can see from nursing, and this is according to my parents, are: healthcare benefits, less hours compared to other jobs (usually 12 hr shifts 3x a day), you get to help and take care of people, and the fact that there are a lot of job opportunities (only problem being is that most require bedside experience.)  
  
I'm not entirely sure what I want and it doesn't help the fact that I never took up a job before despite being 23 years old. I have some interest in business or tech but even I'm not sure if they are good stable careers. My only goal(s) in life is just to have a good well paying job but also gives me time to do hobbies, travel, and maybe start a family...

I haven’t officially received a offer letter but saw 50k gbp on documentation and when asked my boss about it, he said he is yet to get involved in that talks and if it gets there he’ll back me up.

When asked about salary he said quote” I don’t care how much you make in US but will give you the pay you deserve in UK and said about 60k but won’t go lower and if it’s more than that he’s okay with it. (Assuming that when offer letter is to be issued and budget for the role is discussed with him from executives)”

I feel that’s lot lower and need advice on how to navigate this to get a better pay or comparable pay. 

I’ve checked Glassdoor and LinkedIn there are certain positions with my skill set aiming at 75-100k. How do I pitch this to get a better compensation if it gets to discussion.

I am 28 years old, have a BA in journalism, and worked in a call center for 2 years. Before working there and immediately after graduating college, I went traveling and had a travel blog for 2 years. Great for my personal growth, bad for my professional growth. 

The company I worked for didn’t start out as a call center, it was a place where people could grow in the company. Unfortunately, it gradually turned into a call center with micromanaging and demands to be on the phone for 8 hours a day. It wasn’t what I signed up for. I tried and tried to move up within the company but it didn’t work, there was a lot of competition. Eventually my mental health and performance deteriorated so much I got fired. l am doing much much better mentally now, just stressed about money and my resume gap growing. 

I’ve been unemployed for a month so far and never ever want to go back to customer service. I can’t go back to that type of job. I wasted 5 years in those kinds of dead end roles. I earned a BA in journalism 5 years ago and am trying to get back into communications but haven’t gotten any bites. I’d love to do copywriting but at having trouble knowing how to get there.

Recently this guy starts doing company related stuff. Because we are a small company, this guy starts helping out on business projects that lacks hand. He did some ground and he does project management related work because he lacks degree in the specific industry we are in. I involved him in some projects that I work on because I thought he could be a helping hand.

Then he kind of starts stepping up to a extent that worries me and makes me annoyed. 

During meetings he will make comments that he knows nothing about. He will jump in front of me and report to boss the progress of projects I'm working on, leaving me got nothing else to say.

Boss will be travelling. He will be taking to boss on regular basis for boss's personal related stuff. He starts wanting me and my colleagues to tell him what is going on with our projects so he can brief boss when he talks to boss.

18lor1c,Why feeling guilty or afraid to leave a team and company?,"I know I am not the only one but it happens a lot to feel guilty before leaving a team or company under conditions that do not feel “correct”.

I recently did an internal transfer in my company to avoid staying with a toxic manager and learn something new, as well as joining a team with friends, but in fact my current job and pay are lower than my experience. 

After only 2 months I received an opportunity to be the head of a department in another company with about 50/60% increase of my salary. But as much as I want to move, I feel bad for the team and my “friends” that did their maximum to make the transfer happen.

I think I will make the move, I know we owe nothing to a company, people eventually get upset but in the end also understand why others move.

Do you guys feel guilty as well sometimes? Btw I’m french and it is a common feeling in my country.",shankaviel,1,0.5,0,1702947023,2023-12-19 00:50:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18lor1c/why_feeling_guilty_or_afraid_to_leave_a_team_and/,12,2023
18loflp,Burnt out because my job is too reliant on others.,"I can't take it anymore!!!! I work in the music industry. I have very few tasks that I can actually accomplish myself, and so I have to delegate tasks to colleagues at other companies to work on, whose staff are already stretched thin. So it takes a long time to get the tasks that I need done, done. I cannot do these assignments myself, unfortunately.


It is nearly impossible to track the progress of these tasks because I am hit with a wall of bureaucracy & crazy long timelines to finish these assignments. It makes doing my job very difficult and frustrating.


A few questions: 

1) Is this a relationship issue? I take these colleagues out to lunch when I can, and we have regular meetings and are very friendly with eachother. But very little gets accomplished on their end due to again, being stretched so thin. 


We aren't their only clients for sure, and we aren't the only ones experiencing these issues either. There is a lot of commiserating around the drinks table at industry mixers.


2) If a particular task took 3 months to update 2 years ago, but now takes a year+ now, should I lower my (and my bosses') expectations? How do I learn to let go when so much of my job relies on others to do the work in a timely way?


3) Should I look for another job that doesn't make me want to protest outside these companies' offices?",tyrannaceratops,2,1.0,0,1702946108,2023-12-19 00:35:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18loflp/burnt_out_because_my_job_is_too_reliant_on_others/,12,2023

18ljogl,Seeking Career Advice - Feeling Lost at 28 and Considering a Change,"I'm a 28-year-old male currently working from home as a ""DM manager,"" but the pay is less than ideal, and there are no benefits. I'm feeling a bit lost and stuck, especially considering I have a wife to support. I have over 4 years of experience in sales, including selling cars for 2 years and some time in telesales. I also have 1 year of management experience, all with only a high school diploma.  
  
I've been thinking about making a career change and was considering joining the trades, specifically aiming for an electrical apprenticeship. However, I'm aware that it might take months or even years to get into that field. On the other hand, I've been exploring sales opportunities, particularly SDR/BDR roles, but my LinkedIn applications haven't been successful so far.  
  
I've heard that selling residential windows or getting involved in construction/remodeling sales could be a good move. I'd appreciate any advice or insights from those who have been in similar situations or have experience in these fields. Should I continue pursuing sales, explore the trades, or consider other options? Any tips on breaking into SDR/BDR roles or the construction sales industry would be greatly appreciated.

18lje0h,How long is too long to be doing grunt work?,"I have a pretty specific degree and 4 months ago I started a job at a company in that industry, but in their customer service department as that was the only position open. I was told that since I have the knowledge and experience they would love to have me working with other departments, and that customer service would only be part of my duties. They put me in the bottom level shipping sub-department “just to start”. I can’t stand it, it’s frustrating and uses none of my skills, but I thought it would only be for 2 weeks or so. 

It’s now 4 months later and shipping is my only duty. There is one other person in this department and there’s not enough work for the both of us so I’m constantly, daily begging for more things to do, but only get tossed one or two tasks that my boss is too busy to do instead of new duties that I can own. When I have a lot of free time I get to do small tasks for the departments I’d rather be working in, but it’s mostly data entry or organization, nothing that requires real skill. Those departments are overwhelmed with work and could use me on their projects.

I’ve brought this up as an issue to my supervisor and she agrees and understands that this isn’t the department I really want to be in, but can’t offer anything other than sympathy. She told me if I’m patient that I would probably get moved but that she couldn’t make any promises because it isn’t up to her. She says she’s pushing for it with the higher ups and that they want to meet with me to discuss how things are going, but I haven’t heard anything else. In the meantime she’s looking for more important duties to give me within the customer service department, but says she’s hesitant to because it could interfere with me doing shipping. The last time I brought it up she just said she doesn’t know what to tell me.

I was going to try to be patient but I can’t stand the work I’m doing and I have a 1 hr commute both ways. I’m starting to dread work already. Is this normal in entry level jobs? Would it be overstepping to say that I don’t want to do this work anymore and I want to work on projects that make more sense for me?

It pains me to write that and follow it with my complaints below because I know so many people are struggling and desire to be where I am at. 

The company I work for went through lay offs this past year. My department has been a bit of a dumpster fire since then and we still really lack clarity on wth the company wants us to do. I feel as though my department’s leadership is grasping at straws to come up with work for us and placing a lot of the responsibilities to figure it out on analysts. For a vague example, one of my senior managers has asked me to come up with “product ideas” to then present to product teams. We are so siloed away from product teams, they have no clue we are working on this, and I just feel foolish trying to put ideas together. 

I know I am burned out and have been since before the lay offs. My mental health is suffering. And I just feel so stuck. The job market is scary and I don’t want to continue as an analyst. All options depress me; stay in a job that is negatively effecting my mental health or quit and enter a terrible job market and face the reality I will not find a job that pays the same as my current one.

My FT job was nights as a sleep tech while my internship is in digital marketing. I realized after a few months that I muchly preferred my internship work direction over sleep tech even though it's interesting with a lot of opportunities, unfortunately not something I envisioned to continue working in the future due to the work balance of nights/direct patient care. I ended up quitting to focus on my internship but it's really not enough to live off of as it's only 6-10 hours a week. 

My sleep tech job reached out to me and ask if I'm willing to work a new FT day position, it has less patient care since thankfully I don't need to watch ppl sleep anymore lol but at the same time it's not in the direction I imagined +  will be a bit of schedule conflict with my internship.

18li2cm,"I think I need to leave a job I like, and I'm just sad about it. Kids will be, too. Could use any boost here.","I work in corporate for a well-known company. I do relatively easy work well. I can put in 70% effort and still outperform peers. The kids think it's cool I work here. Coworkers name me as the obvious choice for a promotion when the position becomes vacant possibly next year. And I'll most likely have to leave the company soon.

The pay's decent, but the company refuses to give me a title I earned years ago, probably because of market pay for this title. I have the ability and experience. They just continue to dangle the title as forever another year away. Merit raises <5% aren't keeping up with the last few years. I've built up debt. While I wait for that shinier title that never comes, the big promotion is separate but dependent on someone else vacating the position. That could happen tomorrow or years from now. Lot of factors.

It looks like I'll have to leave this. I'm honestly scared of that. Everything out there seems riskier, more prone to cuts. But I could potentially make plenty more, go remote, pay down debt, and breathe easier than ever in my working life. Or get axed if quarterly earnings underwhelm. Plus, the kids are going to be sad to hear that I'm leaving here. They see this brand often.

I am supposed to be a facilities maintenance coordinator for this place, a 60+ unit assisted living retirement home. The issue is that the old maintenance guy has just quit without training me, really at all. I have 5+ years in residential/apartment maintenance experience, but the overlap on that does not cover probably 50%+ of my job. The general manager has been let go and turns out did not follow corporate requirements to fill the position I currently have. The required experience is wayyyy more than I have. The idea they had was to just train me over time, but now there is nobody to train me. 

I am not able to repair or maintain a lot of our very big systems which include a lot of dangerous industrial equipment. Some of this stuff includes a professional kitchen/equipment, a complicated fire and security system, medical charting system, industrial boiler, industrial generator, industrial HVAC systems, industrial laundry facility, elevators, and more. 

When I was hired, I let them know my experience and they seemed fine with it since I was to be trained. Anyway, going through the old man's office, he hasn't kept up on A LOT of important paperwork. There is no documentation for required licensing or inspection records for pretty much anything. The computer has basically nothing besides solitaire and links for fishing spots. 

I can't find any info on any vendors, safety requirements, licensing for anything, inspection information, or even so much as anything on how this company wants me to order parts. I'm over my head. 

But, I am also pregnant and due in March. I don't think I can find a job that will allow a maternity leave by then. But, I'm so uncomfortable in this position because I am vastly underqualified with no actual help. I don't want something big to break and leave me up a creek or have someone hurt.

18lekkz,How to address a job offer I just received before a first round interview with a second company?,"So I have just received a job offer today from my first choice employer and just need to negotiate salary/benefits. The only problem is I have an interview with a similar company later today and they offer a higher salary range, but I’m only in the first step of the actual panel interview process with them (after the preliminary first interview). I’m trying to figure out how to address my job offer because I do want to respect the second company’s time and I am interested in working for them. Should I send them an email immediately explaining that I have just received an offer out of respect for their time or should I address this at the start of the interview? I think it would be wise to still take the interview with the second company, but since it’s the first actual interview I don’t know if they would be willing to make a decision so soon.",MuzzledUser,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1702921308,2023-12-18 17:41:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18lekkz/how_to_address_a_job_offer_i_just_received_before/,12,2023
18leces,I have no idea in which direction my life should go.,"I'm currently 21 years old and have no idea how to continue my path. I successfully completed my high school diploma at a business administration the year before last. Last year I also did my voluntary service (which is credited like a substitute for enlisting in the army since I did not want to do that) for nine months as a carer in a dormitory for disabled people and a three-month job as a temporary helper at food delivery. Both were pretty fun jobs.

I planned to study artificial intelligence at the university in my city because I have been interested in computers since I was a child and the industry offers extremely good career chances for the future. I started this course in October, but I underestimated the demands of the mathematical subjects extremely and therefore failed the first exam. I've written the recovery exam, but I'm already toying with the idea of ​​dropping out of this course after the first semester, no matter what the result is, because the math is quite overwhelming for me. 

Now, of course, I've thought about what to do next. I still live with my parents and am therefore financially dependent on them. But I would like to move out as soon as possible and stand on my own two feet, but I don't know what is right for me. I would really like to become a journalist in the gaming sector, but that's a job that almost everyone wants and if I'm already overthinking it before I even tried it, it is hard to think that dream could come true. 

It wouldn't even matter to me how much I love the job, as long as I earn enough money to live independently and not getting home sick and tired from work every day. 

What I definitely don't want is physically strenuous work or work in retail. I've also thought about a gap year and know that you need a plan for it, but would that really be of any use in my situation? I could imagine myself then acquiring journalistic texts and learning about them, possibly opening my own blog and perhaps even starting to freelance... but I also could go into sales since I have heard a lot of good things about it and graduated from a business administration… I could also look at other courses to enroll in the university but I have no idea which…

I hope this text summarizes my hesitations and thoughts about the future and appreciate everyone that took their time to read my concerns. I would be very happy for any comments, food for thought, suggestions and any other opinions!

18ldsu5,Should I accept an offer that compensates me less than my counterparts?,"Hi all!

I am a recent undergrad graduate, with a degree in Neuroscience, and a minor in chemistry and math.

I recently started working part time at a biotech company and was offered $19/hr to start. The expectation was the pay would increase to $21/hr if I became full time.

My coworkers with the same credentials and same level of experience started off with $21/hr as their salary. However, my full time offer has just been received and I’ve been offered $19/hr for full time.

One of my coworkers is my direct equal, same age, similar degree, same level of experience upon entry, the only difference I can find is that she’s white, and it’s hard to feel like that isn’t the reason for this slight.

My supervisor is speaking to who he can to contest it and have it match my counterparts’. He’s suggesting I provide them an ultimatum and say I won’t move to full time unless they offer me $21/hr, and look for a new job in the meantime. However, he has a phd and leveraging power I do not.

Should I go with his suggestion and stick to my guns, or take the full time offer as is and be looking for new jobs in the meantime?


TLDR; The biotech company I work for is offering me less than my similarly skilled coworkers ($19 v $21/hr). Should I contest it with an ultimatum, as my boss suggests, or accept it and be looking for other opportunities?",lemonpeppr_,1,0.5600000023841858,13,1702919394,2023-12-18 17:09:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ldsu5/should_i_accept_an_offer_that_compensates_me_less/,12,2023
18ldpha,Badly handled promotion. What should I do? Constructive feedback to managing director? Look for a new job?,"I started this role approximately 2 years ago and have since improved massively gaining loads of experience, knowledge and responsibility.

The original director and associate director of my team both left a year into my employment and it felt as if my hard work up to that point was lost and I’d had to start again from square one. My discussions with my old director concluded that I would need to take a project from start to completion to get to the next level and become chartered in my profession to achieve the next level after that. That would have taken me a year and 5 months to get to the next level and a year and 2 months after that to reach the following level.

When my new director arrived I had a discussion with him on this, he encouraged me to put myself forward for promotion and insisted that he didn’t want hold me back. When the time came to put me through for promotion he then said that he was only allowed to put one person through this time and chose my colleague (who was working senior level at the time) but there was another review in 6 months he could put me through in.

6 months passed and when the time arose he said that he wasn’t allowed to put anyone through this time but there might be an opportunity at end of year. 

In my bi-yearly review I drafted up some targets for what I needed to do to achieve promotion and he input into those and we agreed them. I then emailed him the targets with the date of promotion (end of year) and the salary to be awarded included which was already on the document agreed in my review.

I then completed all these targets and tried to book in a catch up with him to get an update, which he delayed to tomorrow 3 days in a row, only to find out today that he can no longer promote me or give me that salary but that he is certain that this can be done in 5 months time.

The whole process has been incredibly demoralising and I’ve been loosing sleep over it, particularly in the last 3 nights when he was putting off giving me the bad news. I’ve become very disillusioned and lost all trust for any future promises.

I’m now deciding what to do next, I may send an email to the managing director who I’ve spoken to on a couple of occasions and he’s quite personable giving some constructive feedback although I’m not sure if this will achieve anything. I’m also debating looking for a new job over the Christmas break but I worry that I won’t be able to enter at the next level, is that a common thing? To leave for a promotion elsewhere?

18lczse,What did you do for $ while in College?,"
25m going to college in 3 months in March (my college is on a weird schedule)

I’m looking for ways to make $ in the meantime and throughout. 

Recently got a job at Music and Arts that I’m starting soon… but that caps out at $12h 15hrs a week which is $720 a month b4 taxes. Which isn’t great. 

It’s fine for now, and even if I didn’t get a job, extra BAH and student loans can get me through but I’d rather start some savings. 

I could transfer my Navy Skills into getting a higher paying job, but I think it would interfere with the schedule of my classes since I’m going to school in person so I wanted ideas for side hustles that don’t involve a full time job during normal working hours.

What did you guys do as side hustles?

Edit: 

No I didn’t get disability bc nothing in me broke. I know I could’ve gotten away with claiming depression or high blood pressure. But I didn’t want to take advantage of tax payer $ and I thought the financial struggle would encourage me to be better. 

Maybe that’s a little naive and stupid of me.

18lcj7v,New boss - leave or return to guaranteed job?,"University leader - return to faculty?

This is my throwaway because…well it will be obvious.  I am a senior academic leader at a large state university. I am one level beneath the presidential cabinet. I’ve been in this role for a year and a half having been promoted from another administrative leadership role. My boss was fired and their replacement is a micromanager who sees value in other areas of the university. She is defunding my area. I’ve been spending the last four months showing her evidence of the importance of the work that my team are doing.

I am also a tenured full professor, and can return to my faculty position at any time. It will be a lot less stress and a lot less money about $30,000 less per year. I always imagined that I would continue in my leadership career rather than returning to the faculty but, the dysfunction and toxic culture is so unattractive to me. I am also not handling the stress well. I am highly sensitive and I am finding that each night I come home and I over eat. I’m not sleeping well and I absolutely dread going into work.

My new boss is in an interim role and if I can hold out for a year and a half I would likely have many more opportunities. The key here is that my metrics are outstanding, and the board of trustees recognizes this, so my job is not at risk - I’m just so very unhappy. Do I stick it out and continue along the career path I had planned for myself? Or do I return to the faculty, do my research teach my students and have a lot more freedom and time for external pursuits?

18lam5l,Need Feedback on Potential Career Change,"Need some input on a potential career change, not sure if this is going to be a good decision.  
I've realized I'm underpaid by a fairly large margin and have been keeping my ear to the ground for new positions. I'm in no rush to leave, but if the right opportunity came up I'd be inclined to go. As it turns out, I had an opportunity pop up and I'm a bit torn on what to do.  
My background:  
\- Bachelor's in Civil Engineering  
\- Master's in Structural Engineering  
\- EIT, sitting for PE next month.  
\- 3+ YOE structural engineering in residential and single family. Mostly wood design with the occasional elevated slab, steel frame, or other odd item. Currently supervising a junior engineer and two drafters.  
\- 5+ YOE in construction management and administration. LOTS of field experience.  
\- Living in a high COL area (northern Virginia)  
Current Position:  
\- Residential/Single Family structural engineering and design  
\- $75,000/year base  
\- $10,000 - $15,000 yearly bonuses/profit sharing (never guaranteed, and it's been hinted they may taper off next year).  
\- 401(k) with matching up to 5%  
\- 3 weeks PTO, no sick time.  
\- Health/Dental offered, but non-factor for me as I'm on my wife's plan.  
Pros:  
\- Very liberal WFH policy.  
\- Very liberal hour flexing  
\- Love my boss, he's a good friend and mentor.  
\- Very flexible holiday schedule, burn two days of PTO in exchange for paid leave from Christmas all through the new year.  
\- At year 5 my PTO increases to 4 weeks  
Cons:  
\- Getting a little bored. I've asked to be put on more complex work but it's not yet happened.  
\- Pay feels very low for my current experience. I'm managing clients, supervising a team, and creating my own designs with minimal oversight.  
\- PE Bump will only be $5,000, feels a bit low.  
New Position:  
\- Wide range of projects from K-12, Hospitals, Government (GSA Contract), Historical renovations, etc. More heavily focused on concrete/steel design  
\- $95,000/ year base  
\- Bonuses (range undetermined, not guaranteed)  
\- 2 Weeks PTO, 1 Week sick  
\- Undetermined on WFH, was not brought up in interview (my bad, didn't ask).  
\- Standard benefits (401(k) w/ 6% match, Health, Dental, etc.)  
Pros:  
\- 26% Pay Bump  
\- Opportunity for more fulfilling work  
\- Almost no change to commute (They're literally walking distance from my current office).  
Cons (Some potential? Need a gut check)  
\- During the interview I was heavily grilled on my design knowledge. Pen and paper was involved, but I guess I impressed since they are making an offer.  
\- They want me to start ASAP, lots of pressure to get start immediately.  
\- I was told I'd be starting as a ""Design Engineer"" until they could get a feel for my work quality, then a move to ""Project Engineer"" with potential supervisory responsibilities. A bit unclear on the timeline there. I applied for the Project Engineer position. I think this may be a symptom of the fact that I don't yet have my PE, and most of my real-world experience is in wood design.  
\- Obviously I'm leaving the environment I know and taking a risk moving away from coworkers that I like and enjoy spending time with.  
What do y'all think? Am I suffering from a bad case of ""grass is greener"" syndrome, or do you think I should take a shot at this new position?

We did an interview and a test and I thought that I did good. After the test, a recruiter called me and told me that I did really well on the test, but someone else was just brilliant, so they are continuing the process with them.

The recruiter insisted that we keep in contact in case any future positions open up. And they mentioned how this is a very fast-growing company.

Here is the weird part less than 2 hours after we talked I saw a job posting for the same position that I applied for. No call from the recruiter that there is a new opportunity.

1. No PTO or sick days  until after a year and then you get 1 work week. I won’t be able to travel home for Christmas to see my family because of this, since I’ll only have Christmas Day off. I was only able to go home for thanksgiving because I worked overtime to build up hours to take off that Friday.

3. Coworker is putting in her notice soon, and there’s fear they won’t replace her position…meaning more work for me and likely no pay. She has worked here for two years longer than me and only makes .45 cents more than me.

18l3kps,Benefits package - is it worth it?,"Hi everyone,

I am sorry for the formatting if it’s strange, I’m on mobile. 

I am a plant manager for a relatively small manufacturing facility.  I started off at my organization approximately 3 years ago as a manufacturing engineer, did really well at that and then was promoted to plant manager and given my own plant to manage about 1 year ago.  Although I enjoy what I do most days, becoming management has been really hard on my and I think I regret making the change. Im much further removed from the processes than I used to be, and I have to deal with a lot of HR style issues that come naturally from the plant being in a relatively rough city. 

I am mostly looking for advice regarding my compensation package. I am pretty happy in regards to my salary, but I feel some of the other benefits are kind of lacking. Here’s the breakdown:

-Salary:$95k
-PTO: 2 weeks a year, and can roll over 2 weeks. 
-Sick Leave: None
-Retirement: 401k with 4% match and possible profit sharing. (PS varies widely depending on the year)
-bonuses: eligible but there isn’t a structure
-insurance: awful. 1133/ month for my spouse and I for 6k deductible and 8k out of pocket maximum. Luckily I don’t subscribe to it. 

The salary is good, but if feels like the other bits are off. Also, the salary will increase by a maximum of 4% every year, which I’m worried won’t keep up with inflation.  I hope I don’t seem delusional, but certainly for all the stress that comes with starting up a plant, I don’t feel like I get the amount of time off I truly need to recover.

18l2icf,Should I do another’s Master’s degree?,"Okay, so hear me out. I finished my Bachelor's in Engineering and specialised in Computer Science. I have a year's worth of experience as a Junior Technical Manager right after my Bachelor's. I was in India till this point. Then I went for a 1 year Master's program in International Business in Pairs. I finished this in 2022.
Since then I have been struggling to find a job. Partly because of my language skills in French. The things that interest me like project management, Customer Success Management mostly require a native level of French in France. I have also been applying to other European countries and it is a similar story there. I have tried Canada but entry there is tough if you don't have a sponsored Visa. I do not want to go back to India.
Thus I am considering doing another Master's but in a more Technical Field like Data Analytics, Al or ML. I am considering Germany since it has no tuition fees for public schools. And if I do go I plan to learn German till B1 before enrolling into the program and keep learning.
But I am just here to take advice from people. Is this something I should think about or wait it out to find a job. I am running out of patience and hope at this point.
I have tried to find remote work, outsourced work inside Europe which mostly requires one to speak English. But I haven't found anything yet.",catcocktailinsight,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1702882262,2023-12-18 06:51:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18l2icf/should_i_do_anothers_masters_degree/,12,2023

I’m currently studying Math at Western Uni but I’m looking to pursue a trade. I’m definitely willing to move to a small/rural/remote community anywhere in Canada except the Maritime provinces lol.

I’ve worked landscaping, tiling, snow removal, and general maintenance in the past.

I would really like to pursue something that has potential for business ownership and career growth. Willing to trade off my body/health if that means in 10-15 years I could manage projects or crew.

18l2bq4,Can you ask for a promotion during corporate transformation when the organization is cutting costs? How do you go about it?,"I came across this interesting question and [decided to post #my2cents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izGULCvp6os) 

During an organization change or transformation

- A percentage of folks will be impacted by  the transformation. Layoffs and downsizing are par for the course

- Most will Avoid falling knifes and ride it out this wave of change

- A few (like you) will seize the day and look for opportunities to expand their portfolio. Get promoted or take on new responsibilities

If you are looking to grow or seek a promotion during change, here are a few tips. 

- Leaders are bound to be looking for a few trusted hands who can help with change management

- Take a risk and be an active part of the change (even if it makes your role redundant)

- Leverage your network – relationships with your boss, bosses’ boss and division head

- Build on your past relationships

- Speak up - Highlight what you have done in the past  and how that can help with this transformation

- Raise your hand to manage the change 

- Volunteer for the unknown",Change_petition,3,1.0,1,1702881500,2023-12-18 06:38:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18l2bq4/can_you_ask_for_a_promotion_during_corporate/,12,2023

18l1fvh,How To Cope With A Loud Self-Centric Partner?,"Seriously need advice. I am a passionate person about what I do. I have great results from my past experiences and I am experienced more than 4 years in the business and industry. I recently moved back home from abroad and got a new job! This place is perfect, lots of benefits, fun and experienced people and so on. But there is this other coworker, who started working with me at the same day with same position. We are expected to work together.

They don't have the experience in the business but coming from something similar. They have no respect for me. Despite me being the experienced one, they take over everything, never ask a single advice or never do what I propose to. They do all the presentations. One time they let me do one presentation, and couldn't stand being silent for literally one minute and last thing I realise is that I am cast aside again.

Apart from that they are too, too loud. They constantly talk about what they are doing if they are doing something. If they have nothing to do, they talk about popular topics, football... whatever you can think of. No respect for personal space either. I am a silent person and I never been loud in my life. I have had excellent feedback record from my past jobs and clients. I am not even allowed to show myself to prove that my way works because they are too loud.

I can't complain about them due to them being kind of 'nepo' and actually doing stuff that I can't do because of her past experience. I tell them 'well, this is your are, I trust your gut' but they never tell me 'this is your area, I trust your gut'.

I honestly don't know how to cope with them. I am super stressed because of them. I can get another job so easily as my ex company wants me, one of my clients wants me, my uncle says I should work with his nephew at Unilever, somewhere else is headhunting me but I kind of mentally can't afford starting in a new place and I am only in my home country for 18 months.

18l0do6,comparing yourself to coworkers,"Hello friendly redditors. I'm looking for some different perspectives here. I apologize that the background is a bit of read, but I appreciate you taking the time to read it!

So, I graduated with a engineering degree about 3 years ago. and I've been working in my current role for a little over 2 years now. However, my specific degree and the multiple internships (1.5 years worth) I had during college in the same industry set me up very well for this role. 

Anyway, I when I started for the first year in the role, I quickly learned the ropes alongside someone who ended up moving to another position in the company. (I am 1 of 2 people doing my job, plus a couple other folks that do some similar tasks) Anyway, when he moved we hired a new guy into the position. He was hired in as SR. my job title; he had 18 years of experience working with some of the same software we use, but not much other relevant experience. Anyway, being that I am the only other person that does the job I was/am expected to teach him the ropes. So, over the course of the past year that I've been showing him the ropes I have been really rather unimpressed with him. Overall he is a good guy, but I wouldn't say he is picking it up quickly, and his lack of knowledge/experience in the industry is defiantly a limiting factor. 

I make about 80K a year myself which is probably pretty good for a young guy fresh out of college in the Midwest. but, the problem is that I just cannot get around the fact knowing that he has the Sr job title, and probably makes at least 20K or more a year doing the same job as me, while being worse at doing said job.

further compounding my frustration is that the department/company does a really poor job at professional development... Every single one of my coworkers are pretty much old enough that they could be my parents, so they just don't really care that much about their career advancement. I have asked my manager to try and come up with some good goals or something to work on to help me get a promotion quicker. However, despite the fact that I learned the ropes very quickly and have a excellent track record with the projects I've handled so far. He keeps saying that I do not have enough experience to get a significant raise and/or promotion and that I simply need to ""keep doing the excellent job just like I have been doing"" (literally was written on my year end review last year) The lack of clear goals, or constructive criticism really makes me feel like I am not in control of my own career.

to me, it boils down to how good you are at the job, not how experienced you are, and I'm pretty certain I am significantly better than pretty much all my coworkers at the job. Even some of our external customers have expressed that they are really impressed with my abilities and are really happy to work with me.

Is the world just this unfair? 

am I being impatient in asking for a raise/promotion? my manager certainly seem to think I am.

if the answers to the 2 questions above are no... How do I stop comparing myself to him?

thanks!

18l00zw,Put on a PIP recently and I need some advice on what to do!,"I have been working in my full-time job for almost two years and recently was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) which I believe will lead to my layoff. The nature of the situation was uncomfortable. A 10 minute call was placed on my calendar two weeks ago to notify me that I would be placed on a PIP. For the next two weeks there was no follow up. 

This Wednesday, a meeting was finally scheduled and I was told I would be given an hour to review the document summarizing my PIP prior to the meeting. The meeting was scheduled during my lunch break (I’m hourly so I’m not supposed to work during).

While reviewing the PIP I noticed in the examples they gave they mentioned that time off due to a medical emergency was unacceptable. The context of this is that I had an urgent deliverable due by EOD but around 3pm I had a medical emergency where I was unconscious and unable to communicate. It was extremely sudden and I didn’t anticipate being unconscious hence the emergency. 
They also mentioned that my communication around a mental health day was also unacceptable. But the context around that is that allegedly, I didn’t go to meetings and I pushed my work off and then just decided to take a mental health day. On my end, I have the screenshots and conversations surrounding these instances saved. What actually happened was I had a panic attack and told my lead that I wouldn’t be able to lead a daily internal meeting but would carry on doing what work I had in the background. When I felt better I did end up joining another internal meeting as well to coordinate. I did all my work that day and the only time I potentially “gave my work to someone else” (verbiage used in my PIP) was when I told them after a partner team sends a deliverable back to us, the team could review it to move it forward.

I took a mental health day the week prior as well, not on the day they claimed I did, and I was told by team leads during that conversation that that was fine. 

In my opinion, there were many inaccuracies that I have tracked down the communications of and very vague and subjective goals to work towards. I’ve already begun to look for new opportunities, but I was wondering if there are any steps I can take since the PIP lists many health related emergencies as justification for my layoff.",Useful-Persimmon-490,2,0.6700000166893005,14,1702873223,2023-12-18 04:20:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18l00zw/put_on_a_pip_recently_and_i_need_some_advice_on/,12,2023

18kz6yy,Raise and new title advice,"I started with a start up company a little under two years ago transitioning from a career I was in for over 12 years and held senior positions in. This was a huge pivot for me but I caught on quickly. Within 8 months I was put into a manager position for a program and I’ve turned this program around in many ways, from streamlining processes into leaner procedures and most importantly I’ve improved user engagement. I was recently offered a 10k raise. If you’ve gotten here you’re are probably thinking…so what’s the problem? Well, here’s the conundrum. The women before me ruined this program and held an executive level title as well as made a min. Of 20k-30k more than me. Additionally, a project manager who was making 6 figures was recently let go and all of his tasks directly fell into my daily responsibilities. I’m more than managing this program- I have built it from the ground up and now even negotiating with top executives at large companies to add to my calendar of events as well. I guess I am struggling with the fact that the gentleman that was holding a position I now directly absorbed in addition to my existing role  was making 20k more than me and the previous girl held a higher title and made more money and did nothing compared to what I do. Now, do I take the raise and be quiet? Or do I take the raise and ask for the title that matches my work? Or do I respectfully ask for more and higher title for reasons above?

The thing is, I am miserable. Since I was a kid, I have dreams of being an Actor on Film and TV. But I never had the chance to do it.  
In high school, I did took drama classes and received excellence in drama award. But that nothing compared to real acting.  
Now that I am in college, I am completely focused on my career and school. What setting me back is I don't see myself working 9 to 5 for the next 40 years of my life.  
Yes, I am going into high finance, yes, I am meeting top professionals, and yes, I am actively seeking opportunities. I basically feel like a successful slave.  
I want to hang out with my friends more, I want to be more active, I want to go skiing for the first time and try out many things, etc.  
When it comes to my career, either I go into this business life where I am working 40 to 60 hours a week and I will never feel truly happy. But I will make great money, prestige, stability, and opportunities.  
Or I can go into the acting world, where I can be a film actor and work on projects based on my own time, etc. Yes I do know being an Actor isn't easy and it not like Hollywood where I can make millions with a stable career.  
Honestly, I just want to be rich. I want to retire my mom, who has been working hard for how long? I want to travel across the world; I want to own a restaurant business; I want to own a laundry business; I want to own a community service; I want to help the homeless and donate to school, etc. I want to do my education in California; I want to do my education at Harvard, etc. I want to go skydiving, etc. I just don't have the money.  
The thing is, if I go down this 9-to-5 route in finance, it won't work, as acting and business are two opposing things. I won't have the time to start a business; I won't have the time to truly feel happy, and working will just remove the lust in my life.  
My current plan right now is to just focus on school, get business internships, and aiming to become an extra in high-production films or feature in commercials one day.  
Somebody, please help me out. I'm tired of going to these networking event where I am kissing these people asses for an internship. I don't feel happy I just climb my way up the corporate ladder, and when I am at the top, I am miserable?

2) I haven't looked especially far into different types of engineering, and I am not sure what might be the best option. I want to gain a general technical understanding in order to be more effective at problem-solving and communicating with more specialized people.

18kpih2,How to change my co-worker's view of me?,"Hello all.

I am working my first office job (trade worker, got injured and here I am). I am a happily married guy, and don't read social cues the best. 

I started this position a few months ago. It's a small office looking to expand, and I was hired in with a woman for the same position, where we'd be sharing an office. She and I were the only smokers, so between sharing an office and smoke breaks, we spent more time together than anything. It was always professional, she'd complain about her significant other here and there, I'd say ""that sucks"" and that was it. 

A few months later, my boss has me move offices to share with another guy. I don't think anything of it. Shortly after, the lady I shared an office with gets fired for attendance issues.

Well, after she gets fired, all this stuff comes to light. Everyone sensed there was more to our ""relationship"" than there was. The reason my boss had me move offices is she felt the woman was flirting with me, and ""wanted to protect my marriage"". When the lady got fired, she had some tell all about how she had broke up with her significant other, and it was found out there were pictures of sex toys on the her work phone when she turned them in. 

So long story short, the office thinks we had something going on, that I never even realized could have been a thought. I made it clear I didn't know she was flirting with me or that it could even be construed that way, and even if she was I would never consider reciprocating. The staff thinks I tried to be a ""white knight"" and save this lady from her significant other and the stuff she was going through, which I didn't know about (when she was getting fired she was telling the boss how she was being abused and stuff from my understanding).

I told my wife all of this, she laughed and said it sounds like me, as I don't see signs or get hints that well. I always kept it professional, she never had my personal number or any personal connection like social media or anything. But being looked at by the office for this kind of sucks. I feel like a dirt bag even though I didn't know anything was going on. Should I address this with the office again, or will it go away in time?",Smokingsasquatch,23,0.9700000286102295,12,1702842575,2023-12-17 19:49:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18kpih2/how_to_change_my_coworkers_view_of_me/,12,2023

18kkgvt,How to talk to my Supervisor about how I don’t want to look for a new job?,"First for context, I live in Canada and my supervisor has advised me that I am not at risk for losing my job. We just don’t have supportive upper management. I am union and I have seniority.

Every time a new position in a similar organization is posted, my manager is on my case to apply. True,  there can be some better pay and I could then move to a theoretically cheaper city. He is very willing to provide a good reference. 

Sounds great right? And the cost of living keeps going up. And I am the main breadwinner in the family (my husband does freelance, so the pay is irregular). 

But the other thing is: in my current position, I have great vacation time and leave policies. I am going through testing related to my chronic conditions and I am covered. I know all the people I work with and how to push things through. 

And all of that, with older family members and health conditions!really means a lot. I’m not kidding when I say I worry about my parents making it to their next birthday.

If I were to move to a new organization, I am back down to snippets of vacation time. I have to go through 6 months of review, before I’m permanent union. I would be leaving various projects in progress. 

What I want is more professional development. He’s supporting me through some professional membership stuff. I want to attend more conferences etc.

Personality wise, he’s a pretty extroverted, super honest guy, always expressing himself and often thinking he knows a bit better. Will get mad super quick, but also gets over things super quick. 

I don’t want it to seem like I don’t value his opinion. But I do want him to stop grumping if I don’t apply. I’ve tried to be straight with him about my concerns, but he has this idea that I can just negotiate the vacation and work from home conditions, like it’s no big thing.",katmekit,5,0.8600000143051147,4,1702829073,2023-12-17 16:04:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18kkgvt/how_to_talk_to_my_supervisor_about_how_i_dont/,12,2023
18kk5si,I have no reason to go on and live life at this point I honestly feel suicidal at this point??,"Hello everyone. I am 25 years old, and I feel like a complete idiot and a failure. I have been dealing with ADHD since I was 7, and sometimes I think I'm just not intelligent. Graduating high school was a struggle for me, and I was compelled to attend community college because I am a first-generation Asian American. My dad always believed that our financial difficulties were due to his lack of a degree, so I enrolled in community college. It took me nearly four years, but I managed to earn three associate degrees simultaneously. When I was almost 22, I was accepted into Rutgers Business School in New Brunswick. However, they did not accept my calculus credits, so I ended up going to TCNJ - The College of New Jersey - in 2021. I despised it there because it was a lesser-known state school with predominantly wealthy white students and lacked diversity. I felt there were no opportunities for me, and I had no desire to attend a college where I would start with $10,000 to $20,000 less in salary due to not attending a prestigious school and lacking a recognizable name on my resume. Consequently, I made the decision to drop out.

I then pursued a career in tech sales, but I hated it. I encountered some truly awful and unpleasant individuals. Afterward, I took some time off and earlier this year, in 2023, I discovered that Rutgers Business School actually has two campuses: New Brunswick and Newark. The Newark campus would have accepted all my credits, including calculus. However, back in 2020, when I was making my decisions, New Brunswick never informed me about the existence of the other campus. I endured three years of agony for nothing. Now I find myself back in college, a junior at Rutgers Business School in Newark, majoring in supply chain management. Unfortunately, my GPA is abysmal, and I fear that I may be dismissed from the program. At 25, I feel like I am significantly behind in life. I am filled with anxiety that I will never achieve wealth, earn a six-figure salary, own a luxurious home, or obtain an entry-level position with a salary of $70,000 to $80,000, with the potential to earn $120,000 or more in three years. I also worry that I won't be married with children before I turn 30, like many individuals from prestigious schools and wealthy families. At this point, I am starting to believe that I am utterly hopeless. I experience thoughts of suicide on a daily basis, and I have lost all hope for the future. I don't care if people mock me or ban me after reading this. I just feel like my life is completely ruined.",Throwav3456,2,0.5600000023841858,44,1702828221,2023-12-17 15:50:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18kk5si/i_have_no_reason_to_go_on_and_live_life_at_this/,12,2023

Hey yall, 

 I’m married and 35 with a 16-month old toddler living in Texas. I spent the past 16 years of my life as a professional athlete. I was able to gain tremendous life experience through my athletic career, yet didn’t properly set myself up for the next step in life. I didn’t finish my education nor was I able to stash enough of my earnings into savings. Currently I am a private instructor for youth athletes, and my earnings fluctuate based on appointments. I have some prior experience in Sales (part-time) and coaching. Long term, I would like a stable career that will allow me to provide for my family and allow my wife to work less. 

My wife has a very stable job with great benefits, but travels 5-6 days out of the week. She is the main provider at this moment. 

I enrolled in EMS School and have intent on joining a Fire Department as a Firefighter. I’m uncertain if this will be the correct career path to go towards.

Also i work in public sector so no pay rises now and can’t negotiate one. I’ve been frustrated by this and also don’t feel valued for the work I do, I’m given really complex pieces of work and no recognition which upsets me. I’ve been unhappy with the role a long time if I’m being honest.

The flip side of this what keeps me there is that they are very flexible, understanding if I’m ill due to children giving me every bug possible from nursery and I’ve also got a health condition, supportive and flexible manager and in general I’m just very comfortable. I’m known and respected as I’ve already proved myself. 

I keep applying for jobs and then withdrawing or saying no where offered to interview, this one I went through the interview process which was rigorous and to my surprise I got it. It’s the same role I do now but somewhere else but a step up with more responsibility. They’re offering me 
30% more money, there’s career development, offering me flexible working so can pick my children and also work from home half the week. It’s private sector.

So pros 
More money and opportunity to make money
Career development and a step up 
Not as stressful a subject I’d be working on
Flexible working 
Subject matter isn’t as intense so mental health wise might be better 
Commute isn’t longer than current job.

Cons
Private sector so pension isn’t as good but it’s not bad 
Lose a day annual leave 
I’ve got young children and unsure if I’m ready to start all again and make an impression
Worried I’ll keep catching bugs and it impacts new job. 
It’s a step up and worried I can’t do it 
Scared I can’t do the job and people won’t like me 
Leaving my comfy job.
Might get bored with subject eventually as it’s not as exciting but also might be good for me mental health wise.

Pros:
- sales job with relatively low technical details or selling (I'm essentially a messenger/account manager in a niche but in-demand service in the medical field)
- 110k total salary this year (base and commission) and brought in ~$920k in revenue.
- very low stress regarding deadlines/work load and able to regularly wake up at 10-11am almost daily without any repercussions from customers or management. 
- work either from home or travel in the field to visit customers face to face and never required it go into an office  and rarely interact with other sales reps/company employees
- work weeks are generally 20-30 max
- compensated 50/day for food, 66¢/mile, $150 for hotels, $400/flight when traveling
- 401k with company match
- company has given $2-4k annual raise every year since I've started

Cons:
- management is practically non existent and doesn't seem to have any realistic goals for long term expansion(small company of 30 people)
- no ability for growth or promotions (received a 2-4k
- required to travel ~30 weeks out of year/60% travel (Mon-fri/weekdays only though)
- low barrier to entry and relatively commoditized service so new competitors are easily able to disrupt a market/territory by offering lower pricing
- company and managers are slow to respond to internal problems faced in the field
- unable to vacation internationally since am forced to be spend so much the field
- relatively chaotic and unstable home life since I'm gone so much (can't have a dog, tough on relationships, forced to eat at restaurants, etc)

18k9wlq,Adding “Senior” to title on CV,"Hi all,

Posting this from a throwaway account. 

I work as a Project Engineer in the construction industry in Australia. In 2020 I joined a company with the intention of moving up to senior a few months after I started. Long story short, some things fell through at no fault of my bosses but the senior title bump didn’t happen and I stayed for 2 years anyway as I enjoyed the work. 

I left that company in 2022 but now a recruiter has been in touch about a great opportunity within the same company, but different business unit. However, I added “Senior” to my title in my CV even though it was never formalised during my time there. 

I was a high performer there, won awards and placed into their internal leadership program. I definitely did the responsibilities of a senior like creating and implementing processes that made a genuinely positive change in the way the parts of the project was administered. Two project managers I worked for kindly emailed me a copy of their nominations for me to win the quarterly award which mentions the processes I implemented and general high performance. 

I’m worried when HR look at my Cv that they will see I have “Senior” in my title which won’t be reflected in their end. I added this to reflect my actual responsibilities and experience. 

How should I approach this? Pull out of the recruitment process? Not say anything? Be upfront at my first interview?",AdeptnessAlive4439,1,0.5,12,1702790114,2023-12-17 05:15:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18k9wlq/adding_senior_to_title_on_cv/,12,2023

18k7yp0,Is this retaliation?,"I work in the wellness industry, and most of the time days are pretty relaxed. Nothing crazy for the day to day for stress.  
However, one day I got triggered and I left early . A coworker thought I was mad at her,  when I wasn't.  I did apologize to her after. I felt badly that she thought she did something wrong. 
I had a panic attack and was crying when I left.  
I returned to work the next day and it was typical. My boss wanted to follow-up with me (I had sent an email explaining the situation and apologized) at first it was productive until she said that because of the potential to be triggered again she doesn't want me working upfront with clients. (Only alone with them in the treatment rooms...) which didn't make sense to me.  She had no concerns about my performance until I was triggered. She knew about my ptsd and anxiety related to it. It felt like she was making assumptions about what I can and can't do.  She didn't ask me what I needed ect,  it was I just can't do it. She continued on and I don't remember what she said I was trying to process the loss of shifts and figure out what just happened. 
After that meeting I told her boss (cause we don't have an official HR person) about the conversation. He called me and called me a liar and said I was making accusations that aren't true. He told me I'm suspended until we have a meeting to discuss if I'm staying employed. He said he wouldn't care if I left before then. I told him I only want to do my job as I had been before the meeting with my boss. There was so much he was saying,  it was hard to keep track of.  I asked him to email me the details about the conversation and suspension. He said he didn't have to email shit. I don't know if it's paid or unpaid. 

I have kids and I'm worried I don't have a job anymore.  

There was no concerns at all about my performance at work until this.  In fact my boss the week before had started me on training for a promotion. 
The issues only started after I was triggered and had to leave, then got worse when I expressed concern about misconceptions impacting and limiting my work. 

Is this discrimination? It feels like it is.  I've never had any issues there. I don't ask for accommodations, and can usually keep my anxiety in check. I was just hit with a perfect storm of things and it overwhelmed me. I tried to make amends and I was ready to figure out with my boss what could help in the future.  I didn't expect shifts being take away and suspended. I didn't hurt anyone,  or yell,  or was rude to clients (they didn't see what happened) one person that I said ""it's fine"" to in a tone and left took it personally and thought she did something wrong.  She didn't. It was just the situation. 

I don't get what's happening but I don't think I'm going to have a job anymore.  I regret giving up my other job to be there full time. I never thought this would happen. 

I'm losing $750 of pay from this suspension. I'm not sure how I'll make rent,  even with not finishing my Christmas shopping for my kids and just not spending money on extras.

18k6xou,Should I stay or should I go?,"Posting on here because my husband and I are genuinely torn on staying in Cleveland or taking the offer I got and moving to Nashville. 

I applied to this position 3 months ago…I have always wanted to work at this company and am surprised I landed the offer! I’ll lay out the scenario and pros and cons. Looking for what you would do. 

CURRENT: I make $100K, I content create in my city and make an additional $30K. employer additionally pays $6K per year on my grad school.  We own a house. Husband makes $70K. We both LOVE our current jobs. I received the highest score on my performance eval possible this year. I should be getting a promotion in the next year. I have 6 weeks PTO and we only go in office 4 days a week. Half-Day Fridays. Husband and I travel to Nashville often to visit friends. We enjoy it there a ton!

PROPOSED: Offered a job for $135K in Nashville. Would have to relocate on my own. Would have to pay back the $6K to my employer on grad school and be responsible for paying my own way moving forward. Husband would have to find a new job. Better retirement. Worse PTO. Worse workplace flexibility. More stable job security. Very similar job to what I do now. It’s a lateral move technically. 

Benefits to accepting: 
were young and it’s a fun, new chapter
Massive pay bump at dayjob
Earnings per hour overall is better
Nashville is a growing city!

Cons to accepting: 
Must pay to relocate
Must pay grad school
Less workplace flexibility/PTO
My content creation account is specific to cleveland, would lose that. Could always start a new one in Nashville 

Would need to (if accepting):
Sell house
Move within two months
Husband find new job

I am not running from anything. I love my life here. But It’s a shiny new opportunity and could be exciting? But also, I would be very sad leaving this chapter here.

18k3s8g,Socially Akward in the Corporate World (long post),"I am new to the Corporate world and I am struggling to be confident in it. I just got a new job and the people in this company are very social and network with many colleagues. 

I on the other hand  have social anxiety and get really nervous talking and building relationships with people. Now I have realized I need to get over it in order to excel in this company. Especially after what happened Friday, after the Company Holiday Party. 

 I have been trained by a colleague that lives in a different state for about over a month now. Him and his team flew over to our office location on Thursday to attend our Holiday Party. We finally met that day and he seemed very fond of me. 
Now it's Friday and there is just a few of us at the office. So I get more nervous because this guy that has been training me tries to it next to me and talk to me a lot. He tries his best to help me with my assignments and includes me in other conversations. 

Now it's the end of the day and he and his team have to finally fly out. He comes over to say goodbye and I obviously say Bye but got so anxious that I looked over to the team next to him saying their goodbyes as well. I noticed it might have been rude since he probably wanted to tell me something heart felt and gave me me the cold shoulder after I waved bye to him as they were leaving. 

I then learned he is one of the developers of the company. So he is an important guy and I screwed it! 

I was thinking on messaging him on Monday and bring up how bad I am at goodbyes and hopefully he gets over it.

 Any tips you all can offer me? Any books or podcasts that can help me build confidence and work in the Corporate world. 

I want to establish a relationship with him and other important colleagues. Learn how to socialize successfully to prevent this from happening again in the future.

18k2rm8,Should I be looking for a new job?,"I need some opinions on whether or not I should start looking for a new job based on my situation.

I've only ever had one job and have been working for this small company for 13+ years. I have been promoted multiple times and have been in my current position for around 8 years. Though I reached the ceiling for promotion, I receive new responsibilities occasionally. 

The company grew this year by 29%, however, this has not been a positive change. The owner has stated that we are struggling financially and cut our labor budget significantly. Things have been stressful.

Up until these past months, I have never felt as though my job was in jeopardy. I have a close working relationship with both the owner and my only supervisor and have truly felt they care for me as they've expressed that over the years. However, recently I feel as though I've been treated differently by them and they have taken away some of the freedom I've enjoyed though I have never done anything wrong and have not been counseled.

These changes have led me to believe that they're trying to determine whether my contributions are a necessary expense for the company. I have discussed this with my supervisor and she has refrained from giving me any reassurance which is unusual. (I understand the legal ramifications of her providing reassurance, but we've always been straightforward with each other. For example, she calls herself like my ""mom"" and I actually rent my current home from her, so we have never had a truly formal working relationship.)




Other possibly necessary information:
• My supervisor has been working for the owner for longer than I've been alive. They are very close and she is more like his business partner than his employee. Throughout the years, they've made me feel that I am their most trusted and valued employee and I hold the highest position in the company right below my supervisor.
• In June, I'll be completing my bachelor's degree and the owner and my supervisor know this. I have told them that even with my new degree, I do not plan to seek new employment. Though truthfully, I would seek new employment in the future if I felt more comfortable doing so, but I'd let them know several months in advance before I even started looking for a new job. 
• I'm in a lot of debt and like the stability of my current job so I don't feel it's a smart choice to move on yet.
• I'm severely underpaid based on industry averages, my abilities, and the amount of work I do, but I'm comfortable.

In a nutshell, I’ve been pretty happy with my current position (2 YoE SDE at medium company) and haven’t thought much about looking for a new job. But just yesterday, our company’s CEO sent out an email to everyone saying that due to not making our yearly goals they’ll be making cuts to the following:
- No more 401k match
- 50% cut on bonus plans
- 50% cut to vacation and PTO hours
- No “cost of living adjustment” at beginning of new year

These seem pretty drastic and raised some red flags to me, and it has me thinking about looking for a new job. But hearing all these horror stories about the current job market (and seeing friends go through it), I think finding a new job might be out of the question at the moment.

18k2kj8,"Unsure about a new job, should I tough it out or leave?","(disclaimer: I probably sound weak af but I’ve worked bad jobs, long hours, had “crazy” bosses so I thought I was more tolerant than I apparently am)

 I was laid off in November and was fortunate enough to get a job offer within a week of being unemployed. This was the first offer and it’s not the same field I was in but I was excited to learn something new. I was hired to be a project manager. In order to become the project manager I have to earn certifications in the field and have experience in the field. Which I was cool with, I like being outside especially in spring-fall. Winter is tolerable for certain periods of time. As a project manager I was told I would have some field work, but nothing too physically demanding, and field work in things that actually interest me. Problem is, one field job is absolutely not for me. I commend those who can do it, but I cannot long term. I think winter definitely makes it seem a lot worse than it is. 

The company does not really have a schedule. So my schedule can be unpredictable, an 8am-4pm could be a 6am-5pm etc. I also had to sign a waiver to agree that I wasn’t guaranteed lunches/breaks. This is legal for the job, I did not know this before being hired.

After a day where I was scheduled a 7am-3pm I ended up doing an outdoors 6am-7:45pm (I was kinda expecting a 12 hour day but damn) didn’t eat until 6pm and basically worked through the food. Afterwards, I told them I think I’m not a good fit for the job. They assured me I’d become a project manager in February after passing the exam and not have to work that specific field job but I know I never want to do another day like that. It seems like everyone else is unhappy there so I’m a bit worried they’re bait and switching a bit. They told me to think about it and talk to them again and I agreed. The other project managers do the field job but they assured me I would be different and not be on the same job. There are many different field positions.

Anywho, I’m conflicted and don’t want to jump ship but on that day I had a very strong revelation of “I never want to be in this position again” i absolutely hate the lack of a real schedule. I know for a fact the unpredictable schedule does not work for my life, but I guess when I’m a project manager things may become more predictable?

Should I wait it out and hope things get better? Should I just leave?

18k25s7,EOY Compensation ≠ Review - Is it time to change jobs?,"TL;DR: Is my gut correct in thinking my new VP simply doesn’t like me and I’m best off trying to find a new job, despite all the new initiatives I’ve started and praise/awards I’ve gotten this year? 

Longer story — I am looking for some professional advice and mentorship, as I’m currently facing a crossroads in my career and feel a bit lost. I joined my current organization about a year and a half ago as an associate, initially with a focus on graphic design, digital marketing, and communications. I love the work we do, as it’s incredibly important for the sake of our country (nonpartisan work), and I have never wavered in that passion. 

However, since joining, my role has changed significantly and I’m the only remaining member of my team that was here last year. I’ve not only adapted to these various changes, but brought innovation to my department, and helped welcome/onboard multiple managers and a recent new head of our department. I’ve started an entirely new program for the org and was instrumental in managing the vision/development of our website redesign. Throughout the year, I’ve received countless praise from my colleagues, including my executive director. I even received a quarterly award recognizing my outstanding contributions to the team, specifically noting how much I care about my colleagues and make the workplace fun/enjoyable. My performance reviews have been overwhelmingly positive, aligning with my own self-assessment and feedback from peers and managers who have ranked me as exceedingly expectations. 

Unfortunately, I had my end of year compensation conversation yesterday and I was blindsided by their decision not to promote me and only gave me the bare minimum COLA wage increase (I’m an associate still so this was not much and I’m already barely getting by on my salary.) This was not at all what I was expecting, as there was NEVER any indication that this would be the outcome. I had even been on a professional development plan this year that I proactively initiated, which HR signed off on as did our Chief of Staff, that was pursued with the goal of advancing in the org. I executed every level of that plan, had monthly meetings with my manager tracking my progress, and have even attended trainings as part of this program. 

When I asked what the rationelle was for this decision, it was made known that my boss, our new VP of our department (they’ve been part of the team for less than 2 months and work remotely), and our head of HR met to discuss my role. During this meeting, my new boss (I’ve only ever worked with her in person for 3 days and have not been involved in hardly any of her workflows since she hasn't included me on a lot of calls) decided I needed to get on a new “plan” to help me achieve my promotion. It just feels very odd that a person of less than two months on the team had the ability to make such a call despite all the accolades I’ve received/accomplished with excellence this year. I asked my manager if she saw my EOY review packet, as I thought she might not have had a full picture of all I'd accomplished. But he said she had, leaving me to believe that she simply doesn’t like me and is trying to force me out so she can rebuild the department with someone else she has in mind for my spot.

Do you think I’m missing something or should I listen to my gut and immediately start applying for new jobs? Any advice is much appreciated!",KindHeartedTraveler,1,1.0,0,1702765151,2023-12-16 22:19:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18k25s7/eoy_compensation_review_is_it_time_to_change_jobs/,12,2023
18k04y5,Need help asking for more money,"I took a promotion last year that had me move cross country (more desirable location but around 25% higher col) and increased my pay around 26% to114,500. That is 70% guarantee and 30% commission based on territory performance (total target dollars vs actual) this is the number one stat we are judged on. My new sales territory was a much smaller target dollar amount (around half) as also I believed it was under-developed. So, I was very happy with the situation I was walking into. Fast forward 1 year the company had a rough 2023. However, I worked very hard developing business and I am leading the east coast team in sales attainment and 3rd in the company. I was told 5 weeks ago they were moving the sales person in the large geographical territory north of me to cover a open position. I was taking over that position and they were reducing overall head count on our team by 1 person. Next year my territory target will be more in line with the rest of my team. However this number is based off of 2 peoples work and I will need to cover a huge geographical territory (though I will have the same number of accounts). After our last 1-1 two weeks ago I told my boss we need to discuss pay on this Monday. He warned me I should tapper my expectations due to the company performance. However, My performance was not the issue and we are dropping one salary on our team. It will be much more challenging to hit the full 30% commission and I am going to be away from home a lot more next year. I feel like this is all risk no reward for me as I was happy with my current situation. Getting some more money would make me feel a lot better about the new territory. Can I have some objective opinions on what you think I should ask for how I should structure this conversation any resources I should use and any points that you think would be powerful for leveraging.",BKallDAY24,2,1.0,0,1702759287,2023-12-16 20:41:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18k04y5/need_help_asking_for_more_money/,12,2023

18jz8ld,Double Standards? my boss said that's what I was hinting at.. then I got scolded,"In my current work environment, a concerning situation has developed where the owner has developed a close relationship with a new hire. This individual refuses to communicate and when asked why says ""I just leave it as is"". He has been untruthful about updating a shared report. During presentations, their notes are often missing, and the saved entries are cryptic, resembling a code that only they understand.  
  
Additionally, the new hire consistently arrives late to the office without facing consequences, in contrast to the scrutiny I received for minor lateness (my avg. arrival time is 9:05 am, while he consistently arrives after 9:30 am). Another employee from another department has consistently criticized my tardyness while simultaniusly minimizing the other employee's tardyness. I get a ""you need to set you're alarm to wake up earlier"" or long texts how my (she has specifically mentioned me by name as the reason) tardyness affects her productivity; while the new-hire gets ""oh look who overslept again"" or ""oh no traffic must've been really bad"" ""late again? hahaha why? did you stay up late?""  
  
His tardyness usually leads to me reviewing his emails & tasks while reviewing my emails & tasks, and researching on other platforms for the update. An update that had he been at the office, he could have updated the report. On avg. these updates take me an 1 hour and 30 minutes to accomplish throughout the day. While in the office, mysel and an employee from another dept. are the only ones to answer phones. The employee usually knows when her clients are calling so she beats me to those calls but to the miscellaneous calls Im the main receiver. Only on one day out of the week I don't answer calls because I work from home and the entire office hasn't been able to take calls from home on the network. These calls on average. take and hour and 15 minutes out of my day. Including lunch that is three hours cut from a day's work. Throughout the day my boss will also ask for random pop-up tasks with an unknown deadline.. these on avg. take daily 2 hours and 25 minutes to complete....adding on my daily email reponse time of 1 hour and 57 minutes.... that's 7 hours ...out of a regular 9am - 5pm.. with little room to work on advancing my tasks and completing my new calls.  
  
To address these challenges, I brought my concerns to the owner/my boss, explaining how the situation has impacted my task efficiency. I introduced an Excel sheet detailing the time spent on various projects, calls, and emails. Regrettably, the Director interpreted this effort as a sign of me managing others rather than focusing on my tasks. Furthermore, the Director defended the new hire's late arrivals, citing their collaborative reviews after work, which he believed demonstrated their commitment.  
  
Despite my own late stays to maintain productivity, I face limitations due to graduate classes from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm out of three days of the Monday to Friday week. To compensate for laggin behind on tasks, I've stayed late on the two days out of the week that I have availability, but the owner's response was ""yeah but I don't konw what you are working on. How do I not know it's not school?""....I thought my schooling would be a benefit to the job as it is in PR & Marketing ... which is part of my core responsibilities...When I proposed sharing a list of tasks completed outside regular business hours, the Director dismissed the idea, instead suggesting that I arrive earlier than 9 am to address concerns about punctuality. I am a family person, so this would require a family time change outside of business relations... I explained to my boss that I had familial responsibilities before 9am that may impede me from arriving any earlier than that... it was dismissed.  
  
In seeking clarification on potential issues with a new software, I encountered resistance. he new employee explained to me how this new application we use for work could delete certain things on the phones that have the app. Of course, I was concerned and emailed compliance for further clarification while attending the recommended webinar.. but because I said that the new hire had told me about the new features I was told I was putting his career ""under the bus"" since he had just gotten his credentials. I wasn't aware of his credential timing, I didn't know when he took the test or when applied. The focus of my email was my confusion and concern for the application that can monitor my texts and delete stuff...Owner asked why I had a problem with the new-hire and my continuous response has been that I don't have a proble with him individually. I'm trying to ""break the communication barrier that exists"" and cited the previous employee who was open on communication and would have meetings with me to review.",Simplethinking0,1,0.5400000214576721,6,1702756745,2023-12-16 19:59:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18jz8ld/double_standards_my_boss_said_thats_what_i_was/,12,2023

18jz3sv,Upcoming salary and promotion negotiation. How should I approach this with no formal education or background in my field?,"Salary Negotiation
Okay so I (35f) dropped out of college (for music - I was 18 and figured I’d get a job as a professional marimba player I guess) after a year. Not super relevant, but for the next several years I got addicted to drugs then got clean then did the same with alcohol a few times and now at 35, I’m finally at the point where I feel like that’s all behind me. 

*History*
I’ve worked mostly in customer service and sales. Got sucked into one of those door-to-door sales companies (technically not MLM but as close as you can get) and I moved around the country and ended up opening my own office in Tampa only to realize the whole company was basically a cult and a scam. Learned a lot though so not a complete loss. Got a job as a manager of a Verizon Wireless store, then a call center, I do graphic design on the side, and in August 2022 I got a job at a bank for an entry level call center position. I got really lucky because their call center was over-staffed and they had an opening in a new personal loan department as a loan processor. I was interviewed for it and got it. 

*Current Job*
Immediately I saw opportunities for efficiency gains. Stupid things, like saving email templates from Word as a signature in Outlook, creating rules for their shared mailbox, and introducing everyone to world of conditional formatting for their spreadsheets. 

From August to March we didn’t have a permanent manager. Our interim manager said I should inquire about management but I know I’m not a good manager so I politely told her I wasn’t interested. 

April is when it got interesting (for me - definitely not for anyone reading this I’m sorry). We got a new manager and I immediately sent her a 12 page proposal to create a role for me as a Pipeline Strategist. She basically scoffed at it, “I’m sorry but we can’t just …CREATE a position that suits your preferences.” Okay fine. I’ll just continue to prove my worth. 

*Skills*
From April of this year to now I’ve taught myself A LOT. Built our team’s SharePoint, automated manual forms, created workflows for manual processes, learned how to write macros, created HTML email templates with placeholders that auto-fill, created a management dashboard, application tracker that updates daily through the database eliminating the need to manually track the applications, I’m now more proficient in SQL than our reporting team and I just learned it in September, I was a tester for new releases of our loan originations tool, I’m decent at Tableau and Power BI, and over the past few months, my manager has included me in upper management meetings and has been a real advocate for my growth. There are a shit ton of other projects I’ve completed but I’ll spare you. 

*Impact*
Because of all the automation, we’ve been able to adopt workloads from other teams in our department because we have the capacity. I even voiced my concerns that the projected headcount for 2024 is too high. Did a deep dive on our team’s performance and because I’m in the trenches with everyone, I know exactly how to quantify our work, which was a huge question mark for the capacity planning guys. With their projections and my 2023 data, I was able to show that they’re overshooting by about 30% (even before inflating the estimate to account for time off, which my numbers were based off avg number of bodies in seats). For reference, they were projecting as high as 31 full time employees and my reporting showed we would realistically only need 21 for that particular week. 

The kicker is that there’s another team in our department that’s understaffed and has a manager working double duty with two teams. Our roles are basically the same as this team but they’re inbound and we’re outbound. 

Not only are they looking to backfill 2 vacancies on our team, but they want to hire 4 more people for the inbound team AND another manager. My manager is confident she could run both teams and my idea was to just merge them, cross train everyone, and create a dual/hybrid position. 

*What now? Help!*
Here’s where I need advice. I’m going to disclose salary because I don’t care and have never understood why that’s private. Currently I make $53k (it’s hourly and I’ve worked a lot of OT so I’ll probably end the year around $60k) with the same job title of Loan Processor as when I started. The goal is to transition me into an Analyst role. My salary negotiation will be next month and I’ve never been in this position. I feel like I have the upper hand here. My manager told me the number she heard thrown around was $60k or $70k. 

I hate to be like this, because I don’t have any formal education or training or background in banking or analysis but everything just seems to click with me here and I’m a problem solver by nature. Our reporting team is super impressed by me and I’ve shown the guy who showed me the ropes in SQL some tricks and creative solutions to the point where he calls *me* for help. Everyone is super supportive and our department is still relatively new so there’s a ton of opportunity for innovation and growth so finding another job is not of interest for me. 

Am I in a position where I could ask for more? And what would that number look like? What kind of information should I get together for this negotiation and how much is too much to ask for? Does hard evidence of improving operational efficiencies outweigh the lack of formal training and a degree? Am I completely off-base here and should just appreciate any raise? How much do companies value potential? Any advice is greatly appreciated! 


Tl;dr I don’t have experience, education, or training in what I do but I’m a natural problem solver and can save our company a couple hundred thousand with my capacity planning analysis. Need to know how much $$ to ask for and what data I need to back it up.",Appropriate_Salad_30,2,1.0,5,1702756354,2023-12-16 19:52:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18jz3sv/upcoming_salary_and_promotion_negotiation_how/,12,2023
18jz1ir,Should this be my reason to quit or am I just being a whimp who’s looking for my way out??,"I just started my job yesterday and omg my foot and back pain has never been so prominent. I have metatarsalgia foot pain and my first 3 shifts will be 7 hours. I’m on day 2 of my job so far so tomorrow is another 7 hour shift, and it’s not going to get better as I recall, they said that 7 hour shifts are common or are the minimum. The only time I get to sit is during a 30 minute break and there’s only 2 chairs in the sitting area where employees are allowed. I couldn’t even sit down during my break today because those chairs were occupied. There’s another space but that’s where managers are for a great deal of the shifts apparently. I have shoe insoles for my metatarsalgia so after a painful first day, I figured I’d do an experiment and use my shoe inserts to see if things get easier and yea while I’m not in as much pain as I was yesterday, it’s still a plentiful amount of pain that I’m already experiencing at this job. I knew that this job has their employees standing all the time from a former employee but I thought that they would at least ask if I had a disability during the hiring process, like all the job applications I’ve done before have, to see if I needed accommodation but they didn’t. It doesn’t help that I’m standing for 6/7 hours AND I have to walk to and from work(which is luckily less than a 15 minute walk) I already have intentions to not stay long at the job because I only needed it so I could make money to leave for college. But I was met with an actual reason to quit in a few weeks. I’m not loving the job either so that could also be a reason that I’m looking at my foot pain as a means to end this with good reason. Want do you think? Also, I need guidance on how to quit when it’s time, because idk what to say but I definitely now have a viable reason that I want to use to explain me quitting. Keep in mind that that I’ve already been to a doctor regarding my foot pain and that is how I got diagnosed but I probably don’t have the time to bring proof from my doctor into this when the time comes to quit. I have no other reason to quit besides for college but they don’t know that I’m planning to leave for college. They asked me am I in school and I said no because I’m not currently and if I would’ve told them that I’m staying for a short period they probably wouldn’t have hired me😬.

18jyyhe,Career advice needed,"Hello, let me start by saying thank you to anyone that replies with suggestions. 

I'm currently working remote in the Bay Area for a financial institution, and will be laid off in the next year. I will recieve about a year of severance. With that said, the looming layoff has taken a toll on me and become extremely stressful. Im 20yrs into a banking career with a background in a bunch of niche banking stuff that doesn't crossover well anything else (trust me, I've been looking for the past year. Its so niche that most of it only applies to the financial institution I work at now). Also, the job market is brutal right now, and all the related banking jobs are on the east coast (I cannot relocate due to family reasons). The remote option is almost non existent these days in banking as well. I have a degree in Business Management and I'm currently making low 6 figures. My objective is to attempt at maintaining my income level for survival reasons (single father that lives alone). I know money isn't everything, but when you are caring for a child and yourself, it's needed.

 I'm looking for some good possible career change options that pay well, and may, or may not require more schooling. I understand its subjective based on my interest but im kindly asking for ideas.

I thought of possibly doing a coding bootcamp, but I know that field is highly saturated and going through layoffs as well, plus finding a job would be highly competive. My other thought was to go back to go back to school for Respritory Therapy which is about 19 months plus another 6 months for state exams. Maybe work at night doing uber in an effort to make enough for bills durning the second year after my severance runs out. Unfortunately the school is about 50k, but I can take loans. At this point the stress is catching up, and I'm running out of time so any ideas or suggestions would be extremely apperciated.

To put a long story short, I didn’t have access to a lot of my accounts that I needed for work for a month because of her, she spread gossip about me to her colleagues, she is always withholding information from me and not communicating about basic things.

18jskzb,Time to negotiate. Give me a hug.,"TLDR; why are companies secretive/bad at the hiring process? Makes me feel like I should have asked more questions but to who was unclear.  Also, offered 5k less than my desired range. 

I knew I’d counter offer, because what do I have to lose. But I thought I’d be for slightly more & in my range. 

But I’m so confused as to why companies - who hire people frequently - are so bad at it??

I likely F’ed up when their recruiter called me out of the blue. Said some low (but more than I make now) $. I figured I’d interview anyway. 

Nailed the interview did the application, filled in my desired salary range…which I did adjust in a discussion with the recruiter.  Did an in person, got a verbal offer. 2 weeks later (yesterday) got the written offer. And it’s 5k less than my range. There’s a car allowance and bonus structure. But I don’t know what the bonus would be figured on because I don’t know the current sales for this territory and this is a new position in this city. The sales $ will go up, but where am I starting at?

18jscr1,Need advise for career change to data analyst,"Hello! I love working with data and I have always wanted to go into data analytics but have been too nervous worried I won’t be good enough/won’t have the right background or skills but I am finally seriously considering taking the plunge!

So my background is quite varied. I have a BSc in psychology (chem and bio minor) and a master’s from Cambridge in neuroscience, then I worked in film and TV for many years, I worked as high up as a production manager and had a tv show optioned as well as produced and wrote/directed my own musical and short films.

Now I am back in school doing my PhD in population health. I am doing my thesis on human centred economies and mental health. Since I am finished all my core courses and comprehensive exams and am only doing research I am able to work completely flexibly and remotely and my professor is supportive of me going back to work.

I was looking at the Google data analytics course certificate on coursera. I have a lot of research experience collecting and presenting data from my academic background, and a lot of experience in coordination and management from work experience, I also had to do some coding in my research too and I used project management tools and A LOT of excel.

Do you think all of this would be enough to get a starting job as a data analyst? What should I highlight on my resume to best increase my chances?

18js21l,Potential Career Change to HR,"Good Morning, 

  
I am considering a career change and human resources is something that has caught my eye. Currently I am working in retail management/sales, have been in sales my whole career and am starting to think about something else.   
What exactly does HR do? Those of you working in HR, what do you do? I have done my research, read several articles and I still don't really know what goes on in an HR department. Like I said, I've been in a retail and sales environment for a while and maybe thats why i don't fully grasp what HR does. I graduated with a business degree 5 years ago and didn't take any HR courses and have considered taking a few classes at the community college to get familiarized with the industry and better understand how HR works. Outside of a business degree, would any additional education be necessary to break into HR?   


Any additional career advice, info on the industry or any other useful information would be greatly appreciated.

To put a long story short he asked me if I have feedback about the manager. I already mentioned to him in our conversation that she has poor communication and I’m pretty sure he’s just asking it to seem like he “cared” for office politics or whatever

I'm at the point where the lack of direction is a problem. I think the people I'm working with are very capable of making things happen, but we have no feedback. Should I address my boss directly (about the lack of direction)? I fear repercussion based on the ego mentioned in the first paragraph.

I enjoyed it but I need to study more to pursue a career in full stack development as the market is hard.

18jqatm,Internal project transfer opportunity,"I am on a project (Project A) and based on how our bonus structure works I am highly anticipated to make a very healthy bonus in the next year. 1/4 in January and the rest in Sept/Nov. The total, combined bonuses are equal to ~30% of my salary. Project A is 20 min from my house. The downfall with A is I'm with a junior coworker who is unable to teach me anything which is inhibiting my opportunities for advancement.

Before the bonus structure was fully updated, I requested a transfer to Project B. Project B was a great opportunity to learn from a senior coworker who likes to teach. There's a 20% travel commitment and I like traveling. At this point the anticipated bonus on Project A was half of what it is now. This transfer was not approved and I remained working on Project A and Project B was staffed externally. Project B has similar bonus prospects as A. 

This week I was offered a lateral role on Project C. Project C is a dumpster fire with zero prospects for a bonus. I was asked because I'm the company's fixer and this project needs some triage. I was also asked because I had previously requested Project B. C is amazing opportunity to learn and grow and there's a good balance of travel. This is the type of project that would push me into the next promotion or dang close.

These are the choices I've come up with:

1) Start with Occupational Therapy at USYD and transfer for Law after a year. (OT is a good backup career but I'm not very interested in it)

2) Begin with Commerce at UNSW and transfer to Law via IPT without losing any time. (However I'm not interested in Commerce so it may be risky if I don't make the transfer?)

3) Take my early offer for UTS Law/Science, but worried about UTS not being known for Law thereby affecting job opportunities.

I have specialized in many different nursing units over the last couple years and have been back to school for these specialities in hopes that I would find somewhere I loved and fit in. Unfortunately that has yet to happen. 

I do not love my job. I work in Canada and the pay is decent enough, I don’t mind my city/where I live but my job just is not fulfilling to me. I find a lot of the work I do meaningless, and I think lots of people are awful (don’t get me wrong, there are tons of wonderful people and I get that seeing people at their lowest will make anyone cranky/angry). Even then, I have seen so much waste, people abusing the system here in Canada, have been treated awful for no reason etc. I’m sure most if not every nurse can attest to this. The unit I’m currently working on isn’t terrible but nights are slowly killing me as well as the job itself (lifting people, on your feet all day etc). Desk jobs in nursing are not fun, either.

18jmef0,"Career off-course due to a death in my family, how do I explain it in an interview?","TLDR: Doing an online master's program because it was what I decided to do when I was providing care for my terminally ill father. How should I build a narrative for myself in interviews?  
I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Molecular Biology in the spring of 2022. When I was in my third year of undergrad (2020-2021), I had a general plan to play sports abroad for one year following graduation and then do the job search upon coming home. In the spring of 2021, my dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer. From then on, I continued on the path I had laid out for myself but was ready to throw everything aside to come home and be with my family should things go south. I finished my 3rd and 4th year of undergrad before things began to go south. Around my graduation, my dad lost mobility and needed significant care/assistance 24/7. I embarked on a month-long backpacking trip that I decided not to cancel (after much deliberation with my family), and halfway through got a dreaded call from my mom saying the doctors gave him 3-6 months. I canceled a different trip overseas and promptly came home to be with my dad.  
After coming home, I spent most of my time with my family and became a secondary caregiver (2nd to my mom). My mom was around most of the time but it was nice to have me help out and free her up so she could have some much-needed time for herself (this time was rarely used for herself but for things that had been neglected). Since this was going to be potentially the last three months I could spend with my dad, I decided to put my general career plan/life on hold and get as much quality time with him as I could (this would not affect my family financially, but slightly set my career trajectory off path).  
In August, with his condition not changing much, I took up a part-time temporary job (10 hrs a week for 10-ish weeks) as a coach (my best friend and her dad were my co-coaches and begged me to join them if anything just to introduce some life and fun into my day). I had a lot of fun doing it. This level of commitment was sustainable but any more would have made things more challenging for my mom.  
Towards the end of the coaching gig (November), I cast a wide net and applied to a variety of jobs and school programs, intending to find anything that would keep me just busy enough without having to sacrifice so much time/energy that I couldn't help out at home. I ended up getting rejections all around except for an online data science master's program through a large university. I decided to do it. It was the only thing that panned out and I didn't have much energy to keep looking for a perfect opportunity. It offered flexible commitment, I could do it from the comfort of my home, and it was vaguely relevant to my degree/internships.  
I started the program in January of 2023, and my dad passed in February. I didn't leave my mom's side for a couple of months. It was one of the hardest things I have ever gone through.  
Ultimately I think I made the right choice in doing the program during this time; it was a blessing to have anything that could distract me or keep me busy, but I was far too unstable to have held up any sort of full-time or high-intensity position.  
Fast forward to now: I don't love the program. I find the online classes are not engaging, it is incredibly easy to slip by without actually learning the material, I'm distracted, the information seems obsolete, etc. But again, it was the right decision at the time and it is the path I'm walking. I will be graduating in June of 2024 and would like to exit with a job, ideally somewhere I can leverage both my molecular biology background and my data science background.  
I am trying to figure out the narrative I want to tell about myself during interviews and I am not sure how to go about it. My resume is full of academic research and internships from 2018-2021 and is empty following 2021 besides my master's program (with no projects, extracurriculars, clubs, research, etc. to supplement my program). This master's program is also something I wouldn't have chosen for myself had I not been in my family's situation.  
What's the best way to explain this to employers in interviews (assuming they ask why I chose to do my master's program)? Should I avoid this narrative and focus on the benefits of the degree? If I put my career on hold to be a caregiver, is this something I should bring up to explain an employment gap? Should I bring it up myself or let them ask me? This is all assuming I'm already at the interview stage. Is this something I should write about in a cover letter so my resume doesn't get tossed out at first glance?  
Has anyone else gone through something similar? Any advice is welcome, taking general career guidance as well.

I’ve noticed there is not a lot of strategic mis-alignment in between departments so I’ve drafted a list of strategic goals with KPIs (for my function only) grounded in the organization’s principles. The hope is this will spur other departments to either react to me or build their on top of mine. 

I think this will make decisions easier in the future if we basically have a guidebook to review major business decisions against. The issue is that I am just a junior level employee and I don’t want to make my boss look bad by springing it on the team or department leader. 

Wondering if I should keep pushing for this through my boss or if I should drop it and not make waves?",Coffee_fashion,1,1.0,1,1702702491,2023-12-16 04:54:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18jjlow/effecting_strategy_as_a_junior_member/,12,2023

18jg7dx,can any former architects ( or those in the field ) recommend alternative careers?,"Ello. Just a bit of context 

I’m from/live in London and turned 25 last week. Since graduating from undergrad, I have been working as a Part 1 Architectural Assistant for just over two years.

Apprehensive to pursue full accreditation for the infamous reasons (expensive to study, poor work/life balance, salary isn’t great when taking into consideration hours worked and time/money spent on education). I’ve stayed where I am for so long because the studio atmosphere is amazing, I’ve been on two interesting projects, and I’ve got great colleagues; not necessarily because I want to be an architect. These two years showed me it’s not for me.

I do like designing! I enjoy 3D modelling, drafting sheets, hand sketching, and have a thing for InDesign. I’ve also recently taken an odd interest in organisational stuff (spreadsheets, saving files correctly, naming model components appropriately etc). 


Any recommendations? :)",forgottosync,1,1.0,0,1702691175,2023-12-16 01:46:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18jg7dx/can_any_former_architects_or_those_in_the_field/,12,2023

On to the meat and potatoes. I work a fairly specialized role which is very difficult to impossible to find any kind of salary info on. I jumped on this role as it was a decent pay increase (putting me to $95k usd a year). With the one raise I have had in the year I have been with the company, I jumped to 99k. I recently interviewed for the same position at another company to see if I could get more money. They recently reached out to say they thought both interviews went well, and they wqnted ti see what my salary requirements were.   


My issue is, I don't know what to ask for. With no real range to go off of, I don't know if I would be asking for too much or not asking for enough and leaving money on the table. If this was the type of position I've worked in the past with plenty of salary info, I would feel comfortable picking a number or a range, but since there is no info for any positions similar on indeed, glassdoor, etc, I'm at a loss as to where to start.

Graduated hs was going to enlist covid happened got wrapped into the wrong things life was bad for a year after i graduated ended up being told by family”get your s*** together or get out” they hated what i was doing. Realized months after being away from family & now having a positive romodel in my life (my bf who i met through my job below) this is not the lifestyle i want AT ALL. started working for a retail store worked my way up to ft and manager within a year / year in a half. i was making 50k at 21 not bad didn’t have that many expenses besides literally buying myself food & clothes. But then i moved away by myself (to an area that was miserable in every way) everything was on me & my bf, i started hating my job as a manager so i ended up leaving & my boyfriend supported me. picked up retail jobs months later bc im the type of female where i can’t just see my man provide for everything we don’t have kids & i believe relationship is 50/50 we both signed that lease anyways… i picked up jobs but i know retail is not it like kudos to you if you can live your whole life in retail but not me you only make so much $$. & i started thinking like what do you want to do for a career girl & i literally don’t know !!!!! i don’t have any hobbies or things that enjoyed as a kid, i never had an interest in a certain thing, i was never the girl who liked makeup fashion, i don’t care for the medical field. so now im here feeling like a kid in kindergarten where the teacher ask what do you want to do & im saying everything. i really want something new  but dont know what like ughhh i need help what do i do",No_Constant3876,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1702687174,2023-12-16 00:39:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18jewpj/career_advice_any_advice_really/,12,2023

18jecow,How do I tell my manager I don't have enough work?,"I started this job a year ago. It's a brand new position for the company, so there was no real training plan, tasks to take on, etc. Just a few ideas and a general need for someone to do analysis of any kind. I do have projects to work on sometimes, and everything I've done they've been very pleased with. However, I'd say my workload probably averages out to 15 hours of work per week when this is a full time position.

The C-level executives are the ones I work most closely with, and they are incredibly busy.

18jdsr8,How to make an effective career switch to find the right company for me?,"
So I’m (30m) currently working at a private construction firm as a distribution engineer. It’s based on modernizing the grid which is Power and I took zero classes on that in college. I got my masters and tried focusing on controls but classes were scarce. In the end I did a handful of those which were kinda interesting but also some digital image processing which was really fun. While pursuing my masters I was working full time as an engineer too but mostly doing project management work at a small time defense contractor - hated it. After graduating I got this job and although it’s corporate and have a lot of room for personal development and career progression I just feel like I’m not getting paid enough nor is the work stimulating me. We’re going through a lull in billable time and it’s difficult for me to do mundane tasks let alone stay focused on then long enough to not pick up my phone every 3 minutes. I want to do more technical work and am having trouble finding the right company for me. 

In total I have about 3 years worth of work experience as an engineer, but this job didn’t count my previous job in the hiring process. Now I’m afraid the next pivot I make will also have the same outcome. My undergrad was physics and although challenging I enjoyed materials science a lot and some controls which got me into my masters for EE. Are there any resources or websites that helped you find the right fit? I don’t want to spam job applications at random big name companies like SpaceX or google. I don’t feel like I had enough immersion or rigor in my program that will help me stay afloat in those companies and there’s just so much to apply to. It actually baffles me how people decide from the myriad of engineering roles. I want to be deliberate and careful about my next job role as although job hopping is good for increasing salary ultimately I’d like stability and job satisfaction.  Can anyone who was in a similar position offer some guidance? I know no job is perfect but I’m starting to hate coming into the office here and it’s barely tolerable. I chose this company because I was curious about the work/industry but really jumped on the offer as soon as I graduated instead of looking around.",beigesun,1,1.0,0,1702683977,2023-12-15 23:46:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18jdsr8/how_to_make_an_effective_career_switch_to_find/,12,2023

In September all three asked asked on separate occasions why and how certain private decisions were made for individual students. It was explained that this is up to our office and if the students involved were concerned to send them to my office. Since then two members have continued to email my supervisor, sometimes stating incorrect information, asking how to change my office decisions and policy.

18jaq01,Money or good work culture?,"I'll try to keep this short but the TLDR is the title.

I just got a job offer for $46/hr in a nursing home. I've worked for this company in the past and I know it is hard work, but I also know I am good at my job when working in this environment. This job is 30 minutes from my house and is 4 days per week.

I currently work for a different company doing academic and non-clinical work. I work remotely and make $30/hr working 5 days/week. I started in this role 4 years ago making $29/hr (yes, my pay increase has been nearly non-existent). Due to a decline in people wanting to pursue the field i'm in, my company has seen a drop in students and thus, a drop in revenue. Because of this, I have started getting pulled into different roles--roles I have no interest in and that require some travel a few days per month. 

The positives of my current job are---1. obviously, the remote aspect is key, 2. the team I work with is AMAZING. Our personalities mesh so well, everyone pulls their weight and helps out no questions asked. We all want to see our team and each other succeed--I'd have a hard time finding this elsewhere, especially in the nursing home setting. 3. My current job is interesting and I get to wear many hats and have a lot of autonomy.

I am basically making my decision based on pay vs. work culture. I get a good vibe from this nursing home (I've worked in some pretty awful ones before, and I also know the person who's job I would be taking), but at the end of the day it's a nursing home and there is always disgruntled employees, backstabbing, and loads and loads of documentation. 

What would you choose? Good work culture/team or pay?

For  anyone who knows how Costco works, they literally pay the same rate to their pay roll clerk and someone who will be wrapping pallets all day.

I don’t have a degree only high school. I have certificate in graphic design which I did in 2017. Currently Im doing google career certificates on project management, I.T support, Digital marketing & E comm, just to see which appeals to me the most. I heard they can help with entry level jobs for ppl who want to WFH.

Any other certificates I should look into? 

Any suggestion is welcomed how do I make the switch? Are you someone who switched from warehouses or other areas to remote work? How did you do it? Which courses or certifications will help me with the switch?

Turns out I’m paid significantly more than him even though we’re roughly the same skill level and same job title.

During the meeting the manager and human resources told him they looked into my pay and told him I was lying. I don’t appreciate Human Resources and the manager telling my fellow employee that I’m a liar versus them owning up to the disparity in pay.

18j8jzm,Stay in Biochemistry or Coding Bootcamp?,"Hello everyone,

I recently graduated with a degree in biochemistry from a lesser known university in Canada. I am going to be honest and say that I did not use my time wisely in university, I did not get good grades and did not strengthen my resume by doing meaningful extra curriculars. I like to think that I am a semi-smart person but I was very lazy and distracted throughtout my university years. I have now moved to the greater Toronto Area and have started looking for lab work but I will most likely not be able to get a job because of my weak Resume. I have spent a lot of time thinking about what to do next. I am 24 and in my mind (even though I know it isn't a race and people go at their own pace) I have another 4 years to really get my life together before it becomes incredibly difficult to piece things back. I have narrowed down the options to doing a 6-month data analytics or web development bootcamp (I am currently getting a certificate in a field of biochemstry that involves coding so I have learned Python and some data analytics and I have been enjoying it quite a lot) or doing a two year advanced diploma in biotechnology and then after that possibly doing a 2 year masters in biotechnology management. I can not do the master's program now as my application is not strong enough, but maybe after doing the advanced diploma and really excelling and getting work experience (program has a co-op option) then I could be accepted.

18j88g5,"Advice needed from previous post. HR Manager termed, what should I do next?","https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/s/1q6IHuwBZK

Here's my previous post. 

I had asked hoping for growth ideas, as well as what I should do next. It's been almost 3 full weeks. I've already applied for unemployment, figured out health insurance, applying for positions, etc. That stuff was fairly easy for me to figure out. My vague post was left like that to see what kind of advice I may receive. I've had several phone interviews, 3 in person interviews. But I'm realizing I don't have a good answer why I am gone as I don't know what I did wrong. Here's some more info: I was never written up, I was never given a PIP, I never had called in or missed work, I never had an official or unofficial conversation with my supervisor for improvement. I had asked my supervisor for goals, directions, feedback, etc. Was never given anything except a vague BS answer for something I was already doing. ""Lower turnover, hire more people"" was the answer. I hired more people than they have ever hired 1 year, more than doubled the number from the previous year which was the highest amount. 

I believe I know why I was let go, which was lack of a good relationship with 2nd in command who was om the same level as me. However, I don't know. I tried to call THE HR Director to receive feedback but no response. 

Issue #1 with a half solution - I have applied to several positions, no feedback on why I was declined even for a phone screen for positions I feel I am qualified for. Maybe it's my resume? If so, I will post here for resume help (my half solution). Any other ideas why I may not receive a phone call? 

Issue #2a I don't have any real skills outside my positions i have had, so applying for something not HR won't get me far and I need to make XYZ wage. How do I grow and improve myself while not working? 

Issue #2b I have an idea for HR growth which is get certified in PHR and SHRM-CP but those cost money, that I don't know if I can afford because I don't know if it will help. 

Issue #3 I lost my job probably due to a bad relationship, how do I become more personable and grow if i know that much but don't have a foot in the door to have a learning and humble mindset for the next position I may have?",sirspike345,1,1.0,0,1702668809,2023-12-15 19:33:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18j88g5/advice_needed_from_previous_post_hr_manager/,12,2023
18j7u3t,Travel Policy for Field Service (?),"Hi All, I'm an EE Tech who has been doing some field work recently.  I'm curious what other companies do for their employees compensation for traveling to different continents where working conditions might be more difficult, and where travel time is significant?  
a.)  Do you have a flat day rate of hours paid, or do you get paid time and a half or similar for your work days?  
b.)  In cases of long trips where you may have a day off, do you get paid for your days off in the field?  
c.)  Do you get paid for your full travel time (time in transit)?  That is, if you are flying somewhere very far (like 24h of travel time, for example), do you get paid for the full 24h?  
For me, my recent flights were about 44h door-to-door across 2 days (one way), but I am only able to claim 7.5h per day (so I can claim 15h of travel time even though it took 44h).  I get paid for 12h per day, regardless of the work time, and 12h for days off as well.  I am currently a bit annoyed at not getting paid for more of my travel time, and I sort of think the day rate should be proportional to time worked, like time and a half instead of just a flat 12h.

18j7s8b,"Moved teams permanently, paid significantly less than new starts in team advice.","Hi Guys,  


I'm looking for some advice, because honestly, i'm lost after finding out this reality i've been down in the dumps.  


So I started this job a few months back, and earning ok money (more than what I was on). And I enjoy the job, people and the job are great.  


I move to another team temporary to help out in the business and get the ground running in this new team, and after a few weeks i've been told im now going to be permanent member of this team, now here's the important part that maybe I should've raised from the outset - though I didn't know at the time, this team, is on the grade above me in terms of pay grade.  


We recruit some newbies, and they are on the paygrade above me, and we are doing the exact same job, arguably honestly I do more and I can prove it, and I did/have. When I found out the newbies were on more than me, I emailed my manager querying this, I was ignored for a while until my manager says we're to have our 1 to 1s.  


During my 1 to 1 he has no issues with my performance, and highlighted regarding the pay. He noted that the pay grade was only a few hundred $ higher than what im on currently. As it's a large pay scale, also the fact that the previous team I was in (who basically do the same job anyway) get paid the same grade I do, so it's being looked into, but this was 2 weeks ago now.   


This only happened because I raised it.  


Today I find out the pay grade above mine (what the newbies are on) starts the grade scale at 15% payrise to my current pay and honestly, I'm lost.  


I don't want to be that employee who jumps the gun or anything, or to toot my own horn or to fight many battles that could have a negative impact long term, but we're talking about being underpaid for doing the same job if not more and being better at it (verifiable). I honestly don't know what to do.  


To top it off my manager is unavailable for the next two weeks, and I don't know if it's worthwhile to raise it with their manager, because it might be seen as me overstepping, but im at a lost.  


What do I do fellas? Any ideas? :D",evruid,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1702667589,2023-12-15 19:13:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18j7s8b/moved_teams_permanently_paid_significantly_less/,12,2023

18j7gfm,Best way to break into accounting?,"Hey all,

I hope this isn't a weird type of post for this community, but I'm really struggling and need advice. 

1.5 years ago I took a job at this company that seemed like it would be a good entry level position to teach me some bare bones accounting basics so I could move on to another position in accounting, and hopefully start a real career. Things weren't going amazingly to start but I wanted to give it a couple years to either get better, or move on. I'm currently having trouble moving on.

The experience I've gained at this company doesn't really feel very tangible in terms of accounting at all, and certainly not AP which is where I'd like to be eventually. I like the concept of accounting well enough, and data entry and Excel sheets and bookkeeping software isn't the worst thing to me. To be frank, the processes here are really simple. To the extent that I don't know if I have the experience to move into a better role (which I'm dying for. This particular company has really bad culture, I'm stressed to the point of gray hairs at 25, crying, being harassed at work, etc.) and im just not sure what to do. 

Worse, I don't have an education to speak of. I truly am intelligent, but growing up was rough and I didn't graduate highschool, just had a GED. I pick up new systems and processes really quickly, and am fast to adapt to preferred policy from company to company. I'm often told I'm the most detail oriented, the best communicator, the best at customer service. I used to be a licensed P&C Insurance agent for Pete's sake! But i cant get a second interview out of any position I apply for. I'm getting to the end of my rope, I'm just not sure what to do now. I really want a remote role because I'll be moving to a different area in my state soon, and will be hopefully able to attend school, but nothing's coming back..

Then one of the other managers said “you’re just not the right fit. A bit too green”

Which killed me because looking back on the situation, I wasn’t too green, I just was in a wrong role. To be fair, I didn’t let that manager know my discomfort until after I was terminated.

18j6csz,How to traverse through my new team lead role? Becoming confused as experience is increasing - this shouldn't be.,"I do not know how to put this across and it is going to be long.

  
So, I am working in the embedded black box testing domain since 12 years. I have always been an average contributor and around a few months back changed my company to the role of a Senior Technical Lead for a team of 5 people. In India we really can't remain an individual contributor for long and people expect you to manage teams after certain experience level.

  
Now, I am a person of average intellect who is a bit anxious as well. I have always been the ""exceeds expectations"" type but nothing exceptional. I am in this new Team Lead role but I am pretty confused as I cannot come up with new ideas on how to improve the project, its bottlenecks or be innovative(the holy buzzword). Heck I find it hard to identify such things unless some colleague points it out to me and then I start working towards it at my own pace - I am a relaxed guy which at time times might come off as procrastination. I have implemented a few solutions but they have been suggested by others. I always think later that why couldn't I think of it? Why can't I identify new areas of improvement!

  
I am not just managing the team but actively work with them in testing the SW as well, apart from the usual reports, your .ppt preparation and data collection. But currently, I have this depressive feeling that team mates who are pretty less experienced than me honestly are far better in the technological domain than I am. Sometimes I feel that did this project even need a Lead level guy as my juniors are capable enough - good for them! I mean I do not want to lord over them but I have observed them sitting over a task and chilling despite me asking them to finish it and not keep it till the end. Some team members even decline meetings due to personal commitments on a regular basis and then I have to re-arrange the meeting accordingly. I have these thoughts that do they even take me seriously or are they manipulating me(I know it is crazy)? Why am I here? 

  
Though I must add that they team members are cooperative when required and do not miss deadlines. The previous team lead, as I have heard, was a truly dynamic person with good knowledge. I am not that much technically proficient so there is always that constant comparison with the previous guy in my case. Being not up to the mark is further depressive. I see across my office floor colleagues have clear vision, thought process and command over their life which really make me further question myself.

  
Now, I am not scared of the learning curve or come out of my comfort zone. I am currently doing my masters (work integrated program), have a family and other commitments so feel overwhelmed at times when so many things come to me at once. My manager also has quite high expectations from me as I am the most experienced person - Team Lead Right. I can put in the hard work but it is just that I don't have the mindset to bring any radical change or to personality to inspire people. May be it is my procrastination attitude.

  
Currently, I am simply going with the flow unable to have control over anything and this frustrates me. I feel directionless, a person hanging in there from the skin of his teeth,  easily influenced and a pushover. I am worried that without any long term thinking my career in this competitive field is only a few years more. I don't know what I will do after that since I do not have great managerial or technical skills. Hard work? Sure! But no matter how much hard an average Joe works he remains average.

They’ve given me a week to think about it and within that week I had an interview with company b that I feel like went very well and it’s in a more desirable city with higher pay and I’ll also be staying with family there, but company A needs a decision by today. They(company A) let me know that if I needed more time to let them know, but then that would make it two weeks it’s taking me to come to a decision and I don’t want to take up anymore of their time. I let company b know of the offer and they told me the quickest they couldn’t get back to me is middle of next week. So my current options are:

1. Accept the offer of company A, and wait to see company B’s decision, and then decide from then on, but I feel like I risk burning a bridge 

2. Ask for another extension from company A for up until middle of next week 


3. Decline company A’s offer and wait for company B.

I feel like 3 is the worst option, but it is also the lost upfront option.

18j5f5s,Is it ok for employees to disclose their salaries at work?,"I'm a software developer working as a subcontractor for a client. Something that I find really odd is how openly the permanent employees talk about their salaries, mainly with how low they are. I find that really odd since I've never worked on a team where people openly give exact numbers for their salaries like that. I haven't disclosed how much I make to anyone since I don't see how that information is relevant in anyway. I personally don't think it's a great practice. For one, it tells me that I don't want to transition to a full-time employee after my contract now that I know how low average salaries are there. Also, I know that I would be on a team of employees that are openly bitter about their compensation which may affect the quality of work that I can expect from others.

My question is, would you consider that a red flag in an office environment or is it more common than I thought for employees to compare their salaries?",Desperate_Pumpkin19,1,0.9900000095367432,3,1702661502,2023-12-15 17:31:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18j5f5s/is_it_ok_for_employees_to_disclose_their_salaries/,12,2023

18j4kdc,Career pivot into new industry >>> Small Business Owner in the future,"I’m curious to hear a third party POV on a potential career pivot I’m thinking about making. 

My current field is Talent Acquisition (setup recruitment departments for early stage tech companies). 

I am passively working on starting my own business in the audio/ video sector. I have gotten a couple contracts and have gotten a colleague to do the work with me as he owns his own business doing the same in another state. 

I have an opportunity to join a recruiting agency that is pretty flexible and can essentially be part time if I wanted it to be. (Remote / $35k + Commission - 80%)

I have another opportunity with an A/V company that would be learning the business from the ground up and learning how to build estimates / bid jobs, etc. this would be a path to sales. (Onsite / $70k) 

Options:

*Take both jobs and try and squeeze in my interviews for my agency job

Pros - have a consistent pay for the A/V job while learning a new industry and setting me up for future success with my own business (I’m new to the industry so need to learn more). Potential upside for making additional money through the recruitment agency. Helps get me out of recruiting which I’ve started to hate over the years. 

Cons - A/V job is onsite and full time. Not sure how I could still take interviews for recruitment job. Recruitment job is pretty much just commission in a rough market where a lot of companies aren’t hiring. Would be pretty much working all the time if I did both. The agency gig is sort of a gamble as it’s only commission. 


*Choose one job and hope for the best

Pros - A/V job gets me out of recruiting and completes my career pivot. Helps me learn a new industry. Steady income and path to sales to make $200k+. Sets me up for success in the future for my business. 

Recruiting agency gig has a big upside if the market switches up and hiring begins again. Remote gig with extreme flexibility, people only work 10 months a year max. 1 hour of meetings a week so lots of freedom. 

Cons - A/V job is onsite full time. $70k but its salary. 

Recruiting agency is commission only in a bad market so there is no guaranteed money. I have been trying to get out of recruiting so this would just keep me stagnant. 

I know this is a lot of info, but would sincerely like some outside POV.

18j3yeh,In a pickle with my education,"

I have always felt inferior because I did not go to college right out of high school and obtain a four year bachelor’s degree. I’ve done very well for myself in my career, especially for someone without a bachelor’s degree, but really even for someone with a degree, but I’m in a pickle. Background:

I was raised in an extremely religious household where the only option after high school was “Bible college,” essentially an unaccredited brainwashing institution. I always did very well in high school, but was never encouraged to do anything but go into “the ministry.” After two years of this, I came to the realization that I do not believe any of it. I left and never looked back. I foundered for a few years in a dead end job, until a family member placed a referral for me to [insert large financial services corporation here.] I got the job, and started at a very entry level position in the call center. I did very well, and was promoted into the actual “decision making” area of the company, where I have excelled and worked my way up through various levels (I’ve managed a promotion on average every 1.5 years.) 

Again, I’ve always felt very bad about not having a degree. All of my colleagues have at least a Bachelor’s degree, and there are a good number of people with Master’s degrees. A few years back, I decided to go back to school to obtain my degree. I went after work every night in person, and I did well. I made the dean’s list every semester, and got about halfway through my degree when Covid hit and the school was closed, and we had to go online. I took a break from school because I didn’t want to learn online as in person helped keep me engaged, especially after working all day. Long story short: I didn’t end up going back, and I plan on re-enrolling soon to finish.

I’ve never lied about the fact that I don’t have a college degree. I certainly don’t wave flags around advertising the fact, but no one has ever asked. My resume is what it is, and it has never really “come up.” Every position I’ve ever received at my company is advertised as “college degree preferred, but equivalent industry experience can be considered.” 

I most recently was promoted into management in spring of this year. I love my job, and I love my team. I’ve done really well and I’ve started to turn around a historically low performing team. My boss is a gem, and my colleagues are wonderful. I’ve done so well that my boss surprised me by recommending me for an “advanced leadership training program for high-performing individuals.” Essentially this is a feeder program into upper management. Here is my pickle: the prerequisites for this program REQUIRE a bachelor’s degree. Any job above my level requires a bachelor’s degree. Again, I plan on completing this for personal accomplishment, but also for career progression, but I haven’t accomplished this yet. I’m embarrassed about this, and I’ll have to have a conversation with my boss that I am not qualified for this program he’s put me forward for (publicly.) I’m sweating. Again, I’ve never ever told anyone I have a degree, I think they just “assume” based on the career progression I’ve achieved. Any advice? I’m nervous this will put me in a bad light to my co-workers and boss, and any mistake I make will be chalked up to lack of college education. 

TL/DR: I’ve moved up in my company to the point I’m being recommended for an upper management training program that requires a degree I don’t have. Nervous to tell my employer I don’t have a degree (but I’ve never advertised that I did.)",skinnyatlas,2,1.0,4,1702657637,2023-12-15 16:27:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18j3yeh/in_a_pickle_with_my_education/,12,2023

18j2xev,Press Freedom monitoring/ Investigative reporting (EU) - Where do I even start?,"Hi all,

I, (25), some time ago left my (boring and mentally demanding) job in e-commerce to look for something closer to my actual passion, interests and degree (Communication science). My end goal at some point is to work with investigative reporting (more as an analyst) as I want to bring some meaning to what I do; however, I understand how much of a niche this profession is. So I decided to look for careers around press freedom and media watch as I think this would be an incredibly good learning, networking and portfolio opportunity to work towards my bigger goals. However, this period of searching has been so far the most demotivating part since my graduation. Now, almost completely out of my savings and having to start paying back my student loan next month, I am in talks to go back to another totally unrelated 9 to 18 just to be able to survive. 

I am making this post hoping that maybe somebody had any success in these fields and could suggest to me where to even start.  Positions I've seen so far require A LOT of work experience, or if I seem to be a good fit - they just never respond. Trainee-ships are just not there and internships where I am are a complete joke. The compensation for a full-time internship is €400 - €500 a month, while the rent is around €1000 for a room in a shared apartment and I need to supply myself by myself, so this is not an option. I feel scammed by education and the entire positivity of having a 'dream career'.  What's next? Do I just accept that not everybody will have a satisfying career in life or do I need to work on some personal projects for some sort of portfolio? I am afraid, however, to waste my only free time on projects that might not even be seen.

18j1yfw,Current employer has quietly taken away hybrid work. My first performance review is coming up. I’ve received other offers and I’m not sure how to handle this. What do I do?,"I grew up in city A, and I work in city B. I graduated this past May and I live halfway between the two, which is about 30 miles from either city, but I would like to live in city A. When I was hired at my current company, I was told we would be able to work from home whenever we wanted, which was a big deal for me because I was comfortable living closer to city A and I could easily visit whenever I wanted to.

In May, my boss said we were hiring several new employees so we would be moving back to full in-person for a couple months to familiarize them with their roles. Fair enough. In September I asked when we were moving back to hybrid and he said he pushed it back to December. In December I asked again and he said we’re permanently in-person now. 

This was frustrating to me, as I specifically rented a more expensive apartment with an office to work from home and it’s extremely difficult to visit family on workdays when I’m working an hour away. I applied to some jobs and surprisingly got several responses right away. 

At my current job in city B I make $83k plus a 10% bonus in March. The bonus is based on a performance review which is coming up. 

I’ve received an offer from a company in city A (where I would like to live) for $97k. They offer a hybrid schedule, but even if it were fully in-person I would be alright because it’s in city A. The job seems like a great fit for me, but leaving before March would mean I miss my bonus. I could also consider leveraging it at my performance review for a higher salary and hybrid freedom at my current job, but I’m not sure how to do that and I’m worried doing so could affect my bonus.

18izm97,Is it the right decision to leave my job?,"I was recently accepted into an MBA in Spain. I tried to quit yesterday so I can focus on studying.  I have worked there for almost three years remotely because the company is in the USA and I am in LATAM. I don't get paid anywhere close as good as the average American but the pay is much better than in my country. 


The reasons why I quit was to not work and study at the same time (I've done that before and the burnout is awful) and because I want to get a job in Spain. I know the job market is awful over there but the employment opportunities the University gives look really good. The other main reason is that, if I get a work in Spain, I only need to work there for 2 years to apply for the citizenship. I deeply dislike my country so that is a great option for me. 


Now what I wasn't expecting was the company I work at say that they want to ""fight to keep me in"" and that if I would consider other alternatives to study and work at the same time. I have nothing against the company but I have no idea how a MBA fits into a remote company where I do social media. The hours would also be off because my working hours would be early AM for them. Now I am unsure if I should quit my job or try to stay there for longer. I could use the money since it is more than what a student job in Spain would give me but also my main goal with all of this (besides education) is to leave my home country and get European citizenship.

I'm currently unemployed and looking for where to put my focus on. I've been pretty depressed since before my graduation during my 20s and it kind of lost me career wise as I was not so great at my jobs, or just mid. But now at 30 i'm sick of looking and would like to find a good path to stay in.

I have an engineering degree and have worked a bit in python development for a few years until COVID.  I also did freelance work as a motion designer, leaning more towards 3D stuff. I like 3D animation a lot but realistically i'm more leaning towards a career that would use all my skills (python dev, knowledge of image processing, motion design, 3D knowledge).

I was wondering about XR development as i'm quite interested in this domain, but also computer vision (the production part not research) would be interesting, it's still link to images and video and I already have knowledge of python and opencv. I don't know which one would be the most likely to get a job in? Especially the demand for XR i have no idea if the market is strong for that.

18ivezz,I asked ChatGPT this heartwrenching question and this is what it gave me- (sales vs educated social work),"In topic with my previous question, I have started at a new company called (name-redacted) in a furniture sales position (please do source information about name-redacted in Melbourne Australia from the internet to get more information). Originally this company was supposed to be a stop-gap while I was waiting for my masters degree in social work to start. I am probably well suited to a career in social work, but I have discovered working at name-redacted that I am very good at this job and show a lot of promise- I may be considered a rising star. It is also a very good and very competently run company which I believe is not entirely common, and they are showing a LOT of appreciation for the work I am doing and the sales figures I am writing for someone of my experience level (I have zero experience in sales). I could be a top performer here... HOWEVER, I have a high IQ of 143 and have previously always equated educational success with status, and so this is an important factor in this career decision, and social work may well give more opportunities for a higher guaranteed salary (although returns for truly elite top 5 elite performers are higher at name-redacted, there is no guarantee I can make that standard). However, again, name-redacted have a fantastic feeling of inclusion and family spirit that makes me happy to come to work every day.

I cannot make decisions for you, but I can provide some considerations that might help you make an informed choice.  
  
**If You Choose to Pursue Social Work:**  
  
**Pros:**  
  
\-Social work is a rewarding field that allows you to make a positive impact on people's lives.  
\-Higher educational qualifications can open up various career paths and potentially lead to higher guaranteed salaries.  
\-The field may offer a sense of purpose and fulfilment if it aligns with your values and passion for helping others.

18ivby1,How can I find a career?,"I am not really the type to post online but I am desperate. I'm totally lost in my life and I don't know what career is right for me.

About me: 
29M. I have a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics Ed. I worked as a middle school math teacher for 5 years (loathed every second of it). Just to be clear, I love the subject of Math but I hated the teaching aspects. Kids that don't care, parents that don't care, and administrators that just want to appease the parents. I felt like I had an unachievable work load and I was being evaluated entirely by factors outside of my control with students that would actively choose not to learn. Please don't tell me that I should ""just try another school.""

Also, acquired a tech coaching position within my school where I basically helped other teachers implement/learn new tech tools for classroom instruction (didn't hate that as much but wasn't a full time position). People told me that I was really good at that but there was not anyway for me to do it full time. The things I really enjoyed about this position was teachers approaching me with a problem/need and me researching and finding potential solutions to said problem.

Basically worked as a teacher to put my wife through school. She has since graduated and is in a stable job within her field. I took the opportunity to quit my job as of june 2023. In that time I feel seemingly more lost with each day that goes by. At this point, my confidence in myself is non-existent and I feel defeated.

Things I've tried/considered:
Completed the Google Data Analytics certification at the suggestion of a friend who works in the data/tech field. Have been applying for jobs but no opportunities have come up due to my lack of experience. The certification was not challenging for me to do so I'm not sure if it is because of my math background made it easy for me or because it was not rigorous enough (I feel that it is the latter).

Have considered going back to school for a master's in Mathematics but reality is that is going to cost more time/money. I feel like I'm already a burden to my wife, who now has to support us. I don't love the idea of extending that for a longer period of time.

I've considered also just going to work for Sam's Club. Previously worked 6 years there to get through school. Didn't like it at all but it was a good college job. I don't love the idea of not moving into a ""career."" If that makes sense.

I've tried to ask close friends for advice but I feel that they over simplify the situation and are just trying to ""stay positive."" I'm not really sure what I'm looking for but any thoughts would be appreciated on how I can find a career.

18itsvo,"I was laid off a few months ago, and it's been basically impossible finding a job, and the depression is getting to me","Long story short, I have a bachelors in Psychology, I worked in retail for all my career until I by luck and through a friend landed a tech support position at a tech company.

The pay was good (to me atleast), 50k salary (CAD), which was way more than I was getting in retail. Life was good, I knew I had gotten very lucky. 

It didn't last long though because I was laid off after a year and a few months. The managers told me it had nothing to do with performance and was a financial decision from above, it was definitely a shock to me because in our department of 25ish I was top 5 for sure in terms of performance (our metrics were visible by all).

Fast forward to a few months later now and my employment insurance has ended and I havent been able to find a job that would pay the same or more. 

I did get an interiew with another tech company for a support position, for which I thought I met all the criteria, but they let me know a few days ago that they chose another candidate. So that little bit of happiness was short lived and now Im back in sad rejection land.

I just dont know what to do though. My degree is kind of useless (BA Psch) and my experience seems to be useless as well (mostly customer service and tech support).

I work hard and am capable, and I value doing good work despite not finding it meaningful. Health insurance can be motivating.

The last year was also the most miserable year of my work life. It’s been pretty destructive personally. And I have to admit I’ve become resentful. 

Yesterday I found out I was getting a promotion. I looked away and unemotionally said “thank you for letting me know, but…” and then rambled for a full 20 min about how worn down I am and all the stuff I’ve fucked up. No smile and warm thanks. Not an awkward, bashful acceptance of compliments. A full on rebuttal and case for why I suck.

I didn’t directly say anything inappropriate but I severely diminished the moment. And what’s worse is that I actually do understand that these events are highlights for many managers so I feel like I stole that from them.

18iti8b,Should I take this job offer?,"Hello,  
  
I am currently grappling with a tough decision regarding whether to remain in my current in-office role or accept a new job offer that allows for remote work. Here's a breakdown of my current job and the new offer:  
  
Current Job:  
  
**Role:** Software sales with extended sales cycles; I serve as the face of the company.  
**Responsibilities**: Handling incoming leads, managing customers signed over the past four years, and addressing complaints.  
**Compensation:** Guaranteed salary of $100k, averaging around $150k with commission and bonus.  
**Work Environment:** 7am to 3:30 M-F in office, dealing with emails, complaints, product demos, and ongoing deals even outside regular hours.  
**Work Schedule:** Monday to Friday with weekends off, but still handling work-related matters on weekends.  
**Stress Levels:** Currently no stress from higher-ups, close relationships with coworkers, but experiencing stress-related issues from deals/old clients which cause panic attacks, recently prescribed Xanax.  


New Job Offer:  
  
**Recommendation:** Came from a friend working there.  
**Compensation:** $15 per hour, with an average rep of $100k in the first year; top performers earning over $300k.  
**Flexibility:** Remote work allowed, can live anywhere in the US.  
**Sales Cycle**: Fast-paced with no ongoing client communication; approximately 7 calls a day, each lasting around 30 minutes.  
Work-Life Balance: Less stress, no need to check emails or worry about work outside of designated hours.  
**Work Schedule:** Approximately 7 calls a day; friend reports spending time on her phone during work hours but works weekends.  


Concerns:  
  
**Pay Cut:** Worried about the significant drop from a guaranteed $100k to a $15 per hour job.  
**Job Security**: Uncertain about job stability in the new role.  
**Quality of Life:** Anticipating an improved quality of life with remote work but unsure if it justifies the potential pay cut.

  
I currently feel like I am living to work in my current role, even though I am content. Any advice on this decision would be greatly appreciated.",Reduxy,1,1.0,2,1702620768,2023-12-15 06:12:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18iti8b/should_i_take_this_job_offer/,12,2023

18irgub,Boss announced I’m taking a new role in front of the whole company. I didn’t know about it and didn’t accept it. Am I overreacting?,"I work as a data engineer in a small cloud company for about 4 years. I entered the company as an engineer (although in a junior role) and got the current position after spending a brief period being a manager (roughly 1 year) and begging to leave. 

I didn’t feel prepared to manage people and it wasn’t part of my career plan. The position was kinda pushed to me as a temp position until management replacement, which was never done. I clearly have a technical career plan as my main interest. I insisted so much to get my engineer position back and eventually it worked. 

I was happy in a DE position for about 5 months. Recently, I took PTO and returned today. 

This exact day, there was a year-end party where they announce what was done throughout the year and what to expect for 2024. Im sitting in my chair when I hear my name being called as the new manager for a security team that’s being created right now. I looked around to see if it was in fact me they were talking about. It was. 

What is this? I just found out? No warning, no preparation? I’m not even qualified for security, although I did formal training in sec months ago and passed the final test. At the time, they needed someone who could quickly learn the topic and pass a test. I did as I was told. 

Honestly this got me both surprised and disappointed. That seems kinda crazy in my mind, as we definitely agreed in moving me back to a technical position, not management. Also, overexposing me in front of the company didn’t feel nice. 

Am I overreacting here?

18ir35j,Should I take a small-modest salary increase…for 2 more months of work?,"
I work for a school in a licensed profession in a VHCOL area. 

I’m currently underpaid at $84,000 in my opinion because I could easily get a job paying 100-120k if I switch settings or jobs, and my department colleagues with similar roles /education / experience make between 95-96 with summers off. 
I stay because I get summers off. 

Over the summer my coworker who was mandated to work the summer quit, leaving all of her work to me. 

My paperwork requirements have tripled, and I’m constantly falling behind or bringing work home to complete. It’s not great but I really like the kids, and despite the high volume of work, the environment is very relaxed. 

They’ve just offered me 100k to work the additional 2 months full time. I’m considering it because I could use a raise given my student debt and being behind on retirement - but I’m really struggling to quantify the value of summers off with a paycheck. 

I’m looking for some perspective.
16k is good money. With the economy the way that it is, am I being entitled wanting more? My position gives great value to the school and there’s a shortage in my location for what I do so more qualified applicants may not be plentiful. 

Should I just suck it up and take the extra money? I know it’s not normal to have summers off anyway in the “real world” even though it’s a major reason I stay where I am. 
Should I ask for more? What would summers off be worth to you?

 I could make around 16k anyway, more flexibly if I work per diem using my license instead of taking this mandatory summer work but it would be harder work overall for sure. 

and even at 100, I think I would still be underpaid given that colleagues with similar experience make this or higher WITH summers off. 

Once I switch there’s no going back. Really torn on how to quantify this. 

Any advice?",thatkidanthony,1,1.0,0,1702612243,2023-12-15 03:50:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ir35j/should_i_take_a_smallmodest_salary_increasefor_2/,12,2023

I’m currently drowning in work requests at my job and am barely making deadlines. Based on the title, it’s probably not shocking that most of those requests are unrelated to my title - I was hired on as an ROI analyst but have been swamped with asks on site functionality. I am the primary person working on a specific tool that measures this after a teammate was laid off. His position was not rehired.

Anyway, our department just hired a new person, and although they do data analysis, it’s not exactly related to the work I’m talking about. Think more of a lead gen position. The person hired knows the tool I use though. 

So I told my boss about my concerns regarding workload and how I would benefit from having someone else in the company who understands how the site is built. I feel like the UX team could help out here. Instead my boss told me to assign the tasks to the new person. 

I feel bad though because this is an insanely overwhelming job - especially for new hires and it was tough enough to learn the ropes to begin with (I still don’t know shit).

18ipcol,Is it wrong to accept an offer and then interview for a different job?,"I've been in this situation before and I can't help but feel kind of bad about it. To some extent, I think it's only reasonable to pursue whatever opportunities come your way, especially if one is a better fit and better pay than another. 

I've been unemployed for about 6 months. I'm recently married and have a Masters degree. An opportunity came my way that, at the time, felt like a great fit and right up my alley. The only downside is that the pay was far below what I've made previously. Throughout our conversations, the interviewers made it understood that they felt I was overqualified but a great fit nonetheless and aligns with some of my passions. Despite having great pay and benefits, I was miserable at my last job. Therefore, as I went about conducting my search for a new one, I went in with a willingness to try something that I thought I'd enjoy more even if it meant less pay (valuing my own happiness). 

Of course, I came across another opening that not only pays a lot more, but also gives a lot of opportunity to continue learning and building out some skills I've been eager to further develop. It also provides a lot of flexibility (remote versus the other which is in an office) and more PTO which are huge bonuses for me. 

As I mentioned earlier, I've been in this position a few times before, where I accepted an offer only to rescind it later and go with something else. I really would hate to look back at this decision in 6 months or a year and really regret not doing taking the better paying job. But it feels like if I do that, I'm inevitably screwing people over.  


My first question is: do companies or organizations always let other candidates/applicants know right away after someone's accepted a position that they aren't moving forward in the process? Hypothetically, let's imagine there was someone equally qualified as me who was considered for the role, but they gave me the offer and I accepted. Do you think they told that person already to move on? In which case, I'm not only screwing the organization over but also denying that person a job they might have been very excited about.   


Second question: Am I an asshole if I accept the other position and rescind the initial offer, or is it fair considering that I have to do what's best for me and my family? To be fair, I haven't received the second offer yet, so I may be overthinking it, and honestly, it's a good problem for anyone to have. But the interviews went very well and I think an offer is probable. Is this situation one that is common or happens regularly? Have others been in this situation before, and if so, what advice do you have?

My first year, i was only with the company for last 6 months of their fiscal year, butI got a 4.5% raise. They said it was that “high” because they “adjusted for the rising inflation” (lmfao..right). I got eval back for this year and my manager reported me with really high praises to HR and said I was the best and most improved on his team, yet I only got 3.5% for 2024. I’d hate to leave this place because I absolutely love my team and the management is also incredible, but I don’t think 3.5% percent is going to cut it in this economy and housing market.

But I don’t recall ever applying for them- their website seems iffy and they had me do an interview via google forms. I did try to find their building but the address given lead to some random road-

18iocte,I am completely lost (need advice),"Hi I am originally from Greece, and went to the UK to follow university. I did a Bachelors in Business and Management in a not much recognized university, and I didn’t learn a thing. I found all the stuff they were teaching useless so I never payed any attention. After graduation I felt lost, and had no idea what to do, so I chose to do a Masters in Economics & Finance. So far I have learned Macro Micro economics and Quantitative Finance. Its been very hard for me because I don’t have an actual background in Finance so I am struggling. Anyway I am confident I can finish this degree but I feel like I am not really sucking in the things I learn… so I still feel lost and I have no idea what I am gonna do in the future.
I have no previous job experience, no qualifications, and I am struggling with my mental health in the side as well 😂. 

I just don’t know what I am gonna do when I finish uni and it gives me anxiety.
My parents have very high expectations and I feel like I am gonna let them down. 

I am passionate about the finance and political sector, but I have no idea how to get into to, and I don’t know how I am gonna get into it when i have no prior experience or knowledge.

18iobo4,Raise and salary disparity,"I am one of two certified clinicians at an outpatient clinic, and the time for yearly reviews is approaching. I need advice re: negotiating a raise. Last year was 2.75% (they said that 3% is the max). I recently found out that my counterpart, who joined us year after I did, is making about 8k more than I am (I'm glad salary transparency is becoming a thing)  

They have 2-3 more years of experience than I do, so I expect a disparity, but this feels significant. We both work a 40 hours week (our schedules are packed because they won't hire additional staff), but I end up having more appointments as I'm there 5 days/week. I also am the only clinician seeing patients with a certain diagnosis (one that the company markets our services for). 

I believe I'm worth much more and I'm not looking for advice on how to word it, I'm just wondering...is asking for a 10% raise asinine? Obviously I'd expect them to offer less, but what is a good starting point %wise to ask? 

A 10% raise would put me at the same current salary as my counterpart, but I'd be satisfied with 7-8%. How would you navigate it?

18iob43,Boss told me to work the system because I cant get insurance.,"I've worked for this small company for almost a year. I took the job to give myself office experience so I can more forward to bigger things and hopefully be able to not start at the minimum pay. When I got offered the job I was told at the end of the interview that they do not offer benefits and my respond was ""Thats fine, I am healthy and I don't think I'll be needing to go to the ER or doctor anytime soon. "" Part of that reasoning was because I was on medicaid due to covid and I was working at a winery that I absolutely hated with long hours. I wanted something different that wasn't fast food or bartending. 

&#x200B;

Well, recently Ive ran into a minior stomach issue and it shifts around my stomach occasionally. When I was on medicaid, I went to the ER for the same thing and they said that it was a UTI and sent me home. It went away after a few weeks of taking the medicine. The medicine they sent me home with though was anti acid medicine and antibiotics for the UTI. Well, I would like to see a doctor about it without having to pay the rest of my life or my whole very small savings account to just afford it. I brought up to my boss about if I cannot get insurance to see a doctor or get something done about this and it becomes a bigger issue that I would need to find a job that offers benefits. I was very kind and polite about it. She explained to me why they don't offer insurance and its because the company is to small and nobody wants it. They are all got their own insurance.  

I went on to my states insurance and tried to get insurance and its not about being able to afford it, the plans that they offer dont cover my doctor and or dont cover the hospital in my town. The more pricer plans covered both but I can't afford to drop 300 a month on insurance. Not with the debt I am currently in. I want it paid off before I enroll into something that I know I cannot afford. I would at that point be robbing jack to pay paul. 

So, I told her about finding a job with benefits if it came down to it and her response to me was 'Why dont you work the system? Everyone else does. You can get a bill for 236k and you can tell then you can only afford to pay $25.00 a month"" I looked at her like she was crazy because my whole ordeal here is TRYING TO GET OUT OF DEBT. Yes, I would have to pay a deductible, but thats better then me being in debt so and so dollars and paying for it for the REST OF MY LIFE.

I honestly plan to search for a new job after the holidays because what she told me was absolutely ridiculous. The fact that I cannot afford insurance, can't afford to live and she wants me to throw myself into medical debt and ""work the system"" I grew up on the system and I'm trying to get out of the system.. 

Am I wrong for wanting to move on from this job based on this response that she gave me?

I'm also autistic and have trouble picking up things that come naturally to other people, tho I do not have any intellectual disabilities aside from mildly impaired short term memory.

 My ideal situation would be to find a decent paying job (ideally remote but it doesn't have to be obviously) that I can do while working through college while also living away from my parents. I have a girlfriend who is in a similar position to me and both of us want to live together and move out of our parent's houses.

I’ve been having issues with a health benefit (health account deposits) I know I am entitled to because my company stopped making payments without warning this year.

18il6n4,Seeking Career Advice: Transitioning from Civil Engineering and Management Consulting,"  
Hey everyone,  
  
I’m at a bit of a crossroads and could really use some guidance on my career path. Here’s a snapshot of my experience:  
  
Graduated as a civil engineer, realized it wasn’t my passion.  
Explored construction management but faced a layoff due to a mismatch and a mistake I made in a small company.  
Transitioned to management consulting in the public sector (working with state governments, utility companies, etc.) for the past two years.  
While I’ve gained valuable experience, I’m not finding the fulfillment I hoped for in my current role. I have this nagging feeling that perhaps no job will completely satisfy me, but I believe there must be aspects of a job that I can genuinely enjoy.  
  
Given this background, I’m seeking advice on potential next steps. I’m open to exploring new industries or positions that align better with my skills and interests. I’m looking for suggestions, insights, or experiences from those who have navigated similar career shifts or have expertise in different industries.  
  
Questions I have:  
  
What industries might be a good fit for someone with a civil engineering background and consulting experience?  
What types of positions could leverage my skill set while offering a more fulfilling work environment?  
Any personal experiences or advice on finding a job that offers a sense of satisfaction and enjoyment?  
I appreciate any advice or input you can offer. Thanks in advance for your help!

18ikkki,What do I do when my boss has spoken to me like a bag of shit?,"Hi there, I work in care for a small private company and have done now for around 3 months. I absolutely love my job. This evening I had an incident where an elderly lady I care for had fallen ill. I immediately called 111 and went through the assessment, then informed the family and then tried calling my boss even though I know her phone was off this evening. I then contacted my supervisor who advised me to leave even though I was waiting for a call back from 111 to probably send out an ambulance. 

Long story short, the second line supper called back just as I was leaving after waiting for 45 mins and I told my supervisor I wasn’t happy about leaving this lady alone, so I Waited in the house for the call back. My boss was incredibly unhappy about this and shouted at me. The lady in question had a fall out of bed the night before that wasn’t communicated through the relevant lines and I only found this out because the lady who called me back told me they visited her last night.  It’s quite common for elderly people to go into shock after a fall even if it’s delayed, she was also cold to the touch, pale, breathless and shaking violently enough that it exhausted her. 

I had contacted the family and asked for her son to come and give her some support, he was more than willing even though he lives 2.5 hours away. 

So anyway, my boss was trying to cal me whilst I was on the phone to the paramedic and I finally answered after I had finished the call, I was greeted on the phone to. “So what’s up mate?” I explained the situation and my boss scream down the phone at me “ you’ve left 3 other people waiting for a bed call because she’s in bed feeling poorly?”  Is replied well “ yes because she had a fall out of bed last night, I didn’t know about this, and I’ve now given the wrong information to the paramedics that I first spoke to, because nothing was communicated” she again raised her voice and shouted at. The phone “ I can’t believe you’ve done this, I’m going to have to go and do the rest of your bed calls because of this”. “ I can’t believe you called her son, he’s lives over 3 hours away!!” All in all I was actually only running about 100mins behind. I still could have made them all. I apologised for it and I was still told you should have just left he, and usually I would have done but something wasn’t right.  

I left after this and broke down in my car. My supervisor called and said sorry to me for the way the boss had spoke to me but I still just don’t 1 don’t understand why the fall wasn’t communicated with me, and 2 why is it acceptable to leave an elderly lady with possible shock in bed alone? 

Maybe I just care too much. 

What would you do? I’m torn between handing my notice in and starting up on my own or routing for an apology and getting back on with it. I’ve been breaking my back for my boss working every hour under the sun and moon. I just feel the way she spoke to me is completely unacceptable and down right wrong.",Better-Presence-7367,8,0.7900000214576721,6,1702592957,2023-12-14 22:29:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ikkki/what_do_i_do_when_my_boss_has_spoken_to_me_like_a/,12,2023

18ijupi,Stretching out the interview process so I can collect my bonus and know where my salary is at to get a competitive offer,"After my employer laid off 5% of our workforce in June due to what they call ""Profit Erosion"", I updated my resume and kept an eye out for positions that may be a good fit and meet my strict criteria.  At the beginning of November, I had a recruiter reach out with a role that checked every box.  With the extreme need in the construction industry for every role, I knew I'd be in the driver's seat for the most part when it came to timing and financials.  I decided after a conversation with the VP at this company to go forward with interviews likely mid-January.  

Here's where it gets tricky for me.  My review (performance and compensation) is supposed to occur before the end of February.  I typically don't give current salary info, but have stated where I want to be.  This isn't an issue for them however I am concerned that I could be asking for too little and end up with a raise that is well above where they may offer.  Is this likely?  No, but still a risk.  Additionally, I will not receive my bonus until mid-March.  I've shared with the recruiter that information and indicated that I would be staying on until that is received, unless they offer a signing bonus that covers it.  Again, this company is willing to wait until then.  I'm not trying to lead them on, but part of me says I am doing just that.  I could forgo the bonus and leave before then, but with all that's transpired I'd prefer to wait it out and collect what I've earned.  I do know that I'll at least give a day in between when the bonus clears and when I resign (if that's the route I pick).

18iipcm,How to handle a new position “trial run” without a pay raise?,"A little background on myself: I am in my mid 30’s, formerly a career bartender, and in school for Data Science and Software Dev but do not currently hold a degree. 

With that in mind, about three months ago I started working in Tech Support for a hospitality adjacent tech start up. From the jump I’ve received positive feedback from my peers and management. My metrics are great and I’ve never received bad customer feedback. 

A couple of weeks ago my manager approached me stating he’d like to talk about my future with the company. He had two positions he wanted me to consider moving into. One being Dev adjacent and an excellent opportunity for someone like me with very little real world experience. 

The kicker is, my manager has gotten approval for a “trial run” of this Dev adjacent position. This trial run involves 90 days of me building out an entirely new department, setting KPI’s and building pipelines for recording metrics to measure my own success, writing SOPs for the support team, and writing knowledge base articles. All of this with my current on-phones workload and without a pay increase. They are of no obligation to actually offer me the job at the end of the 90 days. 

I know I am being taken advantage of by the company by laying the foundation for a department that they are free to use with or without hiring me on to fill the role. I also recognize that this is a massive learning opportunity for myself and could pay out in dividends moving forward in my career. I am at an impasse with myself about how to handle it. Do I just do the work and shut up? Let my manager know that I am willing but also aware that this is kind of shitty?

18ii34f,Which offer to accept? Corporate Finance,"Background: I am mid-30s, no MBA, and have been an individual contributor as a financial analyst from small $3M companies to big tech at $3B. Smaller companies I've worked for had long-term FTEs above me that never left so when they said there was growth potential they were full of it. Some of those places, I really liked being at though, so stayed anyway. Which of these offers is the best choice for my future? And what can I do to better set myself up for further success?

Offer 1 - Large services manager position. Leading a small team of direct reports with focus on forecasting. The work sounds ok which is not a pro or con.

Pros: Manager experience that I don't directly have, higher base pay (+14k), stability, upward mobility, and team seems to really like me. Cons: in office, upward mobility might require physically moving, not tech may be a con when looking at next step in my career

Offer 2 - Mid-size PE backed tech company as a Sr Analyst which I've been doing for a while now. No directs and base is a little lower than Offer 1.

Pros: hybrid flexibility, work sounds interesting and would basically be helping to build out processes, tech space, PE firm is involved and I received a note from their board along with the offer which I've never seen before, potential movement and networking with PE firm/portfolio. Cons: same thing I've been doing and who knows if there is upward mobility or they're blowing smoke, less base pay (-14k), still no management experience",amanpanda,1,1.0,1,1702586338,2023-12-14 20:38:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ii34f/which_offer_to_accept_corporate_finance/,12,2023

18ihq6j,Will there be challenges if I want to move back to an SME role after taking on management duties?,"I started a new job several months ago. Everything is going well, the pay is great, work is good, the team is good, no real complaints. I'm currently the most senior of the individual contributor / SME people. We have decided to rearrange the team because my manager has too many people under them, and the plan is that I've been asked to ake on the management of a sub team of our most junior people. I am being compensated properly for this move, and they are very aware I haven't managed people before. 

Overall I think it is a good move, and it gives me a change to really cement myself here. So I don't have any complaints. My question is just theoretical. If I hate, if I really just don't like managing people. if I don't feel like I am doing the kind of work I want to do anymore, will I have trouble going back into an IC or SME type role? I know it might be industry dependent (I'm in intelligence/security in the private sector), but is there an weird stigma that when you enter management that is kind of where you live?

I’m woking full time with an hourly rate of $4 which i consider sobrang baba po para sa isang product researcher since this niche requires a lot of time po talaga even though you’re professional na po. I work for $4/hr , fixed 8hrs/day and 8-10 items po. I guarantee naman po na consistent good results/deals po yung nabibigay ko sa kanya. Usually in a month, lahat ng items ko is binibili niya, marami na yung 5-10 items na rejected per month na madalas hindi ko naman fault na kasi nagiging mahigpit si amz these past few months and dumadami yung biglang naging gated.

So my question is, if you are in my position rn, would u ask for a raise na po? Considering the current market for PR, my experience and results. 

If yes, what would u say to your client without being off o something?

18if0zy,Technical Sales vs IT,"Hello,  
I am making a career change. My goal is to become a sales engineer. My dad was a sales engineer. My mom was an account executive. I want to try out the sales engineer side of things. It is my dream job. My ultimate goal.   
I have two offers currently open to me that I think lead me to that goal.  
One is at Keyence for a technical sales role, where I would actually have the title of ""sales engineer"". It isn't really sales engineering though. I'd be demoing, sure, but I'm cold calling and closing deals etc. etc.   
Problems with Keyence: I am only willing to work there one year because all their locations are a minimum of 2 hours away from my home in Maryland. My niece was just born. My entire family is in Maryland. I want to find a wife. That search will likely be put on hold since I'm only going to be in that new place for a year.  
The other is at a help desk position. It would get my foot in the door in IT where I intend do whatever is necessary to move to sysadmin after 6 months - 1 year or however long it takes.  I also have   
 a different path to potentially/hopefully Northrop Grumman since I have a contact there with some influence. I figure I work in the IT field for 5 years after help desk or so maybe more maybe less and try to leverage that into a sales engineering position.   
Problems with help desk path: I feel like it might be a slower/harder path to a sales engineering position because I will be lacking that high value technical sales experience.   
If I take this job at Keyence for a technical sales role, it is my understanding that this position would be more valuable experience or at least high value experience for getting a sales engineer role when I start applying. I doubt I could transition instantly into an actual sales engineer role from 1 year of technical sales at Keyence. Apparently that business is a meat grinder for people anyway. It is pretty much non-negotiable for me to stay at Keyence for longer than that.   
My main questions are: Are there any assessments I've made here that you disagree with?  
Is it possible for me to move from a 1-year technical sales position to something in IT/Cybersecurity/Tech? Do you think perhaps this technical sales position could take me to a different path to SE or allow me to skip helpdesk?  
I'm pretty stuck on what path to take and don't want to miss out on this opportunity with Keyence.  
Sorry for the long post and I appreciate any feedback!",Randomgod792,1,0.5,0,1702578153,2023-12-14 18:22:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18if0zy/technical_sales_vs_it/,12,2023
18iecti,Career Options,"Right so I'll get straight to it. Graduated with a degree in electrical and electronics engineering this year, don't like the field and don't want to work in it. Did an internship for 6 months at a reasonably big sized company as an Application Engineer (involved a mix of coding and in-house tools), left that company cause the pay was shit. Recently I've been working at a not so big company and my role is not completely defined here but it is somewhere between sales, operations and account management. The pay is good for now but I understand that this is a dead end.

My thing is I am aware enough about what I don't like :- Coding and Electrical/Electronics is not my forte per se. I just don't know what I like. My goal is earn massive amounts of money and retire very early as delusional as it may sound considering my situation.

18iddh6,Too drastic of a move for not enough gain?,"I've been with my current company for about a year, and about three months in they told me they saw my potential and wanted to start training me to join the research and development department. Depending on my progress, by December (now), I would fully transition. This never happened. 

Around the six month mark,  I did my own research, gathered data for the past two years and I noticed a mistake in the process that the research and development team had missed. I worked on everything related to documentation and implementation of the paperwork necessary for fixing this mistake. When it was implemented, we got the highest yield in the history of the company (I'm talking double). And it was consistent. Which meant this allowed us to double production for this client. So essentially, my work doubled the business for the company, and quadrupled production for the client. 

I got zero recognition for any of this work, which was way above my regular duties. In fact the only two people who told me ""good job"" were the development supervisor, and the person who initially told me about me getting trained at the three month mark.

To cut a long story short, three weeks ago I was told by the VP that there was no availability for the position I wanted in development. A few days ago they posted a job posting looking to hire someone for that exact position. I talked to my supervisor about this and he told me ""there is a position available, just not for you"". This was not from lack of trying on the development supervisor's part. He really fought for me to join his department but apparently I've been caught in some politics that I wasn't even aware of. 

Essentially, they've determined what my career in this company is going to look like before I was even given a chance despite constantly telling me that this is the direction they wanted for me, and all I needed to do was be patient. By no means am I trying to jump the gun or push for something I don't think I deserve. I just don't feel like hard work is necessarily awarded in this company anymore. The finish line just keeps on moving further away and they are never happy. I definitely exceed the duties of my role by a mile and I feel taken advantage of. 

Now, I've been offered a great opportunity in another company for the exact position I've been trying to get into here. If I go for this, it would be jumping a step in the ladder. Financially, I would be about breaking even because of how expensive it is out there. But career wise it would be a great step. 

My question is whether or not it's worth it to do such a drastic step for moving out into the boonies, moving into a place probably in worse condition than my current living conditions for a higher price, paying about double the cost of living, all for a positive career move. I don't foresee myself being out there for life and would possibly consider moving back to where I am at some point just because of how insanely expensive it is over there. I would eventually get this position if I stick out here (they're telling me another 8 months), it would just be a matter of cutting down that waiting time a bit (who knows if they're telling the truth) and potentially going somewhere where they appreciate my hard work. 

I don't know if this is the right move to make in the sense of risk vs reward and would greatly appreciate any advice on this.",AYoungAcademic,1,0.5,5,1702573856,2023-12-14 17:10:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18iddh6/too_drastic_of_a_move_for_not_enough_gain/,12,2023

My body(knees) and lower back are already starting to hurt. I never envisioned myself long term in trades. It just paid ok, and it was easy to find a job. 

I do stuff after work like playing sports and I already work in the commercial side which is slower paced which is good(residential trades are dog eat dog). 

Im just lost because I know I have to make a change to something else soon but the economy is not good right now, people aren't spending money, and excess immigration is bringing down wages alot. 

I'm also scared because I don't want to change to something else and burn through my savings only to end up back where I started. Also going back to school is not an option because I am not a classroom/book learner.

18icd8p,What did I just do…,"So I just quit a job I was at for a year a four months. I have nothing lined up and I left before two weeks were up. I feel terribly irresponsible and relieved at the same time. I was one of the few who lasted as long as I did in my department. It was the most abusive and toxic environment I ever worked in and the director lost more than half her staff in a year. My husband and I agreed that we would be ok if I put my two weeks in before having another job lined up (I had interviews lined up & I’m in healthcare so we were confident I’d find something soon). 
Anyway, the day after I sent in my two weeks, the director had a meeting with everyone where she starts yelling, “I’m so tired of all this bullshit! 2024 is going to be completely different!” Continues with more unintelligible yelling and ends it with, “and if anyone wants me to put any of this is writing, I will!” I was so wigged out by her tirade (slightly afraid for my safety maybe?), I updated my two weeks to ending it that day. She had a history of publicly shaming people, answering I was confident that tirade was for me. 
HR & compliance have been investigating my director for quite some time now due to the amount of complaints from people, but regardless, I feel like I’ve failed in some way and wildly irresponsible.

I am a humble person, but this increase is truly due to myself and another co-worker that works under me. Together we have worked very hard to make this happen, and our company management team knows this.  
  
However, we are both severely underpaid for our positions.  Note we are both women in a predominately male industry, and it is proven women are not paid the same as men. We make about ¼ what management makes.  Our company is small and staffs about 50 employees.  We have a company president with four other departmental managers under him.

We are not speculating or exaggerating; we know this for a fact. They all take credit for the work done by their employees when they do nothing.  
  
Each year we get Christmas bonuses of $300. We found out last year from a peer that was promoted to one of the four management positions that the managers are splitting the yearly profits and getting tens of thousands of dollars in bonuses. He told one employee that shared it with some others. We know the employee that shared this information isn’t lying because he is very good friends with the newly promoted manager (and oddly enough he happens to be my spouse).  Why the new manager decided to share this is beyond me. He’s a known blabbermouth and likes to stir up stuff, but he’s exceptionally good at what he does. Honestly, he is the only member of management that we feel actually deserves such a large bonus.   
  
With that being said, several of us in the company know the insane amount the managers receive at Christmas, but we are supposed to keep it a secret.   
  
Like I mentioned, our company is extremely small. My position is in estimating and sales, but I wear many hats. I handle all marketing, trade shows, do all of my manager’s reports for him, and handle a lot of HR duties (because we do not have a designated HR department – my degree is in HR). I am also training to take over my manager’s position. He is retiring the end of next year. So I know potentially next year, I may start receiving one of these bonuses. Even so, I just don’t think it’s very fair to the rest of the company.  
  
It is just very disheartening knowing I should be making much more than I make, knowing that myself and another coworker are the sole reason we have drasticaly increased our company profits over the last ten years.   
  
I did receive a small raise earlier this year. The company gives raises to everyone at the same time. Two weeks after our raises, the company announced insurance prices were going up, so what I did receive was canceled out by the increase in insurance cost.  
  
Granted I do have a good salary for my area of the country, and it would be hard to swap careers and make what I currently make. However, I do not know how to handle the issue of the manager’s bonuses. Should we approach management or stay silent?  Should I gamble and demand a raise or threaten to leave? I know my company wouldn’t want to lose me.   
  
Any advise is appreciated!

18ib8gv,How long should I stay in my job before I quit? (UK),"My work situation is pretty rough right now. I am an ""intern"" at a law firm (I say that because everywhere besides the contract I'm labelled as a paralegal and admin). I have been on the job for 2 months now, past my probation period. This is my first real law job and other than my boss, I'm loving it. 

The only issue is how toxic the environment is. I cannot escape his pedantic micromanaging since there are only two of us in the office. Today is the third time I took off work without long notice (Covid, migraine and then my grandpa is dying). My boss' response to me taking today off to deal with my grandpa's surgery complication (it's really dire and he's moments away from death) was that we were going to have a meeting to talk about my absences. 

I'm not sure I can last much longer but I need this job for my resume. Any advice?

18i9w84,How do I ask about the details of my promotion salary increase?,"I joined a small IT team at an organization 7 months ago, as entry level desktop tech support. I have been an hourly wage worker. My annual pay would amount to $52,000.

The team had a VP of IT, a Director of IT, me, and an intern. The Director resigned. VP asks if I want a promotion. I was told this was a salary role not eligible for overtime pay. I would manage the intern and whoever gets hired as tech support to replace my current role. I was told there would be an increase in salary but not exactly how much, as the VP needed to get this approved by HR and CEO. After HR and CEO approve, VP tells me he told them to give me at least $10k more than I make now ($62,000), but was pushing for $65k total salary and an IT Manager title. (I don't know exactly how much the former Director made but I think it was $100k+. He worked here for 25 years though.) He said HR and the CEO would reach out to me to discuss details. This was last week.

HR and the CEO haven't reached out to me. I never got anything in writing. The Finance department reaches out to me regarding tasks (paying technology bills) the former Director did other than that it doesn't feel like anything changed. The VP has told me ""I think you're really gonna like the salary. You're gonna have to prove you're worth it because I pushed really hard for it."" He says we'll meet on Monday to discuss my new financial responsibilities but I have no idea when or how to ask about my own financial compensation. I used to get 2 remote days but was told to come into the office everyday until we can figure out a schedule. We still haven't discussed my new remote days.

18i7psx,Losing skills,"I worked super hard over the last few years and studied part time more than once. I love learning and improving myself but that last year was tough. I found myself in a role where I was just doing thoughtless work and literally losing skills.

I have since resigned and looking for new work but my confidence is a little bit shaky. Two of the things I've been struggling with is speaking to people and writing, which are essential for the workplace.

I was always good at writing. Even in the first few years of working it was never an issue. It became an issue when I started working with someone who suddenly picked it apart even though it they approved my copies with minor changes initially. Now I struggle, from my punctuation to my grammar, I doubt myself. I've also always struggled with being concise. I used ChatGBT a lot for CVs and cover letters etc. but that's not me and I feel like I'm cheating. If I do it myself I just end up reaching a block and it takes me forever.

The speaking is just because I'm naturally introverted, out of practice and didn't use this skill much over the last year but I can work on it.

18i76p4,Asking for some advice choosing between engineering internship offers for Summer 2024,"Currently a 2nd year, mechanical engineering student, originally from SoCal.

A month ago, I accepted an internship offer from Tesla for a mechanical design engineering internship (right up my alley of applied mechanical engineering) for the Winter/Spring term. However, recently, I received multiple Summer offers. Of my four other offers, I am only considering one from Walmart for an automation engineering internship (less aligned with my career goals) and one from a mid-size defense AI drone company for a mechanical engineering internship (very aligned with my career interests and I find the work they do also very interesting). I cannot decide whether to extend the earlier offer for Tesla into the Summer or take one of these other offers for the Summer.

The pros of staying with Tesla include having a longer term to work on my project there. I will have a higher chance of receiving a return offer for the following terms next year and I can learn more. Also, starting the application cycle, Tesla was my dream company to work at - I am very blessed and lucky to have this opportunity. Cons would be if I burn out at Tesla (notoriously bad work culture), don't like the work or the projects, or miss the chance to explore other opportunities with other companies. It's also not guaranteed, I would have to ask my hiring manager to extend it to Summer.

The pros of taking Walmart would be that the pay is much higher than either and the location is in Hoboken, NJ (which is right across the Hudson River from NYC - 10 to 15 mins subway). I do value career opportunities, but I also value life experience. And I have always wanted to visit NYC and having the experience of living there for a 3-month term would be super cool. Also, the higher pay doesn't hurt either. Another thing to consider is that I would be coming out of a 4-month term at Tesla so this would be a nice change of pace. I would be gaining exposure to a new company/industry and that's always valuable. The cons would be that this position/experience doesn't align with my current career goals and I would likely not care if I got a return offer here. FYI I have until Monday 12/18 to respond to the offer.

For the AI drone company, the pay is very similar to Tesla. For location, it would be in San Diego, CA, which is where I am from so I would be able to live at home if I would like. The pros of taking the AI drone company would be that it aligns with my career goals and would give me a chance to work with another high-tech engineering + AI company while having exposure to a different industry. This experience could allow me to segway into the defense/aerospace industry which I find very cool. Also, since it is mid-sized, I would be able to work on real projects that have an impact on the company and learn a bunch doing it. Also, it is downtown San Diego and, even though I live in SD, I have rarely gone downtown so it would be cool to work there. Cons would be that it is too close to home (a pro and a con), burn-out from transitioning from a high-stress working environment at Tesla to a high-stress working environment here, and the possibility of trading this for a higher chance of a return offer at Tesla. I have until later next week to decide on this.

I want to maximize my career opportunities and the possibility of a return offer at Tesla since I will also have my Junior year summer to have another internship. However, I know that gaining a breadth of opportunities both career-wise and life-wise is also very important. Internships are a perfect time to have short-term, low-risk exposure to new places and companies and I value this a lot too. Which internship offer would you go with?

18i4gf9,Reunite with old employer? plz help.,"So I am struggling a bit with my morale at my current job and whether I should stay. I used to work a for a smaller firm (30-40 people) & I end up leaving this role bc my company wanted to wait on giving me a promotion/better pay (which I deserved) for one with the city that offers better pay, benefits, and a pension. I also thought this would allow me to grow more in my career. 

Oh and here’s a twist, my old employer did end up giving me a higher pay along with a promotion but I was already in the interview process and ended up landing the city job. I took the city job, it was a tough decision. 

Since day one I had regret leaving but I knew it was for a good reason. 10 months later I am missing my old job, as I’m tired of the corporate lifestyle and miss being part of a smaller team with a purposeful role. I was pretty happy in my old role. 

My old firm would be thrilled to have me back & it would be similar to my current pay but without the benefits and pension. 

I’m only 31 and although a pension sounds enticing, i don’t want to be unhappy for the next 30 years. 

Would it be foolish to leave my higher paying city job to go back to my old employer?

TLDR: I’m 31, I left good job at a small company for one with the city (higher salary & a pension) but I am unhappy overall. 10 months later I’m offered a chance to go back to old role with my similar pay but no pension.

18i3a5k,"Jumping into the BioMed Tech field as someone with no CompSci degree, but over a decade of professional electronics experience?","I find myself in a dilemma. To start, up until this past year, I was a retail worker. Words do no justice to the abuse I have weathered in the name of learning to function in the workforce. It started at Walmart at 17 in the electronics department, then Radioshack where I learned about ohms law, capacitors, diodes and other small electronic parts, then Best Buy (Geek Sqaud) where I learned how to repair and diagnose both hardware and software issues, then I switched to being our stores Autotech where I learned 12V DC electronics and how to integrate with them using aftermarket equipment. Then I finally left that job after 5 years to be what I am now, a Gaming Machine Technician for a casino.

&#x200B;

That is my career progression for the past 13 years, each job becoming more complex along with the pay trending upward but also the knowledge I gained from each job tying into the next. Twice now I have switched career fields into something I have had next to no professional experience in, being nearly completely unrelated to my last job and gone on to become proficient within the year and respected within my department. There is an opening near me for a Biomed Tech for Dialysis machines with a company called Fresenius and I \*know\* I could learn and become proficient at working with these machines. Plus there is talk of becoming MRI certified and being coveted, for a good reason. 

&#x200B;

My reason for wanting to look into this field is simply being tired of laboring to feed peoples gambling addictions. It is one of the lowest human vices I have ever seen and the atmosphere is depressing even when there arent people in the building. I have a gift for diagnosing and repairing machines and I would rather use it to help people. We wont get into the healthcare system or the atmosphere of working in a hospital, fact is I've been unfortunate enough to have to be in the hospital dozens upon dozens of times in the past decade, not as a patient, so I am intimately aware of how horrifying the atmosphere can be. My only hope is that I can tolerate the stress of having to work on a machine with other personnel and patients around trying to hurry me up.

I’m in my late 20s and have been working the same job for the last 10 years or so. It’s my first adult job. It’s a store manager type position, but the fact that it’s so small (5 employees, mostly part time apart from 2 of us who are full time), means that I’m doing all sorts of things from customer service to dispatching orders to running the website to ordering from suppliers to repairs, with no formal training in anything. I went straight from high school to this job so I don’t have higher education. I don’t think the store is going to last much longer in this economy and I’m also just ready to move on, but I am soooo overwhelmed! What direction do I go in?! The obvious answer is “whatever you want!” but I don’t know what that is. I think I just want something corporate-ish where I can go, do my work, go home, and not stress and get paid. I’m not the type of person who gets a lot of fulfilment from work, I don’t think. I’m just wondering if there’s any job roles/directions that anyone could suggest for someone in my position? So far I’m thinking something in E-commerce, or admin etc.? 

I feel underqualified due to my lack of formal education and training, and also starting a new pathway at my age - and I’m not even old!

You may meet with me and I can arrange to include a representative from Career Services along with our Assistant Dean #####, who you may already know.

We collect exit data from seniors. Our average salary for 144 business students who responded in 2019 was $59,236, and in 2020 from 107 students it was $58,427. I specifically checked for 2019 and Management was at $60,435, and Marketing was at $55,425.
The overall range for 2019 was $37,500 to $87,500, dependent upon the job title.

Typically, employers recruit from several colleges and universities, and the starting salaries for entry level positions are mostly fixed regardless of the school that the students come from, which depends upon the position and required qualifications.  

You indicate a double major in Management and Marketing, though that is more likely a major in one, and a minor in the other based on our School's rules about majors. https://business.tcnj.edu/departments-programs/undeclared/advisement-for-open-option-business-students/change-of-major-specialization-guidelines/

18i0vdv,Underqualified for new job,"I worked for an almost 10 years at a company but after a change in management I had to get out. I ended up accepting an offer from a consultancy company which is great. However I grossly under qualified for my new job. My manager is ok with it as I have an assignment but my consultancy team lead is passive aggressive about me not measuring up. I know I’m bad and I’m trying to get better but it takes time as I have like 2-3 years of experience while they have much more. 

Most people here are in their mid 20s including all the managers. 

It’s not just the skills it’s also the hustle culture I struggle with. I’m middle aged and really can’t muster the energy to work 10h days. My previous job was extremely lazy also, where we worked 100% remote. 

I’m thinking about looking for a new job. I have been here now for 6 months soon. I would like to stay 2 years or so to learn the job properly. 

If I’m allowed to stay, should I suffer through 6 more months at least? Or will it look bad on my resume if I quit?",WingOutrageous9987,2,1.0,0,1702529775,2023-12-14 04:56:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18i0vdv/underqualified_for_new_job/,12,2023
18i0s3y,Career change for someone who has worked in Orthopedic Medical Device Sales for 3 years,"I(24M) have been working in orthopedic medical sales for over 3 years. And I absolutely hate it. It’s hard to explain how this job operates to someone who has never been in the industry. But there isn’t a lot of “selling” going on. You are in the operating room the majority of your time helping OR staff and surgeons with surgeries. Literally I know how to do probably 150+ surgeries and I’m there to guide and give advice to the surgeon as needed. The other majority of your time is coordinating and personally delivering products to hospitals. 

I work in a very successful territory where my managers have done a good job selling and with that comes chaos. Trauma surgeries and scheduled surgeries clash and it’s hard to coordinate what is called “coverage” which is being in the OR to help with the surgery. The territory I work in is so large and chaotic and it’s extremely stressful. My company’s operations team (the people who are supposed to coordinate the movements of our implants and instruments) is absolutely terrible. I work anywhere from 40-70 hours a week it just depends on how busy that week is.

 I’ll spare more details but my question is: What is a different job that I should consider with my experience? The reason I’ve stayed at my job is the money. I’m 24 and last year I made $130,000 which is insane for someone my age. This year will probably be $140,000 or so and honestly this is probably the peak at this company and the position I am in. 

This job has taught me so many things. Being attentive to details, communication skills (literally telling surgeons how to do the surgery), building relationships with everyone that works at hospitals. And I feel I have gotten very good and those aspects of the job but not so much the actual “selling” part of the job. I could never see myself going door to door selling something or sitting at a desk and doing like software sales or whatever. 

I’m curious is there’s another sales job or really any job where I can make as much money as I do now that isn’t as fucking stressful and time consuming, and where I could apply the skills that I’ve learned too. Any feedback would be great.

18i0op2,I was fired for being too nice?,"
I have worked in telecommunication sales for 4 years. It is highly aggressive (I’m in Canada) due to the monopoly here. I have always excelled in sales, doubled every target, was top 50 in Canada throughout all of the stores. I know how to close deals, I know how to do a trial close, I know I’m good at sales. 

I applied at a car dealership and got the job. Started in late November (worked for 19 days total). Trained for 2 weeks and then was sent on my own. I sold one vehicle on my first day - to which the customer asked to speak to the manager about how he had the most amazing experience and would have never bought from us if I hadn’t called him. I had 4 appointments coming in and one with a deposit that I was about to take. 

I was called into the managers office and I was fired due to my “personality being too nice” I had been selling for 5 days. Another guy who started a week before me had only sold 1 vehicle in 12 days, yet he is seen as doing great? 

I never signed an employment agreement, I had never been told about a probationary period. Therefore, as per Canadian law, I’m not in a probationary period. Is this grounds for unethical / wrongful termination?? I am feeling like they didn’t give me a chance to actually show my skills. I texted the GM asking for a real reason so I could grow as a person and salesperson and all he said was “I appreciate your time with us - it just wasn’t a fit” considering I was 100% commission, no base, I don’t even know if I can get EI until I find a suitable job.",OkTreat4285,12,0.7699999809265137,10,1702529133,2023-12-14 04:45:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18i0op2/i_was_fired_for_being_too_nice/,12,2023

18i0gdi,Should I just stick to dental assistant at this point?,"*sigh* okay… my reasons or concerns might not be a big deal to you or it’s easy to do it while studying for dental hygiene but it’s difficult for me. All my life so far I dedicated to studying I always put education first I didn’t have social life, I’m 24 can’t even cook because college took amount of time from me. Not ready for marriage while other people I know are getting married. I feel behind in life. It took me 5 years to finish my bachelors now I’m 24 thinking of taking prerequisite which a year or two then do dental hygiene which is 2 years. I’ll be 28 or so. That’s late in life being not married and lack of social life. People say I can have a social life while studying or pursuing dental hygiene. I CANT I have ADD and it’s so difficult for me to study let alone it can take me weeks for 1 subject. That’s my other concern I took part time in university that’s why it took me 5 years to finish my bachelor in health sciences because of my ADD. Dental hygiene is my dream but I can’t do full time let alone part time not available. I just feel if I decided to do dental hygiene. I will not have social life, I will not learn how to cook, I will not be able to focus and become a best version of myself let alone try to get married. But I want to have a career that I will be proud of and not be embarrassed. I want to have a nice car but won’t afford it as dental assistant. I don’t want my future husband to look down on me because of my career or embarrassed to tell anyone about what I’m doing. Idk what to do with my bachelors degree it’s not my passion.

hi. so i've been working at multicare for almost 2 years now. it is not a career for me, just while i'm in school. i am an inpatient phlebotomist (per diem) and it was good, lots of experience and worked with my school schedule. i got another weekend phlebotomy job a few months ago and it's honestly better. it's outpatient (not as taxing, inpatient is a lot harder), better pay, set amount of hours. per diem was great but i never knew how much i would be working, shifts would get picked up. it was better the first year but then they hired floats and also made picking up shifts for per diem much stricter. i used to be able to share my schedule 1-2 weeks in advance and request shifts/pick up call outs. they became stricter, demanding availability 6 weeks in advance. i got busy with my new job and school and honestly have not worked since sept. it's also hard for me to share availability for that long out, i loved sharing just 1-2 weeks out esp with school. they also knew i was starting a new job and coincidentally stopped offering me to pick up shifts since then (but maybe the policy became stricter at the same time). 

  
so i wasn't sure if i wanted to go back but i'm on break from school now and thought i could maybe consider picking up shifts and messaged the coordinator what the new policy was (considering they never offered for me to pick up any shifts). she explained the policy but in the end added ""i think the supervisor will be reaching out to you about your per diem position and the plans moving forward"".... so tell me if i'm wrong but it seems like i'm getting fired. i honestly don't mind leaving this job. but i need to know if getting fired will be better or just resigning before she messages me??? i know i'm in the wrong and should've kept in contact or picked up shifts, but i've just been so busy. i gained everything i need from this job and probably wouldn't have kept it longer anyway. the only issue with getting fired (that i know of) is i heard multicare blacklists you if you get fired and i would consider coming back to multicare for my future nursing career. what should i do? how should i communicate about resigning so it doesn't look like i'm just scared of them firing me instead? is there any way/point of salvaging my job (it's not super important to me and i can go without but the option of keeping it is something i can consider). please help asap so i can do it before the supervisor actually messages me about terminiation lol",raspberrylemonade-,3,1.0,3,1702527796,2023-12-14 04:23:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18i0atu/better_to_get_fired_or_quit_need_help_asap/,12,2023

I'm a mechanical engineer but I have always been interested in programming, I've been in touch with programming or with things related with computers in different ways such as learning basic C++, doing industrial automation (pneumatics, PLC, etc.), vba in excel, numerical methods, CFD with Matlab and simulation with ANSYS

I was thinking about choosing a master related with computational mechanics / simulation since I already have the bachelors degree and 1y6m job experience with mechanical design/analysis.

I am currently in my sophomore year of Undergrad, and my current major is Cell and Molecular biology. I was originally planning on pursuing medicine, and am on track to graduate early, but for a multitude of reasons, like the course load being too challenging to maintain high grades in, and honestly, lack of interest in the subject matter, and motivation to pursue the fields that I am studying, I no longer think that it’s for me. I have no idea where to go from here, Psychology is somewhat interesting to me, but I am honestly stumped, and feel like I have no direction. I want to pay back my parents for all of the help they’ve given me in my college career and life as a whole, so I aspire to be in a career path with good pay. I feel like I have no motivation or discipline for education anymore, and I truly hate that my passion for learning is dissipating. I’m sure part of it is that I feel that I don’t align with the campus culture here. These aren’t my “people”, most people here live the party lifestyle, and that’s just not me, and it makes it hard to fit in besides my main friend group. I don’t feel happy here. I’ve considered transferring, but I wouldn’t have the slightest clue where to. Another monkey in the wrench is the fact that my parents are also in state, and we’re extremely close, and I don’t know if I can bring myself to leave them. I’m also worried to transfer because that would likely eliminate my ability to graduate early, so I’m not sure if I should just stick it out here to get it over with sooner.

18hv42h,Need career advice and life advice please.,"First, thank you all for reading this as I lay down on my floor in tears. I was let go from a job today for “not being the right fit”. I was working for a company through a staffing agency for around a month, when the staffing agency called me and broke the news to me this afternoon. I feel horrible about myself and keep replaying every action, decision, and  conversation that I had. I’m 27, male, have a bachelors in business and my MBA is in accounting. 

The staffing agency only told me the company told them they thought it wasn’t going to be a good fit, but the company would have told the staffing agency if I had done something wrong. Apparently the staffing agency only helps people who are “employable” lol. The staffing agency contact keeps telling me over and over again I didn’t do anything wrong or else they wouldn’t help me anymore lol. So I guess that’s the only positive thing. They said it happens all the time within staffing agencies and not take it personal lol. 

I have been let go at another job in the past for a political issue that was very much in my control, and I handled it poorly. I regret that and have learned from it. I’ve had around 5 jobs my entire life, been let go from one I guess technically since I’m still employed by the staffing agency lol. The other ones I took upward promotions at different places. I have previous experience in operational management, budgeting, logistics, credit analyzation, investigations, payment plans, customer service oriented roles in general. 

Wooo, go me lol. Idk where I’m going in life, I was an athlete, team oriented, discipline, hard work, very personable and kind/gentle hearted person. I guess I haven’t moved on from my past properly. I’m just so lost and confused, I want to reach out to my supervisor and ask for feedback, but probably a bad idea lol. I have another job lined up with the state government where I live, I’m just waiting on an official start date, but with government work it’s pretty much hurry up and wait lol. So I probably won’t be able to start until after the holidays. I’m praying for guidance and understanding, this really hurt me. Maybe I’m just overthinking it and it’s not even in the same universe 60 years from now. The lady who is my poc at my staffing agency told me she could tell how kindhearted and sweet I was and to not take it personal.

18huitb,Project Manager moving to US from the UK,"Hey guys,

Just looking for some guidance/opinions/help. I am currently in the process of moving from the UK to the US to join my fiancé and not sure what companies look for or require for jobs as a project manager. 

Some background for reference. I have worked for the same company for 14 years. The company is a defence/aerospace engineering company. I started at 16 as an apprentice and have worked across many different areas of the business. From being in manufacturing on the tools/workshop. From being in engineering as a Test Engineer, to my current position as Project Manager which I’ve held for 3 years.

So this is where my questions start. Although I have a HND (higher national diploma) from college here in the UK, I do NOT have a university degree. Will this hold me back from getting positions as a Project Manager in the US despite 3 years of experience and combined 14 years experience in an engineering environment?

Is there any potential online courses I could do prior to my move to the US to make myself more employable?

All help is greatly appreciated.",ormi11,1,1.0,0,1702510241,2023-12-13 23:30:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18huitb/project_manager_moving_to_us_from_the_uk/,12,2023

18hssd5,Complaint,"Should I be worried?
 Had an audit conducted at my place of work. An internal one. Have fully passed all my previous internal ones with no issues and flying colours so to say.

Expect this audit was conducted by a person I've have never met before. Her behaviour during the whole thing was appalling and unprofessional. She reported multiple things that are not true.( I do have proof of all of this, all emails and dated pictures and documents) and just the way she spoke to me the whole time. I reported her to my superior.And they are starting an investigation. 

I'm not worried about the actual audit as I have said I have proof of everything. I'm more worried about office politics and being labelled as a problem to deal with. As I am the newest employee( Just under a year) and I am already putting in a complaint like this.

I don't know what to think of it as I am always trying to avoid all office politics. Should I be worried or am I just overreacting?",veki2020,2,1.0,0,1702505729,2023-12-13 22:15:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18hssd5/complaint/,12,2023

18hsb6c,Do I ask to be laid off?,"Background: 
So I’m working in a field that I dread and I’m looking to make a career change in the next few months if all things go accordingly. I’m currently in a school that would fill all the requirements I need for the next job. I should be done with the schooling in the next six months but I’m getting pretty slammed timewise with my current gig which keeps pushing all of this back. It’s become very difficult to pursue my next step. 

Recently:
Today, I met with my manager who straight up asked me how I was feeling about my career right now and was trying to get a feel for where I was at mentally. It was almost like he knew or could sense what was going on(which he 100 percent has zero idea). He was also mentioning how things aren’t moving forward like they need to be and how it’s not neccesarily my fault as he hasn’t been present due to corporate BS among other things; this is very much true because I’ve definitely lacked leadership while growing in my position. He then expressed the reality that the company might end up moving a different direction externally for my role. Overall, he’s honestly a pretty solid dude who wants what’s best for me or at least comes off that way. 

Question:
Given my situation of not having enough time to pursue my dreams and things being pushed back(I’m about a year and counting behind my original plan), should I sit down with him and tell him about how I’m planning on making a career change as this current role just isn’t meant for me? I was thinking about maybe hinting at the idea of asking him to lay me off but I’m not so sure of how I’d ask. I’d rather not quit for obvious reasons(mostly money). Also, I don’t think that getting fired or layed off would hurt me in the long run as this career change would be a completely different field entirely. In addition to that, I’ve been networking and already have my next gig lined up once I finish the schooling for it. 

Let me know what you guys think. I greatly appreciate the advice ahead of time. If you want more context, shoot me a PM. I’d rather be a bit more discreet in this post.",solace_infinity,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1702504525,2023-12-13 21:55:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18hsb6c/do_i_ask_to_be_laid_off/,12,2023

18hs2lb,Looking for advice- Unsure of major and career path,"Hey guys, I'm heading into my fourth semester of collage in a month as an Electrical Engineering major and I've just come to the conclusion that after this last semester I don't really want to be doing it for the rest of my life. I come to you guys just to dump things I'd love to have in a job and see if there would be a match for me. Ultimately what it comes down to is that I love learning and doing new things, and I just don't want a career in which I'd be doing one thing, however interesting it may be, for the rest of my life.

  
I've always loved math and science and it's always been something I'm naturally good at, which is what attracted me towards engineering. But I'm also a super social person, and no offense to engineers I'm one of you, I just don't think they're very similar to me in that regard. I want a job where I can socially interact with people, whether it's a customer or a coworker, an example would be something like consulting where you interface with a customer then work with others on a solution. But I would also love to do work that is in many different fields to keep things fresh. So I'm wondering if there is a job like that where you're hired to work with a company temporarily on a project that could be in any field. I'm far enough into engineering to realize that it's math that's truly behind everything in science, so if there's a job that is able to do math within many different fields such as working with a health company with CAT scan machines to use linear equations to reconstruct images, then later working with a microbiology company to express the growth in a petri dish over time using logistic growth models.

  
In conclusion, are there careers in mathematics that involve working in many different fields to perform the math required to complete their respective issue. Sorry if this seemed ramble-y but I'm thinking a lot about what I want to do in life and have come to the conclusion that working in different fields would keeps things fresh and less stale.

18hr021,Musical Theatre and Nonprofit Management Degrees leading nowhere?,"Hi. I should start by saying that I do have a decent job working as an Executive Assistant for a nonprofit in PA. I make around 46k, which is less than I made in the corporate work but more than I made while working in the arts. I love my job's social advocacy work and the job does have pretty amazing PTO, life insurance, travel reimbursement, etc. benefits. 

With that in mind, I just finished my degree in nonprofit management, and I can't help but look ahead as to what my future is in the field. My background in the nonprofit sector really started when I worked in nonprofit theaters. However, after Covid, I transitioned into social services as that was an area that was hiring at the time. My concern is that there isnt really consistency in my career path now. I went from a theatre apprentice >admin associate >admin project manager >executive assistant. What I'm asking is... how can I move to a Chief of Staff, Manager, and eventually VP position from an EA? 

Important to Note: In the nonprofit sector, the main areas are development, grants, finance, HR, Program operations and executive leadership. DEI and Policy are also invested in depending on the type of nonprofit. Being that I don't currently fit into any niche, advice would be greatly appreciated in getting my foot in the door.

18hqv9z,Is my career over? (any advice is greatly appreciated),"So here I am, I’m 25 and have one more semester left in college and wondering if my career is over already.

I work in Finance and was at a life insurance/brokerage firm during college and tbh their business practices weren’t the best at times but it was my first job so I didn’t really have anything to compare it to. Anyways, I got all of my licenses through this firm while being a full time student and during that time I unfortunately was in a situation where I was charged with a DUI while waiting for my roommate to come pick me up in a bar parking lot. The judge decided it was entrapment because of how long the officer waited in the parking lot for last call at said bar and decided to dismiss my case which was fine.

Where this comes into play is that I informed my boss about it the day after I was charged and he chose to keep it a secret from HR which honestly I didn’t know about. Cut to a few months later and HR finds out on their own so my boss tells me we’re going to call HR and report it now to get ahead of it. We tell HR what happened and they do an investigation and I’m fired for “not reporting the charge to HR.” I told them I informed my boss about it but he denied knowing anything about it and nothing was in writing (before you ask, yes I spoke to a lawyer and they’re a billion dollar company, with nothing in writing it’s over before it starts and would just cost me $10k or more).

So anyway, in the finance industry there’s this thing called a U5 which is basically a permanent record that shows all past financial employers and if you were terminated. I got another job at a call center role dealing with annuities with no upward mobility to hold myself over thankfully.

But recently I went to apply at a different firm that had some upward momentum and I was open and honest about this the whole 3 interview process. 3 days before my start date they took back the job offer and said it was because of my firing from my old firm (mind you I’d already been past my 2 week notice so they let me quit my job before telling me this).

I asked some other friends in the industry around my age and they asked their bosses about my situation and they talked to their HR department and heard the same kinda thing back. Firstly idk how this isn’t defamation of some kind and secondly I have no idea what to do at this point. I feel completely lost and like I’m dead in the water. I’m applying places and trying to stay positive but it really feels like I’m fucked.

Any advice or has anyone ever been in a situation like this before?",MagnumJimmy44,2,0.6000000238418579,2,1702500751,2023-12-13 20:52:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18hqv9z/is_my_career_over_any_advice_is_greatly/,12,2023
18hqcvp,Have an offer from a ‘toxic company’. Should I accept?,"I’ve managed to get an offer for a job which I haven’t accepted yet - I’ve got until Friday to decide. I haven’t told any of my colleagues but have subtly dropped this company in conversation with my more senior & experienced colleagues.

I keep hearing my more senior colleagues say it’s toxic, has a bad reputation, that ‘they know people who’ve worked there and hated it’, has a bullying culture etc.

I happened to come across a content creator in my line of work on YouTube who quit a few months ago. They made a YouTube video about quitting a toxic workplace.

18hqb09,I was just invited to a second interview with a small company despite the salary range discussed in round 1 being below what I am asking.,"Good day! I'll get straight to the point:

I (34M) had an interview with a small company based in a major US city 2 weeks ago. It went very well, over the scheduled time of an hour. The only bump was at the very end we discussed salary. It was still cordial, but the salary range I'm seeking is about 15K higher then the top of the range they quoted. I'm trying not to be too specific but we are talking around the 100k mark. They made a comment about maybe they could see if there was room to go higher, but that was the end of discussing it. After the call, I was a bit disappointed because I really liked the role and the interviewer was very nice. I still sent an email afterwards thanking them and to reach out for further info.

I wasn't excepting to go further, but today I got asked for a second interview! The second interview is in-person and involves a small skill test (I am in a creative field). However, the invitation did not mention anything addressing the difference in our expected salary ranges. While I like the idea of working there and the role, I'm not so sure about coming in person and doing a skills test when I don't know If they can come closer to my range.

Should I go ahead and ask if there has been discussion about if they have flexibility in pay or benefits before I agree? Should I just do the second interview or should I bow out? What approach makes the most sense here?

18hpowy,Double Whammy Dead-End Degrees: Psych BA & Theatre Degree - What Next?,"Hey pals! Big time of reflection for a lot of folks I'm sure, so I'm hoping y'all could help guide.

I'm nearing 30, sitting on a Psych + Speech Communication BA and a Theatre Degree, and I'm struggling to figure out what I can do going forward. Growing up I was light on work experience, living in a ""focus on school"" household, though not extremely strict, and with acting, my professional resume has just been full of huge gaps. I really wanted to study behavior after some experience with therapy in my teens (MDD), so I went into a Psych BA thinking either counseling or law in the future. During my studies I... got sidetracked by performing in plays on campus... and that steered me into wanting to pursue acting professionally. As a result however my final GPA was an underwhelming 2.8ish.

Fast forward, I was so excited, I went to theatre school and came out a changed person - I had direction (literally), I had friends and peers and mentors who all believed in me, and sure enough I ended up working in a few commercials and TV series' that paid my bills for a couple years. All the while, I've been living with my parents, and have been working part-time as a barista since then. Now with the SAG-AFTRA strike ending, I'm not feeling overly confident in the longevity of acting, or frankly a lot of other artistic pursuits, after the rushed rollout of AI. On the side during COVID when I wasn't working towards acting, I taught myself Adobe suite and started poking around at graphic/UX design, and really fell in love with branding and brand strategy as I worked on naming and logo development.

At work I love the coworkers and the ""everyone is here to sling beans and get through the day"" teamwork mentality, but while I'm decent at customer service, the mask is hard to put on some days. Ideally I would love to work for a non-profit (though I'm obviously wary of the industrial complex) but I could also work toward corporate. I hope to end up in a role where I can be a person-in-the-chair, supporting others to help meet their needs, hopefully in order to create or facilitate public good. In my worksona I'm a helpful little gnome (truly I would love to be a butler), but intellectually I think I've retained a unique brand of outside the box thinking and strategic problem solving from theatre school, and I'm keen on using my actual critically-thinking brain in my work. Otherwise I love doing little menial tasks, the grunt work no one else likes (from cleaning bathrooms to organizing a spreadsheet), and I really just like to help others thrive while trying to work toward global good.

I'm not against going back to school entirely or enrolling in continuing education, and in fact would love a change of scenery and routine, but I'm just not sure what the move is going forward. I have skills, I'm educated even if it feels like a lifetime ago, but I cannot seem to move out of my hole.

18hnr8g,Sketchy boss/owner,"Our payroll was set up incorrectly by our software team when we switched over to a new software. The way they set it up was regular working hours could total up to 1 hour, after that 1 hour it was considered OT. With this, it calculated to staffs checks being 2 hours short every week. After the owner looked into it when staff was complaining about working 80 hours but being paid 76 she saw the discrepancy. She refuses to tell the staff and said that all of those hours and checks have already passed so she won't go back and pay them for the hours. I'm directly under her and she basically is telling me to keep it hushed. I'm not comfortable with this and am looking for advice to next steps. She is an owner of a franchise. My questions:
• Do I tell the staff?
• Who can I report this to?
• Is she right in saying she doesn't have to go back and pay the hours?

18hnna2,Career Switch Dilemma,"Why is making a decision so tough?! 

I work for a state agency. I love what I do (I'm a secretary for a unit director). I love my hybrid schedule (M-W in office and Th-Fr remote). However, I need more money because times are tough and hubby and I want to save for a home and for our future family. I am eligible for a promotion. There are none in my unit so I'm applying elsewhere within my agency and other state agencies. 

Here's the issue. Being a secretary for 6 months, my boss has gotten used to me. I help her remember all the things she forgot and keep her schedule organized. Everyday I ask if there's anything I can do to help her and she usually says she doesn't have anything. I'm bored most of the day. I've taken over 100 professional development courses (most required but the rest are elective) over the 6 months and I have learned Microsoft Suite. I feel bad for leaving or taking steps to leave because I know her efficiency rests on me. 

I don't really care for my coworkers, I don't like my work hours and I don't like being bored at work. My husband thinks I should ask for a promotion so I can stay there but I've asked for a promotion before in another state agency and it turned really bad for me. 

I'm conflicted if I should ask my boss about receiving a promotion or if I should just keep applying based off my reservations that I have in the position and of the unit?

18hllev,Help me here: BI vs DA vs DS (What should I do?),"Hi guys,  
I’m a data engineer trainee on a company.  
The environment is great, and I’m learning a lot. The thing is, the three months of academy/teaching they are teaching us different kind of skills: BI/Data engineer and Data Science. They are going to put me on the BI team but this week the BI team leader saw me doing some data science work that I was supposed to present this week in the data science class (GEN AI with colleagues) and asked me if I wanted to go to work with the data science team in January, and not in BI.  
The thing is: it’s been very interesting to do AI projects with my colleagues and to learn more about machine learning and AI.  
At this point I really don’t know what I should do.  
Accept or don’t Accept? I’m interesting in learning more about data, SQL and stuff, but I see that is more exciting to work with python, torch, gen ai, computer vision, etc.  
The thing is my mental health has spikes and I had some burnouts before, I’m afraid in the future I could get one.  
And I don’t come from an area of mathematics or engineer. I took Science Information as my degree and master in management. And I took a BI course in the last company where I took a burnout.  
So this is a question that is making me think because I don’t know if to be a data science we really need math at the very end.  
The 2nd month is already finishing and I still know very little of python, and other data science stuff. But it’s interesting, really is.  
So I would like to receive some advice from you guys.  
How’s the area of data Science? Has more jobs than DA? Is the machine learning really the future? Do you see people getting from other areas making good employees of DS/ML?  
Or do you think DA is the future? And in the future DA will also do DS jobs?  
I really want to know what do you think.  
By my side, even if they don’t put me in and I stay on BI I will take machine learning courses and still studying on weekends and on free time. Specially AI because I would to explore more on a video games or video related. (This is not because I’m prepared to go to the area, but because I’m interested in learning more, and I think it could be a way of getting into the video game industry. But as always, sometimes we want something and we don’t get. That’s why I want to take small steps.)  
My most fear here is I’m afraid to fail if I accept, or take too long to learn, and put the work that the company does at stake.  
Really would be helpful if you could give me some tips.",Common_Status6647,1,1.0,0,1702487289,2023-12-13 17:08:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18hllev/help_me_here_bi_vs_da_vs_ds_what_should_i_do/,12,2023
18hjrny,Went to HR…Help?,"Ok i have been at this company 2 years. the second day on the job, my team lead took me out to lunch and talked smack about EVERYONE on our team. i should’ve said something then, but i was so happy about my job and gave her the benefit of the doubt. fast forward to 2 months ago, and it turned out to be an everyday thing. this person had played all of us on our team against each other, and it all came to the surface one day. i ended up going to HR because I was going home having panic attacks. this person (lead) would tell me constantly that she had gotten everyone she didn’t like on the team fired before, so i felt like my people pleasing would come up thinking i had to kiss this person’s ass (but i would go home feeling so conflicted because of how toxic that environment is). so we all on the team ended up going to HR…. and now nobody talks to me on the team, but they all are super buddy-buddy with the lead now. it’s very blatant and confusing. i don’t understand what i am doing (there are rumors going around about me that are completely untrue. and we’re going around before i went to HR..:HR won’t do anything about it…they told me that it’s their opinion and I have to let it go).

this all feels so highschool, to be completely honest, but i am having a really hard time just going to work and feeling positive and good about my job.

18hjfqn,What sort of career fields come to mind when seeing this list of skills / traits?,"Hello all! I am being let go from my job at the end of December. My wife and I both feel this is an opportunity to step back and evaluate what sort of role or career would fit my skill / traits / strengths. 

Honestly, I'm a bit of an ""everyman"" meaning I can do a whole lot of things well yet I wouldn't be considered an ""expert"" anywhere. Because of this, there's not an obvious field or career (at least in my mind) that I *really* want to be part of.  I thought my current job was going to be it, but it turns out I was mistaken.  During my year at the company, we did really well - record revenue and profit - but the owner is making some structural changes that pretty much eliminate my position.  

For additional context, here are things I've done in the past 10 years:

* COO / Integrator (current job, 1+ years) - in charge of making all the major parts of the business fit together seamlessly (sales, marketing, finance, operations, etc).  Also in charge of day to day operations to free up others to generate more revenue.
* P&C insurance sales manager (6 years) - essentially what most people think of as an insurance agent but with the added responsibility of training and helping the sales team improve
* College ministry (5 years)

Last night, my wife and I made a list of skills / traits / strengths we both feel I have.  I realize there's probably not one field or role that checks all these boxes, but I thought I'd ask the good people of Reddit if anything comes to mind.    

What career fields come to mind seeing the list below?

* Team building
   * Making everyone feel appreciated, heard and getting everyone on the same page
   * Goal-setting (challenging yet attainable goals) for myself and others
* “The window and the mirror” leadership (from the book Good to Great)
   * Servant leadership
* Integrate different parts of the business to work together seamlessly
* Handling money / making budgets and forecasts
* Goal-setting
   * Zooming out to keep the big picture in mind (vision of the org)
   * Zooming in to find next actionable steps to get to those goals
* Teaching / training / coaching
   * Explaining complex concepts in a simple way (think ELI5)
* Conducting (non-scientific) research
   * For understanding concepts
   * For doing deep dives on products to understand what makes the most sense for the business
* Loyal
* Hard working
* Good in a crisis
   * Take what might feel overwhelming and making good decisions quickly (or even with limited information)
   * Figuring out what to act on
* Organizing / systematizing a mess (whether physical mess like documents or mess of date)
   * I am not a data scientist by any means though.
* Automating processes to increase efficiency
* Sense of adventure / learning new cultures

Recently I have been arguing with myself about which path should I take to make it to the market and find an internship in that specific field.

I also have learned Python, C++ and Java but never made any projects with them; Mostly I used these languages to solve algorithmic problems on Leetcode and Codewars. I also have done HTML/CSS and made some basic projects with them, along with Javascript. I’ve been contemplating which one of these paths I should follow.

18hi1jl,I want to fix my career,"IWTL to fix my career

Greetings all, This is a very long post. Please read only if you have the time. 

I am 36 and I have done so many things I am so lost. I dont regret my moves but financially i am hurt. I want to be in a better position. 

My experience
2003 to 2005 
Helped with marketing of various brands, I was in school so small jobs like giving away pamphlets, face to face sales, customer service at an event. Etc

2009 - 2012 
Started as a software engineer, and got promoted to senior systems engineer. I was part of a team that did programming for an insurance application. 

2012 - 2015 
I quit IT, as I was literally working from 7am to 11pm travel to and from home also included. My days were gone just like that. And bad work culture made me hate it, I joined as an associate HR in the immigration department. I prepared documents for the employees who had to travel on work visas. I also started developing an interest in photography. 

2014 - 2015 
After picking up photography, I started working as a pub photographer after my day job as an immigration associate.

2015 - 2016 
I finally made the move out of corporate. I juggled between three jobs, in the mornings I used to work as a language interpreter and research assistant. PhD doing students needed assistance with their projects in the field. And in the nights, as a pub photographer. Weekends, I was a trek leader taking people trekking to different locations. I also ventured into wedding photography and doing photo workshops as time went on.

2016 - 2017
I got the opportunity to work with Airbnb as a host acquisition specialist, finding new hosts and onboarding them to the platform. This allowed to follow photography as a passion at the different places Airbnb took me. 

2017 - 2019
During my time with Airbnb, it took me to beautiful locations to work. I fell in love with one location and decided to stay there. I started working as a host for a backpacker's hostel. Slowly moved to 3 star boutique hotel as a guest engagement personnel to engage with the guests, digital consultant to start their social media with creating content, and their in house naturalist. My interest in nature has vastly improved during my photography journey. 

2019 - 2020
Moved back to corporate world as I was running out money doing passion jobs. This time worked for a photography firm called Meero. I helped them set base being their first employee, did supply acquisition by onboarding new photographers. Later trained the photographers, and kept at an eye on the photoshoots conducted globally as a producer. 

2020
Started working as tour guide accompanying tourists and making sure everything was smooth. 

Covid hid, I quickly trained myself in 360 photography and the world of virtual tours, did 360 photography of many spaces and created virtual tours. But it was difficult to sustain as a freelancer. 

2022
Due to my experience in tourism, i got the opportunity to work as a consultant for two new accommodation facilities from scratch and making sure it is operational. From creating time shifts for the staff, to creating experiences for the guest to making a standard food menu and also overseeing the social media for them. 

2023
I had to move to new country from India to Poland due to marriage, I thought this an opportunity and opted to study a basic course in Filmmaking. And ended up working at a lighting equipment rental. As a part time I also work as a game host for tourists. And currently also as a delivery driver. 


After moving to a new country, I have found it difficult to start over again. But yes I have the opportunity to start over again. After multiple thoughts, I am thinking of getting back into technology. I just don't know where to start again. I am curious about data analytics and cyber security. 

What else do you think I can do, my decisions are not completely impulsive but also because of financial situations I had to choose something that gave me money. I couldn't sustain running behind my passion most of the time. 

Being clouded now, your inputs can help.

What I found out after she became my direct report, is that she is making 3% more than me per hour. I have read other posts in this forum about how managers should not always make more than direct reports (especially in fields like programming etc.) but in this situation, I feel like I should be making more than her given she stepped down from the role I stepped into. We've also been with the company for almost the same amount of time and have the same exact skill set, as we are both pharmacists.

I just started this job in August and its honestly been a great experience. I have a really great manager whose been supportive.

18hhgvk,"Stay with current, great company or take a risk to make more?","Hello all! New to the sun. I work in a position as a real estate accessory. I make a little over $20/hr. We’ve had a few rounds of layoffs this year, as the housing industry clearly isnt great. I dont believe I would be subject to a layoff. My management is great. Schedule flexibility is amazing. I get 27 paid days off a year (that counts my vacation time). If I want to call in sick, I can. No questions asked. Have to leave early? Never an issue. Everything about this job is great, other than my pay. We do get OT when we are busy. But, things haven’t been busy over the last 1 year + and probably won’t be for another 1 year +. 

I have an opportunity to work for the State (NY). I would be a transit bus driver. Do I want to drive public transportation? Not particularly. I’m a single father of a 13 year old that can be comfortable when I work OT, but feel like I struggle a bit when we are just making base pay. I would get a pension and $7/hr. The base rate to drive is $27.86. I’m not entirely sure about OT availability yet. 

I’m conflicted. Not taking Ot into account (since it’s never a guarantee) I would make about $18k more per year. My $20 currently is 37.5 hours worked a week. The $27.86 would be at least 40 hours. 

Is leaving a workplace that I absolutely love worth $18k? My drive to work really wouldn’t be any different. It’s clear the $18k increase would come along with working nights, weekends, and holidays until I build up seniority. I don’t really have anywhere to go “up” when it comes to my current company. They aren’t giving out raises and I’m not getting a promotion.

18hhe4k,[NY]Terminated: Offered severance package but no ‘Record Of Employment’ aka form IA 12.3,"Was recently terminated (communication was the issue discussed verbally, performance related issues was the “cause” on severance paper)

Was never provided a Record of Employment (Form IA 12.3) new law that went in effect in November that mandates employer to provide the filled out form to employee regarding unemployment benefits.

There is no discussion of being contested for unemployment insurance on severance package. Just the typical waiving your rights to sue them and not eligible for rehire.

But also states that if I take the package, all compensation (whatsoever) and other payments due have been paid in full.

2)Can’t seem to find the penalties for failure to comply with providing Form IA 12.3
3)Was terminated mid day, will I be compensated for the whole day?

18hfs30,I lost my job and might lose everything,"This is my first reddit post I’m making just to get write down all the things that are going on and maybe get some helpful advice.

First let me explain my situation, I’m a 21-year-old guy who is less than average on all categories and I have a family who have literally raised me perfectly where they let me make my decisions in life in terms of career path and have been nothing but supportive. In my house when my or my sister have exams we get treated by royalty and my parents make sure that we have all we could ask for so that we can study, and my dad has been working all the time as long as I can remember for us. Basically, I never had to worry about food, shelter or any real struggles.

I have always wanted to become a police officer and that’s what I have been working towards after school finished. Fast forwards to me being 20, I’m working in a bakery as a supervisor while my application to join the police is still ongoing and I meet the love of my life. Let’s call her Steph. She joined also as a supervisor in the bakery 2 weeks after I joined, and we instantly had a deep connection. I’ve never had a partner before, and I was very inexperienced, but everything was so perfect in every way I couldn’t believe how lucky I had gotten. We fell in love, and we talked about how we would marry each other and have a family together one day and made all these promises and plans and that’s what we worked towards. I should mention she was also looking to join the police but in a different police force. Steph and I would see each other all the time and talk about everything and I learned of the extremely difficult environment she grew up in and how she lives alone in a shared house. I saw how amazing and innocent and perfect Steph was and how more so than anyone she deserves happiness and a good life, and I aspired to be that man she wanted me to be for her.

Eventually, we were both successful in our applications and joined our police forces while still seeing each other all of the time. My parents know that I am below average at everything and although to me everything seemed perfect as I had the perfect girlfriend and training for the perfect job, my parents warned me to stop seeing her, messaging her all the time and get my head more into the job I was in as my career is obviously very important. Again, I was given the perfect conditions for everything, and I never had to worry about much at all.  But I stayed upset about why my parents don’t approve of my partner and would always think about how I can move out with her which my parents were strongly against. Meanwhile, Steph who was living alone and in a police force whose training was several times harder than the one I was in, was in the top 5 of her class in exams and during the training she had to move houses, she lost her grandpa and she was battling with loneliness. She has always wanted us to move in together and has struggled from being alone but has been so understanding and patient with me.

Eventually our training moved on to the next stage where we would go out in the streets under experienced police officers and had to complete a portfolio of policing until we became qualified police officers. I loved the police work even more than I thought I would I felt like I was made for it and I had so much fun on each and every call we would attend and had couldn’t get enough of it. Everything was going to be perfect, after this phase me and Steph would have the same schedule and would get 4 days off together after every set of working days and we would share stories and it would be great. But at the same time my stresses about moving in with Steph and making my parents somehow like her as expected got in the way and I was warned time and time again that I was not doing good, and I am not safe for the streets the way I am.  Eventually as my parents had warned me, I was fired from my job. Steph passed this stage and is now a qualified police officer.

The shock of losing this job which I really really loved so much I honestly can’t think of a job I would rather do was overbearing. I told Steph that the officers never liked me, and I was targeted and not given a chance to progress and the time ran out for the training period so they fired me. I told my parents the truth.

I want to join the Police force again but this time the one Steph joined as it covers the area I know and grew up in as well as the fact that I can’t join this force again. My parents are saying that this is what I should do but this time I need to focus on my work and stop thinking so much about the other stuff. They said I can try to hide it but everyone can see I’ve been so stressed this past couple of months trying to get all of these things to work that I’m losing weight, my face is getting slimmer etc. They say that I am being used by Steph and if she really loved me, she would give me space to grow my career as this part of my life should be about, not stressing so much as I will regret wasting this time later on in my life. Steph absolutely doesn’t want me to join the police again. She says she wants to quit the job as well and has a plan to become a nail technician, but we need to live together first. She says we need to focus on us this year and move in together and settle in and then you can join the police again. This went back and forth with me not being able to make up my mind for a while. A couple of days ago after spending the day with Steph I told her I really do want to join the police and after trying to convince me out of it for a while she cried. And I don’t mean the normal crying, she cried deeply and so painfully for longer than an hour and seemed completely given up, saying that she wants everything to end already, and she can’t take it anymore. I know it’s so hard on her having to go through everything she goes through alone while I have a family and the only one, she has to even speak to is me. I honestly do love her so so much and I want to have a family with her but she doesn’t want me to join the police as it would mean 2 years of not living together and wants me to find another job until we can while my parents want me to go back into policing and build my career and after I am stable and able to stand on my own two feet I can look at moving out.

I have been so stressed because Either way I am letting someone down and another way I am giving up on something I love one way or another. I haven’t slept more than 3 hours a night since getting fired, I’m having tummy problems and last night I experienced a panic attack which was one of the most distressing things I have gone through.

Any tips, advices would help. I'm looking for something that might be like things to do before you graduate. What advantages does being a uni student offer that I can leverage max. 
To put into perspective my uni is really great, so I have ventured into consulting, robotics and finance. I have made great friends and took up leadership positions. 
I'd say I've neglected my physical health a bit during on campus tests and interviews this sem.

18hcv6z,Engineering yearly reviews,"I've been working here now for very nearly 3 years. We are having our yearly reviews and everyone in the office has already done theirs and I'm the last. And everyone else was all done a week ago.

I take this as a bad sign?

 My boss told me I needed to work more on mine to brag about myself more. I think I've done a damn good job at doing my job. But I haven't had the time to do ""extra""  projects to help the company develop or grow. Or used personal time or personal $ to learn, train, or teach myself new skills. I don't have the time, energy, or extra $ to do that. 


What I'm feel like I've been doing instead on my ""extra"" projects is I'm picking up other coworkers or my managers slack when it comes to following processes and procedures. They are not keeping their task management up to date or keeping our standards up to date when they change. It falls on me working across multiple departments to do it whenever I shift back to one department or the other and my designs get marked up by the boss for not following the new standards. Nobody communicates to me on the changes of standards, not coworkers or the managers, but the changes are also not documented either. 

Last year I got a bonus, a raise, and praise from my boss. This year my newly hired manager is a prick, throws me under the bus, and belittles me every chance he gets. I have gotten zero direct feedback from the boss, I think he wants to be more hands off chain of command type thing as his company grows. Zero positive feedback from the manager, just that I take too much time on projects. And zero direction from anyone, especially when it comes to what direction my ""extra"" work should go. 

I'm feeling paranoid about my review and hoping for words of insight. I hope I can find a new job because I don't feel like I fit in anymore with this company but I don't feel like I have anywhere to go.",ThatNVguy,1,1.0,1,1702458875,2023-12-13 09:14:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18hcv6z/engineering_yearly_reviews/,12,2023

Enter: my manager. She grew from Junior to Head of in like 2 years, she's quite young and not very vocal. There were many situations where I noticed she doesn't like rocking the boat much or challenge the status quo. She's very agreeable. In terms of hard skills, she has a big way to grow (e.g. leadership, team building, Design Ops, it amazed me how she doesn't also know Figma...)  
Enter: me. I'm quite outspoken in general, and am rather transparent as a person, and can be pretty vocal.  
Now, I've noticed a thing: that my manager kind of ""uses"" my voice and pushes me to leave feedback, be ""the one who vocalizes things"" instead of doing it herself. I don't mind being outspoken when I choose what to be outspoken on -- but I don't like feeling that my being vocal is being sort of weaponized to serve the needs of other people. I feel like she's using me to stay low and not having to rock the boat much herself but using me to do this work for her.  
I don't like feeling like a tool :(

18hbk8e,Should I take the offer?,"
I was offered a job offer that feels tempting. I did a very informal interview with the COO and was texting the CEO, I was referred by an old colleague that worked with me at my current job.

My current job: 
-hybrid I commute 1.5 hrs one way 2x per week. WFH 3 days a week. 
-hours are semi flexible
-company is very stable and continues to grow (job security) 
-81k salary 
-3% 401k match 
-full benefits (pricey side) 
-501c non profit


Job offer: 
-I would commute daily 1 hour one way 5x a week -hours are straight forward 
-newer organization
-was referred by a old colleague from my current company who left 1 yr ago 
-103k salary (this includes a $250/monthly commuter stipend) 
-6% 401k match -full benefits w/company paying 50% 
-for profit company


Thoughts?? Initially I was turned off by the commuting daily but I'll be honest and say that I'm new in my career so taking these new opportunities feels a bit risky or maybe not? 

I’ll add that I’m a single mom/widow to an 8 yr old boy (became widow/single mom when my son was 4 months old)- my mom lives with me rent-free in exchange to help me picking up& watching my son, I bought my house 2 years ago and not looking to relocate.",123Vs,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1702453040,2023-12-13 07:37:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18hbk8e/should_i_take_the_offer/,12,2023

18h986g,Weighing between a reputable PR/advertising degree versus a communication studies degree,"Hey there,

  
So I go to a southern school that's pretty good at football and loves dogs which has a pretty good PR/Advertising program. This program requires approval to get in and the coursework must be done in at least 4 semesters. Otherwise, there is communication studies which seems to focus on intercultural and business communication as well as rhetoric and debate. While I am open to careers outside of PR, it is something I am very interested in and therefor want to ask for some advice here. 

  
I can either finish school in a year with communication studies, or potentially get accepted for NEXT fall for PR/advertising and then from then on, spend at least 2 more years in school. 

  
I know that if I do communications, I would likely have to get internship experience to get a decent job after graduating, which I'm trying to do.

  
I guess I would just like to know if a reputable program with a strong alumni community and more focused classes would be more worthwhile in spite of the extra time and money.

Our company hired a temporary HR admin to help clear up the mess and get our processes streamlined, at this time I was very fresh and dipping my toes into the HR side of things.

I found out after the temporary lady messaged me on my day off, that they offered her a full time position before her contract ended.

When there is a meeting or gathering talking about how to improve client work I feel like I don’t have anything to add because my teammate already considering everything. I feel like I’m imposter. He has more years of work experience and working with different clients than me. 

I’m talking with my therapist about this already because it may sound cliche to you but in my childhood my father, friends always beats me and bully me and calling me “useless”, “you cannot do anything” because i was silent and introverted.

18h3r4x,What degrees are the Gold Standard when looking for Jobs that make 80k-100k?,"Let me explain my question,

I have some friends that have degrees in Computer engineering and Software engineering. They told me that ''''''Computer Science''''''''' is a degree that hiring managers look for and mostly preferrer since how broad it is.

Computer science is seen as the Gold standard as well.

Same thing does for having a """"""""""""""Mechanical Engineering Degree """"""""""""""over an Automotive engineering Degree. 

A Mechanical Engineering Degree is seen as the """"""""""Gold Standard"""""""""" as well.

&#x200B;

So for a 22 year old male dropout looking to get back into college and get a degree. What majors generally have more job security and are the preferred(Gold Standard) in that field. And the suggestion doesn't have to be a STEM degree either it can be anything. 

&#x200B;

Looking to end up working a job that makes 80k-100k with a bachelors or masters. (But not in medicine)

Any suggestion or advice would be appreciated. Thank you ;).

18h3q45,Unsure if I want to pursue a career in finance,"Long story short, I am a recent high school graduate and have to put in my course preferences by today. I have a great interest in the field of commerce, specifically finance and accounting but have heard the horror stories about having to work 80+ hours a week at entry level jobs with minimal WLB for the first few years (at minimum). I've also been working a 9-5 office job a few days a week and found out i can't stand it, and thought this should probably put me off pursuing a career in finance since it is mostly office based. I am also considering a double degree in commerce and engineering, where I could drop one of the degrees after a year if i do not enjoy it as much. With engineering however, I do have concerns about my math and physics ability (i would need to catch up quite a bit) but would be willing to put the work in since engineering seems to have better job prospects/demand after graduating.  
To anyone working in the field of finance, would you say me hating my current receptionist job in the office an immediate sign that i shouldn't pursue anything in finance?

18h2wvz,I have this deep desire to make music at 22... should I drop out of college?,"So

I am from North Macedonia a small country in Balkans. I grew up in a small ass city like a village. They didn't teach us music there and i kinda didn't discover my talent of singing both with my sister at like 12. I'm not the best singer but i def could make songs. We used to sing in our room only nobody else knew. I wanted to have a violin but nobody ever bought me that as a kid and nobody would teach me anyway in my village. 

Also want to mention that my whole dad side of family likes music. The thing is my mom is divorced and we don't live with my dad side of family our mom raised us alone so we never were exposed ised to music. And my mom side of family hates arts. They like economic coding medicine and stable jobs like that that pay a lot cz theh are very greedy and want us to be geniuses... 

Then later we kinda forgot abt music since I didn't had the chance ""feed"" it anymore... i was an excellent student very ambitious and focused in my studies i used to study non stop.. all my mom wanted is for us to be excellent in school. 

Then i went to college. I had issues with mental health such as OCD , depression anxiety etc..

I didn't know what i wanna do. I loved biology,  i started studying medicine. I dropped out i even attended suicide at that time.. anws i was bad and lost. 

Then i started working this office job where i would work for a startup in computer.

Then i went back in college to study what.. business informatics yeah since i started working in computer and all i thought thats a good deal but i also liked psychology but didn't study that since i was very bad mentally myself and i thought i cant heal other's psychologically when i myself suffer from it... so i started studying business informatics since that would be good for leaving the country after i finish too... 

Anws started studying business informatics.. was okay at first.. now im third year and we do more coding and i learned that i fucking hate coding i swear. I also hate management...  coding doesn't fullfill me at all and i hate the process and i hate math.
And business? Im not a leader kinda person im very very empathic and emotional..

Im stuck at some classes now from last year I cant study i feel so lost and all i can think abt is why i never got the chance to make music.. can i do it now? Like all i want is to hear my song one day. Idc if it will be successful or not idc i just want to hear it and be like i created this magical thing. I wanna express myself and put all my life experiences in music. 

This would fullfill me. And the fact that we have it in our blood from my dads side makes me feel like im betraying myself for not doing anything with it.

These thoughts are making me not study. I cannot focus anymore. Nobody in the world knows i want to make a song since i never ever showed this part of me.

Now here where i study or anywhere near i can't find producers that would help me  make a song. 

I texted one but he lives in albania. If i would drop out i could go there but it's risky cz what if the song won't make me money? How will i live. Without a degree? That's why i wanna finish the degree and start to learn how to make music myself. Even tho i think this will take ages since i also am a full time student. Plus my college is 4 years ffs. 

But idk what should i do? What do yall think? It's killing me and making me so depressed. I feel too old to learn how make music.. but i will never be happy if i at least don't make 1 song...

Idk should i finish college and learn music in the side.. or drop out go live in albania and focus on music? Idkkkkkk and also my family would be so so so disappointed if i left college in my third year. Plus the degree will help me go work in germany and i also want to learn german starting from February. But oh man i can't pass my years without making any song.
It would kill me deadass.

18h119e,Please for the love everything that is holy tell me I’m not crazy by getting screwed with my comp,"I’m in software sales.

I’ve worn every hat in this fucking startup company from lead mechanical engineer >> software product manager >> sales development rep >> to now sales development rep manager where I handle all of our outbound  (we hardly get any inbound so my role is critical.) 

I manage two other SDRs and sign off on all email campaigns, target states, etc.

My compensation over the past 6 years starting my junior year of college is:

$25/ hour for 5 hours a week (as a student) doing lead mechanical engineer work as the only engineer.

$15/ hour - 20 hours / week. Took a fat pay cut to make it work for them - cuz startup.

Then out of school started at $55k/ year as lead and only mechanical engineer. Delivered above and beyond.

Then because we stopped hardware work all together because entire company pivoted - I moved to role of product manager where I oversaw and lead operations for our software team of 3 guys. On top of that I did Q/A, traveled to trade shows, and overall put out fires in every area of the company.

Last year I brought in $60k after fees of ERC to my company because they couldn’t figure out on their own.

I also brought in $20k in grant funding.

- that $80k net brought me $0 bonus and $0 commission even though it was never even asked of me to bring that value.

This year, I told them I’ve been killing the game with cold outreach for my side hustle so I told them I could help do sales (it was needed badly)

So now I’m 6 months into this. I’ve brought in $1 million fucking dollars in revenue from chasing the leads, doing discovery calls, booking the demo, RUNNING and being a part of demo, and being a part of 90% of all quote review meetings and working with client to answer any questions since I have so much experience with the software from the ground up and relatable industry experience.

All that to say my commission on $1mil on top of eating shit for years with my tiny bit of equity - I will make $11-12k in total bonus comp.

My current salary is $75k annual base and I know that the sales execs make more than me. 

We have some weird as fuck socialist commission structure where I make 1% / deal closed plus like $150 cash on successful demo. 

Each of the 4 execs make 3% each on ALLLL REVENUE regardless of who brought in.

By the way… I only book deals with one exec because we cover west coast. So he gets 3% the other 3 dead weight execs get 3% on no value added to our deals and I get a measly 1%.

Effectively $90k in commission is going to 3 reps who did nothing off of my sweat work.

18gybhf,Pursue MBA or wait and change jobs?,"Hello everyone!!

I am here for some career advice. 

Background: 
- 26 years old 
- current position: manufacturing engineer at a large aerospace company 
- undergrad: BSME 
- professional experience <2 yrs 

So here’s my question. I am currently working for a top aerospace/defense company. They offer an employee tuition program that will cover my graduate degree. 
I have applied to a local MBA program that will take me 2.5 yrs to complete part time. After which I owe 2 yrs to the company so that I don’t need to pay back any tuition. I can leave earlier but will need to pay some tuition and could potentially leverage a sign on bonus with a different company at that time.

My dilemma is that I will need to stay with my current company for close to 5 yrs, potentially losing multiple opportunities. I like my job but am interested in different fields such business development or sales engineering. 

Do you recommend I stay the 5 yrs and complete the MBA and use this degree as a career pivot? 

Or should I start looking elsewhere and worry about the MBA at a later time? 

Btw the MBA is not a T25 school.

18gxw8x,Did my promotion screw me?,"Long story short, I’ve been in a junior position on my team for almost two years now. It’s BS that it’s taken so long to promote me as I’ve been doing the job of multiple people for quite some time, but the turnover rate in my supervisors has been insane, so anytime I was gaining traction, they’d disappear and I’d have to start over. I never got so much as a raise. I’ve made 55k a year since I started, but nearer to 60k with overtime. Today, I got my promotion. I’m ditching the “junior” and receiving 15000 more a year. I was ecstatic as that sounded like a lot, but here’s the kicker: I’m losing overtime and moving into a new tax bracket. I’ll technically be making 70k now, but I’m losing more in taxes and won’t be compensated for my overtime, which is bound to ramp up with this new role. Is my math just shitty or is this a lateral-to-downgraded move? Someone with a better understanding of this stuff please talk me down cuz I’m so fed up with all of this.

18gxrm8,Hoping to bounce back : path to low-level IT / IT infrastructure support,"Background:
--US citizen
--four year degree
-Comptia A+
-Linux+ (I will pass within a month)
-late 20’s
-experience in investigative work / food service / construction

Crim record:
-Class A Misdemeanor
I’m currently waiting on a major US city to fix their jacked up case system. This process, which has been publicized and is thoroughly their own fault, has been going on for several months now and I regularly monitor it via my attorney. As a result of this, although my misdemeanor is filed as settled (def-adj), formal background checks still show it as unresolved. 

It’s non-violent, non-nonsensical and filed on paper in the court house. However, their database is still in shambles and I’ve already had several interviews and at least two on-boarding processes derailed as a result of not being able to pass formal backgrounding processes. I am understandably frustrated. I am also spending my time building technical skills as I wait for the city to fix the problem that they, themselves created.  


----My Asks
No government work, never again. I’ve been inside that system, directly observed it misused and have been in turn, screwed by it. I also know many people who are living local govt or fed / contractor gigs and am familiar with the lifestyle. I’m not opening myself to that level of liability again or waiting 2 years for DHS bubba to wave his magic wand, spin around 3 times, and make up gibberish about what his crystal ball poly is saying. 


That leaves public sector.

I’ve no desire for direct construction or new construction related gigs. I’ve done both and could care less about which new Rolex my boss is going to spend my his money (my time) buying (an actual conversation that occurred). I would definitely make an exception for laying cable or installing hardware, as that beats roofing or chopping HVAC insulation (duct-board is Satan incarnate). I’ve worked food-service, but as the people in r/kitchenconfidential will acknowledge, that can be dead-end unless you’re management or higher-up.  
 
I thoroughly enjoy troubleshooting and working with computers. I don’t have a CS degree and don’t put much stock in ‘bootcamp’ courses. I’ve found that contacting community colleges and inquiring about courses and respective curriculum is a decent alternative. After that, it is simple a factor of pure motivation and how much time you can invest learning.

I’ve spent the last few months steadily working on Comptia certifications, and have enjoyed some success. I intend to backtrack to Network+ after I pass Linux+ in a few weeks. Working on certs has helped me maintain some sanity and feel like I still have some agency in my life. Personality wise, I believe that I’m better suited to maintaining and utilizing tools and systems that smarter people than I (ie., most people) have already developed. I'm not seeking anything flashy, and am content with doing work that I enjoy and believe in. I enjoy hard work but also don't want to be crippled at 50 like a lot of my ex-coworkers. For these and other reasons, supporting IT infrastructure seems appealing.

My current plan is to keep grinding on certifications and projects; pursuing IT help-desk positions once the background issue is resolved. Beyond that, I don’t have much of a plan. I’ll continue working on projects, and spend some personal time volunteering (good for sanity), but I’m struck with the anxiety that I could be doing more and don’t have a solid plan career-wise.

* Since July, I began working with my former university to wrap up my degree, plus continuing side hustles
* I have very few credits left at this point, which I will be completing online. If everything goes to plan I will earn my degree by May 2024 at the latest

18gwd63,extreme burnout from switching jobs this year,"Well, I tried the whole job switching thing to increase my salary with every new job. First, was 50k, to 65k to 73k but I just started the 73k job and I faced extreme burnout.

I was at the 50k month job for 4 months, the 65k one for 10 months and just started the last one yesterday. The 65k one was a temp job so I didn't know if I was going to stay due to that, but it was really low stress and my manager was pretty chill. Unfortunately, there was really low morale on the team due to mismanagement so it wasn't all rosy. I felt like I needed a change, so I applied to this 73k job and it seemed ok, some red flags but I ignored them. I knew right away at the newest job it wasn't a good fit, due to lack of procedures, small office and other stuff that would make this job very stressful. Also added a 40 minute commute from a 15 minute commute which I am extremely regretting.

I faced extreme burnout, stress, panic attacks and nervous shaking. I still am feeling completely fried, my brain is mush and I cant focus. I thought this was going to be a good move for me, ignoring some of the red flags since it wasn't a temp job but I should've listened to my gut. I knew I couldn't handle it due to the previous job switching, christmas stress, stressful year of moving and other personal issues. I feel like I fucked everything up for nothing.

18gv9xp,How to explain to my boss why my performance has improved with him gone?,"24F, been working at a market maker bank for the last 3 months. From a non finance background so it was a bit of a jarring transition and I found it quite hard. 

My boss is a micro manager. We have long in person “catch ups” to consolidate everything I’ve learned but lately they’ve felt like interrogation sessions and every time he schedules one my heart sinks and I’m super anxious until it happens.  

I have ADHD (haven’t told them) so things like accuracy and attention to detail aren’t my strong suits. The more complex processes I’ve picked up quickly as well as the theoretical stuff but the smaller details I’m not so great at. It will be inconsequential stuff, like not CCing the right person on an email, etc. I’m working on it.

My manager will grill me until he’s blue in the face, getting really snappy and interrogating me why I made that error.  I basically zone out during these sessions to avoid getting upset and just tell him what he wants to hear but it’s now instilled this terror of getting anything wrong I’m very withdrawn at work and it’s made me more prone to making mistakes and it’s a relentless cycle. 

And then he went on 3 week holiday. And all the little mistakes I was making just stopped and it was like a light switch came on and everything made sense. Everyone’s been commenting how much I’ve improved and I know he’s been keeping tabs on me, and he promised a catch up when he got back.

How do I politely tell him that without him breathing down my neck and putting me on edge with his hour - long interrogation sessions, I can actually relax and do my job well with a clear head, not riddled with anxiety?

I’m so torn. What would you choose if you were in my shoes?

Option 1 - corporate job which I really dislike, good pension, average pay (£13 p/h) private medical insurance which I had a spinal surgery though. Hybrid working, two days in the office. 

Option 2 - work for a small company- bookkeeping, maintenance of the company, booking cars for service, site visits, meeting clients - basically right had to a director, - something I would enjoy basic pension but it is something that can be changed, £14,5 p/h, private medical is something they’re willing to do for me once I’m in although not for all employers. Flexible working (take as many breaks - get the job done)

18gust2,Asking for a raise after military leave of absence,"I am returning to my civilian job after being away on a military leave of absence (MLOA) for roughly 1.5 years. My civilian job is very travel heavy and is busier during Spring and Fall seasons. Before I took MLOA, I was told by (now former) boss I was top 3 on team and would likely be considered for promotion from Level 2 to Level 3.

 I have a BS in mech engineering and have been with company for 8 years (including time away). I was told in a conversation a long time ago that I lowballed myself probably about $10K with my salary ask out of college, but have averaged a 3% increase every year. I am a Powerplant Field Engineer/Construction Manager

I really don’t understand how, but upon returning to work, it appears that I got a 4% raise during my MLOA, and am currently sitting at $80K. That being said, I look at salary comparison tools online, and it appears that I am around $15-20K less than average salaries. I get that they are average - some higher and some lower. But despite being salary (as opposed to hourly trades), I definitely am on the lower end.

Not by any means trying to look a gift horse in the mouth with this bump up, but after a MLOA of that length, are there any tips for asking about promotion/raise? Current manager has been a great mentor both personally and professionally, but is notably more “tell it how it is”. Any thoughts on where I’m at vs where I could be?

18gu6j4,"Working for a small family business, feel like I’m being exploited","I do appliance repair for a mom&pop. The pay is decent and I enjoy the work (the repair work anyway… the rest not so much). I feel pretty competent with the repair work for the most part, but my boss is very knowledgeable so I always have him to ask questions which is nice. That being said, *I do every repair* unless it’s a specialty thing. The given reason is that if he participated in the regular repairs we would be caught up and therefore not have anything to do. Okay, sure, i see the logic especially as I’m training and trying to learn as much as I can. 

Problem is, *they just kinda dropped on me that i’d be helping customers that come in as well as answering phones, too*. Thought i’d be just doing repairs but it’s fine, i’ve done customer service since i was a kid, i can be polite and answer questions. Unfortunately the store aspect covers way more than my specific appliance that i repair and the back end of things is really chaotic and disorganized. i’m like 9 months in at this point and still struggling to know where things are, how paperwork is done, kinda basic things that they make really complicated.

In addition, bosses wife comes in 2 hours after me and leaves 2 hours before me every day. her job is supposed to be you know, helping things run smoothly while me and boss do repairs. she just… doesn’t. i answer 8/10 phone calls, i intercept 9/10 customers, i do 9/10 repairs. 

now i will say i ask a lot of questions because i like doing things well and improving the workspace. they are very patient with me. but part of me thinks they are getting too comfortable with me doing everything. my boss has been playing pokémon go on his phone literally all day the past week. he sits there with his earbuds in when a customer comes in. i wait to give him or his wife an opportunity to jump in. they don’t. 

it’s gotten worse at a pretty constant rate since i started. am i being taken advantage of? i’m a good worker and i like being able to listen to youtube or music while i work but fuck, man, i wish they would step up so im not helping every single customer. 

i get a bonus when i hit 1 year but after that im thinking about leaving pretty abruptly. it’s literally just me working alongside their family (their son also works but he’s in a different area, also equally lazy it seems to me) 

TLDR without much exaggeration i do just about everything for day to day store operations when i was only hired for repair work. bosses are comically lazy, don’t know how to feel about my position. losing respect for them steadily, waiting on a bonus before i consider leaving. is this just how small businesses are?",SorryForRaging,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1702409481,2023-12-12 19:31:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18gu6j4/working_for_a_small_family_business_feel_like_im/,12,2023

18gt9hx,How should I approach my manager(s) about burnout?,"First-time poster here, so hello!

I work stock at a retail chain. Over the past 6+ months I have felt myself growing more emotionally and physically drained at work; calling off more frequently and generally feeling dreadful before work; essentially working as the only stock worker Mon-Fri., with little to no help from others in the same position on days we work together. I feel I have become the stereotypical ""yes man"" at my job. I am growing more upset and unsure about my role at this job. Between cleaning up after my coworkers during the day and taking on extra tasks that could/should have been completed during night shifts, essentially being the only stock worker daily (couples with the added traffic during the holidays), I find myself hitting a wall.

Moreover, there are tasks that only I know how to complete and/or find myself taking responsibility for. I practically have zero ability to delegate tasks to others because I'm either the only stock person on shift or because I know my other coworker(s) will not take initiative to those tasks/are capable of completing said tasks. I'm essentially in a lead-stock role without the official title.

I have brought this up a couple times to my managers but not in a formal or private manner. Kind of just in-the-moment conversations, if that makes sense. However, due to my lack of motivation and perceived increase in workload over the past few months I feel it necessary to address this more formally. 

I am looking for advice as to how I should approach this with management. What I should consider in my approach and any other suggestions that will give me leverage. I fear the only ""solution"" would be to simply hire more stock-workers but that is easier said than done. Until then, I need to find a way to clarify my role within the company, and how to adapt from there.

We’re currently moving stuff in the store, as we are being rushed to open before Christmas. We were only given a go-signal to move last Thursday. By we, I mean me, a colleague, and a few staff for manpower. 

As the year comes to a close, it becomes more and more clear to me how I want to leave my job so bad. I’m planning on passing my resignation letter the day after our Christmas party. Though I’m still thinking it through, coz it seems rude to leave right after getting my bonus and 13th month pay. Not only that, we also have an internal, out of office Christmas party right after my planned resignation day. But my heart, mind, and soul are EAGER to leave, I just need to secure my well-earned pay. 

Should I pass my resignation letter after the parties? Or should I just follow my gut and resign the day after I secure my bonus?

18gqfv0,"Applying for an ""Emerging Leaders"" program at my company. Need help with application... Not exactly passionate about my job.","I work in supply chain / logistics / analytics for a big retail company. 

I kind of fell into the role out of school..was never intending to stay for long but here I am 9 years later, promoted once to team lead. 

The company treats us really well, it's a fairly relaxed environment, the pay is decent.  I'm a hard worker, detailed. I don't go overly above and beyond but I do a really good job and go home. In the back of my mind I wish I could do something different with my life but I feel comfortable here. 

Anyway.. upper management is encouraging me to do this ""Emerging Leaders"" program next year as they see me moving up soon. 

I'm struggling / not very inspired on how to answer some of the application questions:

-What are your long term and short term career goals?
-What skillset knowledge do you need to reach those goals?
-What is your development objective?
-How will you know when you've reached your objective?
-What on the job experiences will you focus on?
-What coaching and feedback do you need?
-What formal training will you focus on?

I guess overall my biggest beef right now is my boss and I manage about 4 different departments together (with 6 employees under us).. I think they plan on breaking up the department soon. My boss is very sweet and kind... But also anxious/compulsive.. she worries about every tiny insignificant thing... right down to the last penny on the dollar... of a billion dollar company. She has to be involved in every little thing and it gets overwhelming. I've asked so many times that we divide and conquer rather then having to keep both of us 100% up to speed on every detail of every objective.. but she doesn't, she can't let go. 

So I guess my objective is to practice independently managing a project/team?",NothingHaunting7482,1,1.0,2,1702400033,2023-12-12 16:53:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18gqfv0/applying_for_an_emerging_leaders_program_at_my/,12,2023
18gqbnb,Worth a conversation with boss?,"I started a new job with a tech startup this spring. I’m new to the for profit world and new to the tech industry. I’ve really enjoyed working for and with my boss and coworker respectively. We technically are remote but I work closely with these two who happen to live in my same town. Lately, like for the last few weeks, I’ve had NOTHING to do (with the exception of small tasks here and there when I start really bugging folks for something to do). My boss is great and I enjoy working with him and learning from him but I am NOT good at being idle, especially when working from home where I live alone. He and my coworker are both “online” what seems like all of the time. This job and this company are their entire lives. They’re also great friends and have been for years. Lately, I’ve felt pushed to the side with my requests for more things to do, my time, and my schedule. It seems as though I need to be available all of the time (outside of work schedule wise, as though I too, have nothing else going on outside of work hours). 

My question is, is it appropriate to schedule a conversation with my boss that allows me to express my frustration at both the idleness of my day to day work and the seeming expectation that I have dates free to travel for work without knowing when those dates are? I guess I just don’t know how much notice is fair to receive from an employer or if it is inappropriate to request a bigger lead time to events that might require me to travel. I really like this company and want this job and my position to work towards the growth and overall health of the company.

18goq10,No longer wanting to work with my boss,"Gonna try and keep this as vague as possible in case my boss, a Reddit user, notices. I've been working with this guy (let's call him Alan) for a year now. We work for a company in the film industry that provides a particular service to productions. Truthfully I've never enjoyed working with him as he often lacks on-set etiquette and most of the time people will not like him and try to exclude him, which of course makes me look bad too. Not saying I'm amazing at my job, but I know how to get along with people and do my job well enough to where I'm not making many mistakes.

I'm also not really fond of the company as the people who run it don't seem to be on-the-ball all the time and try and undercut you in order to get a job (e.g. telling a production you'll work on their film for a rate lower than you deserve). Luckily I haven't signed any employee contracts with them nor am I on any payroll (I get paid by the production).

I've mixed feelings about my boss, no he's not amazing at his job but he's also a nice person. We get along better these days and he's even fought for me to be currently working on a good rate, but at the end of the day I'm not happy working with him. He's been mentioning a few productions that start next year and about us doing them together and I just feel dread and simply don't want to do them with him, but I just know it'd come out of nowhere for him if I said that.

Recently I'd become so stressed and SAD became worse to the point of having a mental breakdown. I told my boss about it and said I'll be going home for a couple of months to recollect myself. Truthfully a part of men's using this time off to get away from him and the company and I don't wish to come back. In fact I want to go work with another company who do the same thing, but it's one who they do not get along with. Last thing I want however is drama within our industry, so it's obviously not as easy as it seems.

Although I've enjoyed studying the subject I didn't really enjoy the work that followed.  
Over the years I figured out that I'm a creative person who can't sit still in chairs. In hindsight it would have been better for me to become a craftsmen or so.  
However, right now I ended up in a career path that requires me to work with excel sheets, norms and regulations (it / cyber security) and I can't stress enough how extremely boring that feels to me. Of course it also shows in my mediocre work performance.  
That said I feel like I'm stuck in career that's unfulfilling and does not make me happy. I can't see myself working 25+ more years here.  
The only reason I haven't left the company yet is an ok salary (not stellar, but not bad either), low work volume (plenty of time to do things on the side) and a liberal work from home policy.  
Of course I realize that's not going to last forever. I fear that I might fall out of the loop if I don't grow professionally but then again I'm not really interested in growing in my current path for the reasons outlined above.  
What could I do find a more fulfilling career in my 40s? I suppose it's too late to start an apprenticeship or study a different subject, since I'd be a mid-40s recent graduate then, so who's going to hire me then..

Before summer I lost my previous work as a CRO in tech startup. We were quite small still but I did partly enjoy in guiding the markets and planning the revenue operations.

After summer I found myself tired, unemployed and not sure what to do next.

I tried to say to myself that I will find something and that it would be wise to take some time and think my next move as I financially could hang on for some months with my savings.

But my inner voice said I need something fast so that my CV don’t look bad and I can still land something while I am “fresh”

I took a normal sales role in a new startup with an idea that if I help them grow in sales, I can land a position that is better suited for me.

That is where I am now. I have realised that I am not that good or at all motivated anymore in the field sales. Picking up phone etc is something I did 15 years ago and I just can’t get anything done.

I am getting very stressed cause I don’t like this position and I can’t seem to get any drive to show some example and land a better position. And I am not sure anymore if I will want any position from this company.

I could use some advice. I'm currently 28 and have a PhD in life science.

I've got a promotion at my current job but recently got offered the chance to interview for a position that even after the promotion pays about 15-20k more depending on if you include benefits.

18ghmaq,Would like some advice on my career path as a recent CS grad.,"I am a 27 year old American man who graduated with a BS in Computer Science back in May. I was for a long time completely unable to get a job, though I got a few interviews, sometimes multiple rounds, but never got the job.

My history is a bit complicated, but basically I first graduated with two other degrees back in 2019: a BA in Film and Media Arts with an emphasis in video game development as I was part of my university's videogame development program, and a BA in History that I just did because I like history and it wouldn't even take another semester because of how many requirements my AP courses waived. Ultimately I came out of the videogame program feeling woefully unprepared to enter the industry so I tried to enter my school's master's course for the same program to build my portfolio but was waitlisted and ultimately didn't get in. 

However, my time in the program introduced me to things such as Scrum/agile development methodology so I got myself certified and tried to become a Scrum Master but ultimately didn't manage to score a job.

Seeing that a lot of positions wanted CS degrees, I went back to school and got a CS degree. However, after graduating I am still unable to get a job, as a Scrum Master or other tech jobs. I have been rejected from Data Engineering, IT, etc...

I finally accepted a job at Tesla as a data labeler that I start in February, which isn't a position that really uses my degree and does not pay very well. I'm finding it hard to be excited about the position, and sort of feel like I have failed. 

I am also taking a professional technical animation course that a friend who worked at Epic Games recommended to me to hopefully turn that into something that can lead into a more enjoyable and profitable position.

18ghaij,how to ask for a role change without making manager think I hate my current role?,"I joined my current company a little less than a year ago, in a role I didn’t have past experience in, but I had enough of the required soft and adjacent hard skills to land the position and train for what I lacked. I’m fine with my current role, I’m not overly motivated by it but I also don’t hate it. On some days it can be rewarding, but most days it’s extremely boring and repetitive. 

Then recently I was given the opportunity to work with a new client, one that was signing on a sort of pilot contract. This meaning that the client wants to test our services on a cheaper shorter contract with a smaller team. Well, the team is just me. And this also means I get to take on more responsibilities, those of other roles.

In the process of working with this client the last few months, I’ve discovered that I actually love one of these other roles. I feel more motivated, focused and impactful when doing that work vs. the work of my actual role. I want to move into that role full time, and have talked to that teams lead about it with his full support. He likes the work I’ve been doing and thinks I’m perfect for it. He has even voiced this to other management, including my current manager.

In a couple days I have a monthly check in with my current manager, and I’ll have to finally talk to him about it directly. I’m not sure how to frame this situation for him without him thinking that I hate my current job. I wouldn’t even be able to transfer into that role right away if I was given the green light, as we just don’t need more bodies on that team yet. And as this is the case, I feel like I still need to maintain good standing in my current role to keep that opportunity to change roles when I can.

I'm a grad student majoring in Computer Science. I'm set to graduate in May 2024. I've been interning at a prominent renewable energy company since last summer. I got my internship extension letter for the spring semester. In the last meeting, my manager said that the internship extension doesn't guarantee a full time job post graduation. Though the company has given me an option to work remotely (from my college campus, South Carolina), my manager wants me to come to work location (Virginia) as I only have 3 credits left (1 class) for the spring semester. That class can be attended via Zoom.
Is it beneficial to shift to my work location and work on-site? Will it increase any chance of getting a full time job?

18gg2ah,New management has unreasonable expectations from newbies,"Hello. I’ve recently (2 month ago) started to work in a new company. Customer support position. The company has lots of perks, wfh, flexible time and all that. Other new colleagues and I have received like a half education because they have a lot of activity and need the manpower.

But in my 2nd month in, there has been a drastic shift in the management and another manager will take over. Many things that have been told to me so far will make a 360. New management wants to introduce night shifts, reduce wfh time, no flexibility and the daily targets for everyone will be nearly 3x as much as it was, starting from 2024. New management is number drived and they have high expectations and are only counting the volume we handle…quality is of no importance to them, only if it falls significantly.

Many in the team are outraged but us newbie’s can’t really say much. We have to sit and nod or we will be eliminated. All that and more changes are promoting a toxic work culture imo and isn’t something I signed up for. I am thinking about leaving in a few months…but I don’t know how this will look on my resume, that I was less than 6 months in a company.

18gfvh7,Need Advice: Potentially Inappropriate Comment from Boss in Small Office - How to Handle?,"Hello r/CareerAdvice community,

I’m seeking some guidance on how to handle a situation that recently occurred at my workplace. I’m a recent graduate and an international student, working in a very small local business in Australia. We only have three people in our office, including me, my boss, and an accountant, and we don’t have a formal HR department.

The incident happened when we were discussing having a staff dinner on Friday evening. I mentioned that I couldn’t attend because I have a PTE test the next morning. My boss then jokingly said to the accountant that I must have an appointment with my boyfriend. I responded, saying I didn’t know he existed, to which my boss replied that maybe he could be my boyfriend on Friday night.

I felt very uncomfortable with this comment but remained silent at the time. Later in the day, I thanked the accountant for diverting the conversation away from this comment, but he told me that my boss was just joking and that I shouldn’t be concerned.

I’m in a dilemma about how to perceive this situation. On one hand, I understand it might have been a light-hearted joke, but on the other, it made me feel uncomfortable. Given the lack of HR in our small office, I’m unsure how to approach this or if I should even bring it up.

What would you advise in this situation? Is it something I should address, and if so, how? Or is it better to let it go considering it was intended as a joke? I’m concerned about the implications of addressing it, especially being new and an international student in my first job in Australia.

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.

18gf86o,25M from Eastern Europe with autism and no employable skills - how can I make money?,"Hello.

I currently have no meaningful work experience, just some minor jobs when I was in school. Due to my diagnosed autism, ugliness, and speech impediments, I don't think a job that involves interacting with customers would suit me. I'm thinking that maybe I need to learn a technical skill. Please do not suggest programming - I have tried to learn code many times over years and I suck at it. It's just not what my brain is wired for, I suppose.

Although I've never been good with my hands or DIY things at all, I was thinking maybe I need to learn a trade like electricity or plumbing in order to get money. I don't really know which one or where to start. If there are any other ideas besides trades I would be interested too. I have not really made up my mind at all, except that I don't like talking to strangers or computer programming XD.

More personal details: I currently live with parents and do not have of a car or driving license. I currently have about 150€ saved. I live in a small city/town. No university degree.

In my meeting request, I asked if he had 15 minutes to talk about my goals at the company and any opportunities for me to support his work in the future. 


I am up for a promotion this year. Would it be wise for me to share this with him? We are already at the end of the year, so it’s pretty late. I was thinking I can mention it after I share my longer term goals, and just ask him if from the involvement he has seen from me this year, if there is anything else I should be doing longer term for success.

18gd4om,First day on the job as a socially anxious person,"First day on the job as an socially anxious person

Ok im probably too hard on myself as a socially anxious introvert. 

I believed in the saying “fake it till you make it” and got a job. I prepped really hard for interviews and got confident interviewing at technical and behavioral. Now, i got the job and i cant help but feel anxious all the time. I dread daily standups and speaking up in discussions. I always feel terrible after meetings, which affects my work. 

I really want to perform well in this job but i feel like my anxiety is holding me back and eating me up. I am pretty good at coding and love the fact that this job is remote. But the fact that it is remote, the thought of everyone looking at me on their screen makes me want to throw up and crawl in bed. Im not quick witted with jokes, i only speak in a few sentences(i want to speak more but my brain does not work), i hate that i seem so unfriendly. I want to contribute to the team effectively but i hate myself. 

Just for context: i grew up in a family where my parents bullied me and tease me everyday. So that hurt my confidence growing up. Thats prolly why im socially anxious all the time and scared of people judging me. Please if any other introverts in the same situation as me working as a software engineer have any advice, i will appreciate it🙏🏼",User2366278368k,1,1.0,0,1702353920,2023-12-12 04:05:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18gd4om/first_day_on_the_job_as_a_socially_anxious_person/,12,2023

18gcwln,Coworker undermining me to leadership and is affecting my work.,"I'm not sure what to do here. I work at an international company but everybody at our facility knows each other so having a good reputation is important. I train new hires on lab techniques and diagnostic methods for high complexity sterility testing. One day I had to take off so this coworker filled in for me and trained one of my trainees. I trained this person for maybe 1 hour on a certain task and it takes weeks to learn to perform this independently. Trainee made a small mistake, like something that takes literally 2 seconds to correct and doesn't affect anything for the test. She sent an email to leadership saying that I'm training people to incorrectly perform testing and that I ""have a history"" of making this mistake. Last time I made this mistake was over a year ago and was while I was being trained to that task. And the mistake didn't actually lead to anything bad happening.  I put a sample in the wrong spot of an analyzer and my trainer removed it, which is something that happened to everybody when they trained to this. Its a mistake that is incredibly easy to learn from and not make a second time. 

This coworker is known to blow up over tiny things and hold grudges forever. Not many people like her for this and she's always trying to start drama. Normally I'd just ignore it but management believed her with no questions asked and nullified my training designation for that task. The only reason I know this is because one of my coworkers is a lead and she had the email open on her computer when I was talking to her. Nobody has any idea that I know this.

I took on a different position in a different department about a month ago and I've been working half my week in each department until my position can get filled. This is a position in quality control and assurance and when my training abilities are being questioned, that looks horrible on me. I'm basically being accused of mixing up patient information and now im working in QA/QC so obviously those things don't mix well. 

What do I do? Since it's affecting my job I don't know if I should go to leadership to address this, especially since nobody has any clue that I know this information. Do I bring it up to the coworker? My trainee had JUST started learning so obviously they won't be perfect this early on in the process. I'm just so bothered at how fast leadership sided with her and I was never told about this. She could've made that same allegation about anyone at the lab.",yung_erik_,2,1.0,0,1702353220,2023-12-12 03:53:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18gcwln/coworker_undermining_me_to_leadership_and_is/,12,2023
18gcpe9,"Should I take the alternate role, or outright quit and take a sabbatical?","Hi,  
I'd like to hear some opinions on my situation.  
I've been working my current job for close to 4 years. I'm a team lead in IT. Due to a re-org earlier this year where much of the org flattened out and we were divided into sub-teams, my stress level and amount of pressure went through the roof. A significant contributor to this was having to deal with a sub-team in charge of a component that is mission critical (which brings with it pushy customers and urgency), and the fact that all new hires were placed in my team. This made me feel like I was constantly on-call during my work hours, and my day-to-day stress and anxiety became severe.  
My health took quite a plunge as a result. For a good 6 months or so, I had stopped going to the gym completely, which was very unlike me who used to go several times a week religiously for years, and I was also drinking daily. I've been able to stop the drinking and have been a bit better with exercise, but I still wake up every morning with what can only be described as a crater in my heart, a very sinking feeling of depression before the day starts. I feel I'm truly burnt out, and I know it is purely work related because these feelings melt away once I am away from work or on vacation.  
A primary stressor for me is the customers that my team must deal with, and the urgency of their requests. It feels like things can blow up any moment and its always urgent. While it does funnel through my team, I cannot shake off the feeling that I'm always surrounded by fires, wondering which one I will be roped into as a lead on a daily basis.  
Recently, I was offered a separate role by management. I will no longer be a lead, but it will be more about reviewing incidents and providing feedback to product teams. It will cut out the major stressor, which is the customer-facing aspect.  
However, I have been stuck deciding on whether to take it, or outright quit without anything lined up and take a sabbatical. It is a very high-paying job, but the new role also has a mess that it must deal with right off the bat, and a lot more internal stakeholders. It feels like I may be going from one fire to another fire, but without the major stressor of my current rolewhich is the customer interactions. It would still be within the same team, so it won't be a complete change of scenery.  
I'm a bit stuck because emotionally, I just want to take a break. I've never quit a job without another lined up before. It would be a huge risk, but I do have savings to keep me afloat for a number of years. I am in my mid-thirties and single, so no dependents to worry about. In case someone suggests a long vacation, I have taken a 3-week vacation recently and felt great during it, but the moment I came back, the anxiety returned and hit me like a truck, and I fell off the rails again mentally very quickly.  
Has anyone else been in a similar situation? It feels like the other role may be more manageable, but I'm already dreading the pressure there, and its future is a bit ambiguous. I don't think I want to continue down my current career any more at this point.  
Thanks for reading. I don't have too many people to talk to in my personal life, so I thought I might broadcast here a bit.",MoonPresence777,1,1.0,1,1702352558,2023-12-12 03:42:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18gcpe9/should_i_take_the_alternate_role_or_outright_quit/,12,2023

There’s absolutely no future for me here. I’m given 0 chances to become bigger or have a significant increase in pay or role upgrade, very basic work horse. 
I have a consistent urge to start a business but i feel like I’m stuck in the comfort of the paycheck. Every time i think about a business i get a thousand reasons to do it, but come up with a thousand reasons to not do it. I really ought to leave this job. I feel like it’s stealing my time and my age and my energy for a lowball cheap price, with the toxicity it’s causing me as the cherry on top. I dread going to work or doing any tasks, all my manager wants is completed projects with no chance for me to be introduced to anything new or promotional, absolutely no chance to even get a training like a sixsigma. Everyone in my team likes how i can get stuff done “when i want to” but that’s only when It’s something i like and think it’ll help me grow, otherwise i’ll put it off, so you can probably guess how i’d go in circles, no promotion because no performance and no performance because no promotion, im stuck in a system glitch. I fucking hate this. What should I do? Where do I pivot? 
However I’ve been doing bunch of professional training on the side and business research, so my resume is pretty impressive and i get interviews and offers.

18gb7lo,I need help deciding whether or not a career change is worth taking,"I also posted this in /r/careerguidance so forgive the repeat if you for some reason see it twice.

My background in a nutshell is that I have a B.S. in environmental science and a M.A in education. After 1.5 years, I've decided teaching is not for me. I'm trying to get back into either environmental sciences or urban planning (or anything along those lines really), but the search for an entry-level job in these fields in Southern California is a little grim given my lack of experience or internship in the field. Yes I plan to expand my search to out-of-state, I just want to try staying in the area because my whole life is here.

As the title says, I'm at a bit of a crossroads and I'm having trouble thinking about my choices. On one hand, I've been taking extra extension career classes and trying to network more aggressively in what I currently want to do (tl;dr - environmental science). Again, I've got nothing yet, but I feel like I'm making progress and getting further in the interview/hiring process.

On the other hand, a cousin of mine is planning to create a new startup based on AI or something, and he wants me to learn computer science/programming in the span of 2 or so years so that I can work/partner with him. This is absolutely not what I studied and not exactly what I want to do, but he's promising that it's basically guaranteed, a much more lucrative salary, and probably better than what I'm trying to do now. I'll skip the therapy session/venting, but this option can basically be considered solely financial.

I don't quite know the job markets are for either one, and I guess I'm looking for a little wisdom on how people have dealt with career changes especially with regards to the tech field, passion vs. paper (money), family relations/expectations, etc. I can provide more background if needed, but I'm really just stuck on whether or not I can deal with the last 5-6 years of my education and career choices being a waste of time, only to be saved by the fish hook of nepotism.",WhatAShitName,1,1.0,5,1702347872,2023-12-12 02:24:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18gb7lo/i_need_help_deciding_whether_or_not_a_career/,12,2023

One of those “they’ll never hire me but the worst they can say is yes” kinda deals. Well…they said yes lol.

Both managers in the interview said Google and YouTube are a massive part of their jobs, and they’re both highly paid engineers.

This is an “operations support” role. Basically I’ll be working with production, engineering, tooling, lean, management and executives. I’ll be involved in process development, continuous improvement, cost estimating, bid proposals, research projects, and providing guidance to the build plan. 

I have no degree. I have 10 credit hours from an online community college and I have 10 years in manufacturing, mostly on various CNC machines. My cousin assured me that most people have no idea what they’re doing, especially in this role because it’s so much of an everything position. The manager also assured me that she will find what I’m good at/enjoy and keep me there.

In my meeting request, I asked if he had time to talk about my goals at the company and any opportunities for me to support his work in the future. 


I am up for a promotion this year. Would it be wise for me to share this with him? We are already at the end of the year, so it’s pretty late. I was thinking I can mention it after I share my longer term goals, and just ask him, if from the involvement he has seen from me this year, if there is anything else I should be doing longer term for success. He is pretty structured and strictly business from what I can tell, so I think I have to be careful with how I bring it up.

18g8ha4,Bachelor's in Psych AND a Theatre Degree - Double Whammy Do-over?,"Hey pals! Big time of reflection for a lot of folks I'm sure, so I'm hoping y'all could help guide.

I'm nearing 30, sitting on a Psych + Speech Communication BA and a Theatre Degree, and I'm struggling to figure out what I can do going forward. Growing up I was light on work experience, living in a ""focus on school"" household, though not extremely strict, and with acting, my professional resume has just been full of huge gaps. I really wanted to study behavior after some experience with therapy in my teens (MDD), so I went into a Psych BA thinking either counseling or law in the future. During my studies I... got sidetracked by performing in plays on campus... and that steered me into wanting to pursue acting professionally. As a result however my final GPA was an underwhelming 2.8ish.

Fast forward, I was so excited, I went to theatre school and came out a changed person - I had direction (literally), I had friends and peers and mentors who all believed in me, and sure enough I ended up working in a few commercials and TV series' that paid my bills for a couple years. All the while, I've been living with my parents, and have been working part-time as a barista since then. Now with the SAG-AFTRA strike ending, I'm not feeling overly confident in the longevity of acting, or frankly a lot of other artistic pursuits, after the rushed rollout of AI. On the side during COVID when I wasn't working towards acting, I taught myself Adobe suite and started poking around at graphic/UX design, and really fell in love with branding and brand strategy as I worked on naming and logo development.

At work I love the coworkers and the ""everyone is here to sling beans and get through the day"" teamwork mentality, but while I'm decent at customer service, the mask is hard to put on some days. Ideally I would love to work for a non-profit (though I'm obviously wary of the industrial complex) but I could also work toward corporate. I hope to end up in a role where I can be a person-in-the-chair, supporting others to help meet their needs, hopefully in order to create or facilitate public good. In my worksona I'm a helpful little gnome (truly I would love to be a butler), but intellectually I think I've retained a unique brand of outside the box thinking and strategic problem solving from theatre school, and I'm keen on using my actual critically-thinking brain in my work. Otherwise I love doing little menial tasks, the grunt work no one else likes (from cleaning bathrooms to organizing a spreadsheet), and I really just like to help others thrive while trying to work toward global good.

I'm not against going back to school entirely or enrolling in continuing education, and in fact would love a change of scenery and routine, but I'm just not sure what the move is going forward. I have skills, I'm educated even if it feels like a lifetime ago, but I cannot seem to move out of my hole.

Anyway thanks for listening y'all. Any advice would be incredible.

18g8f0p,My manager faked an email!! HELP!!,"BACKSTORY: I  work in a huge corporation but my department is very small, like 5 people. The hierarchy is our director, my manager and then me. The other 2 people are not above me in hierarchy so they don’t matter. My direct manager is a total micromanaging annoying woman. She’s just so extra. She wasn’t even my manager, I had another manager before her who left. So this one became my manager recently in May 2023. She wasn’t even hired to be a manager, she became my manager by chance and now it’s going to her head. 
Anyway, this organization has given me no raise since I have started. I have been working here 2 years. I have asked for a raise 4 times and they have said a hard no. Saying that I still need improving and no one is getting a raise in the organization (which is a lie). I know I deserve better but I am staying here because I am working on setting up my business on the side and I definitely don’t want to change jobs and get trained somewhere else and waste my time. I hate the corporate world in general. 
My manager is always on top of my head, she keeps a constant eye to see when I’m online, what my Teams status is, what my correspondences are with other employees and other offices. She’s just all over me constantly. She’s annoying but I’m used to it now.

THE PROBLEM: So at work, I’m in charge of issuing certain documentation. We have our own private inboxes and then a shared inbox for the department. 
We send and receive all of our correspondences with this other inbox. Let’s call it Inbox #2 for this case. Everyone has access to Inbox #2 but the workflow is that either my manager or my other team member manages it and they send me the correspondence to handle. I had sent one of our other offices an email and was waiting on them to respond. The response was received this morning but my manager did not send it to me. She was supposed to. Anyway, I followed up with her around 2 pm and asked her if we received a response. At this time, I KNEW we did receive a response but she didn’t send it to me as I went into Inbox #2 and checked for myself. You may ask if I saw the email, why didn’t I action it. It is because I am NOT ALLOWED to action anything unless it is sent to me by the inbox handler to my inbox. I saw that the email response was OPEN from 8 in the morning and it was not forwarded. 
My manager replies to the email I sent to her at 2 pm and said here it is. I checked the chain and noticed the email was apparently forwarded to me and inbox #2 was CC’d at 9:45 AM. I checked my inbox thoroughly to see if I missed it but I didn’t. I also checked inbox #2 in the inbox, sent folder as well as deleted folder but this email is nowhere to be found. I know for a fact my manager faked the email to make it look like she forwarded it to me. I know she didn’t forward it, there’s no way. She made the email up in the chain. That is unethical and unprofessional. She can’t be doing that. In a way she is gaslighting me as she is making it seem like she sent me the email. She could have easily said, oh I mistakenly forgot to forward the email, here it is. But she went as far as making it look like she sent it. So I responded to her email saying - “I noticed you forwarded the email to me this morning, however I did not receive it in my inbox. I checked inbox #2 too, and I don’t see this specific email in there. I don’t see it in the sent/deleted folders as well. I thought that was odd so I should let you know in case there may be an issue with Outlook. Might have to check with IT on this one as I hope this isn’t happening often as it is hard to catch.” 

ADVICE: She hasn’t responded yet but I’m sure it will be something fake and gaslight-y. I can’t have her get away with this. I need her to know that I know she faked an email. How do I proceed with this? How much evidence do I need to get her into trouble? Should I reach out to the Director - I would however they all have this weird culture where they team up and they are against me. I know the Director will be like I’m sure there’s some mistake. Should I contact HR? This is my direct manager so her faking an email is highly unprofessional. The email is NOWHERE to be found EXCEPT in the chain she sent to me. It’s easy to add a fake email in an email chain. Anyone can copy paste and do it. What shall I do in this case? I can’t have her get away with it. She micromanages me so hard, it’s her turn now. I can’t look up to and respect someone who is my manager and who also does this.",New-Business-5330,3,1.0,3,1702339571,2023-12-12 00:06:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18g8f0p/my_manager_faked_an_email_help/,12,2023

So I am a designer in Italy - I love my job and have interesting clients/projects with estimated +€5mil home value. 
I built my company basically in 2 years from a skratch and basically it was just me doing it all: I don’t have any prior business experiences and any experiences in what I ended up doing like: marketing, social media, interior design but also project management and wear many other hats.  Just like many of you do. Well it came to me last year that eventually I will need an assistant. I thought it will be any easy job to find some but oh boy was I wrong. 

This is a rant by the way. So if you aren’t in mood you should not continue reading. If you are I really hope I can get some laugh or learn something new from more experienced people. 

So where did I ended? The assistant. So year ago , to save money I started to look for admin assistant online, like upwork. I also wanted to test it to see how much help I actually needed to know if I eventually need a part time/full time assistant. The experience in upwork was AWFUL. First Asistant was from Philippines who got pregnant week after and quicker the job, after me spending full week to train her. I was so pissed but wished her well. I am women in 30s and totally understand why companies are scared to hire womens around this age. I literally lost a week of my life and spend money on training someone. I interviewed more, also on upwork. This time I wanted to make sure the Asistant is living in similar time zone and have some specific experiences. So I found one who was aparently living 2 hours ahead and had experiences with software I used. Well I did another week of the training, one time she didn’t show up on meeting, and I felt like she uses chat gpt to write texts to me which was I would say super sketchy. Anyway, turns out she’s somewhere from a f**** Pakistan and doesn’t live where she suppose to.

At this point I packed my s** on upwork and never look back. 

I also did some deep thinking and self reflection - Because at the end I really needed an Asistant and needed it to work. Having no experiences in HR or in general, hiring/training someone before really are my weakness. And the flustration with like training them even things such as writing emails and making a paragraphs…. 🙈

I worked as a: Javascript tutor, Wordpress and front end development and then also I became a digital media specialist(video, photo). Then for a while I was super confused and I started working lots of blue collar jobs.  
Now, I have been getting my life together so I have decided to return to my field. I have a better focus and interest for the tech field now and I want to grow with purpose of finding a career I like.  
I started self studying then I did a 6 months Big Data Engineer internship at a Data center. I think I love the data field. Especially Big Data.  
Now after the internship I found a job to work in a project as a tester. I like my job, since we are working with the ministry of health. I live in a country where there is so much to develop so we are actually building an application that connects hospitals, clinics, health insurance and pharmacies, so we are making it all digital. So it is a very wonderful purpose. It makes me feel very fulfilled to be in this project.  
However I am concerned that working as a tester has nothing to do with my goals.  
I have lost a lot of time already in my past. I have only been doing a little bit of everything so I am not getting enough specialized in anything. I was also away from my field for a long time. So now I am really concerned about making good choices that will have me career ready. I dont want to keep doing a bit of everything.  
I think I like the field of Big Data engineer so I think its best to focus my energy in it. I need to develop myself in Java and Python etc, but as a tester I am doing something completely different and it is keeping me away of what I want. If I was working at least as a software developer I think that would keep me closer to my goals of being a big data engineer too.

18g6eia,Possible competing job offer situation,"Here’s my situation: I work in a law office. Last June I was told by the head attorney they were closing our department and I would be laid off between the end of July or mid August. Turns out some key people quit and I was told I would be retained until at least the end of the year. Then the firm started having negotiations with another attorney who is going to take over the practice and reopen my old department.

18g6ceg,Work vacation issue,"Hey everyone, 

Need some advice on a work situation I'm in. So, a while back, my boss insisted I take my paid vacation late, right before Christmas Eve. No wiggle room on my end. Despite our initial no-Sundays agreement when I started, now he's making me work the entire Christmas Eve day. Apparently, I have to ""come in the day right after my vacation because it can't be more than a seven-day break."" Boss dropped this bomb on me at the same time he hit me with the Christmas vacation news.

I've been job hunting lately, and now I'm thinking about resigning during my vacation to dodge the Christmas Eve shift. It's not just this incident; there's a whole vibe thing going on. Boss is buddies with other managers, and I'm not part of the ""in-group"" despite being around longer than both assistant managers. During his vacation this week, he left the other managers in charge, who are all younger than me. One assistant manager, who's clearly his buddy (they call each other brother), gets to work only mornings now just because he feels like it. Meaning, I already cover more night shifts and, recently, Sundays, despite our prior agreement. I'm the only assistant manager left closing alone, while others always have company or the main manager with them. When I started, working nights was supposed to be ""required"" for each manager, but now I'm stuck with three or four night shifts weekly. Feels like some rules just don't apply to certain people.

I'm in Texas, and I'm curious about labor laws regarding withholding pay in this situation. Any insights or advice would be awesome!

18g5tp7,Was let go: What to say on interview?,"Hello guys and gals,

I was recently let go from my company.
My specialization is network engineer.

The best way to summarize the reason I was let go was because I was not a good fit for the company culture. To give an example I would solve problems and issues that would arise but sometimes bypass protocols either because I thought that solving the issue would be of priority but other times I was not even aware of these protocols.

However that is now in the past and I need to apply for new positions.

What is the best thing to say in an interview when it comes to where I work now and what was the reason I left or was let go from my previous company?

18g5pic,Career shift from nonprofit?,"I will try to keep this pretty vague to keep my professional digital footprint low.

Basically, I have a BA and MA related to political science, China affairs, and international relations (w/ good grades and solid standing). Since graduating, I was fortunate enough to land a full time role directly in my degree fields at a nonprofit. The work lives up to its reputation, and it’s a lot of work for little pay. I’m interested in transferring upward salary wise (60k+) in 2024 and thanks to my job (plus 3 other relevant internships ranging part to full time) I have ~3 years of relevant professional experience. I have all skillsets related to nonprofits: qualitative “think tank” type research, office administration/management, social media content creation and promotion, and light finance work. In my roles, I’ve been quite scrappy and consider myself flexible and a problem solver. For example, I recently was tasked with moving the organization into a new office basically by myself which I pulled off. Plus, I taught myself basic Blender controls to make a moveable and scaled 3D render of our office so I could move the furniture models around for a boss who wanted to moonlight as an interior designer. 

I don’t want to get stuck in nonprofits forever, nor am I smart enough to make decent money in more academic-esque think tank/researcher roles.

18g53lo,Help with unfair salary offer? Feeling completely undervalued,"Hi everyone, long one, sorry!

I had a pay review with my manager today and I'm feeling completely undervalued as a result.

I've been in my current tech role for 2 years and I'm getting promoted to a senior tech after 2 years service (this happens automatically in my workplace if you perform well)

I started at the same time as another guy who was able to come into the company as a senior tech due to him having a few years experience in another company and I was fresh out of university so I got a junior tech role.

Throughout the past 2 years, I've had to constantly provide support, help and reviews to this guy and fix a lot of his mistakes before the manager sees them. We're great friends at work but in all honesty he makes a lot of mistakes at work and I'm genuinely better at the job.

He has told me how much money he makes (45k) so I could negotiate a better salary for myself when I got my senior promotion.

My paperwork came through this morning and I was shocked to see it was for 42k, 3k less than he makes.

I had my review call with my manager and explained that I'd researched the market for this role and that market average was 46-47k, so I was a bit disappointed at the offer given that my company claims to pay slightly above market average and I have been consistently out performing someone else in the same role for the past 2 years.

Manager said there wasn't a lot her could do besides bump my performance payrise (which we get in a few months time) to the highest it could go, as he agrees I've been consistently performing even beyond a senior level for the past 2 years. Although I'm glad he sees this, it would only bring my salary up to 43.5k.

I asked him if he could push HR on this for the reasons I have outlined above and he agreed. He later called me to say HR would not budge, and that the offer was based on time in service and benchmarked against other people in similar roles across the business. (I.e. everyone starts the senior tech role at 42k)

I really don't feel like there is very much I can do at this stage. I've spent the past 2 years honing my skills, learning so much about the company, and consistently being the highest performing member of my team. It feels like a kick to the stomach to be offered less than someone who I've basically been coaching since day one and I don't even feel like putting in any effort at all now as it doesn't appear to be valued.

I get so many thanks and so much praise ay work for what I do, but until that praise turns into numbers on a payslip, I'm not sure I give a shit anymore.

Does anyone have any advice to offer? Do I just have to accept that they won't pay me what I know I deserve? I haven't signed the new contract yet - what happens if I refuse? 

Thanks :(",user09098,2,0.75,2,1702330924,2023-12-11 21:42:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18g53lo/help_with_unfair_salary_offer_feeling_completely/,12,2023
18g45p5,Thinking of Reaching Out to Old Employer,"Sorry in advance for a bit of rambling.

I recently started a new job about a month and a half ago. It hasn't been terrible, but the culture fit leaves something to be desired, feels a bit more micro-managed, my commute has become longer (previously 1 day a week in office 20 minutes away vs twice a week in office 1-1.25 hours away), and although not anything too bad the work life balance is definitely worse.

I left my previous employer because I was somewhat underpaid and this new job was offering a 33% pay bump. My previous employer made a counter offer that came with a promotion but it was still a bit less money than what I am making at the new company. I loved everything else about my previous employer but I am at a point in my life where I need the money so I decided to jump ship. 

I am not desperate to get out of the new job, but I definitely feel like I'd be happier at the old one. Is it worthwhile reaching out to my previous manager to see if the promotion is still on the table, and if it can be negotiated? My ideal number would be 10K more than the previous counter offer. I know they haven't filled my previous position yet, so I do feel like there would be an advantage in that I can hit the ground running right away.

18g3irl,accept a confirmed lateral position or continue in current role?,"seeking input!

I work a hybrid position and am looking to secure a remote job at some point in 2024, not necessarily in a rush but ideally by the end of summer. I am in a long distance relationship and the only thing holding me back from moving is work. Longer term I would like to live in a smaller community, securing remote work now of course would make that much easier.

I have been offered a fully remote position, it is a lateral move, if the position was not remote I wouldn't have applied. The position is more application based, speaking with the public. Nothing against it, just doesn't excite me exactly. However, there are other roles with the company that are appealing (and also fully remote), so it could be a good foot in the door.

I have expressed to my supervisor that I am seeking fully remote work which she is supportive of. She did confirm that my current role can't be fully remote (which I agree with), but that she will keep me in mind for new opportunities in the coming months. She has always been supportive of my learning and developing within my current role and I do trust that she would put my name forward for other positions. Of course, this cannot be promised, however my workplace is growing rapidly and I can see room for growth. I would see my career going further in a HR related position if I stayed with my current workplace, and anticipate if I was in a new position it would also be a promotion.

I'm looking for advice on if I should stick it out with my current job, or accept the remote position and just move on. I have rambled on about this to friends and family but appreciate an objective opinion. Thanks!

TLDR: In a long distance relationship and want to live in the same city as my partner. Do I accept a (less interesting to me) fully remote job with the same pay, or wait for a potential promotion in my current job that has supported my career development?

18g3fub,"Just offered a job, but only just now informed I'm required to take a drug test...","Hello, I live in a legal state (AZ) and was just offered a great job for a senior role in marketing for a medical-adjacent company. The company itself is based in Arizona, but they're majority owned by a larger group based out of North Carolina that manages the hiring process.

&#x200B;

This has been an almost 2 month long process that's included 4 interviews, most of which required me to take time from work. Not once was anything mentioned about drug testing. I've never been drug tested before and I'm 32 years old. I micro-dose daily with about 3mg of THC edibles (gummies). I don't drink or take any other drugs. I'm a very responsible person and take my work seriously.

&#x200B;

Now that they've sent the offer, they've advised that the offer is contingent on completion of standard hiring processes, including background check, drug screen, etc... In the conditions of employment, there's nothing regarding drug use. There's no indicator as to whether or not the test will include THC, but fair to assume it will. It's through LabCorp.

&#x200B;

The start date is set for a month from now. What's the play here? I can't put my two weeks in at my current job if there's a risk of not getting the new job. So since the start date is a month from now - is it best to accept the offer, go through with the process and take the drug test and hope for the best? Maybe they won't care about THC? It's an office marketing position, not federal - and no heavy machinery use or any interaction with people outside the office.",Rogue_sector,392,0.8600000143051147,537,1702326842,2023-12-11 20:34:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18g3fub/just_offered_a_job_but_only_just_now_informed_im/,12,2023

18g3d0x,Help me decide at which point loyalty is outweighed by compensation?,"Keeping details somewhat vague just on the off chance someone reads this and would otherwise recognize my situation. Apologies for a bit of length, but I want to explain myself fully.

I work in hotels, and I had to move to take my current positikn. And my boss was good enough to agree to put me up on property to start, giving me one or two months to find a place. However, literally within about 3 weeks of me moving I had a health issue arise, between over 2 weeks in hospital and recovery time, I was basically laid up the entire 2nd month. So he agreed to give me more time.

Fast forward, and between all of the above and the tough housing market, I was there a bit over 6 months. About halfway through, my boss told me he'd have to charge me for rest of my stay, but just the employee rate, which I understood and agreed to. Come to move out, and he said ""Ah never-ending that, its fine."" And comp'd that too.

Needless to say, I'm grateful to my boss for his generosity. That said, the position I work is a bit different from what I was sold in the interview, not necessarily in bad ways but in ways that have been a bit of a let down. And there are promises of things to come that I have since learned are typical promises he has made to others in the past that didn't necessarily pan out.

I like my current boss, he's a great guy and I don't think he mislead me with malicious intent, but rather more a sense of over-reaching.

Anyway, as time goes on in my current role I am growing increasingly dissatisfied. My pay is arguably fair, but it could be better. There are other opportunities in my area that I could pursue and make more money for similar work. There are other factors besides pay as well. I have a personal goal that I hoped to achieve withing 3 years and was hoping this job would help me build towards (and was led to believe in interviewing it would in fact do so) but I'm over a year in now and none of that progress has happened or seems likely.

Cut to today, and there's a new position listed at a property nearby that would be a 25% pay increase that I feel I could land if I pursue it. And yet I find myself hesitant due to how good my current boss has been to me and the fact that, while I don't necessarily love my current job, I also don't hate it either, which is not a negligible factor.

So, I'm asking advice for others to weigh things with input from other perspectives. Thanks in advace.",NixonsBack87,1,1.0,2,1702326650,2023-12-11 20:30:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18g3d0x/help_me_decide_at_which_point_loyalty_is/,12,2023

18g1usd,Struggling to find a balance at work between “I am not willing to work above my wage/title for free” and “I don’t want to lose my job.”,"TLDR: Title says it all.

I want to work and I give it 100% at work everyday, and I’ve always had good reviews. But I am tired of being taken advantage of and being expected to do 200%, and it feels like it’s getting considerably worse in every industry. 

A little background info: I am severely underpaid as it is, and this job was a step down for me. My employer knew this when I had applied and they were unwilling to negotiate a single cent higher for the experience — so it’s 1000% not in my benefit to do any senior-level work. They were very clear they were not interested in paying for it.  Totally fair. I took the job a s I was happy to do the junior level work defined on my employment agreement, within the scope of my title and wage. This job should have been a nice change of pace for me and a breeze and much less stress, so I was ok with it all. The problem is, they added that, “And other duties as assigned.” line at the bottom on my responsibilities list and I didn’t think much of it at the time.

Fast forward a few months to now: They are just constantly putting additional senior-level work on my plate because they know of my experience. My job is now just as much responsibility and stress than previous. I am the most overworked on my team and one of the lowest paid. I have been following career advice to advocate for myself, trying to only do what’s within scope of my role and saying “No” when it’s warranted. I’ve politely and professionally called it out 3-4 times when I had specific reason to (it’s also in writing) but it’s been completely disregarded. I get the same old, “I hear you.” and “You are doing a great job though!” and constant praise every time, and nothing ever changes. They have also made it clear company-wide that raises are not in the foreseeable future. Yet, if I just don’t do the senior-level work or if I go to HR, they’ll more than likely let me go without cause. (It’s easy to do where I live.) It’s not uncommon anymore because companies would rather find someone naive that they can burn out for as little pay as possible, than have someone who is fully aware and stands up for themself.

I can’t afford to lose this job. The job market is brutal for anything in my field. I took this job as something that should have been easy and less stressful based on what they were willing to pay. I know the solution is to keep looking for a new job but this is so frustrating that this is common everywhere. I just want a job where I can do my 8 hours within the scope of my responsibilities and not feel like I have to do more just to keep the job.

18fzzo6,Electrical design engineer change to non-design engineer,"I'm currently a design engineer of ac/dc and dc/dc converters at a small company that does both designing and manufacturing. Over the past few weeks, I decided that I don't want to be a design engineer, but rather a plain engineer, if that makes sense. I came aboard about 3 years ago with the intention of being a design engineer, with a title to match it. However, I simply don't know enough and, quick frankly, I don't have the desire to learn it. I've read some textbooks and watched videos, but I can't retain any information and I lose interest really fast. In the past 3 years, I haven't done an actual design until now (I've been piecing it together with bits and pieces from other designs that have already been done, but that'll only get me so far). There has been a lot of things that I have doing that simply don't require designing. I'm ok with pretty much anything except for the designing of the actual converters (such as first article analysis, finding glitches and coming up with solutions for it, automated testing and everything that goes with it).

Now the tricky part is how do I broach this subject to my boss. He's a really nice guy and absolutely hates letting people go. I feel that he would keep me on as an engineer, but I need to be prepared for worst case scenario of getting let go, as well as a possible reduction in pay. I also feel that I don't have experience for anything specific to be desirable at a different company. It seems that most job listings are looking for people with specific (specialized) knowledge and experience.

One final caveat...I am the sole provider for my family (wife and 2 kids) and money is already pretty tight. We should be ok with a small pay cut and can compensate by better budgeting and stop contributing to the kids 529 college account and my 401k.

This is in USA and 43 if that matters.

I’ve got no qualifications apart from GCSE’s and was out of work for years and years up until 2019 cause I was basically a f*ck up with awful mental health and never left the house apart from going out getting off my face. Managed to do okay for myself as I now run my own pet care business. The reason I want to quit is because after 4 years I’ve lost the love for my job - I’m outside a lot in the cold/rain, get no sick pay, no maternity pay if I ever want kids, no holiday pay, clients pick me up and drop me at their own convenience depending on the holidays so my income is unreliable and unstable. It can either be decent money or AWFUL where I have to rely on my parents for help financially. Just long term don’t want to stay in this job. It was a good little venture to get me on my feet but I don’t want to do this forever, but I can’t easily switch jobs where I make decent enough money as I’ve got no experience or qualifications. 

I’m very very interested in things such as: dermatology, medical aesthetics, laser treatments etc. would love to maybe work in a skin clinic or something. How do I go about doing it? Do I need a nursing degree? I’m almost 30 so an apprenticeship and working my way up just won’t sustain me financially, would prefer to study open university or something on the side of my current job until the income is decent enough to switch - is this possible?

Now I feel like I’m not interested enough to pursue SLP mostly because the major was unnecessary hard/rigorous almost failed it and idk if I would be proud of myself if I go through with it and do it as a career in next 10-20 years. Especially be in debt with something not sure about. I just don’t want to be that one miserable 40-50 year old. 24 years old btw 

Just feel I’m pursuing SLP because of the stability and money aspects of it not because I’m passionate 

I feel like I screwed up in life and should of done nursing as flip side I wouldn’t be in so much  debt and would start working immediately to survive in this world and just get started in the workforce loll

Past 2-3 I had worked odd jobs and currently unemployed and Looking  for another one.

I just feel stagnant and indecisive of what path to take and it’s making me depressed and anxious 

A person suggest I shouldn’t go back for nursing as SLP get paid more than nursing. 

I’ve considered other paths like Mental Health counselor or even an Art therapist (I love sketching/drawing) 

I’m true interests/passion are one day becoming a model/actress, business women (fashion/beauty), content creator and social media influencer(seems interesting to me), artist (painting/sketching) 

But feel like those paths are not stable enough and I feel like I should just pursue SLP and get it over with so I can have a stable career in case other paths don’t work out 

Guess I’m also worried about being in more debt in life as well

18fvgwc,Future career doubts related to adult content opp,"Hi!

First of all let me apologize for my English as I’m not a native speaker. I’m from Central Europe, 26M.

I have some doubts regarding a position I recently took up. I’m a front engineer with almost no experience in front engineering, as I studied a biology degree which is pretty much useless in the country I’m currently in, where I live with my GF and don’t plan to currently move.

Thing is, I studied biology but got to work as a graphic designer and web developer on the side as a freelancer. Most of my experience is in the graphic design field as I decided early on that I didn’t want to work in the lab or anything that related to biology. I also don’t have much experience in the lab, since we were in lockdown when I finished my degree and didn’t get any internship as they were not allowed.

One year ago, I did a front engineering bootcamp in order to complement my skills as a graphic designer and let me tell you, it’s been so hard to find a job… Until now.

Some agency offered me a role as a junior front engineer with some training as it’d be my first time on this role. Problem? The agency works for only adult content partners and dating sites.  
  
Now, I don’t have any personal problems with it as I’m not religious or anything like that. But it scares me to think it could harm my professional development. Salary for this position is pretty good and it feels like it’s the best way to get a foot on this field as a biologist with not much IT/front experience. But it’s not a super wonderful salary and I guess that when I’ll have 3-4 years of experience, I’ll want to move to better roles with the experience which this time as a front engineer will have provided me.  
  
Now, the name of the agency is not explicit at all and it’s something like - “insert name” consultants - with no mention of anything nsfw. But it scares me that some years from now someone will ask me what my position entailed and I will have nothing safe to say. I will also add that the agency is not easy to find online and it’s not a popular site which would give me better experience.  Can I just say I had a NDA and wasn’t allowed to talk about it? Will they catch on?
  
Is this a real risk? Am I overthinking everything? I’d appreciate some helpful advice as this will be my first full time job and I’m completely helpless.

18fuhk2,Accountability and Seniority,"I work in a property company where I am a junior manager in client relations. My role is to organise the clients administrative needs, relay necessary information between them and the company and provide recommendations on necessary actions.

We recently had a high stakes problem at a clients property. Myself and the companies senior management team were informed of this by a visiting employee. The situation was investigated by several professionals who all came back with the same recommendation. As this was highly time critical, I accepted the professional recommendation and informed the client of the problem and the decision, as well as the company senior management team.

After hearing this, the decision was overturned the following day by one of the highest ranking senior managers in the company as they believed that an alternative solution may be possible. They informed the whole team that they would now be taking charge. I thanked them and suggested that I would step back but would be following up for regular updates to ensure the client was informed.

Crucially, the decision by the senior manager was higher risk with a longer timeline and more costly for the client but they were confident it was a better solution than we had been recommended.

&#x200B;

Now the question,

&#x200B;

I was called into the CEOs office after this who asked me who in this scenario who was now accountable for having the problem fixed. I responded that accountability had been passed to the senior manager as they were higher ranking and had overturned the original plan with their decision to take charge. I was originally accountable but responsiblity now was monitoring and ensuring that both myself and the client were informed.

The CEO disputed this heavily suggesting that only one can be accountable and that as the one in client relations, the accountability still fell entirely on my shoulders. He said that the loss of money to the client, was my fault and that I would need to chase the manager continually to speed the process up.

Who would you agree with in this situation? Am I correct that accountability for the task lies with the one who is most senior and made the call, or is the CEO correct that the accountability remains with me regardless?",fastcars420,1,1.0,0,1702301131,2023-12-11 13:25:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18fuhk2/accountability_and_seniority/,12,2023

I'm gearing up for a significant career opportunity and could really use your collective wisdom. I've landed an interview for a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) role at an early-stage fintech startup, scheduled for tomorrow. The excitement is real, but so are the nerves!

A bit about the company: They are building a spezialised trading platform that focuses on perpetual futures. They recently secured $8M in seed funding and are now expanding their team (currently <10) to optimize product-market fit and grow their user base.

My background:

* 4 years as Project Marketing Lead at a global marketing powerhouse
* 3 years as Product Marketing Manager at a VC-backed startup

Additionally, I've developed several small-scale B2C projects, achieving mid-five-figure annual revenue. These ventures haven't led to notable exits, but they've been invaluable learning experiences.

Here’s where I need your advice: How can I convince the interviewer (=CEO and founder) that I'm the right fit for this role, despite not having prior CMO/Head of... experience?

18ftlpy,Career Advice: Startup Ecosystem,"Dear Mighty Reddit Mentors,

&#x200B;

I would like your opinion on my strategic career choices - and my future repositioning.  


In the past, mainly during Uni, I interned at companies ranging from Scale-Ups to international Banks to find out what suits me in my future endeavors. Let's say the suite and tie game was not for me :)

After graduating with a Masters in Management I worked for one of the big tech companies as a BD for 2 years. I started my own company, sold it (not a huge profit), and afterward started working in one of my country's most reputable incubators. My aspiration to start this job was always to get a foot in the door with a VC - which is my ultimate goal at the moment. After countless talks, interviews, etc. I received 15+ rejections in the last interview rounds, as some kind of banker always snatches the position because they seem to have more knowledge in the financial field than me (I don't always argue that - but VC especially pre-seed, seed is a peoples business).I understand that and started taking online courses from Wharton and Bocconi in the related fields to showcase my understanding and commitment. 

Anyhow, as the VC space does not seem to be working out for me YET. I am looking for my next step, which ultimately brings me closer to the VC and PE in the long run. 

I have around 4 Years of work experience without the plenty of internships, a master's degree from a ""target university""  and would like to ask, what you would suggest the next step could be?

I am afraid of stepping out and making the ""wrong"" strategic step which does not bring me closer to the field described above.  


The possibilities I am looking at right now are:  
\- VC - keep on trying  
\- CVC's - had no interviews there yet  
\- Innovation Manager  
  \- Big 4  
  \- Banks  
  \- Somehting else ?  
\- Chief of Staff in a scale-up.  


  
What would you suggest?  


Best.

18fst8j,"When boss makes a mistake, its just a mistake, when I make one its a mountain of a mole hill and I'm being disrespectful.","Hello there,

So I have a somewhat decent boss, the best I have had so far since working from 16 over a decade ago. It seems when he makes a big mistake or back-to-back mistakes. It's bygones be bygones, just a slip up, a little mistake. When I forget to reply to an email, that has a deadline of 5 days not within 24 hours I get a lecture and a write-up.

For example, I got a service dog, legit from a charity. To do this I had to cancel a lot of holidays and re-book, a lot are half days. On our system, the manager says he cannot tell half days from full days so you have to let him know in advance.

So I have, every time, I also sent an email, updated and shared my calendar and updated my status message on teams.

With my job, the last 12-24 hours before you go on holiday, you hand over to other co-workers with notes. I planned to do this on Friday Morning, as I went off on holiday Friday afternoon. I log on, to find my queue and all my work gone with a very nasty message regarding the fact I didn't follow protocol to agree to handover to co-workers with decent notes applied and a handover call.

So I said, hey, I am still here till 11am. I was going to do that this morning.

Get a lecture about changing holidays and plans last minute is disrespectful.

Nope this has been booked for over a month, its a half day.

He didnt believe me, I had to send screenshot proof of my booking that he approved in our system, as well as my calendar and email to remind him. Oh its just a mistake move on.

He did it again less than a week and a half later, same nasty message, same routine.

Work is quiet atm, everything is calm, he is not busy he has the time to check.

So I called him out on it, and said if it happens again I would be heading to HR. I mentioned how this didn't happen before I got my service dog what has changed?

He backpedaled hard, apologized, and promised to make a new procedure after his holiday in January. But before this, he assigned me back all my work and told me to go back over it and work till the last minute or he would write me up. Hence I name-dropped HR.

He doesn't just act up like this with me, it's another co-worker another girl as well.",little_miss_bonkers,15,0.8999999761581421,4,1702295460,2023-12-11 11:51:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18fst8j/when_boss_makes_a_mistake_its_just_a_mistake_when/,12,2023

An opportunity has popped up with Hybrid and onsite options and the site itself is 10mins from home (I commute now anywhere from 30mins to 1hr in sometimes horrific traffic). New role is same AMT of money minus some extra perks. Hubby reckons I am getting myself into more problems in a new role with high responsibility and a 90 day probation period to which I don't even know if I am going to pass. Both jobs are for very reputable companies. 
The old role comes with 5X my income in life insurance, shares and a yearly bonus. New role is just the same pay that I am on.
I feel like it's time to move on from my current role and I'm utterly over it. I have become complacent in my existing role and I just turn up for the paycheck (which I'm sure most people do in their jobs). I have nothing left to give and I feel micro managed.
New role is a Mon to Fri gig with a 4.30pm finish. Contract states 40hrs per week plus reasonable hours.
On paper it's the obvious choice but I'm so scared I am making the wrong decision and will have even more additional pressure having to in essence start again.
My work colleagues are AMAZING... Boss is average... And environment can at times be toxic from senior leadership team.
I have a lot to loose as the new role doesn't come with additional bonuses that my existing one has (and it's quite generous so in essence a pay reduction with the new role).... However I would be gaining my commute time and weekends with my family.
I am so so comfortable that moving on is so so so frightening. 
I don't know what choice to make.

18fmm19,Received (surprisingly) negative feedback on my annual assessment. Does this place just not like me?,"Sorry this is a bit of a vent
But after thinking all weekend about it, I still feel pretty shitty..so any advice would be helpful

I recently received my annual assessment from my employer with surprising negative remarks. I'm a fairly self aware person in general and I am constantly gauging for any feedback whether good or bad. I was hired as a dynamic, sorta broad position that assists in multiple departments mostly focused in marketing and  event coordinating (this is a nonprofit of about 25 employees) I'm the newest member of the team and have been here about 10 months.

One thing in particular that happened during my second month of employment, I noticed a lack in posting and engagment across all of our social media pages so I offered to help with posting. I did so completely innocently with the genuine intention of just offering to help...(I was brand new so I was still getting my feel for the whole team dynamic, which is a bit challenging as I am one of about 10 people working in office while everyone else works from home)

However my boss came to my office saying I offended the marketing coordinator and was made to apologize. Which I did so immediately..still offering any help I could if welcomed to do so. However I was managing a recent large event and again, a complete lack of marketing happening anywhere at all for the event. So I tried very gently asking for any updates ...only to be ignored.
The actual attendance ended up being pretty far under the goal. (75 goal / 45 showed up)

I've also expressed interested in assisting other areas in the marketing department but have been completely ignored as I have been careful to not ""offend"" anyone again.

I have also done several basic designs for things like welcome posters/flyers etc...
We also have a contracted designer,
(that used to be an employee). I noticed that if I send a design out for approval and if the marketing team knows I did it, I will receive criticism. However if everyone thinks the contracted designer did it, the design will receive praise. (Even when I'm the one that did it) 

I was marked down on my assessment for ""not being a good enough team player"". When I'm literally just trying to be apart of the team! As well as ""not contributing enough during our meetings""...if I could be a part of the team then I would be able to contribute more, and I dont want to offend anyone by offering help again.
Plus even when I do try to talk during meetings, I'm the last person to share so everyone is just rushing to get off the zoom.

I don't even know what to do.

The purpose of the assessment is to basically determine whether or not we deserve a raise to which mine was minimal (I make $65,000 and my raise was $2k, with no bonus)
 BUT they also changed my pay from salary to hourly. (It seems pretty convenient timing too as I just completed a massive project that would have given me 20+ hours of overtime last week had I been an  hourly employee)

Does this place just hate me? It certainly feels that way. Or are they trying to get me to quit?

The whole salary to hourly seems fairly suspect too.

I started looking for new jobs and applying places but I have only worked here for 10 months, so that doesn't look great on a resume.

It sucks because before this assessment, I genuinely really liked my job a lot. I didn't know they harbored all these shitty feelings (even though I've always asked and been receptive to feedback)
This is just a bummer.

What would you do in this situation?",DeliciousDopamine,5,0.699999988079071,16,1702270261,2023-12-11 04:51:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18fmm19/received_surprisingly_negative_feedback_on_my/,12,2023

Just a quick career question which I feel like I'm over thinking but perspective might be good. 

I have recently returned to an industry which I want to progress in after a 1.5 year family break in a more relaxed role. I'm now 2 months in now with an employer who I chose as it was the best suited at the time. I have since seen a few roles pop up which I'm very interested in.

Question is, should I wait it out with this employer for x amount more time and explore a new role. Or have a stab at the other roles. 

For context, i'm suitably happy with my current role which is a consultancy based roles but the other roles are future progressions into anyway.

18fkpfk,Which engineering company do I pick to intern for?,"So I  will try my best to explain my situation without doxing myself. But to preface I am a mechanical engineer only needing 1 more class to finish my undergraduate and then moving on to do a masters in robotics. I am still questioning the direction I want to go in my career, but I would really hope to work on consumer electronics, robotics, and or autonomous vehicles. I already had a manufacturing internship at a very large company under my belt to preface.

  
I recently accepted an internship offer at an EV company as a manufacturing/controls intern, I would be working on the robots on the assembly line etc. . I was very excited for this role even though it would be during the spring semester and even though I wanted to stray away from having a ""manufacturing"" role and go more into design/R&D if possible. However, I figured having that company name on my resume and robotics experience would be huge for my career even if it will force me to take a summer class before graduating from my undergraduate. I also had a plan to join an autonomous vehicle lab at my university over the summer (not paid). Because of the location though I do not think I would stay here for a full time offer.

  
However, accepting this offer didn't stop me from interviewing as I thought the practice and connections with recruiters would be helpful. However, I ended up getting an offer for my #1 dream company though for a role I am not the most excited for (Manufacturing Quality Engineer intern)  but DEFINITELY in an industry I want to be in . (Think FAANG or MAANG). However the internship for this would be much longer starting this winter and through the entire summer. 

  
So I would not be able to finish my final undergraduate class until the Fall to start my masters program on time (though I can easily defer it to the next semester). Also I would have a harder chance of joining the AV lab for reasons.

  
Anyways what does Manufacturing Quality Engineering entail? I have done research but I haven't found the greatest answers. Which role is more likely to help me towards my career goals? I am also scared of pigeon holing myself in as a ""Manufacturing Engineer"" especially with the new dream company offer is that a valid concern? Or would the weight of FAANG on my resume help me break out of that? I would love to work at that company under a different role one day (Product Design, Robotics, Controls, Systems, etc.) but what would be the better route?  Also I would have to renege on the previous offer which I wouldn't enjoy doing but would probably be willing to for this company.

  
I also do have time in my masters for 1 more internship. So I could possibly try to go for that company next year? Though since they seem to mainly do 6 month+ internships I may have to further delay graduating from my masters if I were to come back to that same company again which may be annoying.

  
Id love any advice even on anything I didn't ask specifically. Thank you so much?

  
TLDR (sorta): EV manufacturing controls intern vs FAANG/MAANG quality engineer intern at a dream company (love company but not as much the role though I am unsure if I may even dislike it for sure). Which is better if I waned to pivot away from manufacturing in the future and go into consumer electronics, robotics, and or autonomous vehicles. is FAANG really worth to take my chance immediately? Should I try again next year and hope I have another chance? Do the skills of a Manufacturing Quality Engineer make me hireable for the job types I prefer want? Answer as much as you can and even more than I ask if possible!

I am waiting to hear back from a tech startup tomorrow for a talent acquisition role and the salary was listed at 60-65k.

18fk95o,Boss gave me feedback to be humble :/,"I'm a Sr. Manager in a major financial company and I recently received year end feedback from my boss. Overall it was good feedback. This year in May, I was moved to an extremely high momentum role in a critical project. I wasn't given any training or transition. I was expected to hit the ground running and I did so. We successfully launched the project 2 weeks before the deadline in Nov and we're the first team to do so in the company. 

Personally I have learnt a lot and enjoyed myself. I love working. In the feedback, my boss told me that 2 coworkers mentioned that I am no longer as soft spoken as I was before my move and I'm now a lot different. I requested for any specific examples and he just said that before my move I wasn't as strong and pushy as I am now. He told me it's important to be humble. 

I'm taken aback and slightly concerned that I've come across as arrogant or cocky because that's absolutely not me (or atleast don't want to be). I fully understand this is just a job and we're all just making a living at the end of the day. In my recollection I've never been disrespectful or even rude. However, I am someone who holds people accountable given the timelines and am blunt when it comes to commitments across teams. Im super passionate about the products we build and bring a lot of questions to forums. Also, because our org is aggressive, there are a lot of people who are very arrogant and constantly play power politics which I'm consciously avoidant of.

How do I improve my personality and be more humble? Should I connect with few coworkers to understand more? I'll admit I do have a strong personality but I'm well spoken and polite. I don't want to be timid but also not come across as arrogant.

Is specific BI software being used in majority of businesses or are most still using excel templates? Just looking for advice before I invest/waste my time on the wrong software.

18fgdkr,Electrician or Doctor?,"Currently in a situation where I can take over my Dad's electrical contracting business or go to medical school. My dad has been a licensed solo electrician for 35+ years. He just recently retired a few months ago, but he still picks up jobs here and there whenever he is bored. He built another business on the side as well, that basically runs itself. Being a solo electrician he was able to purchase a million dollar house, multiple nice cars, go on vacations, and put all his children through college. I recently got accepted to medical school and it's making me rethink everything. Medical school will take atleast 7+ and will cost anywhere from 400k-500k in student loans. The hours, exams, and routine will definitely suck, but getting through it will basically guaranteed a 250k+ salary for the rest of my life. I'll eventually pay off my loans and will live a comfortable upper middle class life in any location I want. On the other hand, I can take over the family business and become an electrician. Since my dad is retired, I would need to spend the next few years working at a local company as an apprentice/journeyman and work my way up till i can get my license. Once i'm licensed, I'll take over my dad's business and have a full book of clients. I'll build a website, advertise, and eventually hope to slowly scale up the business and hire a team full-time. What's pushing me in this direction is the idea of making money now, having no loans, and being my own boss. As opposed to working hours on end in a hospital, getting a paycheck, and spending the next 7+ years training to become a doctor. Both my parents would rather me become a doctor, but my dad says he's gonna support me regardless. Their argument is that being an electrician is ""backbreaking, blue-collar, dangerous work"", while being a doctor is ""white collar, respectful, and prestigious"". To me I don't really care much about the title. Sure being a doctor sounds cool, but being self employed sounds even better. It's inspiring to see my my dad purchase his dream house, build multiple businesses, and never have to worry about losing his job, company layoffs, etc. This was all on his own. I'm motivated to take our family business to the next level, even if it means getting paid like shit while I learn the next few years. I know it's a lot of people's dreams to become a doctor, and I'd be throwing away a great opportunity, but I feel as though the pros and cons aren't really even debatable. Many doctors hate their jobs and work ridiculous hours. Reddit, does what i'm saying make sense? Or am I being shallow? What sounds like the better move?",SolutionAccording435,1,0.6000000238418579,19,1702250471,2023-12-10 23:21:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18fgdkr/electrician_or_doctor/,12,2023
18fg4qv,I need to switch careers ASAP and need suggestions,"I've been at my first job out of college for 1.5 years now and the stress, workload, and dullness of it have been ruining my life. I work for a financial company and my job is an amalgamation of accounting, data entry, and troubleshooting data problems with the awful software we use. My salary is only 55K and my latest raise wasn't even a quarter of the inflation rate. 

I was an econ major at a good liberal arts college, and I graduated with honors. I decided I wasn't going to pursue a career in accounting since I don't enjoy working exclusively with numbers. Ironically, I ended up in a job that deals entirely with numbers, pays less than entry-level accounting jobs, and comes with longer hours and more stress. I was impatient due to graduating without a job lined up and hastily took the first offer I received. Now I'm paying the price.  

I'm starting to realize that I have zero passion or even interest in a finance career. I've explored the other jobs within my company, and they all sound dreadful to me. I simply don't care about investment research, trading, analytics, or really anything else along those lines. In college, I excelled in classes in political science, communications, and journalism, but I didn't major in any of them due to my naïve perception that there are no jobs in those fields. I was an idiot and concentrated all my effort on a career path that I knew I wouldn't enjoy.

I really want to find a job/career that isn't so quantitative, but I'm having difficulty thinking of things to look for. I would really appreciate and ideas or suggestions that you guys may have. Seriously, I'm desperate to get out of this hell and any ideas would be helpful to me at this point.

I therefore ask for your assistance in brainstorming possible long term career or industry options. I'd evaluate having to go through another MSc to re-specialize completely. Apparently, even roles like Data Engineer / Data Scientist / Actuary have multiple hours of calls per day, which I cannot manage.

18fc0s2,"I have two choices at the moment: which would you pick, and why?","copywriter or an author. Those are the two choices I have to pick from. Why those two? Because I have seen signs of what seems to be an inmate affinity for words, and I would feel unfulfilled if I don't explore and cultivate it. I narrowed down my choices, and these two are what I am left with. I would feel really fulfilled if I were to be an author, but it would take investment of time, effort, and at least 3 years + of my life. (I'm 22  yo male)

I just got out of nursing school, and would start a one year internship program next year, and I also want to use that opportunity to work on one of these two possible future career paths, and see what would become of me. I constantly have panic attacks whenever I abandon anything writing related for a while, and I cannot Begin to imagine how much pain and regret I would go through if, at the end of my life, I don't become a writer in some way, or form. Another major hindrance, time and effort asides, would be the current state of my nation, Nigeria. The country is propped to frustrate any thought or plan to dream, and quite frankly, i feel everyone is too busy trying to survive to read and listen to you talk about philosophy, simply because You're interested in it. To wrap up, I considered the following things:

1- time required to break in: copywriting would be far much easier for me because it's a high income skill, and also because, like I pointed out earlier, anything writing related is where I feel able to learn faster. Being an author, I feel, would take much more time and effort to invest in, especially to see rewards monetarily. I say monetarily because Nigeria is, in a way, set up to frustrate you if you don't survive

2. Fulfillment: I would feel fulfilled being an author and speaker, as I see that I'm more suited to that role, compared to business oriented writing, which copywriting is. 

3. Impact: I might be biased to this, but I can significantly impact more as an author, than as a copywriter. I would really love to see how my work helps people live better lives, especially Africans.

Although I haven't been completely exhaustive, I believe I've been able to paint quite fair a picture of what situation I find myself. Any word of advice would be appreciated.

I currently work as a Mechanical Engineer for a big corporation focusing on industrial mechanical engineering equipment, which is quite old-fashioned (\~1.5 years with the company, \~5 years overall), however I serve the main business from a support organization and I don't really enjoy the toxic work environment nor the actual tasks and I am quite unhappy with the role as there is no career growth for me, I see myself stuck in a rut and the work-life balance is not that great as well. My red flags here are related to low career growth potential, having to work as a support for the main organization as well as unpleasant duties and some toxic colleagues. I feel that in my current role, my mental health took a hit.  
  
I was offered a role as a Senior Consultant in Sustainability for one of the Big 4 Companies, however the net salary is about 1/3 less than what I currently earn, so the salary decrease is quite big I'd say. I hope to obtain just a better career growth as I won't serve a main organization, nor I will be within a support organization, and I'm hoping also for a better work culture and environment. The working hours for my current jobs are: 9AM-5PM and for the Consultant Role would be 9AM-6PM.  
  
Any similar experiences or opinions are highly welcomed. Thank you!  
  
In my current role I see no growth potential career-wise, whereas with the Consultant role I see myself leaning more towards business-management and growing from there. I hope I'm not just dreaming. Most people I talked with about this topic, advised me not to pursue this path as it's a big mistake. Is there any hope for career growth in Consulting within Big4?

About 8 months ago, I was asked to head up a struggling dept and get it back on track. I was a dept head elsewhere with strong performance.

Recently, my boss told me now that I’ve gotten the dept on track, what would I like to focus on in the new year and he hinted at potentially helping out a peer dept. (There’s a gap between my current boss and myself that is not filled that historically oversaw my dept and my two peer depts)

I’d like to take on more responsibility and add formal oversight of my peer dept which would necessitate a promotion. But I have never asked for a promotion before (candidly, I’ve been pretty fortunate and just been given every promotion I’ve received).

18f78jl,Please help me choose between these two jobs offers,"Hi everyone,

I'll try listing the 2 options as precisely as possible. TIA! 

A little about me: I've been an RN for 5.5 years, am a morning person, and always eager to learn more. I value work/life balance greatly due to  health issues. I plan on continuing to work part time (ideally 32 hours) for the next 3-5 years until my husband and I want to expand our family, then id find a per diem position. 

Right now, I'm at a crossroad and don't know which to choose.

Job #1: Hospice RN Case Manager 
- Current/former job for the past 4 years 
- Day shift, 8-4:30, flexible schedule
- Option to work 32 hours or 40 hours per week 
- Get to practice my second language (intermediate level Spanish) since my manager assigns me these pts. Downside: can be difficult doing a this job in my nonfluent language. 
- Have a history of compassion fatigue, burnout, and anxiety. Have since realized I need to take my PTO days and probably go to 32 hours.
- Offering me $6 raise to come back 
- Requires driving 30-60 miles per day 
- I truly love my coworkers and managers, who came to my wedding in September 
- Required to work every 4th weekend. Can get mandated for short staffing on eves/nights
- Required to work 2-3 holidays per year
- Confident in my skills at this job. Can get certified as CHPN. Options for expanding career are limited.

****

Job #2: Med Surg RN on Post Surgical Unit (with possible opportunity to pick up shifts per diem at my former job or this job)
- Evening shift 3-11:30 (worried I'll have difficulty adjusting), less schedule flexibility
- Opportunities to learn new skills and experiences (can get certified in IV, wound care)
- 24 hours per week 
- Offering $2 raise and $25k sign on bonus over 2 years
- Not really sure what manager/coworkers are like (yet).
- 0.25 mile commute (I can see the hospital from my kitchen window)
- Required to work every other weekend and holidays.

I think my former job has the better offer with the weekends and $6 raise, I feel dumb not taking it as it really works out well for me, but I don't want to regret not taking this opportunity to try something new. I'm not sure if my former hospice RN position will be available for too much longer, so I feel I need to make a decision. Also worried about burning bridges with the hospital with many opportunities so close to my home. 

I don't know what to do, any advice is appreciated!",mspeekie,1,0.5,1,1702225718,2023-12-10 16:28:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18f78jl/please_help_me_choose_between_these_two_jobs/,12,2023
18f6n30,Is it worth it to get a degree online? 29F wasted my life I a struggling,"Basically I have a lot of regrets in my life. I dropped out of school in my last semester of a Bsc in Biomed engineering. That was the second time I had dropped out during junior year and went back and finished junior year but could not graduate. My mental health was bad and I was in another country alone. Then I went back home stayed without doing much for 8 months and then got accepted into med school in my country but dropped out on my second year during the pandemic. Again my mental health and my avoidance of things affected me. I have no excuse really. I just suck. Then I started a remote job where I have been working call center for 3 years now.  But I make 4$ an hour before deductions and it can be very miserable at times .

Now to my question, I have always wanted to be a professor that was I wanted to do when i first graduated high school and that hasnt changed since then. I think I could be a good teacher. I am thinking of doing a Bsc degree in the Open university. Now I have some savings from  working but if I do this it will wipe me out.  And I will have to spend most of my money I make on tuition. The pro is that if I can get it done in 3 years vs trying to do in person probably 5 years. Ideally after I get the degree I get it validated in my country then become a HS math teacher then later get a master's degree and try to teach at university in my country. Maybe I dont know if it possible. Or if I get started with this if it can give me hope of landing a better job even if it isnt teaching.

18f5o16,What Industry Can I Transition To?,"Hi all. So I’m 27 years old. I have a 4 year degree in Parks, Recreation, and Tourism Management from one of the top 5 PRT programs in the US. This has led me into the Hospitality industry, specifically luxury resorts. 

I have had a very successful first 6 years or so and have really built a name for myself in this industry. But the reality is, this industry isn’t sustainable for me. I work every weekend, holiday, and constantly am putting in 60+ hour weeks for a yearly salary that is less than local teachers make. I haven’t spent Thanksgiving or Christmas with my family in 6 years. I’ve never taken a vacation. I’ve lost most of my friends growing up because it’s impossible to stay in touch with my schedule. I’d also like to settle down and date, but it’s near impossible when I’m working when everyone else is off. To top it off, hotels and resorts recorded record profits in ‘21 and ‘22 because of staffing issues. Now hotels and resorts are intentionally running on skeleton crews to maximize profits and are expecting their salaried operational managers and leaders to fill in the gaps this leaves, further pushing the hours worked. All to live paycheck to paycheck. Then when guest satisfaction dips as a result, we don’t get our bonuses.

I just can’t do it anymore. I need to make a change to something that is Monday-Friday. But the problem is I just don’t know what my experience translates to. I’m not sure what roles and positions I can transition to in other industries. I’m a people person who is very good with numbers, which is one of the reasons I’ve done well in this industry.

18f4n5v,Older new colleague competing like HS,"I currently accepted a job where I’m right now training with two other people. It looks like the other one is a much older gentleman in his mid to late 50s. LinkedIn gave me a suggestion and I saw that this guy was actually customer support manager for our company before a merger that happened two years ago. So he was basically support manager for 15 years until 2017 and he quit to do his own thing (real estate stuff) and now it looks like he’s back but got to a way way demoted position of entry level onboarding. Company requires a lot of experience with their softwares (kinda like Microsoft) so I’m starting from the bottom since I came from fintech. 
My coworker (let’s name him William) doesn’t seem to know how to use support software and tries to “teach”
Me and the other new hire zendesk tools when we both already had prior support experience and know that software really well. 
He would also like to ask questions on Teams and if I reply and help him, he doesn’t directly address me but he would just sort of speak to himself “oh I think I get it now” etc.

Moving forward after that I stopped helping him out and not reacting to any of his distracting comments on Teams.

I’m considering to ask my manager to move to move me to another bigger team they trained before. How do I work well with this person moving forward? Just try to avoid and ignore them?

18f4fv5,Should I switch jobs?,"**My current job:**  
Pros:

* know the entire team and have some ""friends"" (we don't hang out outside of work but we have fun)
* decent salary + OK bonus
* stock options that vest the longer I stay
* very stable long term contract (as far as a startup can ever be ""very stable"", but still!)
* great work/home balance: I can work from home 50% of the time, get to leave early to pick up my kid as long as I finish my work
* I feel very much at home at this company, people know me and I can be myself  


Cons:

* took a job there way below my level with the (mutual) plan to get to a higher level as the company grew --> this never happened, so I feel stuck doing dull work
* talked about my role (and level) several times but due to the start-up environment the only thing I get is ""you can do the work you like on the side, but you cannot stop doing your current tasks""
* the work culture, although my direct colleagues are mostly great, is not very good due to bad management/C-level

&#x200B;

**Other job offer:**

* higher salary
* a lot more vacation days
* much more interesting, challenging workload.   
However, all the other pros I might lose and I feel very uncertain about switching jobs while I have it pretty good where I am.

&#x200B;

I guess what I'm trying to figure out is: what's more important, the content/tasks of my job or all the other stuff that comes with a job? I feel like I'm getting a little dumber every day at work doing shit tasks, but I feel so scared that if I leave, I'll regret it and never find such a place again where I can just be myself.

&#x200B;

Does the fact that I'm hesitant mean it's not the right time to switch? Will I ""just know"" when the right opportunity comes by and not feel this way? Will I regret rejecting this job offer when in a few years nothing else has come by and by then I've been out of the field for too long?

18f41a5,How should I go about my jobs pushback for extra compensation?,"Hey guys! I’m 23 and I’m a home manager for a company where we work with people who have disabilities and help them to become more independent. I work in the consumers actual homes, 12 hour shifts, 3x/week unless I’m needed on days they can’t find extra coverage, and have to have a min of 40hrs/week which could be reached by working at home. I am a live in manager so I basically have my rent and bills paid for. At the end of September, there was another manager who went through an incident and long story short is not here anymore. Since then, they have expected me to add her workload to mine without offering any extra compensation. At first I didn’t mind because I was hoping good karma would come my way, but I’m tired of waiting. Plus, our company is now going through a massive change and will ultimately be downsizing. My position will not be needed anymore, but they have offered something new. The only thing is that it would be a demotion and my ultimate goal with my career was to work my way up. If I’m gonna have to go through a demotion then I’m just gonna go find something else instead because I’d also have to start paying rent and bills since I wouldn’t be a live in anymore. I have asked for a $4 raise since I am doing extra work that I did not initially sign up for. We are so short staffed that it is not even funny. I have found myself having to work 30 extra hours on top of my 40hrs/week because there is no one to cover. I don’t make any overtime pay because I am a live in.

We have a company party coming up and we have team members all over the country so, in my small team it'll just be me and my boss (though he's part of a larger team and has lots of connections)

Anyway if I show up, are they going to kind of be reminded that I live close and ask my boss to start having me work from the office? They just invested into an extension on the office space which they're proud of about a year ago.

18f26rz,Need help deciding career move,"Hi all,

Current job is mostly remote but I need to attend events several times a year (an hour away or more) because management feels it’s important that we socialize together. The events are during work hours but I find them extremely uncomfortable. New job would also be remote with a few in person meetings (also over an hour away), but no forced parties or events.

Job 1: pay is low 70’s and company contributes 10% to retirement from day 1. I’ve been there for 2 years and will be vested in one more year. I plan to retire in 7 years. 
Job 1 has good health care, lots of time off (6 weeks vacation), a separate sick time bank with lots of time available at full pay. Job is easy but boring, no one else is involved with what I do so I just kind of do my own thing and get the job done. I work alone but have check ins with management from time to time. 

Job 2 pays about 12k more per year. Company contributes 5% after 2 years and it’s 3 years to be vested. Heath care is decent but not as good as job 1, higher deductible and costs $50 more per month. No sick time, just a pool of 20 days per year to use for all time off. They do have free disability ins but it doesn’t cover full pay and takes a few months to kick in when you’re out. Job is familiar work but I’d be learning a lot of new things and working with a small team of people, one of whom I already know fairly well. Job 2 requires 5 more hours per week on the clock, but that isn’t much of an issue since it’s remote.

Neither job has bonuses but both have yearly increases of about 4%.

I’m sure I’d enjoy job 2 more but would I be making a mistake to give up the retirement and all the time off benefits? Does the extra 12k a year make up for that? I’m healthy with no issues atm.

18f08sh,"Need Career Advice: Company with a good manager but company-wide promotion freeze, or a company with a manager giving negative vibes but better total compensation?","I am currently working in a junior role in a company that is still in the midst of recovering from COVID, (tourist industry). Promotions and salary increments have been frozen for 3 years. I genuinely enjoy working with my team and reporting manager, and I have been assured that I am in line for a promotion. However, the promotion freeze is a directive from the board of directors, and my hiring manager and their superior have limited influence in this matter.  
  
Recently, a recruiter from another company approached me for a senior role, and I agreed to an interview. However, during the interview, the hiring manager gave me negative vibes. Her tone was condescending, reminiscent of an English teacher addressing a primary school student. She seemed rigid in her questioning, and when my responses didn't align with her preconceived answers, she became defensive. I had to spend 20 minutes convincing her of my answer to a simple question. It was a very exhausting experience, and I can't imagine dealing with this on a day-to-day basis if I were to join her team. Despite this, I was surprised to receive an offer, albeit for a junior role instead of the initially discussed senior position. The total compensation is attractive, and the another company remains unaffected by COVID, allowing for potential bonuses.  
  
To summarize my situation, I am faced with an offer from another company for a role similar to my current one. While the compensation is appealing, I am concerned about the negative impression I got from the hiring manager. Had it not been for her attitude, I might have considered taking a chance with this new opportunity. My current company is on a recovery path from the impact of COVID, and I am content with my team and reporting manager. The only drawback is the promotion freeze, and I feel the need to avoid being stuck in the same role for an extended period, as it could adversely affect my resume.  
  
I feel I have 4 options currently:  
  


1. Transition to the new company, hoping that the red flags I observed during the interview do not indicate a toxic management style.
2. Utilize the offer letter from the other company as leverage for a promotion in my current workplace. I am aware that some colleagues from another team were promoted as a counteroffer when they tendered their resignations, so I think it is not impossible for me to do the same.
3. Communicate with the other company about the compatibility issues I observed during the interview and inquire whether there are opportunities in a different team that might be a better fit for my skills.
4. ""I understand the rationale behind not accepting a counteroffer; at the same time, the offer from another company raises some red flags. Perhaps it is better to not alert my current company, pass on the offer from the other company, and continue my job hunt.

2 more new grads joined my department as QAs, but only 1 of them is working on the same project as me. The guy on the other project received 6 months of training, but my friend and I on the same project only received 2 weeks of training and were expected to start working on things immediately. We were quite lost as a result, but I was able to catch up quickly.

My manager was a sweet person, and very happy with me and often commented on how well im doing despite being a new grad, and that I was on my way to receiving bonuses and becoming the top employee in the team. However, this manager quit 6 months into my role. My new manager is not the nicest person, and often yells at people during meetings and has been firing people left and right since she joined. 

Anyways, the new manager has not had any 1:1 meeting with me. Her manager (the director) asked me 3 months ago how things are going, and I mentioned that my manager never talks to me unless it’s through the team lead, so she said that our manager should be setting up 1:1s to know where things are at. This never happened. Furthermore, my manager never had a performance review with me despite me receiving HR reminders for it since October — I tried asking her about it, and she told me to ignore the emails about it. She also didn’t set any goals for next year. I decided to hold back my question about the 8% bonus mentioned in my job offer.

I found out from my 2 new grad coworkers that while they also haven’t heard about their performance review yet, the manager has set goals with them and already told them a few weeks ago that they’d be receiving bonuses of $5000  soon. I was shocked to hear this as I have been told that i’m a top performing employee throughout my first year, especially by my previous manager, and don’t understand why I am being excluded from these things.

Do you guys have any advice on how to approach this matter? Should I ask for a bonus? Should I complain to the manager’s manager that  I don’t know where i’m at due to the lack of 1:1 meetings? 

I am worried that I will anger my boss, since she didn’t take it too well when I asked about the goal setting meeting. I have worked hard and am really confused and hurt.",muse_kimtaehyung,1,1.0,0,1702189157,2023-12-10 06:19:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ex7ts/im_a_new_grad_and_have_been_in_my_current_role/,12,2023

18ex2lu,Quit job,"Today, I resigned from the internship at the company. At 9 am, I messaged my boss, asking if he was available to meet at Cafe A. He agreed for 9:30 am.

I rushed to the cafe by 9:15, ordered black coffee for my boss (his favorite), and a brown one for myself.

At 9:30, my boss arrived, asking, ""What's going on?"" I smiled, asking if he sensed anything. He didn't, so I revealed my decision to resign.

For the next hour and a half, we discussed various matters. My boss gave advice and shared insights, emphasizing that understanding would come in a few years.

I'll keep updating him occasionally. I chose this approach to maintain a friendly relationship even after our professional paths diverge.

By 11 am, I returned to the office, submitting resignation letters to my two managers at 11:30. I thanked them and expressed gratitude for their support.

Some might find this process elaborate for an intern, but it's my minimal courtesy and respect. Treat others as you want to be treated.

Though my time here was short, it was meaningful. I reflected on the coincidences that led me here, appreciating the connections.

Before joining, my teacher advised caution and offered to read my horoscope. I declined, believing in self-analysis and decision-making without regret.

Looking back, I've no regrets. Every experience brought valuable lessons, forming a cohesive narrative in my life.

While not religious, I believe things happen by design or fate, emphasizing the importance of connections and destiny.

This is a small event in Chapter II of my life story, to be shared with my Golden Retriever at age 30. 🤣🤣🤣

I have a previous internship as a logistics intern and have a supply chain internship for next summer. While this area does interest me, is this a good field to go down in  a financial sense? I have heard through a school advisor that this field does not pay much and I would ideally like to make six figures (CAD) once I have established myself more in this field. Is this realistic, and if so how can I set myself up for success in this field? Is there a specific branch in supply chain or logistics that pays more?

18ewpmr,Should I drop out of physio school or not?,"Sorry for the long post and might be a bit too personal but there are a lot of things that are important factors to be taken into consideration and they are all pieces of puzzles for a bigger picture. I apologize if it’s disorganized but I have tried my best.

**Some quick background info about me and my family:**

* I am a Canadian but my parents are not
* My parents and my home are not in Canada
* I have spent most of my adult life in Canada

I am 27 years old and I am from Canada. I am currently enrolled in an MPT program in Australia, I am in my first year and just finished my first semester last month. Unfortunately, I failed one of my courses and it got me thinking if it’s worth it to repeat and continue pursuing this degree, especially seeing a lot of posts mentioning mediocre pay and young physios getting out of the profession.

I will start with my background. I graduated with a kinesiology degree 3 years ago in Canada. When I was in uni, I already knew physio was my dream job. But my GPA wasn’t good enough so I buried my hope for a while. After graduating, I didn’t know what to do with my kin degree. So I planned to visit my family and stay for a few months then return to Canada to get a job. But Covid hit and I was stuck there, I didn’t want to be a slave for a company so I did what I was good at and what I had been doing in uni: freelance personal training. I did that for 1.5 years and unfortunately I didn’t get a lot of clients, I was earning barely higher than minimum wage. Looking back, that 1.5 years seemed like a waste of time.

At one point I started researching overseas options and discovered that MPT programs are easier to get into in Australia. I didn’t think much and applied to a few schools and received one offer. The tuition however was astronomical to us ($75k cad for the entire 2-year program). Regardless, my parents were very supportive and wanted me to do it although it would cost most of their savings. I thought this was too big of a decision and risk to take so I decided to defer my offer for one year, return to Canada to work and save up as much money as possible while taking time to make the decision.

Unfortunately, that didn’t end up well either. I was unemployed for 2 months after applying to countless jobs on Indeed even including McDonald’s and Walmart. I was desperate and had to work at a sweatshop for 2 months making minimum wage. Then I was lucky enough to land a half-decent job, I worked as an office coordinator at a small furniture design & manufacturing company for half a year until the deadline for accepting my school offer was near. I then trusted my gut and decided to do it.

***TLDR:*** *I am a complete fuck-up. I have already made a lot of mistakes and wasted most of my 20's. I have practically achieved nothing in life career-wise and I have zero savings, getting closer to 30 I am starting to panic. I can't afford to fuck around anymore and make any more wrong decisions. I have chosen to pursue PT but now I don't know if it's worth it for me to finish it although it's my dream.*

Fast forward to now, I have already put down $18k cad toward my tuition and finished my first semester. Unfortunately, I failed one of my courses and I would need to re-take it next year. This means two things: 1. I would be graduating 1 year late and 2. It would cost an extra $10k to re-take the course. I did some math and it’s starting to look like it’s a bad investment (I will illustrate below). Because of this, I have to take a step back and reevaluate if I should continue with my degree. I will list the key points below to make it easier to understand and weigh out the pros & cons.

**Cost to complete MPT:**

* $75k (tuition)
* $100k opportunity cost (working instead of studying, assuming I make around $4-4.5k a month for 2 years)
* ***Total = $175k cad***

(already disregarding the fact of having to graduate 1 year late)

**My timeline:**

* 18-24: At uni for my kinesiology degree in Canada (graduated 2 years late since I switched my major)
* 24-26: Originally planned to visit parents for a few months then back to Canada to start working, but stuck due to Covid; worked as a freelance personal trainer
* 26-27: Went back to Canada; unemployed for 2 months; worked for a sweatshop for 2 months; worked an office job for half a year
* 27-now: PT school first semester done

**About me and some of my thoughts:**

* I have never really enjoyed life and I have sacrificed the majority of my 20’s for school
* I want to reunite with my family
* I have hardly ever traveled and I have always wanted to travel in Europe and the US to see the world, I don’t want to have to wait until I am 30-40 to do this, it’s just not the same
* I have never owned a car and always wanted to own one, just simple things like going on hikes & road trips and having the freedom to go wherever I want to go can already make me very happy in life but this can’t happen until I finish school

**What I like the most about being a physio:**

* It’s what I love
* Flexibility (might not need to work fixed hours?)
* Ability to work in different countries
* Versatility of taking online clients and building an online business with social media
* Laid-back job nature (compared to many other jobs)
* Possibility to open a clinic

**If I continue with PT school:**

* (+) I would love what I do for a living since it’s my dream job
* (+) Plus all the perks I listed above on what I like about being a physio (e.g. being able to travel in different countries)
* (+) I would be guaranteed a decent-paying job and I would never have to worry about being unemployed or not making enough money (being a physio might not make you rich but it guarantees you would at least have a decent life)
* (-) It would cost me and my family \~$175k
* (-) My parents would need to continue to work in old age to support me until I graduate
* (-) I would be graduating at 30 with zero savings and tons of debt
* (-) I would pay off my debt from school at around 32-33 still with zero savings
* (-) It will take an extra 2.5 years until I can start sponsoring my parents to immigrate to Canada
* (-) My partner and I would continue to be broke and live like hell to save up money, we would be barely surviving and wouldn't have a life
* (-) The amount of money and time invested vs the pay doesn’t seem like a good investment

**If I drop out of PT school:**

* (+) My family and I would save \~$175k
* (+) I can start sponsoring my parents to immigrate to Canada 2.5 years sooner; which would fulfill their dream and I could finally reunite with them
* (+) I will be able to finally afford a car
* (+) I can go on working holidays across Europe and the US which has been my dream
* (+) I can possibly have a career established before turning 30
* (+) I can actually have a life and do things I want to do without worrying too much about money (e.g. eat out, go on trips, go skiing, go to theme parks, carnivals, gun ranges, etc. things like these are usually luxuries and out of reach in our lives)
* (-) I would lose the $18k that I already put down toward my tuition for nothing (but not much of a loss compared to $175k?)
* (-) I would give up my dream job
* (-) Less job security; kinesiology is not a profession
* (-) Depending on my job nature, I might lose the perks I listed above of being a physio
* (-) The pay of my future job might be worse or better than being a physio but I won’t know for sure

I have seen quite some people here commenting that they are making merely $5k to 6.5k cad a month with 4-8 years of experience and it blows my mind. It makes me question if I should really just blindly follow my dream.

But then even if I choose to drop out and start a career, I am still not sure what I should do even at this point. Some of the things I have in mind are occupational health & safety, ergonomics, exercise physiology, research or program coordinator roles at clinics, community centers (but idk what exactly I can do), etc. But for a lot of these jobs I have no idea of how to get into them, they are not straightforward like professions e.g. physio and nursing, and many require experience. I have also considered government jobs such as the customs, police force, firefighting, etc. but they are harder than expected to get into. One thing I know for sure is I love helping and interacting with people, and I would love working in the healthcare field.

I feel lost and I genuinely don't know what I should do, what would you do if you were me? Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thank you for the patience.",ProfessionalCow1122,1,1.0,2,1702187172,2023-12-10 05:46:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ewpmr/should_i_drop_out_of_physio_school_or_not/,12,2023

18euuiy,How to approach offer negotiations with recruiter when I started a new job 1.5 month ago?,"Hey everyone. I was laid off in early September and was lucky enough to find a new job by the end of October. During my unemployment I interviewed with Disney, whose process has taken about three months. I just finished a final round interview with Disney, and I have a few questions.

1. If I got an offer, how would I approach the conversation with the recruiter when I started a new job 1.5 months ago? Do I tell Disney I’m recently employed with a new company, or do I say I have an ""offer"" with the new company and use it for leverage? As of right now Disney does not know I'm newly employed (when we started the interview process I was unemployed).
2. Will Disney see in their background check that I got hired at another company in late October? If so, would it look bad if I left this new company after only working their for a month? With how long Disney's interview process took, I wouldn't be surprised if they had a lot of candidates who accepted other roles during their interview process, so maybe it wouldn't be as big of a deal as I imagine it.

I know I don't have the offer in hand yet, but I want to prepare myself for if I get the call, as Disney's benefits and pay would be vastly superior to my current new job.

How do I ask for more pay? I just started this and the offer was thru text. They said eventually I will take over for the HR Generalist that is there and I’ll go full time but I don’t even know if the pay will change. I haven’t even gotten an offer letter yet. I want to keep this job but I’m stuck on what to do. Ask for more money or move on to property management. FYI I’m going to school for my bachelors in human services/ non profit.

18esks5,"I was just fired from my first ""real"" engineering role. Was it my fault?","For context, I graduated in 2020 with my BS in Biomedical Engineering. Due to my lack of experience I couldn't get any roles within the industry so I have looked towards more broad roles, like Quality, in hopes of using the experience to allow me to join the medical industry in the future.  
Before I was hired, in the interview process i made it very clear that i don't have manufacturing experience and that I am more than willing and capable of learning as long as I received some training. I was told that there would definitely be training and that they estimate that it takes about 6mos-1year to become comfortable in the role. Great, I agreed and eventually i got my offer and moved forward.  
Upon arriving, I did receive a generic 2 week corporate/hr training but thats it. Anything else was completely on my ability to connect with people to answer my questions.  
No direct responsibilities  
No communication of expectations  
No tasks.  
No follow ups

Nothing!  
I was assigned to a certain area of the factory and was told to ""figure it out"". After about a month I would talk to other new engineers in different departments about their experiences and I found out they had really different experiences. They each had trainers to guide them into their new roles, while I had people around me who didn't know how to teach me some of my certain responsibilities. I also asked my direct lead for help because I felt like I wasn't properly trained to fulfill my role. He asked me why and then brushed it off.  
After about 2 months into this solo education. I was fired because i ""wasnt a right fit for the role.""  
When i asked how i wasnt a right fit I got a generic ""not fufilling job roles"" statement. As my lead walked me out of the facility I asked him ""how could you fire me for not fufilling my role when I asked YOU for help and you brushed me off."" His response: ""being an engineer is being able to figure that out""  
Conclusion:  
The only learning I gained from this:  
ask more about the training/onboarding during the interview process moving forward  
when they mention overtime ask if its paid, how often do they expect me to go over time  
dont be late. take an hour break if I have to.  
I could go on and on about all the weird experiences I had as a new hire here but I really want to know if this is normal for engineering roles. How much fault is really mine?

18ep9kk,"Verbal Job Offer Pending Since Nov 21 - How Long is Too Long, and What Should I Do?","I hope this post finds you well. I'm reaching out seeking advice on a situation that's been on my mind. 

I recently went through a series of interviews with a company, and things seemed positive. The last interview occurred on November 21st, and the recruiter shared the following: ""That was the last interview in the process. The next steps are the team would like to move forward with an offer. I submitted your offer details to be reviewed and approved by management. I will be reaching out to you again shortly with the offer details as soon as they are approved.""

However, it's now December 9th, and I haven't received any updates or a job offer. I understand that these processes can take time, but the lack of communication is starting to make me a bit anxious. I sent a follow-up email on November 29th, where the recruiter responded: ""The offer is being reviewed by my VP this week before it can be sent out to the agency to extend the details. I will give you a call as soon as I get the offer details approved and let the agency recruiter extend the offer to you. I sent it for final approvals today so it should be ready to extend very soon.""

Despite this response, I'm yet to receive any further updates or the actual job offer. I'm unsure about the appropriate course of action at this point. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How long is too long to wait for an offer after the final interview? Considering it's now December 9th, should I follow up again, and if so, what's the best way to phrase my email without coming across as impatient?

I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity and want to handle this situation professionally. Your insights and advice would be immensely valuable.

Thank you in advance.

18en3qs,Are All Office Jobs Like This??,"Are All Office Jobs Like This?

I graduated earlier this year and got my first real job. 6 months in and I'm noticing my coworkers’ tendencies.

Coworker 1
Will try to take credit for work whenever possible. He talks to our manager that successes are achieved though his help and will occasionally purposely try to instigate an issue in front of our manager or other managers. This guy is a straight up ass kisser but is always constantly bitching about people behind their back. He spends his free time around the office lingering around managers’ office doors. I have no idea if what he's doing is working out for him. He constantly mentions the materialistic things he buys as if they're making him look better than he really is. He comes off as a superficial person who rides other people's nuts, trying to pass of other's works as his.

Coworker 2 
He NEEDS to know what everyone does outside of work. He will act highly interested in you, but I get the feeling he does this because he knows from first hand experience that people love talking about themselves (he LOVES talking about himself) and because he uses it as a way to gather intel on people to use as gossip. He is a very charismatic man who loves to walk around the office chatting up with people. I think part of this involves getting attention, recognition, and approval from people. This takes up most of his day. He will use people's personal lives as gossip around the office as some sort of currency to gather even more gossip from people. In my experience talking with Albert, he seems to only talk about himself, gossip about other coworkers, and celebrities.   
One time, I tagged along with him and two others to the lobby because one of our other coworkers, Coworker 4, ordered donuts for another coworker's birthday. Coworker 2 walks in between Coworker 4 and the Door Dasher. He has this grin on this face and asks, ""How was your weekend?!"" The dude just says, ""it was good! how was yours?"" Albert proceeds to go on a 10 minute tirade that he had 20 people over at his backyard to grill and that he had drank a whole bunch of booze and then outdrank everyone. He went on and on and on. The door dasher was trying to leave but didn't know how to end the convo. My other coworkers were just laughing and were completely invested in Coworker 2’s story. I thought it was sad that Coworker 2 asked the guy how his weekend was to only springboard the conversation about himself. This guy cannot take criticism. When he had turned in a report, I pointed out that it looked great but there were two minor errors. He started talking over me once I started explaining. He quickly changed the subjects and continued talking over me. I've had this happen every time I've had the chance to work with him. There was one time when he walked around the hallway and bumped into another coworker. He didn't even apologize and talked about how he was looking at a picture on the wall and that if they had changed the picture’s placement, people wouldn't bump into each other at the corner. Lastly, anytime someone new joins and stops by our floor to introduce themselves, he is the first person to run out of his chair and introduce the new person to everyone. He'll then proceed to bring them to an empty office and talk about all his experience at his previous job and at the current workplace. He spends more time with new people talking about himself than the new person saying hi to our whole team combined! One time, I had gone to print something and passed by the office he leads the new person to. Before they got out, I heard him say, ""If you ever need any help, I am always available."" Like what!? This dude talks about himself and then makes it seem like it was all just to reassure the new person that someone experienced is there to help them. 

Coworker 3
This guy will never admit faults and always has an explanation for something. He comes off as a know it all, but when you take the time to Google the random facts he blurts out, they end up being false. Textbook grandiose sense of self. Always acting like they're the expert in something when they have no idea what he's talking about and always tries to one up experiences. I tagged along with the person to introduce him to coworkers when he first started, and I noticed details from his stories would constantly change. This guy kisses ass up and kicks down. This guy claims to push a lot of weight at the gym and can do lots of cardio, but he's actually fat with skinny extremities. One time, we were tasked with scanning old documents to have electronic copies. This guy was struggling to carry around a banker's box for someone claiming to deadlift 5 plates and benching 3 plates? I have no idea why this coworker can't just admit their mistakes or blatant lies. 

Coworker 4
Always has to know what you're up to. Always has to gossip and talk about others. Always talking about their “poor self”. Almost always tells a story where it seems like they're fishing for compliments. This person will throw passive aggressive remarks but call them jokes. Will gaslight people into saying they were joking even though they 100 percent meant it. You will always turn around a corner where you can catch this person gossiping about someone. 

Coworker 5
This coworker can only talk to people and cannot listen. Anytime you talk to this person, its like talking to a wall. He talks for 30 minutes and the moment you open your mouth it's like he's on another planet staring at you. His opinion is the only opinion. Anything else is wrong and you're gaslit into why you're wrong or stupid for believing anything else. This person can't do anything wrong according to them. Will always try to make something insignificant at work a big deal and turn it into gossip. Will always find someone to talk about and rally other coworkers to talk poorly about someone. It's kind of pathetic how 1 this person targets someone, and 2, how other coworkers jump on the bandwagon to talk poorly about people without getting to know the person they're talking shit about.",Beginning_Bee5392,1,0.5,9,1702156005,2023-12-09 21:06:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18en3qs/are_all_office_jobs_like_this/,12,2023

I want to go back to school - both for financial reasons (I work in sales right now, only making \~ 44k pre tax), and because I feel totally un-excited by what I do. The problem is nothing excites me in terms of career. The only thing I truly enjoy, I find, is academia. I love academic researching, I loved every moment of my bachelors degree because the entire thing was essay writing and academic research. The problem is I haven't found a way to turn that passion in to money. I dropped out of college in January of 2023, so it's been about a year now. It is excruciating not having any real ""purpose"" to keep my mind strong and busy outside of my own fickle passion.

I want to go in to nursing (LPN or RN), but I am not enthused by the idea of quitting my job to go to school and have failed finding night degrees that aren't exorbitantly expensive or super sketchy (questionable accreditation standings). Even that doesn't particularly excite me (I see nursing as something of a constantly ongoing puzzle- something to keep my mind sharp), but I do far prefer the 12+ hour shift/less working days schedule so thats kind of my drive there.

My parents keep throwing ideas at me that sound \*interesting\*, such as radiation therapist or cardiovascular technologist. These things sound like paths that will keep me entertained for a time, but once I """"solve"""" them (once it no longer becomes a challenge) I will very quickly burn out - like with most of my existing hobbies.

At this point I've owned a mildly successful business (which I dissolved to move half way across the country), loosely studied over a half-dozen languages, completed my bachelors degree, and have worked in pretty much any field that would hire me from sales to fast food to repairing and calibrating nuclear test equipment. I have never lasted more than a year at a job because that is around the point it loses any challenging aspects, and I get too bored to justify the commute.

18ejacl,Would going back to school for a Master's in Electrical Engineering help my chances for breaking through into a robotics career?,"My current status:

* 27
* Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering
* Master's in Computer Science
* 8 months experience shoveling dirt in a construction yard

  
I've finally discovered my passion career but I'm afraid I did so a little late. In school, I was not a part of any organizations and I did not undergo any internships. Because of this, I have been struggling immensely in securing an engineering job since I've graduated 8 months ago. Additionally, I realize now that the field in which I truly want to entrench myself in is robotics.

  
This brings me to my question, would going back to school for a Master's in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Robotics propel me forward in a significant way, considering my previous degrees? With this, I would have completed the mechatronic circle (mechanical, computer, electrical). I would also like to use this time to right some previous wrongs, as in, joining my university's robotics organization and possibly take some internships between semesters. I've already mapped it out with my state's university:

*  My tuition will be waived
* I will receive a small monthly stipend if I undergo an assistantship (10 hours/week work)
* I can complete the degree in 1.5-2 years

  
I'd really appreciate the advice. Thanks in advance",SantiagoOrDunbar,1,1.0,0,1702145261,2023-12-09 18:07:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ejacl/would_going_back_to_school_for_a_masters_in/,12,2023

18eimtk,Is there a way to leave an employers name off my resume without raising any flags? Any alternative ideas?,"I’m currently looking to change jobs and have been fixing up my resume as a result but I’m a bit stumped on how to proceed with this. 

I’ve been in this industry for 6 years and spent my first year working for an awful small company. Almost any toxic work-related experience could be found at this place. I only worked there for just shy of a year before leaving and they held a strong grudge against me for that as I had become the go to person for many clients. The details aren’t very important, but what is notable is that if a potential employer were to call the owner, he would most definitely try to sabotage me despite me putting out excellent work and being wholly dedicated my entire time there. 

After leaving I ended up getting an offer from another business to work for them from an independent contractor position, which gave me some good footing with a safety net and confidence to launch my own business. I’ve since grown and have been doing this for nearly 5 years.

While it’s had many perks, I’m getting very burnt out and need a change of pace. At the current rate, I feel like everything is gonna collapse because of this and I need to be proactive about it before it reaches that point. I plan to downsize to just my best clients and continue to manage them on the side and get a regular job again. 

An old colleague of mine recommended me for a position at his new company that I’m very excited about. It would be a great opportunity to kind of get a reset and enjoy a 9-5 type of schedule for some time but I’m worried that my old employer would badmouth me should they be reached out to and I’m concerned they might since it’s my only other experience in this field besides my time self-employed.

Is there any way around this that you guys would recommend without raising red flags? I’m so stoked about this opportunity and am a great fit for the type of candidate they’re looking for. I really don’t want something as dumb as that to be what stands in my way…

18ehan0,Can you still have a future as a Forensic Linguist if you've had a kinda sketchy career choice in the past?,"Hi all,  
  
I just graduated and got my Bachelors, but the degree I majored in wasn't really my thing. I discovered my love for languages tho and I'm thinking of studying Forensic linguistics in Spain (it's the cheapest option, compared to other countries that offer the program, and I like the fact that I'll be studying in both English and Spanish) next year for a career change. The issue is that I don't come from a country with a high quality of life and most people here are quite poor - if you don't work in IT or Customer Support you can barely make ends meet. I don't have an IT education so I'm left with Customer Support. I also don't have enough money to just go and live in Spain comfortably, so the plan is to work for a year and save up money before going. Plus, I don't have much time to search for the best job - I want to start now, not waste time, and go to Spain in a year.  
  
The problem is that the only place that would hire me (on top of everything, I think some companies before them saw that I've worked as a Support in a CFD trading company, and that didn't look well for them) and offer me enough money (some companies called me and offered me other jobs, but with a salary with which I just wouldn't be able to save money) is in the gambling industry - I have my moral reservations about that, but I really need the money, and I'm kinda comforting myself with the fact that it is only a Customer Support job so I'd be kinda helping people out. I'm also a freelance translator (books, not documents) but that pays even below the minimum wage in my country - we really have a problem with not appreciating cultural and scientific industries...  
  
So my question is - will this kinda sketchy (for me, I know it's a regulated field) job in the gambling sector be a problem for future employers in the Forensic linguistics field?

I have 2 offers at hand, job A is not what I want to do (gear motor, PLC control) and job B is what I want to be in (telecom industry). Salaries wise, $1000 difference. Benefits are kinda the same (10%-18% 401k matching but on-site 40-45 hours/week vs. remote/unlimited PTO but 3% matching). 

From what I researched, job A appears to be more stable (private/stable company = less layoff vs public company with some quite comment about freq layoff on Glassdoor). 

The answer is quite easy and straight forward for my case (job B). I kinda want to take that risk. However, there is a voice inside me saying that what if job B would fire me and I would not be able to find another job.

I recently held a 1:1 discussion with my manager concerning my WFH productivity. He has been scrutinizing my activity during WFH, noting a decline in productivity at home and expressing concerns of potential fraud. As it is stealing company time.  
While it is accurate that my work output is lower at home, I want to emphasize that I ensure the completion of all tasks before taking breaks. No complaints have been raised about the quality of my work, and I consistently receive positive feedback on the thoroughness of my job.  
Why did the manager start monitoring? The manager's increased scrutiny originated from a coworker failing to complete their tasks. So, he started checking everyone's work.... As a result, my manager now requests daily updates and seeks confirmation that I am working the full 8 hours each day. I am disheartened by being subjected to monitoring.

At this point, I’ve survived a couple of years and I’m much more solid in the recommendations I make and products I source/sell.  

However, the client is still pretty mistrustful.  Today, it was to the point that they were actively questioning my integrity.  I pushed back and then had my job threatened as a result.  

I backed down.  I’m the sole breadwinner for my family.  The person challenging me wants evidence that I didn’t do what I’m being accused of (I have hard evidence and it will be cleared when we speak next week).

However, I’m sitting here tonight wondering if I shouldn’t have just taken a more principled stance and told them to basically go fuck themselves for questioning my integrity and threatening my job.

18e5hgw,first job after college,"
Hi. I graduated in May with a bachelor’s degree in math, minor in spanish, and certification in data analytics. I graduated with a 4.0 GPA, but had no internships. Throughout college, I worked in fast-food and retail. For health reasons, I decided to take the summer off. I have been applying to administrative/clerical entry-level jobs since August but have not made any progress. During college, I wanted to go into data analytics but I feel like I’m not smart nor skilled enough for that field. My classes were more conceptual and software programs weren’t covered as much. I am a beginner in Python, SQL, and Tableau. I am aware that I can self-teach myself these kinds of programs at a deeper level, but meanwhile I just want to get a job ASAP. I honestly don’t know what career path to go into, but am willing to try out new things and continue learning on my own.

18e4wsh,Feeling lost/underachiever,"Growing up i was always one of the smartest kids in school, best athletes, super funny, everyone liked me blah blah blah. I used to have such high self esteem and had a sense that of course i was going to do something great. I used to think i’d play in the MLB one day then i thought oh i’ll be a famous sports broadcaster. 

When i hit high school i realized i had no idea what i wanted to do. I met with guidance counselors, therapists i talked with adults in my life about their careers from all this i thought maybe i’ll be a physical therapist, a mental health counselor, or a dentist. I thought if i want to enjoy going to work every i have to help people. I loved sports so i thought i might love PT. I had plenty of experience with mental health between my personal anxiety and the other mental disorders of the people in my life. My dad was a dentist so i got to see him work 30 hours a week helping people all while making around $250k in ohio. All 3 options made some sense in my mind but i was in no way sure of anything. 

Fast forward: went to college, struggled a little bit, tried pre dentistry- decided it’s too hard after taking chem 1 (wasn’t motivated) . Switched to marketing hated it, felt business was boring and cold. Switched back to a “helping” career track - PT. Majored in psych, took all the science courses, partied a lot. Mental health declined got on SSRI's, estranged a lot of my friends after sleeping with one of my friend’s ex. Felt my life crumbling apart even more and hit an all time low between my realization that I may lack any morality and my complete lack of direction or passion in life. By this point I've taken every personality and career test in the book and have spent countless hours journaling and talking to more people about careers/career advice/life advice.

Graduated with a bachelors in psych, didn’t make it into PT school right away so I took a gap year working as a therapy technician, was bored out of my mind. Applied to PT anyway thinking I'll enjoy it when I'm actually a PT. Made it into several PT schools one of which was down south. Would have loved that weather but finally decided PT was not for me, backed out two weeks before classes started. 

Started working at Amazon as a manager on the weekend + night shift. That was about as close to hell as i can imagine, mental health got pretty bad again and I quite after 6 months. During that time I applied to PT school again thinking maybe I made a mistake before. I got into schools again, decided yes definitely still don't want $140K in loans and interest upon graduating for something I'm barely interested in. Decided I'll pursue construction management, since I've always thought construction is pretty cool. Got a job doing drywall while I started taking classes in construction management. 

Worked in drywall for about 8 months, levered that for an assistant project manager role now here I am about 6 months in, and about 4 months away from graduating with an associates in construction management from a community college. All things considered I'm doing ok career wise but deep down i feel like such a failure making around $50k a year in a career i'm only mildly interested in. I used to think I would be so successful making well over $100K a year early in my career going to work every day feeling engaged etc etc etc.

I feel like the only things I'm passionate about are hiking, and being creative (making videos, writing, making people laugh) It's pretty unlikely I make good money doing these things, so at this point I just want a career that makes me feel like I'm not the underachiever I've become, make good money, feel intelligent, and work a reasonable number of hours. It feels like my life is slipping away, I feel like I'm getting dumber every day, I sometimes even feel like If there's alternate universes I happen to be living out one of the shittier versions of me that I thought I'd never become. 

Should I just move to Jamaica and spend my days underachieving operating a snow cone stand on the beach? Can anyone relate to how I'm feeling? It just sucks feeling like this for so long and I don't know how many more years I have to feel like this.",Desperate-Produce-79,4,1.0,4,1702094252,2023-12-09 03:57:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18e4wsh/feeling_lostunderachiever/,12,2023

18e3szf,Medical School vs Electrician?,"Currently in a situation where I can take over my Dad's electrical contracting business or go to medical school. My dad has been a licensed solo electrician for 35+ years. He just recently retired a few months ago, but he still picks up jobs here and there whenever he is bored. He built another business on the side as well, that basically runs itself. Being an electrician he was able to purchase a million dollar house, multiple nice cars, go on vacations, and put all his children through college. I recently got accepted to medical school and it's making me rethink everything. Medical school will take atleast 7+ and will cost anywhere from 400k-500k in student loans. The hours, exams, and routine will definitely suck, but getting through it will basically guaranteed a 250k+ salary for the rest of my life. I'll eventually pay off my loans and will live a comfortable upper middle class life in any location I want. On the other hand, I can take over the family business and become an electrician. Since my dad is retired, I would need to spend the next few years working at a local company as an apprentice/journeyman and work my way up till i can get my license. Once i'm licensed, I'll take over my dad's business and have a full book of clients and connections. I eventually hope to slowly scale up the business and hire a team full-time. What's pushing me in this direction is the idea of making money now, having no loans, and being my own boss. As opposed to working hours on end in a hospital, getting a paycheck, and spending the next 7+ years training to become a doctor. Both my parents would rather me become a doctor, but my dad says he's gonna support me regardless. Their argument is that being an electrician is ""backbreaking, blue-collar, dangerous work"", while being a doctor is ""white collar, respectful, and prestigious"". To me I don't really care much about the title. Sure being a doctor sounds cool, but being self employed sounds even better. It's inspiring to see my my dad purchase his dream house, build multiple businesses, and never have to worry about losing his job, company layoffs, etc. This was all on his own. I'm motivated to take our family business to the next level, even if it means getting paid like shit while I learn the next few years. I know it's a lot of people's dream to become a doctor, and I'd be throwing away a great opportunity, but I feel as though the pros and cons aren't really even debatable. Many doctors hate their jobs and work ridiculous hours. To the electricians of Reddit, does what i'm saying make sense? Or am I being shallow? What sounds like the better move?",Ok_Cheesecake_8399,1,1.0,4,1702090529,2023-12-09 02:55:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18e3szf/medical_school_vs_electrician/,12,2023

Hows it my fault its high school popularity is all they seek at workplace? I understand construction requires great soft skills but it's not like I'm totally a robot.

And this is the reward? Just a slap in the face at the end at the year and keep grunting day and night for this thankless job...

18e1dzw,Changing major from international business to electrical engineering.,"I am in my early 20s studying international business and I have been considering a degree in electrical engineering (EE). I don’t really mind studying business because I can do it or understand what is going on but I don’t see great value in it, considering the future job prospects. I know what is happening in class and I learn stuff but there not hard skills (except finance but I’m not really into it).

 I want to try EE because it seems cool to me with understanding how electricity and energy  affects the world without having the ability to see them. The thing I am afraid of moving to EE is the workload that is required. I haven’t done physics for 3 years and my math is okay I guess? I never done advance math but learnt abit of calculus. Getting an EE degree is also a lot better than business with getting a job and I could do an MBA if I wanted to. On top of all this, I want to travel once in awhile and play lots of sports!

18e0fsa,How essential are certifications to a career in psychology or healing? I have the skills but few papers.,"I wrote a long post that got eaten by a filter and no way to get it back. :( Here we go again.

I'm 41, I have an AA in psychology and work experience in multiple fields. In addition, I have self studied psych for more than 2 decades, and the last few therapists I've worked with have agreed I am beyond the MA level. I didn't go to college because I had terrible mental illness for most of my life.

When I did make it back to school a few years ago, I realized that I already knew most of the content being taught and I felt it was largely a waste of time and money.

I genuinely enjoy psychology and counseling and have provided free ""therapy"" for friends and people for a long time, with the caveat that I am not licensed, see your own therapist etc. It's gone over well each time (lost count of the number of times, but more than 50 for sure) 

However, I can't practice because of these things called laws...which sometimes are a little irritating as I've met many bad therapists (I've seen over 30) people who have no psych training whatsoever are are great at healing, and people like me who have skills and experience but no papers.

A life coach I worked with suggested I could do life coaching or something similar which don't have strict educational requirements. Hence why I wrote this post - could I do counselling or some other form of practice? 

If I absolutely have to get the degree I'll probably do the cheapest online course I can find as cost is a factor. I've been able to get scholarships at every school I attended, not sure if they work online.

I was with my previous company for 5 years and I loved the job, the work and my coworkers.  But I needed more money so I left  and went to the same position at another company and received more pay. 

During my interview I asked what the company culture was I was told ""we love it"". When I got to my 3rd interview with the boss and asked the same question and what would make a good employee he said wonderful things! During both interviews I told them I LOVED my job but i need to move to more experience. I said i  I want to make sure that we where a good fit. Side note: this was odd for me to say during these particular interviews because I never asked that or mentioned I loved my job in previous interviews.  My intuition was probably talking . 

Anyways. I finally got to the new company and... it is like hell. Abosolutly no support from my boss, constant criticism, unattainable expectations, blatant lies on me and no common curiosity.  I have had other roles but NEVER experienced this. All of my bosses have been great leaders. Even the ones that were basic where still generally good people. This new boss hasn't liked me from the beginning.  I wasn't even welcomed by my boss on the 1st day (or 2nd or 3rd😒). That should have told me something. 

It was like a bait and switch. I honestly think I was a diversity hire. This has to be do to one board member  questioning diversity and the lack thereof in the company.  I am sure that when my contract ends, I will not be asked to continue.  So I am looking for new jobs.  Got get out before they get me. 

Outside of this job, my work history is good, my skills are good. I just have to get my references together. I.may have to ask my previous coworkers or bosses... they will laugh and say i told you so 🙄. So my question is:

18dzjl1,Leaving Current Job - Company Wants to Keep Me on as Part-Time Employee Instead of 1099?,"Hi there,

First of all - thank you for those who responded to my previous post about taking a lower paying, but less stressful job. I did get the offer and accept it!  


I offered my current (soon previous) employer 4-6 hours a week of contract work (off hours and weekends only) to help with transition and training. I'm asking for $85 an hour, which is $10 above my current hourly rate. I'm seeing that many say to charge double your hourly, so I absolutely feel that this is fair, but they are trying to get me to agree to $65.  


I'm now hearing that HR wants to convert me to a part time employee instead of a 1099. They are assuring me that I could still work my own schedule, and while I would no longer have benefits, taxes would be easier vs 1099 (I'm sure this is true) and I'd still use company equipment.

So im now making 23.50. Another year goes by. I ask for another raise.  They told me they can give me a 1 dollar raise (so i would be making 24.50) and then in 6 months they would promote me to supervisor. I asked how much the pay increase would be when they promote me to supervisor,  and they said 1 dollar.  So i would be making 25.50. I feel like this isn't enough for the position. I would be managing 5 people. There was a guy who was offered 25$ an hour(he was making 18 dollars an hour) when i was making 22$ an hour,  and he wasn't even a supervisor.

I am also going to college for computer science. I'm going to work over the summer. Because working full time means I have to pay for my own medical insurance, I may not personally profit monetarily from doing so. However, I would be doing the right thing in many ways getting off government assistance for insurance. I have the choice to work part time and study extra computer science topics like javascript, html, and css with my extra time or work full time and pay for insurance but not actually take home more money. I feel expanding my software dev related skills is also important. Also, I feel the ideal summer job for me other than an internship, which I feel I cannot get at this point, would be working helpdesk with a Comptia A+ certification. (I don't have one yet) What do you think? Which is better for me and which should I do? Either work part time and study more or work full time and pay for insurance? How much would it help me get a job to know more languages than college will teach me, which is basically C++, JAVA, and maybe one more? I already took object oriented and data structures so I feel like I can learn other languages at this point. There also do not seem to be any part time help desk jobs on indeed.

18dv9pw,Can I even negotiate a promotion when it’s already low-pay and have been doing the job a year?,"I make $17.50 in a hospital doing clinical work. A supervisor spot opened up for a few days a week - I’d be in charge only weekends and normal position for the weekdays. I already worked weekends and the guy who was leaving had already showed me what to do. I technically had to interview but my boss has encouraged me to take the position and I was working it before I even got the offer. 

I was offered the position but never received any formal paperwork to sign nor change in pay. This was November of 2022. Long story shirt, HR rescinded the offer without telling me because I didn’t meet the 3-year requirement for experience. I had boss and coworkers write letters and HR didn’t budge. I’m not 3 years until June of 2024. Boss managed to get me a small bump from $17. It’s been a year. 

Fast forward today and boss tells me they want to offer me the position again. Mind you, I’ve been doing it the past year. Yes, they took advantage of me but I needed health insurance and can’t afford to leave. 

Offer came through of $18.11 an hour. Still sucks but whatever. I’ve never negotiated and I always seen people negotiating salary but never when it’s relatively low wages. Plus my rent just got raised another $100. 

Is this something I can do? They stood firm earlier this year that I can’t have the position due to the 3 year rule. But they changed their mind a year later, so clearly it can be bent. And now I have a year of experience in said title. 

Do I have room to ask for more? And how? I’m not leaving this job - I literally can’t afford a car or bike to work further from home. But I’d like more if I can.

18dv16w,Caught in between 2 jobs and a drug test,"So I was just offered a really good position for a real estate investment company here in Florida. It’s really everything I’ve been praying for, job and salary. My start date is scheduled for January 2nd. I have not put in my 2 weeks notice yet at my current employer because I am very scared there could be a drug test for this new position since I have been smoking delta 8 on and off for a few years. 
I accepted the new offer on December 1st and immediately quit smoking so I have been clean for a week now and won’t smoke again until I start in a month.

The contingencies listed in the offer letter state:
•background check,
•reference verification, 
•AND/OR drug testing urinalysis
(Not sure what the and/or means)

I emailed the job asking when I should have the listed items completed since my offer is contingent upon them. I was trying to find an answer about the drug test without blatantly asking them about it.

HR responded with:
“•Drug testing through urinalysis- This was not requested of him through his background package”

Does this most likely mean they will not be testing, or testing is not apart of the background package? Could they potentially wait until the start date on January 2nd?

I feel like I would be able to pass in a months time, but I do not want to put my 2 weeks in until I 10000% know everything is good and I have the position. 

This could potentially mean I will have to quit my current position without giving them any type of notice which I really do not want to do, I don’t want to burn any bridges but I might not have a choice.

Sorry for the length of this but im hoping someone has some kind of advice.

A suitable career path for a young mum

Hi!

Currently, I’m just stay at home mum. And I chose to focus on my son at least until he’s 2,5-3 years old and he will start going to an early childhood education in 2026.

Long story short, I want to get back to start building my career again once he’s start going to school. But I’m still a bit confused what should I do? I moved ed here to Australia fom Indonesia. I had a pretty good job back in Indonesia. I was working as Marketing Executive for an engineering consulting company based in the US for over 3 years and in total I had experience in marketing for nearly 5 years. Btw, I’m still 27 years old now. 

I’m thinking that marketing life or corporate life is not something that I enjoy anymore. Since becoming a mum I think I lost my capability to do what I was doing before. I was thinking to start my career in healthcare or community service over here. Like nursing or social workers. I’m whiling to study even from the scratch. So I don’t mind if I take certification or diploma or even bachelor to start new career path here. 

But the question 
1. What job/career that actually really suitable for a mum? Especially with young kids and a husband?
2. What specifications would be needed?

18dtf26,Just a Young Man Who's Losing Direction (Alternate Career Paths out of Programming?),"I graduated with a degree in psychology from a reputable university. I got excellent marks taking very easy courses, and graduated with a cumulative GPA of 3.8/4.0. This was in 2020.

Since I was graduating into a pandemic, and since I wasn't keen to pursue psychology any further, I decided to go back to school for a second undergrad in computer science. The computer science undergrad was geared towards adult learners and was designed to take two years to complete. 

After the first year of the computer science program, students are encouraged to find internships. I found an internship at a small SaaS company operating in the environmental technology space by getting a reference from a friend of mine. After my 8 month internship, I managed to convince my employer to hire me on full-time. The salary was great, and I worked there for another year and two months.

I quit in June. 

Though the salary was great, the company was very mismanaged. There were three rounds of restructuring. The first just as I was hired on full-time, a second one in December of 2022, and a third just after I left. I was moved teams each time. After the second restructuring most of my coworkers who I had come to like were fired and I was moved from a team working on interesting projects to a team that was doing web development which is kind of the ""grunt work"" of programming and not something I enjoyed at all. 

Moreover, some great developers were fired while some terrible ones were retained. We worked remote, so a lot of people got away with things they otherwise wouldn't which irked me. I knew for a fact that there was one developer on my team in a managerial role who spent most of his working day smoking pot and playing video games. He was retained of course. Suddenly, my salary didn't seem great when people like him made six figures doing nothing. 

I knew the software market was bad when I left, but I didn't know it was *this* bad. I've been looking for a job since I left, and have only managed to find some part time freelance work in the interim. 

I like being a programmer well enough but I'm concerned with the direction the career is headed. It seems the people who do well in the field are people who live, breathe, and eat code. Hiring managers expect you to code extensively outside of work. This is all understandable because with so many different technologies and frameworks, the definition of who is and isn't a programmer is a bit up in the air. As a result, there's a large saturation of people who consider themselves programmers who aren't very good. Consequently, there's a large onus on programmers to prove their worth. There's also a lot of very corporate-minded individuals in the field who are chasing money. I'm really not a fan of the work culture, and thinking about it makes me a little sick.

I kind of want to leave the career, but I'm not sure what else to pursue. If leaving my job taught me one thing, it's the value of a dollar - part of me wants to go back to school but I'm not sure what to go back to school for, and I don't want to commit financially to something I'm not sure about. I'm in my mid-twenties, and I feel a lot of pressure from seeing my peers begin to establish their careers. Meanwhile, I'm stuck in a profession I'm not sure about but I don't know where else to go.

I've considered law school, but it seems like a heavy financial investment to end up in another overly saturated market. I'm also not really sure what I'd do with a law degree.

I've considered getting an MBA, but I don't really have enough work experience and don't want to be surrounded by corporate-types. 

I kind of want to travel, but I don't have tons of money nor do I want to come back from abroad as somebody who's thirty years old and doesn't have any real work experience.

18dt47s,Should I get a Masters Degree in Field that's different from current career and experience?,"Need some advice...I'm in my mid-40's and went back to college and about to graduate with a degree in Strategic Leadership in Communications. I work in Academia for R&D Defense type work. All of my 23yrs of work experience is within DoD or supporting them as a contractor or advisor. I'm looking at getting a MS degree in Biodefense as it seems very interesting to me but that degree doesn't correlate with my job experience and would need to switch jobs to really utilize that education.

The thing I'm stuck with right now in my career is that should i go back to school and get a career that can help me start a business like taking accounting, finance, marketing and etc or get a career thats high paying like IT. i did take a intro course In IT at a community college but i just hate coding, is there any other jobs that don't involve coding in IT???  
Should i even go back to school at all?? This it what I'm stuck with at the moment on what path i should take:  


1. Not go to school and get a random job to start a business  

2. Go to school in a Business Program and start a business on the side  

3. Go to school to earn a high paying job(tech Industry), Then use the money to start a business  

4. not go to school and take a entry level job and climb the corporate ladder at a company and start a business on the side  


Any Advice?? What's really stuck in my mind right now is Time and Money. Should i take on student debt?

18dsu56,What type of Engineering degree should I pursue,"Hello everyone, so currently i'm a Technical Sales Engineer which is debatable weather or not its really a real engineer. I tend to look at it more as a title compared to people like chemical engineers or mechanical ect. i started in IT off of certifications and ended up as a sales engineer a year later after doing side projects on my own then presenting them to my boss. That being said i never actually got a degree i'm currently 26 and would like to go back.  
  
One of my side projects that i have presented and have been working on in the company has been automating repetitive tasks with lowcode solutions. I have some coding ability but nothing incredibly extensive at the moment i touch a little JSON and in the past i've done some Python and Javascript as well as some markup languages. I mainly use coding to customize actions that are not prefab in the lowcode software.  
  
Since taking on the project i've found that i really enjoy the building of logic and figuring out the puzzle of how to translate it in an actionable way to make the automation work practically as well as planning for contingencies and failsafe's incase of X situations and Y situations. So as a result i've gotten more interested in going back to school for something that focuses on automation whether it be business oriented or otherwise. So i was wondering what the best path would be to go i was imagining something along the lines of Electrical Engineering, Machine Learning or something of the like but i wanted to get the opinion of people actually in the field.",WestTransportation12,1,1.0,0,1702059139,2023-12-08 18:12:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18dsu56/what_type_of_engineering_degree_should_i_pursue/,12,2023

18dsa5b,Offer to Interview in Person?,"I’m interviewing for an Analytics Manager role which is hybrid. I’ve made it through the first two interviews and take-home case study. There are two interviews left:

2. Interview with director to talk about managerial style and experience.

18dpn64,3rd career change - Lab Tech Job,"I don't have paid laboratory experience, and the last time I was in a lab was during a post-baccalaureate program in 2015, which I didn't finish. However, there's a lab tech position open in the corporate office/lab of a power company, and I'm the only internal candidate who meets the minimum requirements and passed the test. They're 25 external candidates, that has yet to be reviewed.  
  
The pay is $38 an hour, first shift, no weekends, and no overtime in a location with a low cost of living. During what was more of an 'interview,' I mentioned I lack lab experience or a chemistry degree—my background is in econ/poly sci (don't use that either). I visited the lab; it seems to involve a lot of testing of different samples and data entry. The environment appears relaxed with just 2 techs, 1 temp tech, 2 environmental consultants, and 1 manager (who oversees 2 different departments).  
  
Currently, I make $32 an hour in the same company/union, with the flexibility of working from home on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays (though this might change). The work is pretty relaxed—I realistically put in about 4 hours a day and often spend the rest surfing the web, streaming TV, or playing video games during work hours.

We've had multiple conversations about how the disjointed communication causes issues. 

We use Asana for task management, Freshdesk for tickets, and google chat/email.

The solution that I've been advocating for is to keep the task related conversations in Asana, because anyone who's used the chat feature built into gmail knows how hard it can be to find a specific conversation. 

Having the communication live in Asana means I can see the history of all the conversations and any relevant information that could be forgotten, or not relayed to the right person.

My boss agreed, but he keeps failing to respond to questions when tagged on Asana. Often even emails or gChats will go unanswered too. I often have to resort to waiting for him to leave his office so I can flag him down to get questions answered and things approved.

18dot2t,What is a good degree for working remotely?,"Hello. I am hoping I can get some guidance because I am currently feeling lost when it comes to the future of my career. I was born in the US but lived most of my life in Brazil where my family lives. I went to High School in the US and also attended colleges for 4 semesters (3 in software engineering then switched over to exercise science) Started to struggle a lot with mental and financial problems, I was 100% by myself in the US, no family or friends pretty much and trying to get by with the money I was making off Door Dash while studying full time.  
  
I reached a breaking point, grades started to drop and my life was no longer sustainable that way, I have a history of mental health problems so I felt the wise choice was to take a break. I decided to move to Brazil where I have family. Since then I have been working a costumer service job for an American company where I make a little over minimum wage, which is enough to get by here. But I still have an ambition to be at least a little bit more successful professionally speaking.  
  
College here is not really an option and enrolling in an American college and doing it remotely seems like the best option. I have come to the conclusion Software engineering or anything math heavy is not form me. I do enjoy working out and learning about the human body, muscular imbalances, dieting and such so I though an exercise science degree would be great for me , which also gives me the possibility of specializing in physical therapy down the line. Now that I am in Brazil I am not sure this is the best route to go, given this field is very hard to work remotely.  
  
I am also interested in marketing or financing but not as much. Right now I am pondering going back to college but I also don't plan to move back to the US anytime soon so I need a field that will allow me to work from here while also allowing me to get a decent enough job if I ever have to go back to America. What are some degrees that will help me find a remote job easily? The pay really does not have to be that good. Anything over 20 dollars an hour would render me a very good life given the cost of living here. I know this is a very broad and loaded question but I am feeling very lost and overwhelmed right now so I really appreciate any kind of feedback or input.

18dk8hs,Can't decide if I should drop a major to graduate sooner,"I'm in my 4th year of college, and I am studying Cyber Security and Criminology. I recently realized that I could graduate next semester if I drop Cyber Security and just do Criminology, but it would take me another year after that to finish both. 

Here's the main dilemma: I have no desire to work in tech. None. I am so burned out of all things computers/cyber, and to do a career in that sounds so unfufilling with where I'm at right now. The issue is, I kinda just have the Criminology degree by accident and don't really want to do much with that either, so I'm at a crossroads. 

Right now, the main things that I'm passionate about are being the president/national director of a student org I'm apart of, and the summer camp that I work in during the summer, but both of those things seem hard to pursue as careers, especially compared to a steady job in Cyber. However, if I graduated sooner I could start a masters in student leadership or something and start down that path, but again, that seems really uncertain. 

Should I do an extra year and get the Cyber Security degree as a backup? It seems like it would be a good safety net, but I have no real desire to use it, but also I don't have a super solid plan for a career otherwise, rather just grand notions of things that I enjoy.

18dhb4q,At the rate that I’m going am I ever gonna see six figures…?,"Hi all, I’m 25 years old and a guy. To be blunt, I’ve experienced poverty, homelessness, and eviction. I have lived in poverty my whole life. I went to college at 18, which was mandatory for me as a first-generation Asian American born Pakistani Muslim. However, I struggled in high school due to ADHD and a difficult home life. As a teenager, I gave my parents over $50k before we were evicted. After almost 4 years in community college, I earned 3 associate’s degrees simultaneously. Unfortunately, Rutgers business school New Brunswick did not accept my calculus credits, so I ended up at the College of New Jersey (TCNJ) instead. I didn’t enjoy TCNJ since most students were wealthy, white, and in fraternities. I dropped out in 2021 and pursued a career in tech sales B2B, where I faced many terrible and toxic experiences. Eventually, I obtained a job with a salary of $83,000 with base + commission, but I lost it due to mental health issues and poor performance in 2022. Earlier this year, I planned to go back to TCNJ, but I discovered that Rutgers business school the Newark campus would accept all my credits, including calculus. I transferred and I am now a junior studying supply chain management at the age of 25. I already feel stupid and behind because my grades suffered after being out of college for almost 4 years. I have been applying for internships, but I keep getting rejected. I am worried that I won’t be able to secure a top entry-level job in supply chain management, paying over $70k, immediately after college. I fear that I won’t reach a salary of $100k+ within 3 years, considering my circumstances. Graduating at 27 instead of 23 makes me worry that I won’t achieve the milestones of getting married, having kids, and owning a house all before turning 30, like most people do. I feel slow and behind.

18dgqfl,Grass is greener?,"Looking for my sanity check. 

Got a job offer for an upper management position a few months ago and accepted it because the position is one I've been looking for for the last few years. I ended up renegging because as the date came closer, I started noticing some red flags namely the position was not as well defined as I initially thought and the dynamic between the management team was chaotic (in a concerning way, not a fun way). 

I'm a few weeks removed from my intended start date and now I'm wondering if I should have taken the position. Reading this as I write it sounds ridiculous, but I honestly fear that I essentially got a once in a lifetime opportunity and turned it down out of fear. 

I guess my real question here, is toxicity a common feature of upper management? Does being a manager mean sacrificing every free moment of your day?

18dfi8i,Advice on how to move forward after 10 years,"For context I'm 25 years old and have been working at the same job for 10 years, it was my first and only job and I've been praised as an above average employee numerous times but management throughout the years. I've wanted to move up for the past year or two but have been blindsided at every opportunity by the newest store manager who seems to have a bone to pick with me (quite literally has gotten in my face and screamed at me before infront of others.)

I have always loved my job and have always taken great pride in my work ethic, being the best I possibly can be, training every new hire, taking on extra work like doing orders for our store (grocery store) and things of that nature. I have applied for manager / assistant manager and have been refused an interview and then still asked to do all of these things while the new assistant doesn't know how to and they refuse to teach them. 

I asked for a raise of 60 cents. I currently make 16.40 an hour and wanted to make 17 an hour but they denied me that and the new store manager told me to go somewhere else if I want more money. So now I'm feeling defeated and my passion for the job has died, I've been just going in and doing bare minimum lately but that just doesn't feel like me, I want to work hard and I want to be proud and show what I can do but it just doesn't seem like anything is going to happen here which is incredibly frustrating after giving 10 years of my life to this job.

18dffny,"What the hell else can I do with this background? (31, M)","My newspaper company decided to ring in the holiday season by...being sold to a corporate giant who is firing everyone (myself included). There's no room in the company for other positions so I'm on the market (again) for a new job.  
  
Since 2015 I've done the following roles in the industry: Reporter, Editor, Copy Editor, Page Designer  
  
I've found reading/editing copy and designing pages to be the most enjoyable as they allow a creative outlet and a sense of independence. Unfortunately, these jobs are pretty much non-existent in my neck of the woods, CT.  
  
I've been laid off too many times to want to keep staying in the industry with pay being as low as it is.  
  
The only semi-marketable/unique thing about my resume is freelance reporting I've done for ESPN/Washington Post in the video game/esports space which I have multiple years of experience.  
  
I'm someone who needs to enjoy what I'm doing as a career or I'm not doing it. I know it sounds picky but if I'm doing something for eight hours a day, there has to be joy in it for me outside of the money.  
  
PR and advertising (the natural transitions out of this industry) could not interest me less. Shilling for a company or doing bland copywriting is not my cup of tea. Sorry if they are yours, no disrespect.  
  
That being said, what's a neat job that comes to mind based on my history above that doesn't require years of experience to break into? Teaching/IT sound cool but the former takes a hell of a long time to get into and the ladder seems daunting to break into.

18deuty,how to pivot into business-style job with an unrelated degree?,"Hi!  
  
I'm currently 20 and studying Health informatics (which is a new major in my school) and in my third year. I have been questioning what I want to do as a career a lot since I've been in college and recently got career-tested by my school to see where my interests/skills lie and it seems that for the most part, it does cater towards either a technical or business realm (interestingly enough, credit manager was the #1 best career I should get into).  
  
The thing is, I don't want to change my major because it just wouldn't be financially smart for me and it's hard to say if I really would like to work in business because I have no experience in it whatsoever, but it does have me intrigued.  
  
So I guess the question is would I be able to pivot into the career even with my unrelated degree? And what careers specifically? I know so far in my classes I learned SQL and will be learning things like tableau, python, R(?). I was thinking of learning Power BI on the side too. But I am learning these things from the standpoint of healthcare because my degree is specific, so that worries me that I can't necessarily branch out.  
  
I thought about trying to do some type of business/IT internship so I can get a better idea, but I have no clue if they'd consider me even due to how oddly specific my major is so they wouldn't want to bat an eye or obviously pick a candidate that has a business-related field of degree over me.

18ddao1,How to handle situation with boss ?,"hi! I need advice on a situation with my boss. I recently went on vacation and my boss did as well right before me. On her vacation, she found out unexpectedly she was pregnant and made decisions last week on something she said I’d be getting next year to a coworker because he’ll have a lot of projects next year. Next year, the intern was supposed to be reporting to me but then my boss told my coworker he’d be now managing the intern while I was on vacation last week. He’ll have 20+ projects next year and he’ll have the intern while she’s on maternity leave to help him. When I came back to work Monday I was unaware of the situation at hand and emailed as I planning ahead on anything I’ll need to in the upcoming few weeks. She then relayed the news my coworker would be getting the intern due to lots of projects, etc. In the moment, I wasn’t sure on why she had told me I was doing it to then just hand it off to him so I asked for clarification and said I wish there would have been more of a discussion about it and if there was a change in my performance. She told me we’d meet the next day to discuss and go from there- that I’ll understand once she tells me her news and it’s nothing against me personally. The next morning she cancels the meeting and says we’ll meet with for more a formal tb once she meets with her boss on next steps. I replied and asked to her canceling meeting and asked if we would be able to meet at one point during the day or is there a date I can follow up with her to have this conversation- completely unaware she was pregnant because she canceled the meeting we were supposed to have. She then slacked me and told me that she was pregnant and she’d be out next summer so that’s why coworker needs the intern and she’s waiting on next steps from her boss. I answered her and said congrats and that I didn’t mean to imply I needed to know right now but rather a day I could follow up to see if there is an update when we can meet. And that I’d send my other questions through email. She asked me to hold on sending anything until we have a face to face convo and if I send anything she’s going to hold off on responding as just an fyi. In this instance I just said I understand and I’ll wait until we meet. Although now in the office yesterday, my coworker and boss were acting weird when I didnt do anything wrong I was asking for clarification and wasn’t trying to cause any issue. The more I think about it I go back and forth on is it my fault or is it hers for not having a 1:1 conversation with me that day? Which I know I’ll receive once she gets next steps from her boss. I can’t help but feel like maybe I should apologize on my end for being not understanding of the situation and only thinking about myself in the moment. Honestly I’m just at a loss of not knowing what to do because people tell me I did nothing wrong but then I feel like I did at the same time.",Mountain-Tell-2168,1,1.0,0,1702005352,2023-12-08 03:15:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ddao1/how_to_handle_situation_with_boss/,12,2023
18dczmo,Girlfriend from India not getting Christmas bonus - the company's excuse is that she got a signing bonus - what should she do?,"My girlfriend is from India and has been here for 3 years, just completing her Masters 1 year ago. She joined a company recently, and before signing, she asked for a signing bonus. The company gave her a nominal $1,000 bonus and she was pretty pleased.

Fast forward 3 months to now. There was a large Christmas gathering at the company, and they're handing out bonuses to people(seems kind of gross to me, like they want to look like Santa Claus and have people being so grateful. Just do it via direct deposit and tell them about it... but I digress). They mention that my girlfriend's small team will be getting their bonuses next week. 

Later, in private, my girlfriend is told by her manager to not expect a bonus as she already got a signing bonus....She's very disappointed by this, and I feel she's being mistreated a bit. 

If they didn't give her a Christmas bonus because she got a signing bonus, was the signing bonus even a signing bonus? Or just an advance on the Christmas bonus?! 

We understand that she's only been there 3 months, and shouldn't expect a large Christmas bonus. She even would understand if they told her that she wasn't getting a bonus because she'd only been there 3 months. But to essentially tell her that her signing bonus was an advance on her Christmas bonus? It seems very wrong.

18dco7y,Worried about looking for new jobs because of job hopping,"I recently started a new job (about 2 months ago) and I do not think it is a good fit for me. I’m worried about applying for new jobs because I am new to the workforce, only about 1.5 years into my career. I work in a technical field, and a decently specialized one at that. I have had 2 jobs before this one, both of which lasted 7 months each. I left my first job (local government) because my fiancé moved across the state for a new job. My second job was contract work (federal government), and I was told I would go full time after 6 months. Unfortunately, this did not happen and I was laid off this year in late August with over 60 other people. This layoff was due to budget cuts within the fed. My current job is a corporate job, and my previous two were government work where I felt like I was making a difference in people’s lives. I don’t think I fit in well with my current coworkers, I was reprimanded in the first month for a misunderstanding in deadlines, and I also do not like that I feel I am not working to help people in my community. I want to apply for government agency jobs specifically, but I am worried that my short stints at my previous workplaces are a major red flag. I have a lot of diverse experience, and am well-acquainted with a variety of softwares, from GIS to graphic design programs. Should I stick it out for the year? Is the hopping okay because I had legitimate reasons for the short tenures? If I do apply, should I leave my current job off my resume?

18dbiey,"Advice Needed! Want to stay at current job, but need to make more money","I’ve already talked to my manager about how I feel severely underpaid with my experience, educational background, and qualifications. Obviously backed up my reasoning with current workload, accomplishments in my role, etc.  She basically told me that I’ll have to wait until evaluations and compensation statements in March 2024. I seriously cannot wait that long, especially since I had this conversation with my manager in late August/early September. 
I’m a sourcing analyst and the salary range for my role with my company states 66.4-99.8K. I make 70K and have been here 2 years. Bachelors, MBA, and 4 other years of work experience. I already know that by waiting until compensation statements in March I’ll only get another 1.5-2% raise.
I work remotely, have flexible PTO, enjoy what I do, and love my team. I just need to be valued more compensation wise. I feel that based on my qualifications and the market value for my role, especially based on the salary range for my position, I should be making between 85-90K.

I’ve been applying to other jobs similar to my current role, or ones that have more responsibility/challenge, but obviously pay more. I have a job interview tomorrow for a role very similar to mine for 85K, but it’s an onsite role that I’d have a hard time accepting going back to commuter life (an hour each way). 
I want to use this offer (that is, if they offer me it) to try to get my manager/company to see that I am worth X amount and should be getting that here instead of needing to go elsewhere. Does anyone have any advice on how to go about this? I’ve already heard the “don’t accept counter offers from your current employer”. I don’t want to have to leave or put in my notice for them to offer me something that makes me feel valued. I like what I do, and love WFH. How do I tell my manager I’m interviewing for a similar role/got offered this similar role, to use that as leverage to get what I deserve in my current role or? 
Also to add - there are no open job positions at my company that I’m interested in or that pay more than my current salary (most are sales, entry level, production roles, many on site roles the past few weeks). Otherwise I’d just move into a new role in my company.

I wasn’t looking, but was contacted by a recruiter and took the call and it eventually led to me getting an absolutely insane offer. I took the call because I knew I was somewhat underpaid and I said a crazy number to the recruiter and they were like, “that’s good with the hiring manager”. I went through a lot of interviews, told my boss I was doing the interviews, and he said he wanted me to stay but if I got the job I couldn’t pass it up for the compensation change. Many said I was absolutely insane for even considering staying.

Well I got the job and the offer.

The boss I loved said I should take it, and that he couldn’t even come close to matching it. After much deliberation I decided to take it.

I opened it up, and saw that my job title was listed as “senior” instead of mid level.  There were a few other people listed with a higher job title as well, but some matched their job titles they have now.

Are they lying to the client that I’m a higher job title or am I getting promoted in 2024? 

If they’re lying this will be my final straw with this company for multiple reasons. Yes I was promoted already back in June from junior, but multiple people have been telling me that I’m executing way above my level. Also, we already have a senior on my team in the same department as me, but she hasn’t been doing the greatest and people have been telling me I should be the one managing her.

18davgq,How to tactfully tell a colleague that their project is not a priority on my list?,"Keeping some details vague so I can’t be identified by anyone at my company.

Context: I was hired to do data analytics on sales/ROI metrics, but they downsized the team and now I am getting a lot of requests from a UX perspective on how users are interacting with the site. This is not my area of expertise, and I am the only person working on a particular platform (the people who knew it best were laid off) so I am learning from scratch. 

I am swamped with requests. In particular, I have a coworker (different department) who is now asking me for extremely detailed reports that are tedious to put together, not to mention difficult to figure out how to find in the first place. Think: “how many people are using the search form on Page A vs Page B and what are they searching for on each, then where do they go after that?” or “we have rotating images every week on Page A, how many people have clicked each and what did they buy?”. This person is looking to optimize the content they are responsible for, which I get and want to help with, but it’s not exactly critical to the business at this time. I’m trying to automate a report for them, but that’s proving to be difficult as new material is constantly rolling in.

I told my manager about the project and he straight up told me to put it on the bottom of the list because he wants me focused on other things. He also told me there is a plan to completely revamp the site so the info will essentially be moot in a few months anyway. 

However, I keep getting asked for updates and I feel guilty for pushing them off in favor of more important items. The person expressed some frustration about the lack of movement recently.

18d9gqc,From business school to tech job?,"Hello everyone,  
  
19, currently enrolled in a business target school, my career plan involves starting in strategy consulting for 1-4 years at a significant firm (Big 3 or Big 4), with a subsequent move into Private Equity or founding my consulting firm.  
  
However, I've observed a potential downside to these roles, namely the challenging work-life balance and less-than-ideal corporate culture. On a different note, I've self-taught coding since the age of 13, with proficiency in languages such as JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, C++, and C#. I also run a SaaS business, though it's not generating enough income for full sustainability and the revenue has been very unstable.  
  
Despite my technical skills, I opted for a business degree due to my enjoyment of the lively student experience. As an extroverted person, I appreciate attending events and meeting new people, and my university's business program is essential for my social developement. I've never been happier to have this chance.  
  
I've been losing sleep lately over career uncertainties, particularly regarding the demanding nature and long hours associated with certain paths. This uncertainty has, unfortunately, impacted my motivation for academic pursuits. While I'm drawn to tech roles, my lack of formal qualifications poses a challenge.  
  
I'm seeking advice on high-paying positions that allow me to leverage coding skills while still valuing a business degree or experience related to consulting. I'm open to temporarily working long hours but not interested in committing to an intense workload for an extended period (10+ Jears).

18d8lk8,Stay or Move on?,"Hey there Reddit!

I took u/nothought4themorrow's advice, sent an email to my boss about it to no reply (she was constantly avoiding me and gets busy in a lot of meetings as of late) and applied for a job posting for the full-time position I wanted in the company on November 18th, the day after it's post date.

It's December now, and the application is still under review. Currently for the job market for my field, there's plenty of full time and higher paying jobs for the same duties as my current one, and for some jobs I did apply for that didn't work out with my current schedule, these had offered more to learn and grow in the field. I've been considering if it's time to move on from this position, and would like input about what I should do, and about the plan I currently have in mind.

My idea is to wait to hear back about the position within the company I applied for no longer than February. If I don't hear back, or am rejected, and there's still no room for growth or to even be hired, I think I'll have to bite the bullet and go somewhere else that is full time.",Chara_Rae,2,1.0,2,1701991111,2023-12-07 23:18:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18d8lk8/stay_or_move_on/,12,2023

18d8ajw,What should I do about an extremely condescending and insulting manager?,"
I graduated from college in May and took an Embedded Software Job that stRted in July. Almost 5 months down the line and I have done 0 embedded work. As a matter of fact, my manager brought someone else on the team who is training to be an embedded engineer according to his own words. 


I can overlook all of that. My problem is that he’s extremely abusive and borderline insulting. He constantly mentions how I’m a mediocre engineer and that I don’t think / not using my brain when I go to him for help. 


He’s been making me use a language called PawnScript that I’m barely familiar with. I haven’t done any C , which I specifically  hammered was my speciality during my interview. He’s the ONLY person on my team that knows how to use it so naturally I go to him for help. He almost always gets condescending and affronts me in all sort of ways. 

He mentions how he’s able to solve things in minutes that take me forever to solve. But he’s given me 0 training and when I mentioned it he said “ Nobody trained me when I was in India so I don’t need to train you”. 



 The only time I learn anything is when I work with others.

18d72ix,Take the state job or corporate job?,"I have two job offers right now, both starting Monday. For the life of me I cannot choose which job to take. I have gone over each con and pro in my head 100s of times. I'm hoping someone may have advice or an additional point to add that may help me make a decision.

Job #1: state job helping disabled veterans find work (a lot of these veterans are on drugs, have been in jail ect). It's in my town (less than 20 minute commute) and 3 days would be remote from home, 2 in office. Pay is okay. I won't be here for 5 years so I won't be vested for retirement. I do feel as though I would enjoy this job more day to day. The work would be more fulfilling and interesting to me.
Benefits aren't great. When i inevitably move (military family) I cannot take this job with me as it is a state job.

Job #2: corporate job doing planning which I have done in the past at another company. This new company offered me 12k more than the state job offered. The benefits are great, 401k match vested the day you start, 15 pto days and 10 holidays. Office is about a 50 minute commute. 2 days in office, 3 days remote. When we move I can keep this job and find another office or go full remote. I have done the work at another company and didn't really enjoy the corporate lifestyle, however this company is quite different from the company I worked for before in terms of pay, culture, ect.

Do I take the job that I think I might enjoy more day to day or do I take the corporate job with more benefits but possibly be a little less into my day to day tasks.

18d5zge,My coworker (not my superior) wants to set up an unnecessary monthly 1:1 with me and keeps pushing for it. Advice?,"At my workplace, we’re broken up into separate teams that each have a few people from each department. One woman on my team/in my department is more senior than I am, but she is not my superior.

We have up to 11 meetings each week, and biweekly 1:1s with both our department manager and our team manager. Most of these meetings aren’t actually relevant to my work and they drive me nuts.

This coworker tried to set up a biweekly meeting for me, her, and the other person in my department on our team as a “check in” on how things are going. Our work is separate from each other, and there’s nothing we could cover than isn’t already covered in the other 11 meetings I have each week. I pushed back and she said she’d make it optional, so I just declined every time with an excuse.

Now, she’s decided to switch to scheduling monthly 1:1s with me and the other woman in our department/team. Again, she isn’t our manager or superior.

I pushed back again when she told (not asked!) me about this. I told her that since I already have ~11 meetings per week and biweekly 1:1s with both managers, I don’t want to add another recurring meeting to my calendar. And that if she had a specific thing we had to colloborate on, we could do that, but otherwise no.

She completely ignored that message and starting DMing me about something else work-related. I’m hoping that means she’ll drop it, but I’m worried she might say something to one of our managers. 

Any advice on how to handle this if my managers get involved? I literally can’t have another meeting on my calendar or I’ll go insane. I have ADHD and meetings make it SO hard to stay focused and go back to actually doing my job. It’s crazy to me that she would schedule a 1:1 with a peer to “check in” as if she’s an authority figure?? She’s also younger than me, which makes it feel even sillier.

I don’t want to tell my job about ADHD (they have a history of discriminating about that) and I also don’t want to seem lazy or like a bad team player, but also this meeting request is SO unnecessary and honestly a little insulting.

18d5bhy,Update to: my co worker is making 20k more than me,"All's well that ends well


Tldr (can elaborate if anyone has questions). 


I had a meeting with my manager a few days after. The meeting was professional in my opinion, and it ended with my manager saying to just trust him and wait. I have no reason to doubt him and so that's what I did. I waited.


In the months that followed there were times I wanted to say well why don't you have my co worker do it, they get paid more. I swallowed that attitude and kept it professional at all times. I still did excellent above and beyond work, still took opportunities to shine and continued on as if nothing was bothering me. 


I had a huge project I needed in my portfolio. It was non negotable that this was in it so I was staying until January regardless. 


December 1st rolled around and our weekly meeting changed from a Monday to Friday and from online chat to in person. I went in and made a joke about the date change and he told me there was a reason why and walked away. He walked back with the vp of marketing and a piece of paper. 


The vp told me congratulations, I'm being promoted to senior designer and that this year will be me training to become marketing manager under my art directors guidance, so by 2025 I would be marketing manager and promoted again. 


The piece of paper was for me to sign with a new official salary of $85,000. For those who didn't see my previous post, I was making $55,000. A raise of just over 30k (I'm rounding). 


I'm floored to say the least. Not only to get a promotion but a promotional raise that substancial. I never thought that either of those would end up happening but they did.

Right now, I'm collaborating with a client who is developing a project, and my responsibility is to attract users to their platform. My work primarily revolves around that task.  
Although my academic background is in psychology and not marketing, I landed this job through a connection in the marketing industry.

Additionally, I have another project that gives me €300 every three months for writing blog posts, which is decent in my home country, Venezuela.

I put time on his calendar, he moved it, then accepted the new time and didn’t show up to the meeting. I messaged him and he said he was very sorry and he’d propose a new time but he didn’t. This was last week.


At the beginning of this week, I set up another meeting. He didn’t respond to the invite. (The meeting is today). 


What is the etiquette for what I should do next? Should I message him individually before the meeting? 


Should I wait until the meeting starts and then message him during it (I’m assuming he won’t join)?

I’m a little confused on titles because I know a financial advisor is investments only if I am not mistaking… well anyways I have two job offers on the table. I have a job offer from Morgan Stanley starting off as a CSA and they’ll pay for my series exams and I can move around after a year or so and apply for a higher position.. it gives me an insight on investments which will help I believe.

18d1vvo,Am I giving off signals I can be pushed around?,"Am I giving off signals I can be pushed around?

I, 30F, have been struggling with being assertive and depression but worked so hard to be mindful about how I always present myself to other people. I try to be capable, responsible, reliable and kind to other people. However, I constantly feel like regardless of how I keep my weakness hidden and be a better human being, people still see me as a pushover. As I am turning 30, I do want to be respected as a human being.

Work - When I worked at a company as a project supervisor, my senior said I have a full autonomy over a project, and he did not want to fuss over the details like the budget. I perfected the project down to the T and the project expenses were quite reasonable. However, once the project was completed and my senior was about to sign for the bills, he humiliated me publicly screaming how I was not a team player because I did not check expenses with him first. Honestly, it felt like a power play, but why me when I went above and beyond with the work and for the team? This is not the first time a senior yelled at me because as an intern I got publicly yelled at by my supervisor for a mistake someone else did. I am not sure what my problem is. And I was also told to go buy snacks for the rest of the team even though there was another male intern. 

In other incidences, I sense hostility from people more junior than me, especially from men. I have this gut feeling they always seek opportunity to make a hostile comment to make me look bad. 

Networking - I recently catch up with an old classmate who is in a similar industry as I am. I was happy to see him as we used to be desk mates back when we were children. But he constantly tried to one-up me throughout the conversation and even said I was too easy.... what does that even mean? I also get comments that I am a clueless person, although I am not sure where it's coming from.   
People have been constantly commenting on how quiet I am or if I have any friends at all and I am not sure why they make those comments because I am very laidback but not quiet.    


Sorry about the rant, these incidences have been occurring so often, I wonder what is wrong with me and why people keep treating me like shit.

For the last few years, I worked in SEO (search engine optimization) and it was a very interesting sphere for me, but I was laid off work. Now I'm looking for a job and I'm slowly realizing that this sphere no longer brings me that satisfaction. I've been taking regular vacations, but it only helps for a short time.

Now I am haunted by thoughts of realizing my business idea

I am very fond of outdoor activities, namely trekking and multi-day mountain trips with tents, backpacks, etc.  
For a long time, I have been updating all the elements of my equipment and reselling used equipment. Over the years, I have gained a very deep understanding and knowledge of building tents, backpacks, and other equipment. Now I have an idea and samples to create a fleece jacket and a tent that will be cool on the market.

All of these processes with my job gradually led me to think that it might be time to realize my idea of creating equipment with my own brand but I am very afraid of financial risks and high competition in the market.

I have a little experience in retail sales since the 1st year of university. I have a great knowledge of materials and technologies used in equipment. I have ideas on how to improve and create items that will be useful for travelers, but I don't know how to turn my ideas into reality.

I considered the option of using my knowledge in SEO on the products of companies that produce something for outdoor activities, but unfortunately, I did not find such vacancies.

18d0xq9,New grad — Not sure which job offer to accept.,"So I’m graduating in just 2 weeks with my B.S. in computer science. I had an internship last summer at company A which I enjoyed working at, but I’m not really interested in the product or work. They gave me a return offer for 80k and unlimited vacation and I ended up accepting it.  
Today, I received another job offer from company B. The salary is $77k + 3k in relocation assistance, and 15 days PTO. 
Clearly the offer from Company B is slightly worse, but it is in a different city which is a plus for me since I want to try living somewhere other than my home town, and it’s in an industry that I’m interested in with work on a product that I think is really cool. 
I’m really struggling with what to do. On one hand I feel like it’s a mistake to give up a job that I know has really amazing WLB at company A, but at the same time I think I would regret not going after work that I’m passionate about. 
Another issue is that I would have to renege my acceptance of the job offer with company A, which I’m assuming would burn all bridges there. (is it possible to renege and still keep the door open if I changed my mind and moved back to my home town?)

18d0vht,Should I decline this offer?,"So, I went through a 4-stage interview process, provided and set up meetings for them to contact my references, all while balancing a full workday and other interviews that I had already confirmed my attendance. For context this job is *decent* not great in regard to benefits or pay, some of the other interested companies have better pay and better benefits but I do like the ""Small team"" dynamic of this one and see a lot of potential for growth there.  


Now, yesterday after describing to the benefits ""off the top of their head"" the CEO was like I need you to make a decision by Friday, I explained I have prior obligations and wouldn't be able to make a decision until the following Friday. They said that was unacceptable and that they'd need one by Wednesday, finally after more talking, I get them to agree to Wednesday, while trying to make me feel bad for needing time to decide.  


This morning I get an email that says more or less ""We still have other candidates so this offer is only on the table until another one accepts.""  


At this point, I feel like I have gone *way* above and beyond for this job, especially with other firms offering a *much* more generous salary after just 2 interviews, no references, and no background check from this crazy aggressive company (checkr, I've done one with them before, and it's clean, but they're just insanely aggressive and difficult to please).

18cxy9q,Trying to decide if leaving retail would be a good idea after 25 years,"I've been thinking about leaving my current job for around 6 years now. I work in a grocery store as a grocery clerk and I just passed the 25 year mark recently. I have built up 4 vacations now. I only ever take 3 though, because that is all my dad picks for me. We always take vacations together.

I just learnt that I make only 2 dollars an hour more than what meat department does starting out. If I did the math right I should be making around 4 dollars an hour more than meat department starting out after 50 years.

I have no desire to move up in this company.

The problem is I've been worried about my financial future because I've come to realize that my parents wont be able to support me financially forever. I looked online and see that I should be able to get a small apartment and stay single forever and this job would do fine, but IDK if I want that future. I never moved out of my parents house and just want to live like this forever, but I don't see that happening. My parents are both retired now.

My father worked in retail for 47 years before he retired. He worked 2 jobs off and on over the years to support a family of 5. My sisters moved out over 20 years ago, but I never did. So my parents still take care of me. Plus from what I hear both my nieces got there bachelors degree and make twice what I do and both end up having a room mate to pay the bills, so how am I supposed to make it on my own?

I have been talking about leaving my job with my parents for awhile and even started up college again, but I dropped out for the third time. That third time dropping out and seeing my schedule back to full time hit me real hard and idk if I'll recover from this. Perhaps in time I will.

I feel like if I leave my current job then I would finally begin to grow up and stop living in the past. Would it be wise for me to switch careers next year or should I just accept working here for the next 25 years and end up with a 50 year anniversary with this place?

18cxjis,I have had a very tough situation with a co-worker that I have always been getting along with very well. They are more seinior than me. How to properly handle the situation?,"So this person is not my boss... basically my superior I guess, and we have always been maintaining a pretty good relationship. Not even close to like work-friends, but never had a single issue, in fact we don't even work together too much. Just having a few conversations about life, and ask a few work-related questions once or twice a week.

**The context**. *There is some overlap in our work, however, it is not too much. There is one process that this person initiated a long time ago when they were a part of a different team and this is sort of related to my job, and few months ago we briefly talked about moving it to me (I initiated this because I though it would be something that I should be doing, but it wasn't urgent), however, it never happened due to many system/permissions related issues which are solvable, but way too complex to turn around quickly. In addition to that, there were many new projects assigned to both of us and we never talked about that process until now.*

*There was no direction from my or their boss to have the process moved to me, but I told them that it would be eventually my process, but nobody really cared because it is still that person's job to do, and due to their permission/applications they have they can do it in just a few minutes. However, over the last couple of weeks, I was thinking of finally having it resolved in a month or two.*

**The situation.** We had a some sort of verbal exchange about some system issues recently ( just a regualr conversation really), and this person asked me about the process in a pretty harsh way. They almost yelled at me in front of everyone (our bosses weren't there at the moment). Basically they said something along the lines of: "" it is a part of your job, and you should do it, I can't be doing it no longer, when are you finally going to set it up so you could do it?"" but in a very rude and agressive way.. I would never expect this person to talk to me like that, and they never really asked me about the progress of this initiative ever before. It got me a bit confused.

Of course, I tried to defend myself, and at the same time told them that I would ensure that it should be done relatively soon (I really got lots of work on my plate from my actual bosses).

I believe I didn't deserve this kind of treatment, and should have probably pushed back? How to properly hande the situation and should I talk to them about that?",QuestionsAsker99,5,0.8600000143051147,5,1701961516,2023-12-07 15:05:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18cxjis/i_have_had_a_very_tough_situation_with_a_coworker/,12,2023

Accepted a good HR Director role at a good company a few days ago and am happy after 6 months of searching. The job requires relocation to a similar sized city about 5 hours away but am good with it.

Today, I find out I’m getting an offer from another company.  It’s a better job, larger company doing more of what I want to do and it’s 15 minutes from my house for a little more money.  I also know and like the team and my prospective manager.

I truly could be happy at either company.  I think I accepted the 1st offer in good faith since it was a job I want and there was no other offer on the table.

I’m a rule-follower at heart.  How bad would it be to back out of the 1st offer which I have already accepted?

I need some advice regarding my career path :
I have a master’s degree in Accounting and Finance from a french University and for the last 15 years I have held various roles in finance as FP&A, Finance Business Partner and also Financial Controller mainly in the telecom industry. I moved to the UK about a year ago and it has been a struggle to find a job here relevant to my experience. I don’t have a UK recognised accounting qualification such as ACCA or CIMA and studying towards one of these is not really a possibility at the moment. Do you think I should continue applying for these kinds of role and hope to find a company that is not bothered by me not having an accounting qualification ? Or should I try completely changing career path and turn to BI analysis or Finance ERP implementation ?

18coawa,Did I get my coworker fired?,"Today at work I (27f) was in an uncomfortable situation with a coworker 21m. We were alone together and his usual line of questioning me for a date escalated into full on hinting to ask if I would have sex with him at work and him telling me he wanted to show me his junk. It was nt a malicious conversation and most of it was in jest and he is a joker. There was lots of talk about sex but after I refused, his comments about me appearing friendless and too uptight were really the stinger.      

In my hurt and angered state about his personal comments about my personality, I felt so embolded as to directly tell my manager so and so (21m) asked me on a date and I refused and he was so persistent it made me feel disgusted.       

I didn't mention the sex stuff but I did show that there were unwanted advances made. Manager promptly told me he'd take care of it....I begged him to tell me what he meant by that....I didn't want to get the guy fired. I was just hurt and upset by his digs at me after I flat out refused him and I suppose for a second I wanted to see him get punished, but now that I snapped out of my hurt and anger I feel I took it too far.           

What would realistically happen in this scenario? How is my manager going to take care of it? He won't tell me when I asked, he just said that so and so won't be bothering me any more. I really regret telling my manager outright what happen d cause I feel like I admitted I can not fight my battles.

18ckzxw,Never did any internships or job fairs in college and I know I messed up. Now over 6 months after graduation how do I get myself back on track?,"tl;dr: Recent college graduate with a sociology/economics degree, was a social and academic shut-in the entire time, graduated with good results but zero connections and am now struggling to find even an entry level professional job

So I graduated this spring from a small private university with a Bachelor's in Sociology and Economics. During my time in school, I spent very little time on campus outside of class, and didn't engage very much - if at all - with the various career resources available to students. I *could* make excuses here about how covid impacted campus life or decreased resource availability or whatever, but basically over four years I didn't do anything but go to class, do the bare minimum and work at my shitty grocery store job (where I still work). 

I guess I assumed that finding a job post-grad was something that would happen entirely after graduation, so my plan in my head was that I'd take a few months over the summer and fall after school to decompress with a lighter workload, then I'd start applying for real in the winter. Well, I've started doing that, and with a little research I've realized that I'm about a year and a half behind schedule. It seems genuinely impossible to break into a professional workplace (even the most entry level positions) without any experience or connections, and now I'm feeling very stuck.

Basically, I know I messed up, if I could go back I would, but what I'm asking is: what can I do now? I'm not even trying to make hundreds of thousands a year or anything, I'm not an ambitious person by nature, just looking for something in my field before working in customer service inevitably kills me.

18ck12y,Wanting to leave a small company after less than half a year. How to explain during a job interview I have tomorrow?,"Back in college, I landed an 8-month co-op at a (small – less than 15 people – most of them also being co-op students) doctor's office during my third year (research student - handling the data analysis). Fast forward to 2023, post-graduation, and I found myself in the typical job market struggle. We all know how tough it's been out there, especially in the last year. Then, out of the blue, my old boss from the co-op job messages me with a job offer because there was no one handling the data after I left. I didn't waste a second and jumped right back in. But this job is definitely not my dream job, far from it.  
  
The work I'm doing now is a far cry from my co-op days (mostly involved simple data analysis for medical research). My boss is a big dreamer with grand ideas for his company, and I'm all in for that but things have changed in the 1.5 years I was away finishing my degree. The past 4 or 5 months have been a bit of a rollercoaster. The lack of clear direction and zero training (there's literally no one to train me) has me feeling like I'm wading through a swamp. I'm the go-to person for data analytics (my job title now is technically research analyst) or anything technical in general and everyone treats me like an expert, even though I only have a minor in applied statistics (my main degree is in health sciences). Maybe I oversold myself when I took the job?  
  
I want to work in data analytics, but here's the biggest problem – my boss wants me to handle tasks that usually fall on people like software engineers, computer scientists or senior data scientists with master’s degrees (I am being asked to look into things like machine learning – something my undergrad degree never taught me and I have no clue how to teach myself??). Small company problems… They can't afford a squad of specialists. But it's messing with my confidence. I keep saying I'll figure things out, but the truth is, I'm struggling. I don't have the technical knowledge for most of the things my boss wants. It's chipping away at my self-esteem constantly failing and struggling. I’m trying to strike a balance between being eager to learn and not setting myself up for a fall. I am starting to get extremely burnt out after less than half a year here.  
  
Recently, I got an interview offer for a job I applied to over 4 months ago, before I started my current job. I might be jumping the gun but given my current jobs toll on my mental health and the unknowns of this potential new job, it feels like a glimmer of hope to escape my current situation. The job is at a much bigger company, and I found the team I would be apart of, there are people there who could be mentors to me and actually provide training.  
  
Now, with the backstory laid out, I could use some advice on a couple things. I've always heard that leaving a job before a year looks bad, but since I applied for this new job pre-current job, it's not even on the resume I submitted. Should I even bring up my current job? The easy way out is to say I've been on a brief hiatus these past couple months, but what if they ask for a reference from when I was a co-op student at my current place? Obviously, I will have to make my boss aware that I am job searching, which could lead to a bad reference since they might feel like I am blindsiding them.  
  
Also, this whole situation has made me realize I need to start job hunting. I'm pretty miserable, and it's taking a toll on my self-esteem. How do I broach this topic with prospective employers? Explaining why I want to leave feels like a whole saga. And quitting – the company is so small they don't even have an HR department, just a medical office assistant juggling HR duties.  
  
I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and don't want to burn any bridges, especially since I respect my boss and colleagues. And, I know people might suggest talking to my boss, but it's tough. I'm afraid he'll think I'm not cut out for the job, especially since I am sure there are people out there who do have more of the skills needed for this position and are willing to accept a lower pay with how scarce jobs are right now. But bills, student loans, rent in a high-cost area – I can't afford to be jobless in this market. It's a bit of a catch-22, dealing with a job I'm not happy about but still getting a paycheck, which is better than the unemployment alternative.  
  
  
  
Sorry this is a bit of a rant and thanks in advance for any advice you're able to offer!!

18ciekm,Go back to the former company to higher position or to go with high mental stress for a few 100s more in Fortune 500,"Hello everyone,

I left my former company to enter fortune 500  and regretting it big time. I am around 6 months here and near the total breakdown. I am part of the small division that my boss formed in the middle of this year and I was first employee in that division. I set up the whole CAD/PDM/SAP ecosystem, wrote the work instructions and automated the CAD setup process for every new employee.

I also won a big project for the company and constantly either on business trips or doing a lot of CAD work and parallel also doing bosses job (making a presentations for his project, reallocating people  to the projects - because he don't know how to do it. I am also giving employees advices on how to design something, stepping in if someone is on vacation and so on).

Anyways boss is a real emotional a-hole and coward (and I am really nice when I say it this way). He doesn't own his mistakes, constantly has emotional breakdowns and yelling or putting some nervous vibe on the team. He also sometimes sit with me for an hours complaining how world ain't fair and he still ain't CEO in his 50s...and that he deserved it to get CEO because he is such a nice guy. As you see he unload at least once a week his private problems on me. 

Problem is that pay is somehow good and job is near my home. In the other hand I got an offer in a former company that is much more far away (30mi). I am also getting promoted if I take this job in a former company to higher function where I can exit CAD almost completely - which would be after 7 years refreshing and more interesting and I am highly competent to take offered role. But the money will be same as I earn now and I have some travel time that I can reduce only if I move to that area this summer (also an option). The boss in a former company is also a real manager and really fair and straightforward person. I worked with him and we delivered results successfully without problems or drama.

What would you do and have you ever stayed for the money and name (fortune500) in the company or would you take a chance and move to a higher position even if it means to move 30mi away to save some gas and time? It also doesn't look good on resume if I leave fortune500 after half a year. Anyways Fortune 500 announced layoffs in our division last week.

Thanks in advance :)",3D-krkan,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1701907838,2023-12-07 00:10:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ciekm/go_back_to_the_former_company_to_higher_position/,12,2023

I (29 male) am on vacation right now with my partner (30 female) and my team lead keeps harassing me despite me being out on PTO. I work for a software company in tech support that my partner also used to work for (she no longer does). While on vacation my team lead called me to ask about my previous PTO utilization (what day I took off for a previous holiday), she’s texted me multiple times to sign up for a work conference by Friday, for me to call her regarding this, and she’s called my partners cell phone (former employee) looking for me. I haven’t been as responsive because well I’m on vacation and I want to disconnect from work while I’m enjoying my time at a theme park resort. I’m honestly busy in the day and don’t see the messages and voicemails until evening. They do however make me feel harassed and like I can’t relax on vacation. Is there a way I can tell her professionally that these questions are not life threatening and the deadlines are a non issue so she needs to stop messaging and calling me (and my partner) when nothing is “on fire”? None of the other team leads engage in this behavior and she’s known for being like this with all employees. Should I talk to HR? Should I talk to her boss? Should I only talk to her directly?

For reference, both jobs would be in IT just different facets

I have an interview coming up in about a week for a different position in the same company. I and others around me have agreed that not much career advancement happens in my current department and I work with another department frequently thats interested in hiring me. I dont have any real distaste for my current department (outside the whole advancement thing) and I'm aware that I'm a key player, but management just happens to be notoriously stingy.

My question is, there is an opening for a lead position in my department that was created just recently and I was wondering if I should notify my manager that I'm interviewing or wait till a job offer is in hand to tell him that, in order to stay, I would want that position.

I know that its best to wait till an opportunity is actually in the hand but considering its internal and I'd still be working with him at least somewhat, I'm also trying to be as professional as possible.

18ceusj,"Fired Predecessor, Should I Be Worried","About 6 months ago, I took a contract position at a medium-sized accounting firm. It's kind of a new role at the firm that was previously started by one other person - my predecessor - and was a permanent full-time role, I am signed as a contractor.

Here is my worry. The more I dig around the files and documentation, the more I realize that my predecessor was quite good at their job. Everything was meticulously documented, including some fancy things with Excel that I didn't realize were possible. The only area where I don't think he's good at is some technology skills, where I am a lot better at. His output wasn't great.

My predecessor was fired. Normally, I wouldn't think much of it, but all my co-workers have had nothing but positive things to say to the point I'm starting to feel like I have Imposter Syndrome. The only person who has anything negative to say about him is his, and my, direct manager. But if my experience has been similar to his, the direct manager and I don't work on a lot of projects together and the bulk of my time is spent on projects with accountants, assistants and other staff. Besides a meeting or 2 a month, we don't interact all that much.

Should I worry that what happened to my predecessor? I know it sounds weird to be worried about someone who doesn't work here anymore, but I'm worried it is a pattern of behavior with my manager, or if I should be worried by what appears to be an impossibly high bar that I'm being judged by.

So I'm feeling insecure on two fronts: 

One, I haven't been able to find any reason for why my predecessor was fired. Looking him up on LinkedIn, I found he has a ton of experience and a good reputation in the industry. Everyone else here has great things to say about him and I still use his templates for all my projects. Based on what I can tell, it wasn't his performance or his personality that led to his firing. And the only person with anything bad to say about him is my boss. So, what could that possibly be?

Two, I don't think it's fair I'm being compared to him and it seems like every time we approach a new project, I get hit with ""that's not how we've traditionally done it"". I'm sort of tempted to say fuck him, but can't for obvious reasons. I want to reach out to him on LinkedIn and ask him for tips, but I'm guessing that was be super improper.",AcceptableCarlos,5,0.8500000238418579,4,1701898345,2023-12-06 21:32:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ceusj/fired_predecessor_should_i_be_worried/,12,2023

Due to time management and government regulations, I chose to find my first “real” job earlier this year. 

After being hired, I was made aware that I was going to be launching a new subsidiary of the company that hired me in the US, alone. Sure, I’ve got some support from HQ, but nothing that really helps. Due to the time difference, we are rarely in the office at the same time. Essentially, this company is NOT a retail company, but this new subsidiary is. The “support” I receive is less than helpful, as these guys don’t understand the market in general. 

Long story short - they developed a few products without getting any feedback from anyone in the US, and absolutely NO ONE wants them. It’s quite literally impossible for me to do my job without marketing support, brand awareness campaigns, etc. 

The company made it abundantly clear that their goal within 18-24 months is to sell the company.

18cd5ch,I Messed Up by Falling Asleep,"(To preface this post: I’ve been having sleep issues and am still undergoing testing with a neurologist. I make it through most days but I end up falling asleep when I get home and normally don’t wake until work the next day.)

Today during my lunch hour, things went as usual - I clocked out, closed all the screens but the time clock. I decided to watch a video to pass the time and next thing I know, I’m jolting myself awake right at the hour mark. To say I was mortified is an understatement. However, my embarrassment doesn’t stop there. I was hoping no one noticed since my cubicle is in the far back corner. Unfortunately, I got an email from my boss about it, informing me that it was unprofessional and I need to go out to my car to nap. I kinda suspect one of the old-timer executives saw me since he stops by to speak with my boss and her boss often and he’s not a very kind/understanding person. 

Do I write an apology email? Or do I just go on as if nothing like this happened and just go to my car during lunch in case I fall asleep again. I honestly did not intend to fall asleep and I’m truly embarrassed it happened.",PurpleShark2619,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1701893982,2023-12-06 20:19:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18cd5ch/i_messed_up_by_falling_asleep/,12,2023
18cct56,Can you continue to negotiate after you receive a counter-offer?,"Hi, I received a job offer for $58,000 a year and I countered by telling them that I was targeting roles in the 70-75k range. I gave my explanations for why I believe this range is appropriate given my working experience, education, and also the market rate. I live in a HCOL and many of my friends who work in marketing make around the 70,000 range. The company countered by $64,000 which is a decent jump from 58,000 but the 58,000 was a huge lowball to me.  
The initial job listing was for part-time but they decided to make the job full-time which is better for me anyway. I was flexible with them jumping to full-time and told them I could start immediately so I feel like my flexibility should also be taken into account for compensation. What would do in this situation? I'm afraid to counter-offer because another candidate and I were ""neck and neck"", that they may just drop me to approach the other candidate.  
Options are:  
Counter offer again and explain that that compensation is still too low for the market range.  
Agree to the base pay, but negotiate factors like PTO  
I'm not willing to walk away from this offer, but just trying to make sure I get the best I could possibly be given.  
ALSO - I would like to note, that throughout this entire interview there was no salary range/budget for the role given to me by the company. On the job listing when it was a part-time listing, the range was posted, and they've offered me the highest out of that range, but that was the only time I was ever given a budget and it was not expressed verbally once in the interview. The email also does not say - ""this is the highest offer we can give"" or anything like that.  
Thanks so much, I appreciate your help - this was the exact response I got also: ""I appreciate the thorough review you've given to the offer. After careful consideration, we can offer a salary of $64,500 per year, which our team believes reflects a fair compromise between our initial proposal, your desired range, and our research of market value for this position.""",RelevantGlass6625,1,1.0,1,1701893121,2023-12-06 20:05:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18cct56/can_you_continue_to_negotiate_after_you_receive_a/,12,2023
18ccqow,US Employment: Possible Lawsuit?,"I feel like I already know the answer to this question, but here goes. I am a senior-level team member at an organization. I know, at my level, I should have informed my CEO as soon as I started to look for another job, but I do not trust that my CEO will not do something illogical based on past emotional reactions to other team members. 

I received a verbal offer for a job yesterday with a partner vendor of my current organization offering $60,000 more than what I am making at my current job. I asked what the next steps would be and the recruiter informed me she would then be calling my references and getting employment verification and that she would send me the written offer today. Hearing this, I told her that I wanted to be the one to inform my current CEO (instead of HR informing the CEO that they had completed a verification for me). The recruiter agreed and said she understood. Fast forward until this morning when I tell my CEO that I will be leaving, and offered her a full Succession and Transition Plan including the required notice amount as well as additional time to make the transition smoother. My CEO said that she was going to immediately terminate the contract with the vendor that was hiring me 'to teach them not to poach me'. Her ending the contract is potent, because all other organizations similar to this one in NC will follow her suit and also cancel their contracts with the vendor. So, now, I am genuinely concerned that the vendor will rescind the offer they had verbally offered me because hiring me would be such a detriment to their ability to do business in my state. SHe fired off the termination letter to the vendor half an hour after my giving her my resignation. Now I may be left without a job in a month. 

Do I have any recourse? I know that she can end the contract with the vendor at any point, but this seems retaliatory. She was smart enough to cite the clause that we can end te contract 'for any reason', but her intentions are very evident and I am screwed.

There are other options that pay more that are easier to do. I'm also thinking of doing business administration, but I'm not sure how interesting it will be or if it will be boring. I'm really good in chemistry I enjoy learning theory of physical sciences, but I don't enjoy working in laboratories or working for big pharma, especially after reading Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood.

18c9gfj,I feel like I don't know where to go,"Hello everyone I'm new to this group. I recently graduated from Full Sail University with a certificate in Creative Writing, but before that I was in school for game art and design way back in 2015, while I enjoyed what I was learning and dreamed of making it to the gaming industry, I was also hindered by something that was out of my control. My mother was dealing with an autoimmune disease that was affecting her liver. For a while, I tried to balance both school and home life, but it was a nightmare for me. I had to drop some classes and even took some time from school to help my mother through her illness. I returned in spring of 2016 after she had a full liver transplant, and I finally had hit my stride. I was on the Dean's Honor roll, and even was chosen as student of the month in my concept and illustration class, but by 2018 that's when it all came to a halt.

I found out from one of the staff members at the school that it would be closing. By the end of summer 2018, I decided to leave before the school officially closed in 2019. From there I started working regular jobs, I still kept my hopes high that I would return to school and I did by the end of the year when I enrolled for screenwriting. I liked it, but trying to balance my work life was becoming difficult. I dropped out.

I stayed out of school until 2022, and decided that I'd approach things differently. I decided that I'd get a certificate rather than a degree. I enrolled at Full Sail for Creative Writing, and graduated in May of 2023. I thought things would be good, but it's been a difficult journey. I tried to apply for writing jobs, blogging, even some entry level roles for screenwriting, or news writing ,but nothing. Now I feel like I want to go back to school,but at the age of 35 I feel like I'm being pulled very which way and it's become annoying to me.

18c9c8z,Career Switches,"Hey r/careeradvice peeps,

As revealed in the subsequent text, I’ve become scatter-brained in terms of what I want to pursue career-wise. I can see myself pursuing all different types of careers, but leaning toward those simultaneously involving numbers and open communication. In essence this is a cry for help and guidance to hone in on what I’d like, be good at, and be fairly compensated for.

I appreciate all/any input. I’d love to me suggested an interest career path I’ve never considered :]



Before my word vomit, here’s my bottom line- I’m eager about a potential career in the data and/or tech space, but looks like I have a ton of work in front of me before I fire off a even a single job app.

I’m ready to commit to building technicals skills and building a portfolio displaying competencies, but considering my interest in data, I am worried my efforts will be outpaced by AI’s capabilities which are increasing on a seemingly daily basis.

****My likely ignorant question- In terms of pursuing a data-oriented career path, is it worth it to start at this point? Inevitably, when we see more developed AI work its way into business and lower tenured data analysts get the boot, how could I safely transition?

Whether or not this sounds ridiculous, it’s a legitimate fear of mine lol




More context for those who are bored:

I’m still pretty early in my career (25), but know I’d be much happier doing something else/feel pressure from myself to figure my ish out sooner rather than later. I’m currently working in a commercial finance role doing project budget/expense stuff but feel like I’ve mastered the role and want more… elsewhere…

While I have experience handling data via Excel, some SQL, Tableau, etc. it’s definitely not in the same manner or degree of a data analyst. I’m well aware projects/any relevant experience are pretty much mandatory to land even an entry level data analyst job- or any job for that matter…

Numbers aside I really enjoy presenting/communicating along with other essential soft skills.

Apologies for the lengthiness and thanks if you read this far :]",Apollotron,1,1.0,0,1701884221,2023-12-06 17:37:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18c9c8z/career_switches/,12,2023

I work in fundraising/donor relations/some event planning. One position I find relevant to include is a position I held in my sorority in college. It was called ""Sisterhood Chair"" (later changed to Sisterhood Officer after I graduated), which imo is a surefire way to get an eye roll. But it actually took quite a bit of involvement. I had to coordinate events for the entire chapter of girls (around 200 people) and worked with a (small) budget and had to organize transportation, communicate with local businesses, plan team building exercises, recruit volunteers, etc. etc.

The point of the position was to organize events that would get ""sisters"" out into healthy environments (no drugs, alcohol, or partying) to socialize, meet and bond with their fellow chapter members.

I don't plan on putting it on my resume with any bullet points or anything because it's pretty minor at this point in my career (I'm happily on my 3rd desk job) it's more of like a ""hey look how long and at different levels I've been doing this work"" kinda thing

""Sisterhood Chair"" just seems laughable and feels like it undermines what it actually was. Anyone have any good phrasing I could use? I was thinking Member Engagement Officer but that sounds kind of vague.. I want to steer away from anything that sounds frilly due to unfortunate sorority reputations.

Understandably, input would be needed across the board so we could compromise on a good naming convention to make it possible to even find a KB in the directory. As it currently stands, documents have no naming convention, are incredibly long and lack keywords to easily decipher what the document is about. 

I’ve received no support from my manager to field this effort. It’s frustrating as I and the majority of my coworkers are the same grade. I am the second youngest, and also the newest to the unit, so I feel as if so am overstepping.

I recently found a position in my old agency for Problem & Change management. It’s a bit out of my wheelhouse regarding SLA’s, however, relaying information in meetings and creating public facing outage reports and Memos is something I have quite a bit of experience with in a previous position.

18c4vom,I hate my job,"I just started a new job 3 months ago in corporate at a large, publicly traded company. I love the people I work with and my boss is great. 

The thing is, it’s very stressful. I’m working on like 10 projects simultaneously and I’m still at the point where i don’t know what i don’t know. I go in to work everyday stressed about tasks and if I’m gonna mess up or miss deadlines. 

Im not in an industry or field where I see myself in long term, but I really don’t know what I would want to do otherwise. 

My fear is that I’m either stuck here until I figure something else out, or if I get let go that I don’t have enough experience to get another job.

18c4nlw,What to do in this situation while interviewing? Pls advise,"Hi! I’m a recent grad and have been looking for jobs for the last 2 months. At the moment I’m in the process of interviewing for two different positions at two different reputable banks (let’s called them bank and position A and B respectively). Both banks only have two rounds of interviews and then either an offer or rejection. However, I have already scheduled the second interview for bank A next week and the second interview for bank B in early January (as that’s just the way the interview dates are set up and nothing earlier is available). Personally I find the opportunity at bank B more appealing, interesting, and fitting for me although option A is also really good, but given the choice I’d pick B. Now I’m in a pickle because I feel that bank A really likes me and there’s a good chance after the second interview next week I will be offered a contract but that also means I need to give them a response before the end of the year meaning I won’t even get to interview for bank B. I could ofc decline bank A and go for the second interview of bank B in Jan, but possibility is I can get rejected in the second round and be left with no options. I really want to at least have a shot at trying for bank B but also want to respect bank A and not burn bridges with them given they are also an amazing bank. How would you handle this situation?

18byvwi,Advice for 23 y/o feeling lost in my career -nurses and IT advice,"Hello everyone, I was wondering if anyone has gone through a similar situation and could offer me some guidance as I’m pretty lost right now and do not know what to do with my life. I am 23 years old with a biology degree and work in a healthcare job paying me $15 an hour. I recently got a scholarship to go back to school to pay for a nursing program but lost it because I cannot seem to pass the exams associated with nursing. I have a learning disability and have used my testing accomodations in hopes that it will help but have never been a great test taker-especially because nursing questions require you to know how to answer the questions in a specific way (there are multiple right answers but which one is the “best” answer? Type questions). I have tried my hardest in the first semester but cannot seem to get the level score that I want. It is so demoralizing to me because I wanted to go into healthcare but now am forced to look into different careers. I know that I’m not stupid and am capable of doing it. I’m great with patients and know I am capable of being a great nurse but the way that programs are set up I don’t think I will be able to pass. I just do not want to keep spending my money and time into something that I may fail again as the program will just progressively get harder. This has also brought on a lot of issues with my mental health where my mental health has significantly declined- can’t get out of bed, don’t enjoy the things/hobbies I used to, getting more irritable with people around me. The only thing I’ve been doing is pretty much going to work and school and do not have time to do anything else. At the same time, I’ve lost of friendships this past year and do not really have any friends anymore. To make matters worse, I don’t have any family that live near me to provide support during this tough time. It’s just me and my dog. 

Additionally, I do receive VA funding and receive $1400 a month for school expenses  and am able to switch programs but I do use the majority of this to pay living expenses. I am thinking of just doing a post graduate certificate but do not know what to get into or if that will even help me get a job. The good thing about this is that i can do it pretty much at my own pace but just had to be done within a year. The options are: supply chain management, cybersecurity, Data analytics. There is so many options but I do not know what to choose. I want to get into tech but after the demoralization of nursing school, I am afraid to try something different and fail again as I also have no experience in it. 

There is also the option of  going into a program that I was accepted into called the Workforce recruitment program that will help tie me into a federal job for recent graduates with a disability. My dad has worked in a government job for 20+ years as a procurement specialist and he wanted me to go into that. There’s a bunch of different options but I’m not even sure anyone will hire me as I have no experience other than healthcare.


So what do you think I should do? 
1. Pursue nursing again even after failing 
2. Get a post graduate certificate that I am unsure will help me get a job as I have an unrelated Biology degree (options are supply chain management, data analytics, Cybersecurity). 
3. Try for a federal job through the workforce recruit program that I also have no experience in. 

It all sucks because I was so passionate and motivated to finally finish my degree and start my life and had a set plan for what I wanted to do, but now I feel like a complete failure and am afraid I will be stuck working at a low paying job even with a degree. I had a set plan of what I wanted to do and it completely went the opposite direction. That all just went downhill these past couple of months. The uncertainty of it all scares me, but I’ve always gotten through tough times but this just seems impossible. I have worked so hard for everything just to feel like I’m stupid and a complete failure. 

I’ve been seeing a therapist and have been going out of my way to to things outside of school and work so that I can find joy in life again and do not feel miserable all the time.

I feel like if I don’t try nursing again, then I’m feeling like I’m lazy and am a complete failure. If I go with options 2 & 3, I am afraid that I will dislike it and also fail at it. So either way I go, I’ll feel bad regardless. At this point, it feels like I would rather just have a job that pays me well that I am able to actually live comfortably and support myself. The question is what route will best benefit me that I can succeed in that I am able to live off comfortably but also has a good work-life balance?

18by62a,Feeling unappreciated and undervalued at my job. Any advice on how to get back ontrack,"Does anybody have any advice for when you feel unappreciated and undervalued at your job?


For context this is what is going on. I work as an engineer at a defense contractor. I've been there around 3.5 years with 2 of those being FT and 1.5 being an intern. This year, in hopes of getting better performance reviews and hopefully a promotion I started taking on more responsibility on the projects I was working on. I took on essentially the responsibility/classification of an engineer a level above me and got really good feedback from the stakeholders etc all saying I was doing a great job. I was pretty confident this would land me as a 3 on the performance scale (we use a 4 point scale with 2 being a normal performer) but when I had my review today I got a 2 unfortunately. I don't really mind that especially if I were to get a promotion but my boss made a comment about how I would need a 3 to get a promotion and that we'd have to wait until after next year's reviews. To add insult to injury he said raises were only going to be about 2.75% this year which really rubbed salt into the wound bc I was expecting 3.5-4%. Overall it was a pretty demoralizing review to begin with but it got even worse. When probing into why, my manager who sometimes has verbal diarrhea essentially said all the higher reviews went to people on more visible programs at our location which really upset me because I have been constantly getting put on projects out at other office locations and really don't have much control over what projects I am placed on. Overall, it's essentially killed any motivation I have to want to go the extra mile and I really just want to sulk at the job at this point. Anybody have any advice on how to get on track? I am planning on asking to get more local work as part of feeling undervalued if that will help.",ALonelyPecan,1,0.5,2,1701845367,2023-12-06 06:49:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18by62a/feeling_unappreciated_and_undervalued_at_my_job/,12,2023
18bxrdm,Currently a Management Student. What are the available opportunities for me?,"Hi everyone! Hope y'all are doing well.

I'm currently a freshman at a known business school in the Philippines. 

𝗧𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝘀? 
I've been contemplating lately whether to transfer to a more specific course — business economics or integrated marketing — or just continue pursuing this ""generalist"" degree program.

As per my interest, I really am interested with the Management curriculum, and I am genuinely willing to study the subjects offered in my degree program. However, I get second thoughts about the opportunities I would get considering that this program is viewed to be more of a generalist course.

So I'm working part time in Marketing for a small brand and do social media content. I asked in advance for PTO (making sure to ask in advance so we could plan out social calendar accordingly).
My boss then told me the week before to create all the content and whatnot in advance for that week I'm off and any work I do overtime to prepare for that week off will just count towards my PTO, not as overtime pay. Because I'm part time I work like 4hrs a day btw. My PTO starts tomorrow so l've done the work but just wondering if this is an appropriate ask from my boss.

This is my first job, right out of undergrad, so I'm wondering if this is normal protocol? And if not like....what to do since I already did the work lol.

18bw86t,my boss tried to kiss me and confessed his feelings for me. i don’t know what to do now.,"my (23f) boss (37m) tried to kiss me. for context, this is my first corporate job so i know what i did was very naive and stupid. these are not mistakes i will soon repeat. 


we were getting drinks after work with 5 others. i hadn’t had much to eat and the night ended faster than i anticipated, so i was a little too tipsy to drive. he offered to drive me around until i sobered up. i agreed. 


he tried to pull me in for a kiss and i stopped him, confused. he is married, he knows i have a long term boyfriend, and most importantly he’s my fucking boss. we got along like a house on fire but i never thought he would cross those boundaries. he said i was flirting with him but i don’t think i was. i treated him like i would treat anyone else i was friends with. in fact i went to him with other peers who were making continuous advances towards me and he suggested i go to HR. i thought we were friends. i know it was a mistake. 


since that event, we have called a few times to talk. i told him i was furious for putting me in that position, knowing he has power over my career. i also felt invalidated and betrayed, as he gave me great feedback and we work in a place with not many other young women. i asked him to help me report to another manager instead but he doesn’t know how to do that without raising concern. (no shit). im also scared for backlash somehow. im scared people will think i’m a whore or take me less seriously. 


what do i do? i don’t want to ruin his life (his wife works at the same company) or destroy my career. im scared to go to HR. what if they don’t believe me? should i talk to the manager i want to report to instead? sorry if this is the wrong place for this. i’ve been wracked with anxiety.",basementfrog42,2,1.0,14,1701838272,2023-12-06 04:51:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18bw86t/my_boss_tried_to_kiss_me_and_confessed_his/,12,2023

18bv0wq,Put on paid administrative leave for 3 months and counting…,"I need some advice here. 

Context: I was placed on paid administrative leave 3 months ago for an accusation made against me by someone at work who hated the fact that I would push back on some of the decisions made about a certain project. This person is a narcissist and doesn’t like to be proven wrong even with data and facts. 

That being said this person tried to get me fired but I had been document for months prior all the bullying this person kept doing to me and a few other colleagues. I brought this up to managers and they always ignored it so I went through the whistleblower channel.

I have multiple pieces of evidence supporting my claim.

Now what’s been happening is no one from HR has provided any updates since 2 months and it’s been 3 in total of being on AL.  The more this goes on the more I feel like they are waiting for me to resign since they don’t have anything to actually incriminate me with and they know I have a ton of proof to incriminate them and how they had a blind eye to the bullying. 

I work for a federally regulated organization so we have retaliatory protections against whistleblowers.


So here we are, the more this feels like constructive dismissal, as long as I don’t resign.

18btufd,Burnt out and want to quit my job. Likelihood that I can get unemployment? Please read.,"Hi,

I know this title probably screams “lazy and entitled” but please read.

I work for a biotech company in a greenhouse and my job can be very physical. Normally I don’t mind because there is a balance between non physical labor and other, but recently my company had a big layoff and I have had to pick up all of the “technician” level work. 


I leave work pretty exhausted every day, and honestly it hurts my body. I am pretty active outside of work so I think moving all day + working out after and not getting enough sleep is doing a number on my body. 


I also commute 2 hours a day (round trip) which is getting incredibly old. 


I am getting to the point where I can no longer stand coming in to work. I dread every morning, and it’s hard to work with any sort of enthusiasm anymore. I am so burnt out.

I feel like I just need some time off to reset. A 2 week vacation doesn’t really do it for me..


I am wondering if I quit if there is any opportunity to get unemployment while I look for another job. I know the job market is rough right now and I would really like a bit of time to myself. I know it’s not recommended to quit without a backup but it has been so hard to come to work every day. 

I have a bit of savings I can live off of if needed but it wouldn’t be ideal.

This is where I need help - what are typical, professional responses here? I’m especially concerned with handling situations where the raise is less than or barely equivalent to CPI. Would it be worth expressing some disappointment and trying to open a bit of a negotiation as part of this conversation?

Do I inform a supervisor that I don’t want them in my region and leave it vague? Or is it time to start looking for an alternate place of work?

I don’t want to go too far into the details of the client dispute. But suffice it to say that if anyone at the client’s company sees my name they are going to pick up the phone and call Company B about me.

18bnowf,what did i do wrong?,"I recently started working full-time in July in an administrative role (pretty much like the team secretary.) My team is mostly managers with 10+ year's minimum of experience, so I was hired to help them with busy work (mostly, scheduling meetings, taking notes, weekly reports, etc.) Since starting, the feedback I've received is largely positive (about 95% I would say).

In my end of the year review with my manager, I, again, received mostly positive feedback (i.e. you're doing great, super helpful, we're impressed, etc.) The only ""criticism"" I've really received was that when I make mistakes, I fix them quickly (which came from 2 people on my team). The mistakes they're referring to were minimal and happened a month after I started (i.e. titling emails a certain way or including the zoom link in the location and meeting description). However, once I was told the first time, I fixed them right away and moving forward; I haven't been corrected since August. Aside from that, my only other mistake would be a missing word or two in my notes that I distributed, but before I send anything, I made sure to receive approval from the VP (so I feel like that is somewhat better than if I hadn't asked anyone at all). It was approved after all...

I've never left earlier than anyone else, nor arrived later than them in the morning. I guess, to summarize, I thought I was doing pretty well. I manage about 20+ weekly recurring meetings. I haven't forgotten to attend any or send notes afterwards.

Every year, my company offers merit based raises (typically ranging from 1-3%). I was offered a 2.35% raise, which I thought was good. In fact, when talking with my friends, in similar administrative roles, they mentioned receiving more negative feedback than I did. Despite this, two of them earned the full 3% raise. One of them even received a 3.3% raise (which I was told wasn't even possible). Anyways, the percentage increase is entirely merit-based, so assuming I could have gotten up to 3%, and I received a 2.35% raise, I scored a 78% (they grade out of 100).

How do I ask my manager for more feedback on where I went wrong? I feel blindsided, considering my friends and I all started at the same salary, but they've have since recently surpassed me. If I had to count, I've made about 5 ""mistakes"" exactly, which I feel like can be attributed to just being new and learning how they want me to do things. 

I know I should be grateful that I received any raise at all, and I am, but I'm confused why I received such a lower amount than everyone else. My friends have made similar mistakes as me, so I can't help but rethink my entire performance. I know I shouldn't compare myself to them, but we all started the same. I haven't received any feedback since August that would make me think I'm doing something wrong. But, I have to be doing something wrong to only earn a 78%.

This is my first job, and I feel so discouraged. I've always been a high performer (graduating in top 5% of my class), and this feels like a failure on my behalf. Any advice? Am I overthinking?

And yet I feel like I’m expected to do more and learn more about other departments when no one else has learnt about my department, which I don’t mind. I don’t mind being the only person who knows my department just like how my coworkers are the only people who knows their departments. But why are they getting paid more?

I sometimes think perhaps I’m more suited in a more admin/receptionist role. I’ve tried it for a few months and while I don’t mind the admin tasks, I felt a little lonely because I couldn’t just leave my desk and socialize with coworkers even during downtime. I also couldn’t delegate any tasks and ask for help. Perhaps I just need to develop better prioritizing skills? I recently saw a job posting of a receptionist job which peaked my interest a little, but I’m having such decision paralysis. I know I’m being stupid because it’s not like they’ll for sure hire me.

I won’t quit my current job until I have another one lined up, but I’m just having such a hard time deciding if I should keep my current job that I like and find a side hustle to subsidize it, or just get a new job all together.",ShopaholicQueen,2,1.0,0,1701813606,2023-12-05 22:00:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18bnnu8/is_it_time_for_to_move_on/,12,2023
18bn965,Lost in tech (or am I?),"I’m 33F and have worked in tech operations since age 21. With a combination of luck, connections/privilege, hard work and intentional network building, I am having a somewhat fulfilling career working on both operations and compliance for social tech startups as an operations lead who largely works as an IC. 

Despite being in a somewhat niche industry, I do well salary wise and so far haven’t had trouble finding or landing startup jobs. However, my career also feels a bit stagnant and I’m worried I’m putting myself in a box with working for early stage startups and going to hit a ceiling soon, especially once I have kids. 

Some of the challenges:
- I have mostly worked as an IC / vendor manager, so this holds me back somewhat from being respected and considered for management and exec positions. I’m not particularly passionate about management because it involves constantly disappointing people (IMO) , but I’m aware not being a manager is creating a salary ceiling and at a certain point it could look weird that I haven’t had more internal management positions 
- none of the startups I’ve worked for have been particularly successful, which also holds me back from professional growth. As a result, I usually have to jump ship after two years and I usually get poached by another company. I wouldn’t say my career has been held back by this because I’ve built new skill sets across different compliance and operations areas but it does hold me back from dealing with a certain scale of problems and being considered for big tech jobs and it also creates a distinct lack of stability for me  
- I don’t want to go back to school, and I’m not sure that I need to in my niche operations field. I do have interests in law (my ideal would be to eventually go to law school and become an IP or privacy lawyer, then go back to in house corporate tech law) but I don’t think I want to do that until my kids are not only born but In school which is years from now
- i am about to enter my “mom era” for awhile and have 2 kids if everything works out (trying to get pregnant for the first time next year) so I expect to have my career ambitions take a backseat and a hit for awhile

Anyone have similar experiences? How did it work out? Anything I should be doing now to help myself pre kids?",hokkz77,1,1.0,1,1701812599,2023-12-05 21:43:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18bn965/lost_in_tech_or_am_i/,12,2023

My only professional electrical experience so far has been working as an electrician apprentice for 3 years.

Since I was 11 years old my father taught me how to use a soldering iron and my interest in electronics design has been a natural progression ever since. I've built a ton of kits over the years and when I was 18 I started a small business building custom guitar pedals, designing the PCBs myself and using off the shelf components like opamps etc. It's still in the realm of basic analog but I want to take my skills further officially and professionally. Whilst I do struggle in advanced math, calculus and physics I have been able to master the formulas that were applicable to the designs and that I use often.

I'm a self-starter but do admittedly struggle with ADHD. Things that interest me usually give me the driving force to complete them whereas things that do not (my time at school, some low end jobs I had for example) can become a miserable slippery slope.

My local college does have academic upgrading and it is a consideration, however it's been 4 years since I've been at school and I am a little scared that I've lost the momentum so to speak. I bit the bullet anyway and I'm starting in January.

18blvoo,Non-Exempt rate question for new job offer - California,"Hi! I have been job hunting for months after being laid off, and finally got an offer that I intend to take. I just wanted to see if anyone has more knowledge about this salary question that I do, and any help would be super appreciated.

I was offered just under $30 an hour for a new position, where I would be non-exempt (California, btw.) I know that the threshold for non-exempt employees is raising to $32 an hour in 2024. The company would like me to start as soon as possible, before the new year.

My questions are: how would you go about navigating this? I'd like to be at that $32 an hour rate, and it seems as if I should be in 2024. Normally I'd try and negotiate for more around $35 an hour, but there seem to be benefits to being non-exempt (paid overtime?). Would the company be able to offer me $32 an hour before 2024, and if not, would they need to raise me to $32 after the new year? Or am I locking myself into 2024 with that just below $30 rate?

Any help would be beyond appreciated, and if anyone has any great insight I'd love to gift you a lil $5 starbucks gift card or cashapp for your troubles.

18blu9q,Rebooting Career,"Hello fellow Redditors, I hope you are all doing awesome!

I have had a rough few years personally and it has affected my career trajectory. This is as well as personal decisions deciding in career. Right now, I am currently working at a large retail book store in a temporary position, but I am struggling to learn the Point of Sale System, due to the large amount of operations required. The position would only be for 4 weeks and I am just finishing my first week. 

I am in recovery from substances, and have had a wonky resume as a result. My resume currently looks like with the most current being at the top:

\-1.5 years at a non profit as a child and family worker

\- 6 months in another child care facility

\- 6 months of Walmart before that

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology, but struggled to find work before this period when I had even more experience for longer periods. 

I am currently enrolled for January for a BBA Accounting program. I have never made over 30k a year, and I am hoping this is the right move in my direction for a career. 

I do have back up applications to other programs in case this accounting program falls through in Massage Therapy and I am considering game design as well. 

I suppose my questions are this as it stands: 

1) Should I keep this current temporary position even though I am struggling in the role? The role is minimum wage, but has turned out to be much more difficult than expected. I plan on talking to my manager about how to improve, but the writing may be on the wall. 

2) Is accounting a good career in terms of security and pay? As I have said previously, I have never made over 30k a year and 50k a year would seem like a gold mine to me. I also enjoy looking at financial statements, and do quite a lot of business reading in my spare time so I feel like it would be a good fit. 

3) Has anyone here had experience in massage therapy or game design? If so, I would love to hear your thoughts on the work itself as well as work/life balance. 

Sorry for the long winded post, I will put a TL;DR at the bottom. Just in recovery recently and trying to get my head back on straight navigating the career world. Any help would be appreciated. Financially I am doing okay right now. 

TL;DR: BA in Psychology, working at book store in temporary position. Struggling to learn Point of Sale system, debating on staying or waiting for school. Enrolled in Accounting for January, curious about pay as well as work life balance. Considering Massage Therapy or Game Design and wondering about pay/ work life balance as well.

18bl964,"Got arrested while working for an employer, can't find another job.","I was working as an IT Technician at a local community college while on probation for Criminal Mischief which was an accident but I left so I couldn't say much.

I was on Adderall and Caplyta, a bipolar medication, and decided to call 911 and declare them a threat to me then claim I was an IT Technician Serial Killer. After realizing what I said I hung up and turned off my phone.

The cops showed up full tactical and I was arrested for terroristic threat, a 2nd degree felony. 

While in jail the chief of police for the college showed up with his goon to collect the keys, and issued a criminal tresspass warning so I couldn't even communicate with my previous employer other than on the phone. Those that knew me stopped responding to emails and were probably advised not to have anything to do with me.

What do I tell future employers? I feel law enforcement is somewhat out to get me on a personal level because a minor 15 second phone call shouldn't equate to 6 months jail time becore a PR bond with extended probation until I'm indicted for the crime, which was a year and a half ago.

I’ve been at my current job at a large aerospace company for about 10 years in a very very niche microbiology based role., about 6 of those years being in a project manager lead role with a few million dollar budget. It is not practical to pursue this niche at another aerospace company because the number of roles just do not exist. I have a MA in science education, a MBA, and my PMP. I’m interested in going more into the tech field and given the VHCOL in my area I’m looking to get above 150k, even if that takes a year or so to get to. 

I have this role until the end of 2024, but then I may be out of a job. Any suggestions for what tech roles might work for me and what I should do over the next year to prepare for this change? I’m open to even having to learn coding or something but I have no experience there. Something in a product or project manager role sounds appealing but without the technical background I’m not sure how competitive I would be.

The only thing I’ve gained from being here is experience and I am a certified specimens collector but I can’t stand how he treats me and other people.

Not to mention we are very busy and there are only 2 people running the whole place. It’s extremely stressful. I’ve made 2 mistakes that have cost him a bit of money. Only twice. And both times he has threatened to take the money out of my paycheck. He will tell me to go do something but then call me away to do something else in the process and then make remarks about how I didn’t finish the other thing fast enough. When I was interviewed. He told me I’d have 3 day weekends. Of course I was happy about it but that doesn’t stop him from making fun of me for not getting 40 hours a week. He has no respect for me it seems which has caused me to not respect him and resent him. He will constantly talk over me so I don’t feel like I’m ever being listened to or understood.

However, I've also realised my true passion is in speaking: I've loved presentations since I was little, I've participated in multiple public speaking competitions and, frankly, I consider myself to be a good (if not excellent) orator.

Are there any career paths I'm missing in public speaking? Is there any way to combine my engineering degree with those speaking skills I desperately want to centre my work around?

Currently I’m making $25/hr (+12% 2nd shift differential) so $28/hr. But I want to get off 2nd shift. This job at Element Materials Technology on 1st shift for a UT inspector trainee position offered $20/hr but showed me the trajectory after making level 1 to be $25, level 2 $27 and level 3 $39. Also was informed my resume would potentially qualify me as a DSQR for an additional $1/hr.

I’m 27 y/o and currently live with just my dad (want to move out soon though this could hinder that), but when discussing this with my parents recently in general conversation that I was thinking to make this jump my mom in particular flipped out calling me crazy and that I’m stupid if I do that etc etc though my dad didn’t really have much to say on the matter (him and I are closer than her and I) 

So I guess I’m asking this to y’all to confirm, am I crazy if I take this offer?

I didn't hear back for nearly a month so I figured the office was not interested in me and t the director of the first office I applied to is now saying she would like to interview me but the ""inner workings"" of freeing the position are taking a while. 

I was intimidated from hearing how strict the director is, but the person in the position I applied to said they are all willing to train me and they think I would do a good job based on how I perform at my current position. That helped me feel a little more optimistic.

At the time, I figured that I am more interested in the second office and it isn't uncommon to apply for multiple positions, but I don't want to offend the first office. 

I thought I could interview with them and make my decision from there, but now I'm worried they are expecting me to take the position. Is there anything I can do? 

tl;dr: applied for an internal position, did not hear back and grew skeptical of if it was a right fit for me anyways, but the office ended up seeming really interested in me.

A grad professor told me that PMs are doers, and to be in a strategic leadership role, one must become a thinker. Roles along this new potential career path seem to involve more levels of thinking and directing, rather than purely executing and ""doing"" projects. 

Any advice, experience or insight?",z1ggy16,1,1.0,0,1701799235,2023-12-05 18:00:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18bhzfp/proj_manager_to_supply_chain/,12,2023
18bgizb,"I got kicked out of a job I loved, but that job barely exists anymore...","I was summarily booted from a company I had worked for for over 12 years. I was a graphic designer with print specialization. It sounds fancy but most days, it's splitting files, relayering client artwork, dicing and separating and making things fit tight onto sheets of materials like you're a digital cookie cutter operator.  
But here's the thing? I really loved the work itself most of the time. I got CRAZY GOOD at it. By year 6-7 I was basically mentoring everyone else in the department of 9-14 people. I got a position of ""Lead"" during the pandemic, but then the company just seized up, started refusing to give anyone raises EVER, making absurd hours demands, and when I was having a hell of a year and some mental health problems, they fired me (while also pushing back my yearly review for over 6 months, hilariously).  
But the print industry is basically dwindling. I have specialized skills and knowledge in wide format printing. And the number of job openings is effectively zero most of the time. I was never amazing at digital design, never learned videography, and I'm horribly out of practice at web design. I'm a decent photographer but don't really have a portfolio to display. And the cherry on the cake? My old company refused to give me the low-rez samples folder I'd been accumulating on my computer to showcase clients I'd actually done real creative design work for, or extensive prep work for.  
I have a mortgage, and a spouse I love I want to support. But I feel completely untethered to the work I went to college for 20 years ago now. Scholastically, I'm a weirdo that aced science and math courses as well as art courses. I tested out of college math by acing Calculus in high school. I continue to have a good head for ratios, numbers, figures, and geometry. I almost failed english and social studies courses, ironically. I'm feeling the itch to shift into a new career, but I'm not sure WHAT. I was doing enough project-management adjacent stuff at my old job that I'm trying to apply for project management and PM-adjascent jobs, but keep getting a lot of, ""You're very nice to talk to but we went with a better candidate.""

Now, I’m with Company B and I just found out that same client that led to my termination with Company A is going to be my client beginning in February. Nobody at Company B knows that I was terminated as the transition from Company A to B happened pretty quickly and it never came up in the interview process so I never mentioned it.

Do I inform a supervisor that I don’t want them in my region and leave it vague? Or is it time to start looking for an alternate place of work?

I don’t want to go too far into the details of the client dispute. But suffice it to say that if anyone at the client’s company sees my name they are going to pick up the phone and call Company B about me. I can’t avoid them as they are in my region so I will have to meet with them in February. Due to moving pieces behind the scenes, they will not know they are in my region until I visit them.

Part of me thinks it's a sign it's time to bow out, and the other part thinks that would be selfish since I did get recognized and moved upwards from what my 'official' responsibilities formerly were.

18b9ojc,Sudden career crossroads due to baby & overseas move - advice appreciated,"Hi everyone - hoping for a chance to vent my feelings about my career and to hear some feedback - it would be greatly appreciated. I'm originally from Australia (aged 39) but have been living and working in the UK for the past 17 years where I set up a small media agency doing web design and video production. It's just me and some others that I contract in for various shoots and other jobs, but over the past few years despite the opportuity to grow into a larger agency it's suited me to keep it small as my wife could travel (included going back to Australia regularly) and unfortunately we also went through years of traumatic nfertility treatment and pregnancy loss. 

During this time despite having several business ideas and intentions to try some other things to build for the future I was low on energy and suffering from PTSD - but I kept my business ticking along, earning around £100k a year.

Thankfully we've recently had a baby girl and we are feeling the draw to move back to Australia to be nearer family (in about 3 years), however I'm now realising my lack of building for the future. I would be able to get a job in my line of work however I have never worked for anyone before as I started freelancing and it would be a huge culture shock and a loss of a lot of perks I've come to enjoy (such as being able to travel back to the uk to see friends and family more freely). I'd also need to find a remote role as I'd be moving back away from the cities, so while available these are harder to find.

I could also try to build my business into something that can be run here and I have a branch in Australia, although that would be difficult in only 3 years, and it would take me a while to pick up work in Aus so it would need to be able to pay my salary there and 1 or 2 people here. 

Or I put this time into building something else that can be run remotely, such as an online platform. I have experience building these for others and have helped countless brands build ecommerce stores and tools, so I could focus on doing something for me in the hope it would be paying a salary in the next 3 years although this would be rapid growth these days. 

I am struggling to be kind to myself and to see a clear cut option but it's difficult and were hoping some kind internet strangers could help. 

Many thanks!

18b5xed,Struggling with Management Expectations in a Challenging Sales Director Role - Seeking Advice,"Hey Reddit fam,  
I recently took a leap of faith, relocating my family – wife and three kids – from Melbourne, Australia, to Malaysia for a new Sales Director role. The challenge was exhilarating, but reality hit hard. The targets were sky-high, resources were scanty, and the pressure was overwhelming.  
Initially, things seemed promising – maybe a bit too much. I secured partnerships left and right, but here’s the kicker: these celebrated wins didn’t translate into repeat business. I could foresee the pitfalls, the areas needing investment and improvement, but my pleas fell on deaf ears. Upper management seemed content with the short-term victories, ignoring the underlying issues I flagged.  
Now, fast forward, and the results are dwindling. Management wants bigger targets based on the previous year’s ""success,"" but I know it's not feasible. The stress has been building, opportunities shrinking, and the pressure is suffocating. Heading back home soon, feeling like a massive opportunity was squandered, and management remains oblivious to the root problems, fixated only on demanding results.  
Managing a family remotely under this constant stress has taken a toll. Sure, I’ve grown as a director, but it’s been a painful journey.  
Has anyone faced a similar challenge or have advice on navigating this kind of situation? Feeling pretty defeated here.

18b5tvj,Which job should I go with?,"So I currently work at an Amazon Delivery Station and I have been there for almost a month, it was a get by job for me.. something to do while getting paid until I found something I really would enjoy doing. But now I do like it, I mean it’s okay, but I don’t see myself moving up there.. from what I have heard, it’s not easy to move up there but of course I’m not sure unless I try for myself.
Anyways, I got an interview at a school that I applied to around the same time I applied to Amazon, did the interview last week and did a tour of the school. They offered me a job after the tour, I would be a full time toddler teacher (40 hrs at $15) which means a bit more money compared to a part time warehouse worker at Amazon (20 hrs at $16.50)..

Or is it?

Right now working at Amazon I don’t have to pay for aftercare for my two children, and I can’t really depend on my husband because he’s Military so a lot of times not here or off later than they’re out of school, but after care is cheap ($120/w altogether for both). Both jobs are close to home.. I just am not sure what I should look for when it comes to which job I should pick. 
My degree is a management type major with a minor in Child Psychology, have done all of the certs to be an asst teacher and the director of the school said I could be a teacher within 6 months, or a toddler coordinator because of my degree as she has said I’m overqualified to be an asst but not fully qualified to be a full teacher until after I graduate in May. Amazon has some good benefits (I love the weekly pay, at the school it would be twice a month pay), but I like that the school does holiday pay.

Is it worth changing jobs if I may have to pay for childcare now? My husband said I should go for it, but I’m still unsure, as I like the vibes more at the school but I’m used to warehouse work more.. plus I’ll be working longer hours (Amazon- 10-2pm, school- 8:15-5:15pm) 😭… help!",Commercial-End-5192,2,1.0,1,1701757822,2023-12-05 06:30:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18b5tvj/which_job_should_i_go_with/,12,2023

I'm really struggling with this schedule. Some days are fine and I only work 8-10 hours but others are so long. It's not uncommon for me to have three 18 hour days in a row.  Between this and my email buzzing all night (I have to monitor to ensure it's nothing timely) I'm going crazy. I don't sleep and barley take care of myself during my 7 days working. At least 3 of my off days are spent laying on the couch recovering.  

I know I need to move out of this role ASAP. I jave let this go on to long and the mental tole is starting to take affect on me and my family. I liked the company I work for, of course I'm having doubts now.  I'm afraid at this point that I won't make it in time for a transition to take place as they estimate 6-8 weeks typically.  I'm very afraid that I'm going to burn a bridge and walk out mid shift as I I'm reaching my breaking point.

Hi all, about me.
I worked in physical therapy for nearly 10 year years and worked my way up the ladder to area manager. After getting my MBA and the current healthcare temperature/COVID/Medicare cuts I wanted and want to stay out of healthcare. I got a position as a project manager at a Healthcare Saas company. I have been there for a year now. I have disliked it since pretty much day 1. I kept telling my to stick it out and get more experience, but I have never once felt comfortable or knowledge about what I've been doing. I for the first time have serious anxiety about work, debilitatingly so sometimes. Yes, I have been seeing a therapist and working on coping skills. I am looking to transition out of project management and have 3 years experience managing people before this position. What are some careers a young project manager could switch to?

It pays way more and is in my wheel house (or so I thought). Now here I am one full month in and I am miserable. My job duties have completely changed- drastically. I thought I was doing community advocacy and resource allocation for folks exiting the Department of Corrections. However, my position has been rerouted to sales and enrollment. I even requested a copy of my job description from HR to confirm I wasn’t going crazy. No where in there does it say lead generation. I have absolutely no experience in sales or lead generation and starting in the month of December I have a 300+ a month quota. 
I spoke to my supervisor about the bait and switch and he keeps reassuring me that I will get to do what I was hired to do soon. We just have to meet some company wide milestones first. He understands that I am frustrated but I just need to adjust my strategies and I can hit my goals. I do not think that is possible. I am not a sales person and I made that clear in my interview when asked about my weaknesses. 
If I had more information about the company I would have made a different choice. Like- everyone is related in some way to the CEO. Or, the cognitive therapy program we utilize for our clients is not accredited by any governing body.

My teammates, and I have been really struggling under leadership. We don’t really have any processes for new client on boardings, business pitches, coverage process for when one of us is sick or on vacation, etc. We also really struggle when someone is in the office working, since our boss is meant to do the designers’ work herself or brief another team member into the project on our behalf, but she never does either.

This has led to all of us working, 15+ hours of overtime on a regular basis, not being able to take vacations, and having a lot of our work completely derailed, because the work environment is a mess. We don’t have anyone to help create better processes with other departments or handle client issues that require upper management attention. 

Meanwhile, my boss keeps talking about new, big developments at her 1-person side gig. She’s single handed Lu doing sales, order fulfillment, new product development, and more. There’s no way she does all of the things we see her company do on a part time schedule. 

Because it’s a small agency, my options are to go to the HR “team.” This is one exec assistant who sometimes does HR tasks. OR I can talk directly to the owner, but i don’t know how well he’ll receive it and if it will start any drama.

18aywc2,Conflict of Interest?,"Hello. Long story I will make relatively short:  
  
I have been working with a company for 14 years. My older brother has also worked for that company for much longer. He had been the district manager for the company in a different district, so he did not directly oversee the store that I am employed at.  
  
Recently, he was transferred into the district that I am a part of. This did not seem like a big deal to me as I still report to my direct boss and not him.  
  
However, I recently told my boss I wasn't doing something that I believe is not my job and a small back and forth ensued (whether it is or isn't my job isn't the issue). He then proceeded to phone my brother about the incident and then tell the head of HR as well.  
  
Now I feel like my brother is in the middle of something that he has absolutely nothing to do with and I don't want him to put him in the middle of this argument or in a precarious situation because my boss is a feckless loser.  
  
Is this conflict of interest and is there any possibility that I could leave my employment on these grounds? There is nothing tying me down and I am probably leaving anyways, but I figured I would do some asking around about this matter in particular.

18axrkx,Got offered a better paying job,"I work in Oil and Gas. My company has begun cost containment (as have most), resulting in many positions not being backfilled and a lack of open opportunities. Due to the nature of my contract, my time is up September of 2024 (I am in a three year program that concludes 9/24).

With a bad taste in my mouth, I applied to 20 different firms in a variety of industries and got an interview with a top private equity firm in my area. After interviewing a second time, I got an offer for about $30K greater than what I receive now for a similar role, mid-senior level analyst/associate. 

As of this morning, I have been promised a job (TBD) at my company and no longer need to be worrying about departing in 9/24. 

So now, with that in mind, I want to collect an offer from the private equity firm, and attempt to negotiate with my firm.

I know that if I negotiate, my company will not be able to meet me at $30K higher. 

What should I do?

I’d really like to stay at the company I’m at now for a number of reasons, including the fact my experience expertise is Oil and Gas, and that this new job is not remotely related to Oil and Gas, and since being promised a job by management.

18axngr,Employer Posted my position on Indeed,"I've been with a company for 6 months. I don't see my self staying forever but was giving it a year until I started looking for a new job. Last week I had a couple of bad days where I had made some mistakes and thought I was going to be fired ( I am a worrier). To make myself feel like I had some control I updated my Indeed profile. 

I have job alerts still going to my email from when I got this position and the recruiting agency that hired me posted a job listing for my exact position using the same exact listing I applied for and it says urgently hiring.

We've been slow so I know there's no way they are adding someone. All I can think is they saw my activity on indeed and now are going to fire me because of (🤦‍♀️). And it turns out I was worried for nothing because I had my 6 month review on friday and I got a small raise. (they posted the listing on sunday).

 I think they are going to find some candidate options then fire me. They were normal with me today but I could tell there was some awkwardness.

18ax29s,"Starting over at 52, is this the new normal?","Hey folks,

I'll be 52 next month, and this year I've switched from a role in Management to more of a self employed role with a business I started.  Seeing as I'm still in that up and down phase of the business (five months old, some months are fine, others are soft) I've been trying to pick up a part time job or two to make sure I'm covered when / if things go pear shaped.  

I've sent out 40-50 applications for stuff way ""below"" what I normally would make simply as I just want to go to work, then go home.  I've dumbed the resume down, and I can't even get responses for 14/15$ an hour jobs.  The local Walmart won't even call me.  

I left the Management role as I was just burned out, and I no longer wish to exist to work 50-60 hours a week and have no life. I've simplified my life as much as possible, cutting out costs everywhere, to focus on clearing debt and setting myself up to succeed in the new business. 

What's kind of kicked me in the jiblies this week is I'm floored that I can't even get an email response.  Am I just spinning my wheels and this is the new normal?  

If it helps, I'm located in between some small towns (4000 people) and smaller, the ""big"" towns are 10k people and about 45 minutes away.  Even those I've sent applications into big box stores and get nothing back.  I love where I live, and my mortgage is cheaper than rent so moving is out.

18atew2,Should my friend take the job I’m offering him,"I am looking for advice on behalf of my friend, whether he should take the job I’ve presented to him or not.

I work for a state agency. I’m the biostatistician for my department and only one that does my work here. My boss is looking to expand my bandwidth and give me a coworker to offload some of my repetitive task to free up time for meetings and more development of reports. 

My friend is 31, married, one child and lives 1 hour and change away. He would have to relocate his family. He does not have a career at this time and has been looking for one a long time. He often confides in me that he just doesn’t feel he’s been given that opportunity to grow in a career. His wife is an optometrist and has been practicing for the past 3 years. 

When I mentioned this job to him I didn’t think he’d be interested especially considering uprooting his family. But he’s very excited for this opportunity and I can get his foot in the door without any experience. I’d be taking on someone without experience whether it’s him or a random applicant. 

The job:
He’d be working along side me with my guidance. It’s a pink slip so it is hourly pay without state benefits. Initially my boss said the pay would be 65k but it’s been downgraded to budget reasons to 56k. My boss can not obviously promise him the pink slip will turn into FTE, but feels confident that he could slide into one of our analyst positions that is open in a year or he can take the skills I give him and join the statistics department within our agency. Those would come with benefits and between 60-70k. I am guessing on his current pay but it’s about 55-60k now no room for growth. This job does come with a state pension should he get to the benefits offer in a years time. 

Should my friend take the chance on this job with me? This is a job he’s excited about and I feel confident that he can get to the better permanent position in a year or two time. They want to leave the area anyway and have been looking. He has wanted a career such as what I’m offering him but I know it’s less than ideal. For reference I was also a pink slip at another agency for two years before coming here myself. 

What would you do?

Let me know if more information is needed. Also this is South Carolina, 56k isn’t poverty like say California and his wife is an optometrist making around 125 or so currently.",soccerguys14,2,0.6700000166893005,4,1701721606,2023-12-04 20:26:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18atew2/should_my_friend_take_the_job_im_offering_him/,12,2023

I thought that’s what I wanted but turns out I’m just unsatisfied with my job/industry/myself etc and here we are again a year later looking for change.

The other offer wants an answer by EOB and I’m riddled with anxiety of what to tell either party 🥹 I have an additional option of taking my boss role (he is being promoted) this increase is to 90-100K but I feel terrible taking the job just for the money and leaving in 6 months.

I am 20M in the UK, I finally got an apprentice finance assistant offer for a local government council.  
In regards to what it is, however, it is mainly focused on accounts payable and accounts receivable and a bit of budget forecasting as pretty much the entire summary for the job description for the position. It's for 18 months and I am not getting a AAT qualification. Instead, I am getting a business admin level 3.  
I do have a final interview with another accounting firm in the few weeks that will provide me with the AAT/ACA later on the ACA. However, I am on 8/12 sick leaves and for some reason, I am being put on a plan which means I have to follow it for a few months and if not, disciplinary action.   
Tried to get an interview times for the final interviews in the mornings at 9:00-10:15 in which I can easily do and get back to work in time but they keep on still insisting i do it at 3;00 - 4:00 pm which i can't do due to my shift hours being from 11:00-20:00pm. Basically, I can only do the interviews in the morning on Tues-Thurs with barely no risks.  
Although, I have not signed the contract with them yet for the offer of the FA apprentice at a local government council, should i just say 'fuck it', do the sick leaves and go for the final interviews for the other accounting firms (that being MHA and GT that is) or should I just stop now?

I feel kind of stuck though as I am a recent graduate and don’t really want to get stuck in such a role at a young age; I would much rather get overworked if that would mean that I’m actually gaining something to show for the time I spent there, besides that the nature of having minimal work is not something that sits well with me.

I've been on a performance improvement plan for the past two and a half months, and my 90-day check-in is coming up soon. I am most likely going to be terminated because at each check-in I have with my manager, there is still something that needs to be worked on where I'm not meeting their requirements. So I've been looking for new roles and I posted about it on my LinkedIn. 

Today my manager brought this up in our one-on-one meeting and asked me if I was looking to resign anytime soon. I did express to her that I was not looking to resign but it was just a mere inquiry that I was making to my network regarding a specific industry that is separate from what my role is. 

I have severe anxiety over this conversation, and I'm having difficulty figuring out how to navigate what I believe will be my impending termination, and looking for a new role as soon as possible, especially since the holidays are around the corner. 

Any advice on what an effective game plan could be to navigate my feelings and my situation is much appreciated. Thank you so much for reading this and listening.",kingxanos5,1,1.0,1,1701712468,2023-12-04 17:54:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18aptec/got_caught/,12,2023
18apsl1,Being great at your job doesn't exempt you from interview preparation.,"Daniel Rizea, an engineering director at Google, highlighted in an Insider interview a common mistake among job applicants: the **""halo of knowledge""** fallacy.  
He explains that this happens when someone is a high performer at work, so they believe they'll be a strong interviewer.  
Rizea cautions that **interview skills can significantly differ from everyday job skills.** Strategies to avoid this trap include conducting mock interviews and preparing for behavioural questions.  
**Behavioral interview focuses on the past and asks questions about your actual experiences** and actions in specific situations. For instance, you might be asked, “Tell me about a time when you had to meet a tight deadline.”

  
**Try to answer these questions to yourself before your job interview:**

1. Tell me about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours. (Teamwork Question) 
2. Describe a time when you had to interact with a difficult client or customer. What was the situation, and how did you handle it? (Customer Service Question) 
3. Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it? (Adaptability Question) 
4. Give me an example of a time you managed numerous responsibilities. How did you handle that? (Time Management Question) 
5. Tell me about a time when you had to rely on written communication to get your ideas across. (Communication Question) ",kickresume,5,1.0,0,1701712411,2023-12-04 17:53:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18apsl1/being_great_at_your_job_doesnt_exempt_you_from/,12,2023

18ap8n5,Is my work withholding from giving me a fair raise?,"The company I work for conducts annual reviews in December each year. I’ve been working at my job for 1.5 years. In August of this year, two new employees (M) & (F) with the same title/rank as one another were hired simultaneously to be a part of the team I’m on. As far as skill and experience go, it goes (F), (M), then myself. 

I recently got a review. The (F) got a review. But the (M) employee didn’t. My boss explained it as: “(M) will just get one next December.”
This has raised some suspicious feelings in me as to why (M) wouldn’t get a review when I and (F) both did. Whenever I’ve negotiated for a raise, it’s always the same “budget limitations” speech every job excuses with. 

However with reference as to how we rank in skill and experience that I previously mentioned, this all seems indicative of something else. (My place of work notoriously underpays to start yet they have very talented people who work there that could easily be picked up anywhere else, so I have to assume low salary isn’t a concern of theirs… meaning the company isn’t exactly pinching pennies the way they’ve excused to me this review and the last). Could it be that (M)’s starting pay was significant enough that a review was deemed unnecessary because negotiations so soon after being hired were better left for next year?

Funnily enough we were just notified (F) was promoted to lead myself and (M) so her experience and skill set have proven to outweigh ours in the four months they’ve worked here. Yet no review for (M)

All this to say I can’t help but wonder if this means I’m being short-handed in my raise negotiations. For some more context, I was hired in August of last year with one other person who has since left and we both received reviews in December of last year. So I don’t think it has anything to do with timing as to why (M) didn’t get a review.

Any thoughts over the discrepancy about why one employee wouldn’t get a review when the other two did? Thanks in advance.",katzorp,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1701710965,2023-12-04 17:29:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ap8n5/is_my_work_withholding_from_giving_me_a_fair_raise/,12,2023

18aow68,1 hour commute each way,"Hello, 

Quick and easy question. I was wondering if it would be worth it to take a job offer where I have to drive 1+ hours each way, there and home. I was wondering if anyone has had similar situations and can provide some guidance to whether it’s worth it. Below I’m giving some more specifics to help determine if it’s worth it. 

Pay: I currently make $45,000 a year. This job would offer a minimum of $60,000 

Location: currently, I live at home with my parents. With my job, I’m paying for my fiancé, to live in another city to go to school. I could not find a job in that city that paid high enough to support me and her, so I had to stay here. This new job would allow me to live with her, but at the cost of driving 1 hour to work and 1 hour home. The job itself is in Indianapolis 

Hours: it is in-office, Monday through Friday, 8am to 4:30pm 

This is extremely tough for me, because I know I need the money. Like Badly. But I know I’ll be paying a lot in gas, I know I’ll be paying a lot in personal time (10 hours a week just driving, or more depending on traffic). Everything in my body tells me not to do it because of that alone, but I’m wondering if the sacrifice is necessary for the money. 

Any advice or guidance would be strongly appreciate",Bovoduch,1,1.0,13,1701710015,2023-12-04 17:13:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18aow68/1_hour_commute_each_way/,12,2023
18an5hy,Career advice,"Hi everyone! I find myself in a bit of a pickle at Company X. I've been with the company since 2022, gradually climbing the ranks from Marketing Executive to Senior Marketing Executive. Things were going well until a recent number of events, and I'm seeking some advice on how to navigate this challenging situation.

In the summer of 2023, I applied for a Marketing Manager role within another team at Company X. After successfully maneuvering through four interview rounds, I landed the position. I didn't inform my current manager about the application process, assuming that internal job applications didn't really warrant disclosure, I mean you wouldn't mention it to your manager if it was an external role, right? Little did I know, my current manager and the hiring manager are quite pally, and the news leaked early on, leading to some initial frustration from both ends. 

Fast forward to breaking the news of my success to my current manager, and things took a turn for the worse. They expressed disappointment, emphasising their expectation that I should have informed them earlier. A request from my current manager came in, asking me to juggle both my current role and the new one for four months, which I declined. This led to HR intervening, insisting I had no choice, and my refusal ultimately resulted in the role being revoked.

Since then, my professional reputation at Company X have suffered, and I find myself feeling isolated and uncertain about the future. Despite actively job hunting since the summer, I've faced setbacks in securing a new position, leaving me questioning my abilities and losing motivation for upcoming interviews.

So, I turn to you  all for advice and recommendations. How would you handle this situation? Have you faced similar challenges, and what steps did you take to overcome them? Thanks so much for all your help 😊

I am on mat leave and unfortunately found out that my company is not very family friendly… I won’t go into specifics but I feel the need to leave and find another job.

I have two options.

1. Work part time to make enough to cover the cost of living minus daycare. I don’t think I would be able to do what I do this way though, as I would need very flexible hours so I could only work when my husband is home to watch baby.

2. Continue in this field at another company. Do you know how to determine if a new company is family friendly from interviews alone though? What I really need is a company that will let me wfh when my baby is sick/daycare is closed and has the attitude of as long as you get your work done we don’t care if you have to do it at night/weekends to make up for it when that happens. Is that too much to ask?


I also have a separate question. I feel constantly unsure of my own abilities in this field. I think it’s because I don’t know sql, R, python etc and I’m really just an excel monkey. Well I’m more than that as I have a good working knowledge of Salesforce and a few other programs. But I feel whenever I’m asked to give insights that I’m just putting the data into a chart and making basic observations from the chart… I feel very insecure about the idea of making important decisions this way and I don’t know if this is how other people feel or if it’s just me.

There is wifi on the train, I could possibly work from the train. Should I ask them about that?

Due to my registration of classes I won’t be able to take any if I continue with the apprenticeship. I am at a crossroads as I do enjoy school and it seems like something I could maybe see myself doing, I just don’t like from what i’ve seen that some engineers don’t necessarily get the opportunity to work with their hands and instead work mostly from a computer and i like the aspect that electricians give, that plus no debt even though i’m at community i’m still going to have to pay at least 24,000. I understand that engineers due tend to make more but in my local union, electricians still make about 100k so money isn’t necessarily the issue.

18ad9v4,Is there any solution to my issue? Please Help!,"Hi, I am a 21-year-old male working as a developer at a small company. I have just taken a break of 1 year to figure out whether to pursue further studies or start a business. During this year, I tried different things; I did freelancing, which went well as I got projects. However, now, while juggling my job and freelancing simultaneously, I feel lazy. I was very excited about projects initially, but now I barely pay attention to them. Even when I make up my mind to start working on a project, I end up watching YouTube videos and struggle to concentrate on work. I have gained 14 kgs of weight since college when I used to hit the gym hard and follow a strict diet. Now, I have cravings for junk food every day and occasionally give in to it.  
  
These bad habits have made me lazy and less curious about work, affecting my image with clients. Is there any way I can overcome these bad habits and get back on track again?",kev_11_1,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1701667556,2023-12-04 05:25:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ad9v4/is_there_any_solution_to_my_issue_please_help/,12,2023

I am looking to gain a full time position in digital marketing, specifically paid social. Im hoping to lay out my experience and skills and get some advice on what to do next. From a societal, “that’s not what your degree is in” standpoint, this is a career shift.

18acjnf,Post consulting advice needed,"Tldr: I was at a consulting job where I did not build any specific expertise. I did “general projects” mostly on my own using personal instincts and google (data analysis, project management, process improvement). Now, I am not qualified for any jobs where I can take a step up. Where can I go from here? 

Hello, I have been working at a small consulting firm that works mostly with medicare services providers in the midwest. Generally, the firm “rents out” their consultant to their clients for a few months to help with projects. There is no structure in terms of how we should approach out clients, projects, problem solving or anything. Right from the beginning I was paired with clients and helped generally without any support. I thought it was great because I could learn from experience and had a lot of liberty and ownership. 

However, the projects were all over the place, no specialization. At times, it was data analysis, other times it was process improvement, and other times project management. Since I did not have any support, I generally googled around for how to lead solutions. I would google things like how to project manage, how to make process maps, how to analyze large sets of data. 

I am not seeing much growth at this firm and want to look for other opportunities. But as I am looking, a realization has hit me that I cannot point to any specific skills to get a job that would be a step up. Most jobs require specific skills. I don’t know structured problem solving as many consultants do, I don’t have PMP certifications, I don’t know SQL/Python knowledge for data analytics. 

So I can’t go to better consulting firms or get a permanent position at a company, without probably needing to take a step down from where I am in my career. 

Would anyone here have any recommendations for where I can go from here? 

Aside from this job, I previously used to work for a small restaurant chain in California as an assistant bookkeper. Alongside, I got an MBA from a local school and then moved to the midwest and got this job.",ybotherbrotherman,1,0.6000000238418579,0,1701665041,2023-12-04 04:44:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18acjnf/post_consulting_advice_needed/,12,2023

I have been feeling burnt out for the last couple years but haven’t left because I don’t know where else I could make the same amount of money without a college degree.

I have enough saved to take a year off of work and go to school. I’m tech savvy, have great people skills, and I’m very analytical. 

I have not had enough mental strength left at the end of each day to even think about what a new career could be and on my day off I’m too busy handling basic life chores and giving my partner the attention she needs.

So I’m just looking for some suggestions for a new career path for me to look into. Ideally something that I can acquire the skills, certifications and/or degrees I would need within a year. I understand that I may need to take a lower paying job and while that’s not ideal it would be worth it for my mental health.

18a9kpb,22 but feel like times running out?,"Staying switching career /rant

Hey y’all. I am 22, and graduated with a BS in Exercise Science, minor sports psych in three years. Also played college soccer, and compete in natural women’s bodybuilding competitions and running my own online personal training business. 

Since the day I graduated I’ve been working as a sports performance coach, and part time client coordinator (scheduling, insurance, etc) for the same company and physical therapy company that is in conjunction. 

I love my clients truly, but I’ve been working primarily with the non-athlete population (quite a few elderly post PT) , and I hate to be frank but it’s not what I envisioned for myself. My job has no benefits, is not recession proof, and I’ve been working 5am-9pm for 6 months for bad money. I know I have more to offer and I want to have something to work for with all the energy I can bring. 

For five months, I’ve been trying to break into Medical Device sales. I knew it was a rough road but I just need direction. I love people, I love healthcare and science, and I’m confident in myself, my interviewing skills, my medical knowledge and my ability to sell, so I’ve been pedal to the metal. 

I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on resume writers, specific job forum memberships, taken HUNDREDS of phone calls to gain insight and many people have been cold, or just saying “it’s luck.” And you know what- that’s fine! I just don’t want to give up but I need more for myself even if that means yet another career.

Without going directly into continued education in the medical sector, I’m struggling to find career paths with my degree. I was raised by two extremely hard working parents who hated their job. I know nothing good comes easy and will sacrifice a pretty salary any day for a job I love, but every career I look into needs experience even for associate level roles, relevant degree, etc. Of course they’re out there, I just can’t find them haha.

18a93f8,Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and Master's in Computer Science. Should I go back for my PhD in Electrical Engineering to complete the Mechatronic circle?,"I'll start off by relaying my current status:

* 27
* In long-term relationship
* Working bogus job making a bogus paycheck
* Unhappy
* PhD would take \~4 additional years

When I graduated late 2022 with my Master's, I was eager to apply to all of these big tech firms. I assumed one would swoop me up and I would be living with a happy paycheck, enjoying my work. Since I've graduated though, I've only been able to find construction jobs making little pay given my credentials. The last time I can remember being happy was when I was in school, working towards something. Now, I just feel hollow inside, like I'm wasting away.

  
I've been pondering on the idea lately of going back to school for a PhD in Electrical Engineering. I don't know if this is me being biased with my current scenario, making an unwise decision or if the combination of these degrees will allow me to truly step beyond the competition. Additionally, I am still not truly sure what niche I would like to fall into. Ultimately, I would love to have my own robotics firm but that seems like a bit of a pipedream.

  
Furthermore, I would like to right a lot of the wrongs I've made in school. I focused solely on my GPA and projects, neglecting other aspects that make a resume great. This time around, if I do continue with pursuing a PhD, I plan on being a part of field-related organizations and undergoing internships in-between semesters.

When I joined, I was just going along with everything since I never had an internship and had nothing to compare this type of job to. But now I recognize that i am having an extremely hard time both with the work, and with conducting myself in this type of environment.  
I find the work itself extremely unfulfilling and it has nothing to do with what I studied in college. Its also one of those work environments where people really work a lot. Like 60-80 hour weeks, sometimes more, even weekends, for months on end. I probably should be doing the same but I cannot stand to look at my laptop past 5 on fridays as Im so burnt out and discouraged from the work week.  
Now I know that work is work, youre not supposed to make your best friends there or anything, but I cannot stand the awkwardness, up-tightness, and passive-aggressiveness. Im a very easy to talk to and outgoing person, but at work and work events I am almost paralyzed by anxiety and usually remain very quiet and subconsciously avoid eye contact. I am extremely frustrated at this since no one seems to want to even attempt to break the extremely thick layer of ice that surrounds every interaction at my job. It should not be this painful to talk to other humans, no matter the setting.  
I might sound ridiculous for this post but I just feel so lost and out of place. Its a really good job, I make a lot of money and have great benefits, but I cant take it.  
I havent gone to the gym in months, and I've been staying up late on work nights because I dread my work the next day, and on top of all that I'm not performing well, which my managers know and makes me feel even worse about myself. I feel like a shell of myself 9-5, monday thru friday.

18a5b9k,Mechanical Engineer Looking to Pivot – What Am I Qualified For/What Are My Options? Pls Help,"Hey Guys, 

NYC
$80k
6yrs working in very niche position for a very niche manufacturing company.
B.S. Mechanical Engineering from UVM
Lots of service industry work before and during school. 
Sailing instruction of all levels during school.
Myers Briggs: ESFP (Extroversion | Sensing | Feeling | Perceiving)

Please help me identify high paying jobs/career tracks that you think I might be qualified or nearly qualified for, or that you think would suit me.

I need a change and I need some help choosing a direction… My career has essentially stalled where I am now: I’ve worked for the same company for 6 years while increasing my responsibilities and comp to a point where I’ve maxed out both. It started as an exciting opportunity to follow a passion of mine even if the pay wasn’t top end of the spectrum and the work culture wasn’t gong to be young and fun.

I am basically the company’s bridge between product design and manufacturing. For design and production we use mostly in house software programs, one of which is more important than the rest. I am the only power user (with a few proficient users and maybe 10 novice users) of this software – though I did not write it. What the program actually does is using an algorithm that I maintain and develop, it produces a virtual version of the ordered product based on input from the engineering team. That virtual product can then be sent to production or further analyzed using FEA and CFD.

The company itself is ~2500 global employees with around 90 of those under the “engineering” umbrella. But there is essentially hierarchical structure and what little organization does exist is virtually meaningless. This is made even worse by an event that occurs every 4 years that contracts out work to a number of my coworkers, including the head of the department. This can be frustrating but also has also shouldered me with more responsibilities and experience. 

I’ve become disillusioned with both my “passion” as a hobby and as a career path: I’m no longer working for career advancement, I’m not learning new things, I’m barely applying myself, the company culture and structure are lacking, and the pay is not what I would like it to be. 

I have a solid foundation of general Mechanical Engineering skills:
•	General engineering principles 
•	Excel (All of MS Office)
•	Python
•	FEA, CFD, CAD (all of our software is in-house, though)
•	Data analysis and manipulation
•	Problem solving
With some additional skills I’ve picked up as my role has expanded:
•	I manage a few different groups - all indirectly though (I lead the team but I’m not their boss)
             o	A pre-production team, that monitors the “virtual product” that the algorithm produces
                        	Mostly QC and providing my expertise on advanced or custom orders being sent to our manufacturing facility.
             o	Several product development teams that either seek to improve on a current product or create a new one. 
             o	An investigative team that identifies product issues and/or failures and determines the mechanism behind them.
•	Leading large in person meetings
•	I sit on the board of a yacht club


What are my options…?
Remain an ME:
•	My current position does not fit the mold of the traditional ME (no FE or PE), making a traditional job change (another ME position) more difficult.
•	I don’t think I enjoy the work
             o	It’s tedious and too detail focused
             o	My interpersonal skills don’t get used enough
•	Relative comp ceiling 

Additional Schooling:
•	Business school?
             o	Getting into worthwhile program might be hard but would make a pivot easier
             o	Expensive af

•	Certificates?
             o	Data science
             o	Finance
             o	Sales
             o	Cybersecurity

Career pivots:
•	Sales
•	Product/project management
•	Finance
•	Management (engineering or otherwise)

18a57a7,International student in b-school. Thinking of dropping out. I need advice :( (22F),"
I moved to Canada from India this Fall to start my MBA at a tier 2 b-school which offers an integrated three internship + 4 academic term.

I am a journalist it who moved into public relations and ended up with 2 years of work experience before starting my MBA.

Doing the first term is making me realise that:

A) I don’t want an MBA
B) I don’t want a graduate degree 
C) I want to continue my work in marketing & communications and have money and financial independence 

I’m legit considering dropping out. 

My grades aren’t good either, I’m barely passing because I don’t have any interest or a strong quantitative background. 

I am not learning anything, my health is fucked up, I don’t have any money, and I don’t think any of what I’m studying is going to take me to where I want my career to go.

I have secured an internship for the coming term and I’m very excited but it’s related to my previous experience and has nothing to do with my MBA education but professional background. 

Alternatives:

A:
Move back to India. Start working in marketing again. 

B:
Drop out, switch to an easier program focused on marketing & communications and work in marketing in Toronto. 

C:
Suck it up. Graduate with a low grade because I have no interest in this degree and I doubt I’ll score higher. 

I really need advice and I feel extremely confused on where I want my life to go.

I’m just 22 and have no student debt so I can think in that direction but I really feel lost and don’t think the grind is worth it and taking me to a place I want to be in life.

18a3z89,Help me negotiate a raise/ more hours,"During the pay negotiations for my transition from an intern to a part-time employee, I agreed to an offer under the terms that we revisit them at my two-month review. 

The salary range for my position is between 40-55K, with the average being 45K in my city. While I don't work full-time (only 2 days a week), my pay equates to a salary of about 42K. This company had to downsize last year and is still recovering so I was flexible because I have an amazing mentor who I learn a lot from. 

I live in a HCOL city and with the review coming up, I want to renegotiate either my pay or my hours. However, they are still recovering and we are moving into the slower season, how should I go about this? I am still in the 90-day probation period and don't want to potentially ruin my future with this company by seeming greedy/ not understanding because I like working for them.

18a30mb,Seeking advice - How long should I wait until I poke an employer after an interview,"Hi all!  
  
I've recently lived through this experience and I don't have anyone around me that has lived something similar, so hopefully I am seeking for some advise from the experts. :)  
  
\[CONTEXT\]  
I am miserable at my current job (while balancing the art of being grateful everyday, because I still have a job... wonder for how long with this results...anyway!), and thus I have been actively seeking for a new one for about 1 year now. But really, the first 6 months were a long learning period and only in the last half I started to get some traction and landing interviews.  
  
I went through a long recruiting process with a company I really liked, got shortlisted and didn't get the job. :( They even told me I got 2nd place (So close!) and that they would call me as soon as another vacancy opened up. After a few weeks they did call me, but although it was for the same role I originally applied for, it wasn't for the same domain and I didn't have any experience on it, so of course I once again didn't get the job, and once again they said they will keep monitoring my profile for future opportunities.  
  
Here's where I'd like your advise: I think I screwed up this second time because although I had no experience in that domain, the hiring manager really seemed torn about hiring me and I believe he tried to get me a position within the team. I already had a LinkedIn connection with this person and after our screening interview I texted a quick inmail, trying to justify an answer I had given poorly on call. This person didn't reply to me like they usually would, but instead I got a message from my HR saying that they were on my case and taking in my considerations and they would tell me something by Friday. Friday went by and next Wednesday I texted this person again on LinkedIn trying to get an update about if I should focus on something else and once again no reply. By Friday, 8 days later from the original agreed date I got my official second rejection.  
  
\[MY DOUBT\]  
Do you think I hurt this connection by being impatient? In really I only texted 2 extra times, one after the interview to complement on something discussed, and a second time to ask for updates. I know the corporate etiquette says that one should be patience and wait a few more days, but I had many interviews, hard, technical, time consuming ones and I am getting tired of this patience/waiting game with no ROI. I am not dealing well with this at all - any strategies to overcome this? I am really miserable at my current job, I want a new one for yesterday and I was really gutted when I discovered I got 2nd.",TheOfficialBBQueen,1,1.0,3,1701636785,2023-12-03 20:53:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18a30mb/seeking_advice_how_long_should_i_wait_until_i/,12,2023
18a2rzc,Should I stay or should I go,"Approaching a year and a half at my current job as a QA specialist in a biotech company. Here’s a brief summary with what’s happened so far.

1. Got hired as a QA analyst under manager H.

2. Manager H left a month in, and I was moved to manager L. Manager B gets hired. We are all under a VP but he is not on-site and extremely hands off. This is my whole department, 4 people total.

3. Manager L makes my life at work completely miserable, doesn’t do anything  and passes all her work to me.

4. Director J gets hired to be above me, managers B and L. 

5. A week into the job, director J pulls me into a meeting and tells me that she sees a lot of potential in me and wants to work with me to give me more complex responsibilities. A day after that I get pulled into a meeting with her and the VP where she lets me know that I’m no longer under manager L and will be reporting to her directly now.

6. My workload actually increased at this point because I was getting stuff from director J along with my original workload. She gave me a $7k bump unprompted in august.

We have reviews coming up this month. I very much want to go for a management role or at least have a promotion with a better title. We don’t have any open positions in my department because of L and B taking up the manager roles and there aren’t any positions in between them and me. B has been on leave in and out because of her health. L is still useless for the most part (either doesn’t know how to do stuff or takes too long), J complains about her to me quite a lot but for some reason she’s just not getting fired. 

How do I approach this topic with J? I don’t want to compare myself to B/L during reviews  because I feel like it’s a cop out, but the fact is I do more work than both of them and I am at a lower position. I don’t know if I’m wasting my time at this place if I stay.",aaanaab,1,1.0,0,1701636134,2023-12-03 20:42:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18a2rzc/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,12,2023

18a26vd,Am I just overwhelmed or do I really hate my new job?,"I started a new job mid-March and since then, I've been miserable. 

I am stressed and overwhelmed all the time. I constantly think about work from the moment I wake up. I've been crying at work, which never happened before. My work life balance has gotten bad too because of overhours and low energy.

It's the highest paying job and the most prestigious place I've worked at - by far. (It's a manager position at an international B2B construction company.) Staying would mean a nice paycheck each month + good benefits + bonus etc.

I like some of the colleagues, but I don't share their enthusiasm for the work and the field at all. I know this is not the most important, but I just don't connect with (or burn for) the subject matter, which doesn't help of course.

Before this, I had 2 jobs in smaller companies in a totally different field, which I enjoyed or at least didn't mind, for 3 years each. Both were more entry-level positions, where I grew into more senior roles over time. 

I don't want to quit and be exhausted in the next job too, just with less money.

How do I know if it's worth sticking it out? Is this feeling normal when starting a new job at a higher level?

Does anyone have experience in this field? Do you recommend it? Is it worth the time and investment do get the certification and work in the field?

18a051v,Promoted with decrease in pay,"Hey guys, new to this sub


Last year I was a general manager in my company and I made 105k. I got promoted to operations manager in February and I’m trending to make 98k this year. 


I already know the company will try to justify this with the perks.

1) “Working Less hours” which yes I’m not tied to a physical location for 70+ hours a week. My technical work week is now 50 hours. But I’m always working my days off by taking phone calls, responding to emails and since I’m the “tech” guy I’m always running special reports and making special spreadsheets on my day off.  So I’d say I work even more now than before

2) company car that can be used for personal use and free gas. Now this is extremely valuable, I can’t deny that. It is a huge perk

3) company phone… this doesn’t do much for me as i still have to have my personal phone. So it’s more of a burden than anything



All in all I feel that when you are getting promoted from one management level to another you should not make less than the year before. I also dont think that we should make less than the top performing GM does.


I feel if I made 105 last year, and the top performing GM is making 112k this year, then entry level for a promotion should be about 120k.

189z9y3,"Cybersecurity, Data Analyst, Project Management or other??","TLDR: What online school program and eventual remote career is going to be the quickest and best earning for a 24 y/o who is heavily numbers/computers/logistics inclined?

Sorry it’s long. 
  I’m a 24 y/o female that got 2 years into a business degree at ASU before dropping out to work full time. I have always been incredibly independent and VERY logistically/numbers driven. Almost every single job I’ve had I end up within management/leadership within a short time and have implemented or created a new system in the process. I’m a big fan of personal, unnecessary excell sheets/data and any form of organization, and get giddy about stupid small segments of software or new process that will make my life 1% more efficient. I have been told so many times by that I need to pursue a degree/career in project management as I end up doing it to some capacity everywhere I go. 
   I have a well off aunt that I have a very good relationship with, who mentioned in passing a few years ago that she would happily pay for me to go back to school. I respectfully declined as I absolutely loathe the idea of someone paying for me, and frankly I didn’t have to time to commit to school full time in the last few years, and was terrified that I would end up dropping out again. However, a lot changed recently and I’m currently in a position with a decent amount of free time, and my aunt reached out again, as well as told some of my family who is adamant that I take the opportunity. Which in complete honesty, the situation I’m in is probably the best opportunity I’ll get to go back to school, but I don’t want to be in this situation for more than 6ish months. If I did take the offer, then my plan is to pay them back as soon as possible. I’m also currently in a small town in Colorado, so online school is the only option. I’ve looked into it, and ASU offers a full 4 year online project management degree (that I already have ~1 years worth of credits), as well as multiple 24-week “bootcamps” for certifications in cyber security, data analytics and a couple other programs.
 
   The main question is, if I go back to school online, what path should I pursue, given that I’m hoping to be at least 80% remote (I have airport access, but not looking to relocate), and ideally start work as soon as possible, while making as much money to pay them back as soon as possible? Are there other programs/jobs in the same vein that I don’t know about? Or if anyone has any experience with the ASU boot camps I would love to hear about it. I’m not super worried about enjoying the job, as long as it’s remote. I’m not attached to ASU by any means, I just already have some credits so that’s where I started looking. 
	OR! If anyone can give me a free/cheap path that I can self-study while I have the time and get some certifications to get into a field quickly without having to borrow anything that would be the best.  

   Project management is something that I know I’ll be good at and will enjoy, but I’m worried about having to be in school for 2-3 more years full time as my situation won’t stay the same that long, as well as probably having to put in a few non-remote years before earning full remote work. So any insight on that helps as well.

Until recently I decided I wanted to pursue my strengths and passions, and a better pay and lifestyle. I am currently working as a marketing intern for a local John Deere dealership, it's supposed to be a year long contract, part time. In finding options for a career changes I came down to two options I really align with: Marketing Degree or Web Development Bootcamp. 

  
**- Marketing Degree Pros:** Aligns with strengths, creativity, design and passion.  
**- Cons:** 4 years or longer to graduate as a part time student. I live with parents, but need to pay bills. Average yearly tuition is $10k here. Harder to balance a morning job.   
**- Web Dev Bootcamp Pros:** I like web design, Higher Starting salary, more job opportunity, Cost less than a degree. Approximately $5k- $20k, Is shorter to complete too! Classes are online, More flexible  
**- Cons:** Competition for junior positions. May or may not need a CS Degree.   
I feel pretty torn right now, on one hand I really like marketing, but I shudder at the working and studying and not being able to work full time in 4-5 years from now at 28 or 29, and taking an entry $40k-$50k entry job.   
On the other hand, although I am not as passionate for coding, I like web design and technology overall, and would love the higher starting salary, but I am skeptical if bootcamps are a legit path to landing a job.

My supervisor is a huge fan of paper trails so she Cc'd me in the email to the location director, who approved the raise, and again in an email to the HR representative in charge of changing the rates within our payroll system. The effective date for the raise is October 15th. I only found out about it around a month ago because we're all still new and wasn't aware that I had achieved the requirements for the raise.

The issue is, this HR representative is notorious for never responding. We can't get ahold of them by phone or email most of the time. My supervisor has now sent them three emails, with me and the director cc'd in all of them.

I've been assured by my supervisor and location director that I will receive back pay, and I do trust them on that. They both do their absolute best for us.

189w75d,Looking for advice in engineering.,"What advice would you give to starting a career in Engineering?

Seeking advice

I’m currently looking into going to school for engineering and was looking at majoring in Industrial Engineering/Systems engineering with a minor in either aerospace/Electrical Engineering and I was wondering:

1) What is the work life balance, job security, and growth potential in the field of Systems Engineering?

2) What does the day to day look like?

3) Is there anything that you wish you would’ve know before you set down that path?

189w0zx,Is working retail jobs a bad idea after college?,"I have graduated college 2-3 years ago and had worked odd jobs last 2-3 years. And currently 30k debt from bachelors in speech pathology. 

Those jobs was both case management (didn’t like it much as it stressed me out) and the others were retail temp at Macys and warehouse at Whole Foods.

Question is is it stupid to work trail jobs such as Macys, bath and body works, old navy/gap, staples, Home Depot, etc just so that I can have pocket money and way to help pay my bills (esp my student loan debt) for now until I know what to do in life 

Hell even become a security guard for time being

But then retail doesn’t pay much is usually minimum wage or part time  but some are above like 17/hr 

I was considering eventually going back to school and become a counselor as that’s interesting to me. 

I know what I want to do in life I want to become an actress, model, artist, influencer/content creator but obviously that’s probably not realistic and probably won’t be enough to pay bills

189uogz,Looking to become public speaker. Thoughts?,"Okay here it goes:

I graduated with a degree in marketing and corporate communications about 12 years ago. During that time I've worked in sales, worked in retail, served as a producer for local TV programs, and a writer for a publication. Long story short - I am broke!

Over the years people have share with me that they thought I would be great at teaching, and I resisted it for a while. Finally, I made the decision to finally give it a try. While teaching has certainly had its rewards, at times it can be very debilitating. There are grueling days, and just not enough support to help some of the students truly achieve. 

While it's great to be off for 2 months in the summer, I'm looking for more of a balance that will allow me to truly live out my full potential. 

I want to do public and motivational speaking, and the best way I've seen to do it from a practical standpoint, would be to serve as a business consultant, facilitator, and corporate trainer. From there I'd be open to working with businesses, educational outlets, and individuals to achieve their long-term goals.

As with many career changes and entrepreneurial pursuits, you want to have enough money set aside to where if things don't go well you don't lose your shirt. I'm putting some money away for these things, and still trying to make sure that I have enough so that I don't have to have short starts and stops on this.

What are some realistic practical steps I can take to get me there in the next 2 years?

189tu5x,Full-stack developers becoming obsolete because of AI?,"Hi, Reddit,  
  
I'm a 31M with a background in digital marketing. Since the beginning of the year, I've been learning to build software, initially with some coding and mostly through a no-code platform called (bubble.io) to build my own startup. I'm doing this full-time.  
  
Last week, I realized that despite the advantages a no-code platform provides, your skill set becomes heavily tied to the platform's ecosystem and future. You can't monetize your skill level outside of their ecosystem if you wanted to. Which is something I'm not willing to do. Even though a lot of concepts still carry over in terms of development, transition from a no-code platform to coding is not easy. it's a hard transition. It's not like transitioning from one programming language to another like JavaScript to Python.  
  
For that reason, I decided to pivot fully into coding from scratch. The goal is to build my own full-stack projects (front end and backend). The good news is that I love coding and problem-solving. Especially with ChatGPT now becoming part of my everyday life, learning and fixing bugs have become easier than ever.  
  
However, I'm a little worried about the future. Specifically, how AI is changing software development, I'm wondering whether learning to code is still the best move for the future. While I can't predict the future, will coding still be a good backup plan if I don't succeed in the next 5-10 years with my projects?  
  
I researched this a lot and I came across two comments from notable names in the tech industry today. Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, discussed ""learning to code"" and how it might be an obsolete advice now in an interview at 1:21:19. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivdXr1PHFPo).  
  
The other comment is from Amjad Masad, founder of Replit, suggests that the average full-stack developer might become obsolete because of AI in the future, while product developers (what I'm doing now, I guess?) will remain essential because there are deeper layers involved than pure coding, like understanding market needs and productizing software. The comment is around 44:17 in this interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm-3QgVf4mw&t=2458s).  
  
Being a software newbie, I can see validity in both arguments. What's your perspective on if learning to code is still worth it with how AI is changing our world?  
  
Thanks in advance.",mgs__,14,0.7699999809265137,10,1701611262,2023-12-03 13:47:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/189tu5x/fullstack_developers_becoming_obsolete_because_of/,12,2023

To give context: I was a graphic designer, however after 3 years of working in that field I had some sort  of ""quarter life crisis"" where I realized graphic design wasn't what I wanted to do with my life. This happened December last year, and ended up losing my job. After a horribly stressful experience of being fired and a horrible breakup straight after in early 2023, I have found myself out of work for 19 months with no idea what job to get myself. 

I left Highschool with great grades (Full set of GCSE A's and B's \[I believe that equates to a Highschool diploma in the US??\]) and proceeded to self-teach myself graphic design. Because of this and the lack of work for 10 months this year, I have below-average qualifications compared to people my age PLUS a huge gap in my Resume. Now, when I try and apply for even super basic jobs - employers seem to not want to grant me an interview.

At this point I feel like I'm one second away from joining the military, however that's really the last thing I want to do as I hate the idea of being away from my family, friends and home... </3

189oyib,What would you do?,"I know it’s not the norm, but I have two job offers right now and I’m conflicted on which one to take. Both are through relationships I’ve built and I don’t want to tarnish either one. 

 I left a large company as a director because of Sr. Leadership and no upward mobility( once you are in you have a role for life unless you leave or die). I went to a smaller mom and pop shop as a Vice President,  and have been running the show successfully ever since. Due to the death of the CEO and uncertainty in the company ( wife might sell and shareholders pulling out) I reached out to my previous employer. 

The previous employer said they wanted me back and it’s been a process of creating or finding role for me and getting me back since June. I told them why I left the first time and was hopeful to become an apart of senior leadership this go around. 

My previous company restructured and I interviewed for a director role (same title as when I left) but more responsibility. I was told that the role was a bit out of my scope and out of scope for anyone at the current moment due to the responsibly and territory. Even out of scope for Sr. Leaders they were interviewing and they were putting the REQ on hold, but they wanted me for a new role they had as an Associate Director. This is more responsibility then I have now and when I left the first time. My future boss did caveat that the Director role would be open again, but she wasn’t going to guarantee or dangle a carrot that I would get it. 

We were not aligned on comp so they gave me the max salary as well as a healthy relo to get close to my required number.  It less than what I make now with potential for commissions. I accepted due to relocating back closer to family and the uncertainty of the job market and my current employer. Fast forward 3 weeks I was texting with my soon to be boss they informed me they had filled the original role and that this person and I would make a great team. I felt betrayed as they originally thur told me the role was on hold due to the size and responsibility. I felt qualified but I guess I wasn’t. I liked the guy up and he has good experience just more of it than I do. I haven’t had a chance to speak to my future boss about this. 

I’m supposed to start in three weeks with my previous employer when I get a call from a good family friend asking me to come work with them on the Senior Leadership team. He has run a successful company for 20+ years and the friends that work for them are set for life when they retire. All the friends that work there now are all building custom homes near each other . Additionally they are in super growth mode and the salary is aligned to what I’m making now. If I take it I am unsure how to balance the work life friend employee relationship. 

I am conflicted because the previous employer jumped through hoops to get me back and they are wanting me to spearhead a big project in February. However, I feel betrayed by them saying the role was on hold then highering for it. I also don’t want to burn any bridges as I got these opportunities through relationship building. 

TLDR: I am conflicted on which role to take. Do I go back to my previous employer who created this role for me but put someone else in the role I wanted, or do I go work with the family friend that can set me up for life? The last thing I want to do is burn a bridge with my relationships as that is how I got these opportunities.",Dear_Application4174,1,1.0,2,1701590955,2023-12-03 08:09:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/189oyib/what_would_you_do/,12,2023
189ogzb,"Didn’t Take Medical Leave, Then Hit with a PIP","I work for a smol accounting firm (about 30 some people). Been here for almost four years.  This firm has supported me (through my bouts of depression, unfortunate personal life events) and I have always expressed my gratitude.  I have been recognized for my hard work/efforts this past busy season, took on extra projects to help out co-workers, and even accepted their ask to take on preparation for a mondo project that definitely stretched me thin.  I have even been told by the head partner that some hard deadlines would not have been met if it weren’t for my work.  
Recently, I have been dealing with personal shit.  Finances have been tough, my significant other has been losing shifts since it’s his slow season at the restaurant he works at, I got some family shit, and I have been a sad individual.  I let it affect my work, meaning I have on three separate occasions failed to meet soft deadlines.  I could have spoken up to request more time or a reassignment, but I thought I had the capability without asking for help.  Afterwards, my career coach (who is a partner in this firm) suggested on Nov 17 I consider taking medical leave to focus on myself and feeling better.  On Nov 27 (after the 3 day work week of Thanksgiving), I decided to not take leave because I can’t currently swing taking less pay while supporting my household.  I let the coach know, and the next day, I get invited to a “performance meeting” where I am told by my career coach that I have been placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP).  It’s a 45-day probation. The points of improvement are all about my recent lack of communication about needing more time on projects and recently failing to meet deadlines.  The hour is spent with them going over the PIP paperwork while I’m just trying to keep my composure and not cry on camera.  I accept the PIP a few hours later. I feel grateful to still have a job.  The next day, the partner and I meet again to get project hand-offs to me.  During this meeting, a manager pings the partner saying he has been asking me about a project but I keep missing the promised deadline.  I remind the partner the project was reassigned 2 weeks prior, and then I ask to check my messages for this correspondence.  The last message from the manager was from over a month ago when I was initially assigned to the project, and was just a comment about how the project is easy but tedious.  There also has not been any missed deadlines. I communicate this to the partner immediately, and they said they’ll talk to the manager later.
Friday morning, I accidentally let myself spiral into a panic attack thinking the management group at my firm just want me gone.  It’s a small firm, a close group, it’s very unlikely that my PIP is a secret.  I guess i‘m just overwhelmed and even more bummed out on life.  I want to keep my job if possible, I do love it.  Maybe I should have taken the leave.  Maybe it’s time to job-hunt.

Has anyone gotten through a PIP?  Or is it a firm’s way of saying gtfo?",DepressionFarm,1,1.0,44,1701588956,2023-12-03 07:35:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/189ogzb/didnt_take_medical_leave_then_hit_with_a_pip/,12,2023
189nrrm,Turned Down from Job that Hiring Manager Approached Me About,"Hi all. I’m reaching out for some advice regarding a recent work situation. To provide some context, I work in finance at a large Fortune 500 company.

On Wednesday afternoon, I unexpectedly received a call from a senior director. He prefaced by saying he was about to catch me off guard, and then revealed that there was an opening on his team. He asked if I would be interested in the position. I immediately expressed my interest, recognizing it as a potential promotion and a unique opportunity I had previously considered. The conversation was straightforward and positive, with no mention of a formal application or interview process. The senior director concluded by advising me to “hang tight” as discussions were ongoing, but his demeanor strongly suggested that I was likely to secure the job and the transition would be happening soon.

However, on Friday morning, I had a call with my current VP. After some initial small talk, he informed me that they decided to go in a different direction, opting to hire someone outside of finance for the role. This news was completely unexpected, especially since they had initiated the conversation about the job. I was taken aback and confused, but managed to maintain professionalism and ended the call courteously.

As the weekend progressed, my frustration grew. This situation feels like a reflection of ongoing issues with leadership and communication within the department, which have been a source of irritation for me.

The role seemed like a perfect match and a significant career advancement, so my disappointment is eating away at me. I have a meeting scheduled with my VP on Tuesday, where I intend to inquire about the decision-making process. However, this experience has left me considering a departure from my department or possibly the company. I probably just need to give it some time, but part of me feels like I need to really stand up for myself after this one.

I’m curious to hear your thoughts or advice on this. Is this a typical occurrence in corporate America?

189murm,Should I apply?,"  
Hi there,  
  
I am a grad student at a well reputed univeristy in the US and im doing my MS in Data Science. I am in my first year of the program and have started hunting for a summer internship for 2024. The market is hard.Also, I come from a non tech background. My hope is to start working in the machine learning space after I graduate (i am an international student so the context is complex in regards to visa stuff). I know that everyone wants ML right now, and with my lack of background, this can get harder. My hope was to get some experience in it thru a summer internship so itll improve my prospects when I graduate to get a full time job in ML somewhere.  
  
So here's the deal, I interned in a non tech role at a place where there was a lot of ML going on. They are looking for ML research interns at the moment in the space that I am interested in. However, its a very very small company and wont pay much for sure(thankfully not a problem for me). The company is HQed in the Silicon Valley but the CEO doesnt even live in the US.  
  
My question is, given the market, and given my background, would it make more sense to apply for this internship and do you think it will increase my job prospects after I graduate? I worked there as an intern in my undergrad for over a year and have a nice relationship with them . I surely have an increased chance of being accepted. The position is remote and Im torn about how itll look on my resume if i intern at the same place twice (once in undergrad and then in postgrad). I do think i have a sweet deal here where I stand a good chance of interning in ML in this market even without a background. The catch is, if i apply now and get another offer elsewhere, im likely to take that offer and risk souring my relationship at this company.  
  
Justw anted youre thoughts based on the situation with my background and the current market.

I’ve always changed jobs due to low pay and moving and have a knack for being invited into brand new positions. 

Currently making the most ever, which is 50k. Next year I will be paid 45k because a separate project contract is ending. This is the most comfortable job I’ve had-I’ve been treated well overall-  but I’m frustrated by the ambiguity of this job, low pay, lack of any funding for projects, and the slightly toxic environment from management. Honestly these frustrations over the last year have made me start to feel burnt out and I now feel that I’m underperforming (for me) despite my best efforts. Several colleagues have recently left which has made me start to think I too should be looking for something better. 

I’ve asked for opportunities to earn more and they want to move me into a hybrid role where I am working my current job plus becoming the marketing director. I’m grateful for the promotion opportunity but am concerned about the increased workload and am nervous I won’t last long (a few people have been moved out of the role- management often doesn’t know what they want.)

I really want to do mining engineering and it pays well but you have to do dangerous jobs and sweat and be greasy. I also like overall business such as management. Other choice was that I applied to a aviation degree, not really aviation but you get your private pilot license, commercial license, and build hours while in school doing Bachelors of Arts.

That degree costs almost 200k because I would have to move and pay for all the amenities including fuel and degree cost, etc.. what do you recommend?

189fzn9,Career Help: I am sucking as a Manager,"
I’ve become complacent in my acting role as a manager

I’ve worked at my organization for almost 10 years now. Starting from entry level staff, and moving around the organization every 2-4 years, eventually into the department I’m in. 

Beginning this year, our supervisor was terminated, and we were all working the jobs of now 2-3 people - including director level duties. Since I started a little before my colleague, they put me in an acting manager role, which I accepted as it was an opportunity presented. 

I started off strong and motivated, few months passed, still no director of the department was hired. Now we are almost at a year, of course projects need to continue on top of my regular assigned duties - still working in an understaffed office. 

Over the past few weeks I’ve been mentally exhausted (and slowly checking out) from the dwindling motivation on top of my ADHD/Anxiety combo. 

I looked over my acting job description and realized I’ve completely sucked and become complacent at the role over the past few weeks, and I up to it. I want to be better, and need to mentally shift back into gear of not sucking in my job. But at the same time I’m stuck in this limbo of, little to no motivation (doing the minimum of my roles) and then the highs of get going or you’re not gonna get a permanent role and perfectionism. 

Any advice? Maybe I’m venting? I feel guilty and own up to not being the best, and don’t want management to think I suck as much as I think I do.",PhysicalCloud9716,2,0.75,6,1701559501,2023-12-02 23:25:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/189fzn9/career_help_i_am_sucking_as_a_manager/,12,2023

1899nci,Wrong to Accept First Job Offer Right Now Out of Fear?,"I (26) was recently let go of my tech job in Oct and have spent a fair bit of time applying to other tech jobs with no interviews, offers or call backs. I don't have a ton of skills to market myself with as I'm a recent December '21 graduate (with an MIS degree) and my old job didn't help me gain any transferable technical skills because of how niche it was (Technical Consultant for an HRM Company).

However, I recently interviewed and received a job offer for a procurement buyer position for a company near my hometown.

My parents think that I'd be an idiot if I said no to this job (they see this as a lucky break), given how bad the job market is right now and that 'being full time in this job would be better than being a full time teller or cashier at Target'. 

Would it be wrong to accept this offer out of fear if I don't have any other options right now?

1896hmx,Flexible Work Life/Balance VS. Making A Lot More Money,"At a crossroads. Looking for input.   


TLDR: Keep a non profit low paying job that makes my life fulfilled in all aspects except money OR sell out and become a coroporate slave and make $$$.

36, just had a kid. Been on a single income for about 4 months (mom is a therapist and doesn't have paid leave). I've had parental leave + PTO to get me to about 4 months paid. My single income are making things pretty tight. 

I was approached by a recruiter during leave and interviewed with a prospective company, the liked me and want me to come on in January. The job is for a technology specialist at a conference center at one of the largest law firms in the country. It boasts high pay and the job is pretty easy. The culture i'm not so sure of though. 

Current job is at a non profit. 

**PROS**:

* $60k salary w/ great healthcare benefits for the family
* 22 days PTO per year
* Flexible work schedule (can work from home pretty much any day i need to)
* Autonomy (the job is actually not hard for me at all)
* Great work culture (I actually like the people I work with)
* Time spent here counts towards my PSLF (Public Service Loan Forgiveness) which has 3 years left. I have about 30k in student debt. So taking that on again would suck. 
* I'm able to tour as a musician occasionally and take on other interesting side work
* Flexiblibility will allow me to spend a lot mroe time with my son  


**CONS:**

* 60k salary with not a lot of growth available (company is in a deficit and just made two senior team hires)
* I have to work other gigs to supplement a low salary (which are creatively fulfilling)
* Working nights and weekends (occasionally)  


**NEW JOB PROSPECT**

**PROS:**

* $47/hr (about 97K annually) - Contract to Hire (FTE would convert in February)
* Annual bonuses between 10-12% (merit based)
* Seems easy & chill
* lots of growth potential in a corporate setting

**CONS**

* The work sounds not very stimulating
* Working with coroporate lawyers can be brutal especially in a service department (IT/AV)
* In person 5 days a week
* Hourly 
* no autonomy/freedom and I imagine pretty rigid
* Have to take on my student loans in full.

All this is to say that I had a verbal offer from the recruiter but had a lot of questions i wanted answered before I committed. They tabled the offer stating since I can't start until January they'd like to revisit this around then when they have a second round of hiring. So nothing is for certain.   


I do value the life I've created with my non profit work and the lifestyle I've been able to cultivate. They've alluded to elevating me in the future but can't really give me a timeline.   


The flip side to this is that my wife has returned to work and is building her caseload back up, but that may take a while for her to get to full speed and earnings.   


I'm at a serious crossroads though. I'm sort of leaning towards going for the money as it can help out the family a lot and help us get ahead. I've been in a similar job before and I fucking hated it, but maybe that was because I wasn't paid very well there either.   


WOOF.

1894gw0,How to best leave the company I'm with,"TL;DR: in an industry messy with politics, do I stay with a disorganised but big company, or work with a smaller but put-together one?

So I work in the film industry in a specific department called DIT and I'm a Data Manager in this department. I'm currently working with a company (Company A) who have myself and another DIT on a film and we've worked together for over a year now. The DIT is a nice guy, but not great at his job (mostly due to bad etiquette). The company itself aren't super-well managed in my opinion. A lot of reminding grown ups to chase up requests or people not knowing what's going on half the time, plus a number of the other crew members (as lovely as they are) aren't super up-to-speed. Basically, I don't feel super confident with being a part of that team/company and while I may not be as experienced as the rest, I definitely feel like I have more motivation to reach higher goals.

There are other DIT companies where I live, and in the film industry everybody knows each other but unfortunately there are a lot of politics that come with that. I know a guy who runs a DIT company (Company B) but he does not get along with the owner of Company A over messy business practices (I'm still uncertain what's happened between them but it's clear they do not like each other). As friendly as I am with Company B, they don't get work as big as Company A does, and personally I want to work on big projects. 

I'm aware I'm not at a stage in my career where I can pick and choose what I work on, but I definitely want to make a change in my career that will project me on the right path to get me where I want to be.

Like I said, there are a lot of politics in the industry and making a jump like this would have consequnces and I'd never work with Company A again. If anyone's been in a simialr position, how did you make the right choice?",Cyanide_Revolver,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1701525991,2023-12-02 14:06:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1894gw0/how_to_best_leave_the_company_im_with/,12,2023

1894610,Marketing Analytics vs Business Analytics,"Hello,

I'm 23F, applying for a master's program in the USA. I pursued a BBA HONOURS in Marketing from India. During my undergraduate, I took a couple of analytics courses and found them interesting...I feel I'm good at analysis and working with software. I also use Excel on a day-to-day basis. On the other hand, I feel marketing field allows me to work creatively and opens options like branding or consumer behaviour or analytics or digital marketing, etc. While I think analytics would be a desk job I think.

But these are interrelated fields and I am confused how to decide. Many people said marketing analytics would be niche and business analytics would keep options open for me. Additionally, to me, business analytics feels like a very technical field to study. I may be wrong. 

I'm also primarily considering a Master's in Marketing. So, yeah there are 3 fields I'm confused about.

I want to ask the people working in these fields to acknowledge me about what is it like working in this field. What it looks like 5-10 years down the lane? And what would you advise?

1892ly7,Male/Female salary disparity,"This is crossposted to another, non medical group. I’ve also posted in here quite a few times about my situation. You all have been so helpful and supportive so I’m reaching out again. 

BACKSTORY: I’m a physician assistant making 98,400 and I recently learned that one of my male colleagues is at 118,450. We started around the same time, same years of experience. (I know my salary sucks- I work for a non profit so salaries are also public knowledge…)

Note; he negotiated to get to 115k when he was hired and has gotten a 3% annual raise to get to where he is now. His original offer was the same as mine. I accepted an offer at 95K and have gotten one performance based raise and one annual 3% raise to get me to 98,400. 

Note; my schedule is insane when compared to his. Example yesterday i had 25 patients on my schedule and he had 4. I work in our addiction medicine and primary care within the same day, every work day. He only does primary care. 

I put in my 90 day resignation and the company wanted to meet with me to see what they could do to get me to reconsider. I mentioned salary (without mentioning anything about the pay difference) and the VP (female) was quick to say we won’t be talking about that right now. Rather I was given a book titled how to be a team player. I have been incredibly anxious and not myself because my schedule is insane and I have a 9 mo old. VP said “everyone misses the old (insert my name)” and she suggested I talk to someone, like our EAP counselor. Following week we met again, I was given a copy of our benefits package that I was given 2.5 years ago when I was hired to remind me that our benefits are great. 

WHAT DO I DO? Is this fair since he negotiated for that salary? My notice is still in but I don’t want to go another 90 days like this. 

If you made it this far, thanks!",kmy823,1,0.27000001072883606,18,1701519681,2023-12-02 12:21:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1892ly7/malefemale_salary_disparity/,12,2023

1892cdu,"Asked for a raise, boss guilt tripping me and now things are akward between us","I'm working at this company for 8 months. I started working as a tester (graduated cs), knowning that if i'll do good they will be happy to transition me to a full time dev position (which is the role i wan't) - we discussed this topic in the intreviews.        

  
And indeed, after 3 months in the company i got a lot of automation taks and small dev tickets, 2 and a 1/2 months more passed and my manager told me i'm being transitioned to a full time dev position. I'm still working on the same team so a lot of things are the same, just the tickets i get are different now.    

  
When he told me about it we did not discuss pay and i thought it's weird. My salary is 48K$, which was agreed on when i was a tester (which is a role that pay much less than dev.) I know as a fact that the company offer ENTRY LEVEL developers 80-90K$.     

  
I decided to wait a bit, and they would probably talk to me about it but i saw more than 2 months passed, and my boss didn't say anthing about it. I did got a lot of good feedback.        
So last week i decided to speak with my manager and told him that i really like my new role, and appreciate the opportunity, but would really like to ask the company to adjust my salary to a entry level salary dev. The moment my boss realized that our meeting is about me asking a pay raise his face was completely bummed, and he started saying that it will be a problem and that i'm not a lot of time in the company and less than 3 months as a dev and talked a lot about how i should be grateful for this opportunity, which i agreed to but i said that still i just want to be paid according to my role as an entry level dev and not as a tester.. meeting finished without him rejecting or accepting but he said he'll think about it and will talk with people.     

  
Ever since that meeting i just feel like things got downhill between us. We don't talk a lot, i think he's avoiding me and i don't know what to do.             
Did i do anything wrong here? How should i procced?        

  
**TLDR:**  
\-started working as a tester, 48K$.     
\-5 1/2 months later moved to a entry level dev position, which pays in my company 80-90K$, but boss didn't discussed about any change in my pay.     
\-2 and a 1/2 months later i talked with my boss about it, he seemed to try and dodge the request and now things are weird between us.

I NEED to feel a sense of belonging, connected to the team, integral and required, yet, do the scrum master role well and you become less relevant, less required and not needed as the teams become more self managing. It feels like the role is career suicide and often end up feeling redundant in 6-12 months. But as an engineer, the more I work the closer I feel and more connected to the team.
Anyone else felt like this? It's like an epiphany moment for me. All this time I believe the role wasn't resonating with me at my core.

1890bh8,"Offered a role in a different department after handing in my resignation, should I stay or continue with my new company?","I recently handed in my 30 day notice for my job. I'm a Marketing guy who's 8 months in my job. It's my 2nd corporate job with 1 year experience as a Marketer in my last company. I left because of low pay, long travel times, and a horrible boss, but mostly because of my bad boss.

My current lead is forgetful, nitpicky, indecisive, delegates tasks late or with vague instructions, bad at technology, and barely has any marketing experience. She's great at writing, but she doesnt know how to use project management tools, and always wants me to direct message her every deliverable, even if we have a google doc for it, or even if the graphic designers already sent it in our marketing group chat. 

She forgets she gives instructions and gets mad at me for following them, even changes her rules when it comes to copies frequently. We barely had any social media postings for the past few months because she can't do her job properly, and can't handle deadlines. The last straw was when she told me I don't know what I'm doing, when I'm the one managing the content strategy, the job she's supposed to be responsible of because she did a horrible job at it.

I've handed my resignation and have a new job lined up now. I loved the manager in the new company, he and I bonded over our love for videogames and talked about how he used to work for videogame companies. He looked at my CV and told me we had the same CV when he was my age. They offered me better pay, better benefits, and the workplace is 45 minutes away from me, in comparison to my current workplace which is 2 hours away. What's more he told me that if in 2 years I don't get a raise or a promotion, I should look for a new opportunity, he believes everyone should be paid well.

Now, the marketing team has accepted my resignation, but the heads of the company didn't want me to leave. I'm a sucker for inspiring words, and the sales head asked me to stay but they'll offer me a job in business development or sales. He told me he believes I'm an asset to the company.

I'm one of the most outgoing guy in the company. I befriended everyone, I say good morning and good bye to everyone mainly because I want to learn how to communicate better, and I want to have more friends. Because of this, I got really good friends in my current company. The sales head is awesome, and the business development team too, and I know if I accept their offer, I'd be welcomed handsomely. The sales manager is a guy I really look up to, friendly, cool, and always jokes around with me.


Now these are the pros and cons of both offers:

Current company sales position offer:

Pros

-Good sales team and heads

-I know the company and how it operates

-Already know the people and have close friends

-Transition period would be easier

-The top sales head promised me a bigger salary

-My resume won't cut my experience in this company to just 8 months

Cons

-Bad relationship with Marketing leads

-Long travel times

-Barely sleep because of long travel times

-Barely workout because of long travel times

-0 experience in business development and sales

-I only guess this, but since I have 0 experience, I don't think the raise would be that big

-Company is a B2B tech company, and it gets tiring always trying to understand technical stuff

-Company lost internet for 3 months and only fixed it recently, I had to spend money to pay for my own internet

-Office is a bit cramped

========================

New company offer:

-Better pay (Around 30%) and I was promised bigger pay once I hit the 6 month mark if I do good

-B2C company, so it's easier to excel in Marketing

-Almost double vacation leaves, and more sick leaves

-Easier transport

-The office feels comfier

-I've got nearly 2 years of marketing experience so I know the industry better

Cons:

-I don't know anything about the company.

-They barely have any online presence yet

-They literally started operations two years ago (2021)

-The role is Performance Marketing, I have 0 experience in SEM, PPC, I'm planning to study a lot and learn it there

-The industry is Sports Gambling, and I'm not that familiar with Sports except weightlifting

-If the company is bad, I'd need to jump ship again and I only have 8 months in my last company

I'm at a loss. I don't wanna cut my experience in my current company to just 8 months, but my next company's offer is great and the boss is good too. The offer for my current company is in a different department, but the problems are still there, travel times, money, awful relationship with Marketing leads etc.

I am a 24 yo graduate from an Italian target school.
After some months of job searching and interviews, I finally received an offer both from P&G and GE and both of them in Italy.
Both offers are 6 month internship and the one from GE might lead to be admitted to the Financial Management Program while the one from P&G is in the sales function.
GE is more stable by requiring you to stay only in one city and sometimes do business travels while, due to the nature of the sales role, the one in P&G will require you to move all around Italy.
My background is corporate finance but I think I can excel both in a sales role ( I am really outgoing and I love to interact with people) and in a financial analyst role.
I am really confused since both of them are good companies, provide good career path and are good brands on the CV.
Also, after a year of long distance, my girlfriend is finally moving in with me.
The fact that my girlfriend is moving in with me influences my need to be more stable.

188vwye,New Job Opportunity,"I (23m) work as a manager at a grocery store. Long story short, after a lot of bad treatment piled up along with disrespect from other management and associates, ive desperately been looking for a way out of my store. At my work, they regularly move managment around different stored to freshen things up. Since I'm fairly new to this store, I probably wouldn't be getting swapped around for another year so I was looking for other job options.

I was talking to a friend of mines dad, who works in a COMPLETLY different workfield. Almost like a trade but it's an entry level position. I was a week from my interview there when I recieved a phonecard from my current job saying they're moving me early to another store closer to home. This store has managment in already well acquainted with and will actually teach me what I need to know for the job. 

I still went through with the interview and they said they'd love to have me. I know little to nothing about the job, as I've been in food/retail for all 8 years of my working career. I should mention that this job pays me way more than my managment job but has intense hours and completely foreign work to me.

While I'm used to the professional kiss-ass work at my current job, this place seems laid back and there's only like 8 dudes total around the place.

188uwto,Accepted job offer but want to continue applying & interviewing with other companies. How do I explain this during an interview?,"So I was let go from my firm few weeks ago and accepted the first job offer I received - it starts in January. I was not terribly excited about this offer but didn't want to end up unemployed for too long. Now, I am continuing to send out applications to other companies to see if I can get a better offer.

Due to the stigma surrounding layoffs (with employers being uncertain whether they were justified or not), I'd prefer to not mention that I was laid off, but I will have to address why I am no longer working for my last firm.

Do I say:

1) I quit my last firm and accepted another offer, but I am having second thoughts because..... [insert reasoning].

2) I was laid off which is why I am not currently employed - not mentioning that I have another offer lined up.

Employer already confirmed they will only share dates of hire during employment checks, so I don't have to worry about embellishing my background.

If I go with option 1), I thought about saying it's a 1099 gig (it's not) and that I would prefer a full-time job.

What should I do here? Any advice would be greatly appreciated - thanks!",Historical_Wheel2044,1,0.5,6,1701489031,2023-12-02 03:50:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/188uwto/accepted_job_offer_but_want_to_continue_applying/,12,2023

188upxj,"My partner has incredible difficulty working due to anxiety, trauma and being neurodivergent; what could be some good options for her?","Me (27) and my partner (28) have been together for a little over a year now. She is a wonderful person and I know I am going to marry her in the near future, but money has been incredibly tight as we've been living exclusively off of my income for about 5 months now. Every month, we spend about 5 to 10% more than we take in and we have officially reached the point where we have nothing to fall back on as a safety net besides about $20k in my 401k (which is obviously the absolute last thing I want us to do).

Her issues started around the end of 2022. She was working as a respiratory therapist, starting basically at the onset of COVID. Thinking about that for even a second, I'm sure you can imagine how traumatizing that was for her. She did it for about two years before she quit and moved back to her home town where she met me. She was living off her savings up until about May of this year, at which point I took over all of our expenses. 

She's since tried a bunch of things, but most of her attempts have been unsustainable at best or disasters at worst. She has high functioning autism, which makes a lot of customer-facing jobs difficult for her because a fully day of masking is pretty taxing on her and she's constantly worried that she's misreading social cues. Her anxiety has also clearly been a problem; she's a smart and competent woman, but whenever she's presented with a time-sensitive task and is faced with any kind of unforeseen obstacle that could delay her, she panics, gets flustered and makes tons of silly mistakes. She could definitely still very competently work as an RT, but the trauma from her previous experience combined with the low pay (IMO, insultingly low, I can't believe places have the audacity to offer like $25/hr for a literal life-or-death job) have made that a non-starter.

Her dream is to be a tattoo artist. She's been working to develop a very robust portfolio of digital art and studying techniques and different kinds of equipment. I think she could be great at it and do very well, but unfortunately she can't pursue it without an apprenticeship or some kind of established shop that's willing to rent her a chair. After looking at basically every place within a 100 mile radius of us, she's come up empty and it's incredibly frustrating. 

I know she has the ability to be great at whatever she does, but at this point she's utterly terrified of even trying anymore. She's only even willing to start trying again now after taking a break from looking for the past month because she sees how much I've been killing myself trying to provide for both of us and she feels terrible that she's not contributing financially. She's not incompetent or a mooch or lazy; she's an incredibly funny, bright and unique person who's just had difficulty finding her way in our capitalistic society that isn't particularly friendly to women or people with with mental disabilities. 

&#x200B;

In case it helps; she has a BS in communications, a AS in respiratory therapy, is competent in ASL and loves dogs and kids.

188u1w1,Just got done comparing myself to all my high school graduating class’s various routes in life,"I looked up the alumni from 2015 and did some facebooking. 

My high school had high standards and high achievers everywhere. I graduated with a 4.0! Only my parents couldn’t afford college, so I was “granted” an opportunity for community college that I so delicately squashed being 19 and stupid. 

Biometric engineers, MD sports medicine, director of operations at the state college, history professor, these were the people I grew up with. 

And here I am. 

Dropped out after I couldn’t catch up in math class, stuck in retail with high school kids and seniors, scraping by and still not over my ex. 

I feel like a child!!

Ever since I was around 15 I prepared for the life ahead of me. I took so many personality career tests, bought psychology books, took degree matching quizzes, YouTube bloggers about nursing school and “a day in the life of a physical therapist” etc. 

I gave up on that in my early twenties. I’m 26 now and the clock is ticking to do something for myself and for my life. 

How the f do I find some sort of direction?? I can’t live paycheck to paycheck in a three room apartment the rest of my life.

188tw20,Help me choose? IT specialist or electrician apprentice?,"Hello folks, please help me decide between two possible career options...

Located in US. So I'm in the final stages of getting an IT job for a public school district in kind of a remote area. The title is ""Technology Support Specialist"", essentially entry-level helpdesk, upgrades/troubleshooting, network maintenance etc, sounds like they even climb on the buildings making sure security cameras work and such.

However, I've been thinking about starting an electrical apprenticeship and have applied to a few companies in a nearby town. I think I would enjoy that route too even though I'd be exposed to the elements, getting dirty, heavy lifting. I enjoy using power tools and working with my hands, and it seems like that trade will always be in demand and could lead to really good opportunities anywhere you go. Job security may also be better in the trades? Not entirely sure there, but my previous job was a private sector tech support job, supporting the services we offered. The job security had always felt flimsy there and they eventually outsourced all jobs overseas. Definitely would want to avoid that situation again.

I just have a few concerns tho, mostly about career advancement and pay. Which would you choose for best long term career opportunity, quality of life, job satisfaction, pay, etc, and why? Would love to hear from IT professionals or electricians if you've been in a similar situation.

Here are more considerations for my situation:

\- I'm 31 years old, in good health (exercise regularly and always trying to improve mobility/flexibility)

\- My SO and I might not stay here forever. I often see on reddit that the IT industry is generally over-saturated, and I'd worry about finding a decent job in IT if we were to relocate. Also to make significantly more money I think it’d be toward like IT director, or network engineer type roles..which sound like a lot of stress, responsibility, and possibly those jobs could be highly competitive and hard to come by?

\- The IT job would be about a 5-15 minute commute to work depending on which campus I'd be going to that day. The pay probably wouldn't be that great but we're living cheap enough I could still save money. Also the job listing said it's a 12 month contract? I believe many public schools work that way where your job is renewed annually but not sure. Some folks I met currently in the role seem like they've been there a while.

\- The electrical apprenticeships would take place about 60 minutes away as there's none near me. So yeah unfortunately that would take 10 extra hours out of my week if I'm working 5 days a week. If I had to do it I mostly wouldn't mind. Also, they would be non-union, with smaller electric contractors as there's no electricians union presence nearby unfortunately.

\- I've never really been *that* passionate about any line of work, and it sucks as I'm still now figuring out what I want to do. I really just want to afford a decent life and hobbies in my free time.

\- I also have a bachelor's degree in management that I'm still paying for. Many IT jobs do ask for a degree in IT but that's probably out of the question for me financially. I've got one basic IT cert so far and would plan to collect more.

This is an offshoring company and of course they searched for someone in Latin America (me).

I have proven track record of being the first SDR at companies with successful results.

Everything went well at first and when I got my offer letter it had a lower base salary than what I asked - this salary is for someone that has less experience and doesn’t know how to figure out what a company needs, because of my financial situation I accepted.

What I had to do is request the tools needed for q successful sales  department to have, I suggested multiple domains and to warm them up first, also I crafted all email  sequences from scratch depending on the vertical and company size I was targeting. 

The CEO didn’t like my sequences and stated I lied on my resume because I told them I did all the copywriting in my previous company (it was true but he doesn’t like my wording)

He’s been pushing me around and whenever he has a chance he mentions I don’t know how to do things and hired a sales advisor to coach me this Monday.

Got a better offer with  better base pay plus OTE (3K USD vs 1.8K previously) this is because I live in a “cheap country”

Today I tried quitting and they complained that I would be leaving everything at the middle and that they have invested a lot of money on this, also that why was I searching for a job instead of fully focusing on building the sales department.

I feel like I’m expected to be the master of all these domains and I’m spread so thin. The owner (my boss) is so caught up in other things that he doesn’t really have any clue what I do on a day to day basis nor have (take) the time to check in with me or appreciate my contributions. We’re supposed to have a weekly debrief-strategy meeting between him, the president(my supervisor) and I, but he rarely ever attends. 

A lot of the outreach strategies I’m involved in are time consuming and difficult to measure the value of in dollars, as compared to the sales team, and therefore It seems like he undervalues my work. 

We used to have much more friendly relationship and even hangout on weekends and grab a beer. Over the last several months he’s become increasingly less communicative, even flat out blowing off texts for weeks at a time. I see and hear so little of him especially since our company became fully work from home. 

Our employee end of year reviews are supposed to be coming up, which since the pandemic we’ve done over video chat. Yesterday I get message from him in our company chat channel saying that his assistant is sending over a calendar invite for an in person meeting at a local coffee shop between me, him, and my supervisor. I told him “that sounds great, it feels like it’s been forever since we last talked, is this for my year end review or did you want to talk about something else?”

He replied, “ya we figured we would meet in person”.

188ozaa,Accept $24/hr counteroffer or leave for new job?,"Hello guys.

I have a pretty typical predicament of stuck between two job offers and would like some insight and advice.

So I am currently at a job that pays me $18.50.

It’s brainless and easy and it’s easily the most chill job I’ve ever had. I wouldn’t call it work. It’s the only job I can say I ever really liked. I don’t mind it at all.

I’ve been here a little over a year now and got a $1 raise from $17.50.

It’s been stable work for me but elsewhere in the clinic the turnover rates are high. We have one position where seven people quit in the span of a year and general employee satisfaction is low. 

Generally the view of management here is not good and the boss has been mean to some of the employees. Many customers are not happy with the service.

My job in particular is just very easy and sheltered. I work independently. My only real complaint is the low pay and the lack of being able to have growth despite several times asking to learn a bit more. Other people have gotten promotions and training opportunities whereas I have been passed up, likely due to me being a little too good at my job.

I’m thinking they didn’t want me to leave from my position. The customers rave about me apparently and also other people HATE my position whereas I think it’s boring as hell but fine.

Needless to say the running joke is our workplace is a sinking ship and many of my previous coworkers are leaving or have left already.

SO…here comes the new job offer.

They offered me a stern $21.50 for a different role where I’d be doing a lot more work than I am right now. It’s related to what I’m doing, it’s just a different position with more responsibility and there would be opportunities for them to sponsor classes and education for me with a 2 year work requirement afterwards.

I tried to negotiate for $23 in the new role, but they declined.

They said they do quarterly reviews and there is a ladder to grow. They will also sponsor you to get certain licenses/certifications that come with raises.

The new job is an opportunity for adding skills to my resume, higher pay, better hours (currently job is 8-5 whereas the new one is 8-4:30), seemingly better work culture (according to my ex coworker who left us for them because she was being severely bullied) among other things. Commute would be the same distance for me.

Again the job will definitely be more work than what I’m doing now but allegedly with more room for growth.

NOW, I accepted their offer of $21.50.

Truthfully I don’t feel comfortable leaving the comfort of my current job. I don’t hate them or the work, but I need more money.

So when I told them today that I would be putting in my 2 weeks, they counter-offered with $24/hr instead (a $5.50 raise from my current pay, but my position would change and  I would be cross trained for a different job which according to my current coworkers isn’t hard and is generally easy, but they’ve been yelled at a few times.

I am stuck on what to do. I eventually want to go nursing school anyways and hope to go by next year if not sooner so neither job will be permanent.

 Career wise I think job A (the $21.50 job) will give me more relevant skills.

Short term wise job B (the $24 counter offer) will allow me to save a bit more money for nursing school but with less of a skill set.

There’s also the worry that my current job might abuse me because I’ll be labeled as disloyal. They’re already talking about hiring someone to replace my position and me going elsewhere.

I’m trying to get my manger to confirm what the boss’ plans are for me.

Currently my future position with the current workplace is up in the air.

Help ya’ll. I’m losing my cozy job either way and getting paid more either way.",ChoosingMyHappiness,1,0.5,5,1701471469,2023-12-01 22:57:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/188ozaa/accept_24hr_counteroffer_or_leave_for_new_job/,12,2023

188lgtl,Marketing Major Having Trouble Landing an Internship,"Hello all,  
  
I am currently a junior majoring in Marketing. I have a 3.5 GPA while balancing work and life commitments. I am also an active member of the marketing club at my school. Despite spending a lot of time applying to numerous internships, I haven't been able to land any. I received assistance from the Business Career Center on my campus to review my resume, but I'm not sure if that's the root of my problem. I have broadened my horizons and applied for internships outside of Marketing such as HR, Supply, and Management with no luck. It has been extremely disheartening to see my friends with lower GPAs get internships and interviews offered to them, and then my friend who also has a good GPA plus a year of sales experience getting denied just like me. This situation has given me anxiety about my future, and I'm determined not to be stuck in a restaurant job after graduation.  
  
I'm wondering what criteria employers are looking for that I'm not meeting. I have worked very hard to achieve my current GPA, and I'm working towards improving it even more. To get a second opinion and possibly improve my chances, any tips or guidance would be greatly appreciated. I have linked my resume and cover letter template below.

188lcfz,Co-Worker treats me as if I'm fresh out of school. I have 20 years of experience.,"I (45 F) work for a large IT firm as a product specialist. I am a SME in my area and frequently speak publically at events in addition to building customized demos as part of the sales process. Additionally, I'm certified several times over, I have several years of implementation experience, 10 years of platform experience and 20 years total in IT change management. All that said, I know my stuff.

I have a colleague (50s M) whose title is Enterprise Architect. While I don't have that title, I frequently have enterprise level discussions with CIO/EA level stakeholders and can hold my own just fine. My issue is that every time I ask this colleague for his thoughts on a specific subject because we share customers (f.ex. Positioning a certain solution) he inevitably responds with a long diatribe giving basic advice on how to do my role as if I dont already know how to do that. It's also not what I asked his opinion on. 

Today, I specifically asked about how the customer might respond to us positioning a series of relevant solutions for a particular use case knowing they would have to buy additional licenses. His answer was to spend 5 minutes telling me generically about how best to structure a presentation, how much time to spend on different high level subjects, and what my overall goal should be. I asked again about how the customer might respond to positioning products given their situation and he then asked if I had any plans to talk about exciting customer examples. At that point I gave up. 

I know I should just not ask this guy for advice but I also have to work with him a lot and this is how every conversation goes.

188kvul,Software Engineer in Fintech vs Risk Consultancy,"I currently work for a Fintech startup as a backend engineer and it’s been great in terms of the experience I’m gaining. The pay is decent and I work with some really talented seniors.

I’ve been offered a role in a Risk and Financial consultancy where they don’t really have a dedicated software development team but they have a decent tech stack built by one of the Principal Consultants who does have some decent understanding of Python and software engineering. I’ll be joining to build a lot of the software, setup DevOps practices, scaling in the cloud, etc. as there are other Risk Modelers that push code. The pay is significantly higher with bonus as well. This seems to be an exciting opportunity as well but I’ll be the only guy with a proper software engineering background. So, I’ll be largely responsible for building out the tech for their Financial modeling SaaS software.

Do I stick with the Fintech that has risk of going under in the next 4-5 months if we don’t hit our revenue targets. Or do I move to the consultancy where I probably won’t be working with a tech stack or on products like the Fintech.

I’ve always wanted to try consultancy but I’m worried that I won’t like the culture and the way tech is viewed there.

Should I be proactive?,"I recently left a very stable job in the energy sector to take a new job working on a major infrastructure project. At my new job, I’m working for a major engineering company. The engineering company is contracting me out to the state agency that is building the infrastructure. On the face, the new job is better but one of my main concerns has been that the new project that I’m working on has had a lot of bad publicity and has been way over budget and way past schedule. Today, in a meeting someone openly discussed whether my job responsibilities would be handled by another contracting group. I don’t think he understood that me and my group were on the call, and this creates obvious fear for our group that our jobs will be eliminated. I just started this job one month ago and it has been very slow to start. Just yesterday, my manager assured me that senior leadership is aware of how slow it is for us but we will surely have a lot to do soon. Based on the comments of this person I now fear that my job that I just started is in jeopardy and frankly, I’m pissed!! I left my job for this new job and the blatant irresponsibility of this is unbelievable to me. What should I do? Address the issues with my manager?

Some background about me for context. My degree is in history, i have been in marketing for 5 years, and I live in Utah.

I was laid off from my job at the beginning of July and since then I have struggled to find a new job. I applied for over 250 jobs and only receive 8 job interviews.

1. Stay the course, keep applying for marketing jobs until something sticks
2. Lean on my contract work and get a masters degree (ms in marketing or mba)
3. Make a career shift into project management (a side interest)
4. Move out of state for better opportunities (I have family in NY and LA that could help me settle into a new location)

188i417,Stuck in a Desk Support Role Despite Skills and Certifications,"Hello fellow Redditors,

I find myself in a bit of a professional pickle and could use some advice. I started as a level 2 desktop support technician with no degree, just an A+ certification, and put in significant effort, earning a 10% raise after 8 months (66k). However, there's a twist – I was told it was the ""highest raise,"" but I suspect otherwise as my colleagues were told the same.

I've been handling additional duties from the start, functioning in an escalation role on top of my regular support responsibilities. Despite doing well, my efforts to secure a promotion have been met with forgetfulness and vague promises from my boss.

Recently completing my Bachelor's and earning a CCNA, I requested a promotion again. After a meeting with my boss's boss, where the need for promotion was acknowledged, I found myself ghosted once more. When I pressed my boss, he offered more responsibilities with a vague promise of a potential promotion.

Feeling frustrated, I'm at a crossroads. Other managers have expressed interest in me, with one directly inviting me to join their team. I'm essentially operating as a team lead and have the credentials for a different position.

What should I do in this situation? Should I explore opportunities with other interested managers, and if yes how should I go about it or should explore other opportunities if this becomes all political?

Any advice or shared experiences would be immensely helpful. Thanks in advance!",Revolios,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1701453486,2023-12-01 17:58:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/188i417/stuck_in_a_desk_support_role_despite_skills_and/,12,2023

188ew2z,Do I join a US based startup as a founding member or go for a US based salary?,"
Need career/life advice. Please bear with me for the long post.

Hello everyone,

I need some career and maybe some life advice from the wise people here. So a bit of a background first (bear with me it's a bit long): I'm a 24yr old turning 25 in 6 months. I live in a developing country and did my bachelors in Computer Science from the top university here and graduated in 2022. Since then I've worked multiple jobs. Was in an ecommerce startup as an ML Intern during my degree and joined it as a full time Engineer after graduation. The startup did not work out. Then I worked as a Research Assistant in a project, finished that and currently on a different project that more aligns with my interests.

So there's a guy, let's say Mr. Q. He was my senior year project supervisor and also my boss in the last startup and even now the second project I'm working on is under his supervision. I enjoy working with him and our research interests align. Last year I got into Imperial College London Masters program but couldn't go due to not being able to secure funding. This year I applied again to Ph.D and Masters programs based on the research I did with him. Now he has started a new startup and this startup is in his field (the last startup was a totally different applied AI product) but this one is right up his alley and he has offered me a position along with stocks (he's based in the US and so is the startup).

So the dilemma I have is this: The pay in the start-up isn't good but I have alot of stock options. On the other hand I can grab a USD based salary and live more than a comfortable life here. But since I am hoping on getting an admission with funding this time, I feel like that might not amount to much (till Sept) whereas this startup pays very less but aligns with my interests as well. Now I'm confused because earlier this year, something very life changing (not in a good way) happened to me due to which I now find my inner self chasing money. Now what should I do? I want to trust Mr. Q but due to some ups and downs so far and due to the opinions of people around me, I find myself a bit cautious but on the other hand, I have spent alot of time with him and do enjoy working with him. 

I want to know if at this stage of my life, should I take this risk or should I not? Because I am afraid that I find myself at 28,29 and startup doesn't work out and I am without any savings or bank balance (I lost all my savings this year) but if it works out, it's a jackpot. A part of me feels I have alot of potential that I can utilize to make money but so far maybe because of Mr. Q my potential is being wasted or maybe this is not true.

188eo5g,Business Management vs Marketing Degree?,"Hello all,  
  
After almost three years of being a full time parent, I am planning to finish my bachelors at WGU next year and am torn between two degrees: Business Management and Marketing. I have taken credits outside of the university from places like Study.com that will transfer to both majors but I am at the point where I must pick a path. Fortunately, I am the primary care giver to our children and able to do school full time and finish within a year

I am also looking at possibly becoming an analyst long term. That being said, which would be the best option for me?

188d9qw,Will quitting be beneficial for me?,"Hello guys
Hope y’all are doing great

I’m at a place in my job where i feel I’m not learning anything new and it has been like this for the past year i would say so to a point where if you’ve interviewed me a year ago and today you wouldn’t feel much difference in terms of achievements or knowledge which kinda sucks because the work I’m doing got super repetitive 

For a little bit of context
I would say that I’m very well compensated in terms of salary and overall package, management love me and trust my judgment and quality of work to an extreme level but I’m just not motivated anymore to keep doing what I’m doing over and over for the same audience or people using the same framework or ways of doing things

finding another job within the same company is not an option because for the current time being i like the field i’m working in, its just that I’ve reached a level where the people I’m working with have the same knowledge cap I’ve reached so there is literally nothing new that can be learned

From my point of view i feel that taking a step forward and landing a job in a another company would help me a lot to learn more and get different perspectives and approaches and experiences that will enable me to conclude my time in this field and perhaps seek another one in the near future (2 years or so ) 

But at the same time, being very well compensated with superiors trust and confidence in you and your work is a very valuable thing someone should consider before moving out which is what is holding me back currently

What do you think about this? And what would you do?",Wale_0,1,1.0,3,1701441092,2023-12-01 14:31:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/188d9qw/will_quitting_be_beneficial_for_me/,12,2023

Even though he said it was 1890 in the message he sent me.

I am not sure if i should accept the job because i got another interview for tomorrow for a job that will start in February and for which i will receive 2050.

188bcor,How can I be less intimidated by senior leadership?,"I started a new job as a business analyst a month ago. 

My manager (director-level) suddenly stepped out for a leave and we don't know when she is coming back. 

As a result, now I am reporting straight into a VP. 

This week I had to pick up a very major and time-sensitive responsibility that she dropped last minute which I am fine with, but still a lot of learning to do. I ended up reprioritizing my week and staying late with another director to get the work done. 

Yesterday I had a sitdown with the VP to discuss the situation. I was so anxious and tired when I showed up to the meeting. He asked me how I was doing and I said ""Okay"" and I must have sounded like a scared child. I had a list of questions and we sat down and went through everything. He is a nice guy. I don't know why I get so intimidated reporting directly to him?

Now anytime I am going to take sick leave or PTO I have to run it through him which is fine but I am feeling like a total imposter and like I am way too junior to be reporting into a VP of a $5b+ publicly traded company. Most likely his assistant would handle my PTO and other requests but I feel like I'm not important enough to be asking him for anything (even though he has made it clear that I should feel comfortable going to him for things).

So I (21m) have worked as a legal assistant since the start of this year at a small solo firm. I recently got offered a new position at a significantly larger firm full time. Since I’m graduating in about two weeks, I really needed a full time job to save  and the attorney I currently work for was only looking for part time. I start this new job next week and it comes with a significant raise from my past position.

Problem is: I was just accepted into my top choice law school and I committed. I sort of panicked when they asked me in my interviews if I had any immediate plans to go to law school and told them no. It seems like they really want something long term but this means I’ll only be staying until July at the latest. What could happen if they find out?

-First the company name differs from the initial information I got before the interview.
-Also the initial company I applied for essentially runs a mediation service for internships and will help me with visa, sim-card, bank-account, finding housing etc. for a fee.

1883pfl,Nurse Practitioner or Computer Science (AI/ML)?,"I’m an RN finishing my BSN and considering grad school options. I got my ass kicked in Med/Surg and I’m currently working a pretty chill Endo gig. Considering mental health NP, but i’m not feeling much passion for nursing at the moment, tbh I never super did and med/Surg sucked the last bit out of me. It’s kind of just a job and I’m nervous to get into another situation where I feel massively overworked and underpaid. 

I like technology and have always been kind of a tinkerer in my spare time. I’ve torn down and rebuilt my computer more times than I can count and I’m getting into the software and networking side of things the last couple years.  I know a little about a lot of things and I enjoy learning about technology. I wouldn’t say it’s equivalent to a degree in CS by any stretch. Truthfully i am on the AI hype train right now, I’ve probably learned and used it more this semester than I have actually learned about medicine. The busy work in the BSN program is UNREAL and it’s been a huge boon in keeping me sane. 

NP seems like the safest option and just feels like the logical conclusion of my career. It doesn’t feel special or interesting. I can’t support a family let alone my hobbies on RN wages so I feel pressured to do NP, I would just want to find a job that pays enough and doesn’t work me to death. Mental heath seems to have the best outlook and I enjoyed my psych clinicals so that would likely be my route. CRNA is off the table because I don’t want to put myself through the hell of that schooling and don’t want to go do critical care for 2 years before applying. 

I know there are tech paths in healthcare. I am very interested in AI/machine learning and feel like that is going to explode into healthcare even more than it already has pretty soon. I know it would be a pretty huge shift and I would have to hone a whole new set of skills. I don’t even know what that path would look like for me. I have no frame of reference for how to pursue such a career path or what the outlook of that career would be pay wise.

Now after that long explanation. NP or AI/ML (probably healthcare related)? I’m most interested in job satisfaction, workload, and salary.

 I’d love to hear people’s perspectives of each career especially if you are working these fields. Also insights into how to chart a path in the CS side with a BSN and little CS experience. Also I want a real look at what these jobs are paying, people talk big about both and the online averages are rarely the reality.

1881s4c,How to ask my boss about how much I’ll be making after a promotion?,"My boss shared that they put in a request to extend our team’s budget so they could promote me in the spring. It’s a weird system, but managers at our company need to request promotions in October for them to be reviewed and approved by the upcoming fiscal year. 

I like my work, I’m excited to stay at the company, and I’m excited my boss recognizes my potential and values my contributions… but they didn’t mention how the potential promotion will impact compensation. 

I know I’ll get a raise, but I’m not sure how much. 

How do I address this with my boss? Can I just ask what they have in mind?

Spring is a ways a way, and though I like my job, I’m gonna need to start looking for an alternative if my promotion doesn’t come with the level of raise I’m looking for. 

Some background, I’ve been with the company in this role for about 18 months. It’ll be closer to two years at the time of the promotion. I have a stellar track record, good relationships, and I know they value me.

18813iy,Boss went off on me after preaching keeping emotions in check,"This is an incredibly long story so I'm going to consolidate the best I can. I work for pretty low key job that should not be high stress despite it being VERY busy with a small staff. My boss has had talks with me before when I was going through an incredibly emotional time about keeping my personal issues at home and I proceeded to fix it. 

Today I was reprimanded in the most incredibly unprofessional way for leaving early less than a handful of times, no more than 20 minutes before I should have technically left. Granted, I AM A SALARIED employee. I more than make up my time by taking shorter lunches, showing up a little bit earlier the next day, etc. 

The reason that I was reprimanded and that my boss even knew about this is because a fellow coworker took it upon herself to rat on me for it. I'm so curious as to what this employee decided they could benefit from doing this aside from being a teacher's pet. 

Things are now incredibly weird at work and I am more than considering leaving.

187zynm,Should I start looking for other jobs after this?,"Yesterday my manager had a 1:1 meeting with me and it went fine for the first half. I just updated her on some projects I was working on and no issues. 

Then she tells me that she noticed my technical writing skills aren't as good for my role as they should be based on a report of mine that she saw. I explained to her that this is actually an older version of the report I had been working on and I sent her the ""final"" version which was much better. She replied that it isn't just this, all my reports have been lacking in some ways. 

My role is much more than just technical writing but this is the one thing she seems to have zeroed in on. She made me sign a form that said my skills in this area are lacking for my role, it's an ""issue"", and we will work together to improve by going to workshops etc by next year sometime. At the end she told me ""this is not a disciplinary action, but we need to get you to grow more into your role."" I assume the signed form went to HR (?). 

Anyway I don't know if this is a formal ""performance improvement plan"" but it sure sounded like one. 

My technical writing skills aren't the greatest but considering I have 10 scientific publications I don't think they're the worst either so I'm a little shocked by this. 

My question is this: should I start applying for new jobs?

i (22M) recently graduated college and started a job in late september. it’s a local government job, and is my first “real” job (full time). its in elections and voting stuff, which i really am passionate about. 

when i interviewed, one of the Big Bosses asked me what my intentions were (i.e. how long do i plan on staying around). i told them the truth; i don’t plan on going where for a near future. they said “that’s good! because we aren’t looking for someone who only plans to be here 6 months.” i replied that i eventually wanted to go to grad school, but did not plan on actively looking to go for at least the next year. i was hired, and here i am. 

it’s not a bad job, i want to say that. the people i work with are nice enough. the benefits are good. pay could be better but it more than covers what i need. but i. am. so. fucking. bored. it’s just paperwork all day long. putting it in the computer system. some days, i literally don’t even have that to do. i’m bored and ultimately unfulfilled. 

i know that some of you are going to say “oh that’s life” or “you should’ve known.” i also want to be clear: this was never going to be long term. i thought maybe i’d have this job for 2 years, MAX. but…i am at the very beginning of my 3rd month. i’m not miserable but if things don’t improve…i can see myself heading into that direction. 

my goal for this job was to kind of just save up some money and get some experience. i guess i am doing that, but it’s just not as great as i thought it would be.

187yoq8,Negotiate Entry Level Salary?,"Hi All,  
I have been lurking in this sub and have seen incredibly mixed reviews regarding negotiating salary at the entry level. I ask, though, because the position that I want to take pays a good bit less than another offer I received. Note, I am quite qualified for both positions based on my internship experience and their relevance toward the roles.  
Here are the salaries:  
\-A: 70k at a big brand financial services firm  
This\^ is the firm I want to work for--mainly because of the opportunity for professional growth, clear career path toward what I ultimately want to do, and location.  
\-B: \~100k at a major wholesaling firm (this is the level of pay I am expected to receive after licensing, so a few months after I theoretically accept the offer. Note--> this is a combination of base and expected commission)  
I recognize that I just graduated from college, and I am very grateful to be in this position but am wondering if it would be possible for me to negotiate the 70k position to be more in the range of 75-80k (which is the upper end of the range I have seen online).  
Please give me your thoughts because the last thing I want to do is burn a bridge with a company that I ultimately would like to work for.

187ygo1,“You should ‘close’ them in an interview” is silly advice,"I originally posted this in r/breakintotechsales but figured I'd post it here as well given that a lot of folks are trying to either break into tech, or figure out how to land a better job than they have today. Either way, this post is for you and it works in both situations.

Common advice for job interviews, especially sales ones…

*“You should close them on the interview!”*

**Meaning:**

1. Express your interest
2. Ask them if they have any hesitation moving you forward

You asking them if they have any hesitations moving forward is what's supposed to be the “close”. Because if you ask them this question, the idea is that they'll like your audacity and pass you onto the next stage for being a “closer”.

**Here’s the thing though: It doesn't matter.**

First of all, I've found that this question is a waste of space. If they like you and you possess exactly what they're looking for in a candidate, closing them doesn't matter. They're going to move you forward ANYWAY! And if they DONT like you, closing them isn't going to matter either. They were going to reject you anyway!

**But here's the kicker: most people are not going to tell you to your face that they don't like you and that they aren't going to move forward with your candidacy**. Furthermore, for highly competitive interviews, there is usually a hiring committee anyway. Nobody makes the decision alone. And so, they have to regroup anyway and discuss all the candidates based on whatever decision criteria they've made up internally.

So the question becomes pointless. It's a waste of space. You are going to be accepted or denied either way, the “closing” question makes no impact whatsoever.

**Instead, I'd focus on the following:**

1. Ask a question that'll help you further vet the opportunity or the Sales Manager. Your questions should be to help YOU make YOUR decision about whether or not this company and opportunity excite you. (Interview Masterclass goes over what vetting questions to ask to ensure you're joining a top-notch organization).

​Yes, that's it, lol.

You usually only have time to ask 1-3 questions, so you want to ask the questions that are most important. The questions that are the most important are the ones that give YOU clarity about the opportunity. So make the questions count, and don't waste precious time asking pointless questions that aren't going to move the interview forward.

That said, I do believe it's important to show your intent and interest if you are genuinely excited about the opportunity and want to continue exploring it. At the end of the interview, I'd say something like,

*“NAME, thanks for the time today. This opportunity excites me. What you said about XYZ is particularly interesting because of ABC. What are the next steps, and when should I expect to hear back?”*

Then let them go make their decision and send a nice follow-up email if you feel like it (even this is pointless because, again… If they like you, they like you. If they don't, the follow-up email wasn't going to win them over).",UnsuitableTrademark,1,1.0,1,1701391882,2023-12-01 00:51:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/187ygo1/you_should_close_them_in_an_interview_is_silly/,12,2023
187y8lw,If I use my employer sponsored college tuition is it MORE LIKELY that I will be promoted?,"I'm using my employers tuition reimbursement to finish my degree.

187y42y,Current Role,"Hey guys, might be along post please bare with me. I work in consulting and I have been at this company for almost two years now. In those two years I was on three projects, one where I was poorly managed, another where excelled and performed very well, and my current role where I am not doing so well. When I joined this team I started working directly with a lead who I would report to on a daily basis, however fast forward 5 months the lead left the team and I was on my own. When the lead left I was pushed into their position with little to no guidance. for the last month or so I have been working as ""lead"" and I have been doing very  poorly. Yesterday I get a very long email from one of the managers saying that I am failing to see the bigger picture of larger initiatives, I am not writing user stories correctly, I am failing to come up with valid acceptance criteria. To my managers defence there are a lot of initiatives that we are working on that have many moving parts. We had working sessions where I was asked to add something to a ticket and still added the wrong thing, am I the brightest? no! but did I feel like crap when I read the email? yes. I have asked questions in the past and never got a direct answer as these are ""things"" that I should be thinking about. and the list goes on and on.   


I feel very stuck, as I don't think I have what it takes to continue further on this team, yet I don't think leaving is an option as my role requires a  security clearance that I am being investigated for. Also keep in mind that my performance was stellar when I worked with the lead. We had a great working relationship and I felt like I can ask her questions and get a direct answer within minutes, that's not the case anymore. So I don't know what to do moving forward. I have been wanting a job with a competitor of ours since they do similar work yet the culture is more focused around assisting one another rather than leaving people on their own. if anyone has any advice or was in a similar position, how did you handle not being good at your job? and any recommendations on how to go on about connecting with recruiters from other companies?

187y3xd,"Feel lost with career path, looking at options","I’m a 26 year old feeling very lost with finding a career path that I am comfortable and confident in as I worry about the inevitable future and wasting my time. I’ve already felt like I’ve wasted my time in the past switching around different courses, some I passed (theatre and film design and production, graphic design) and some I failed (degree in media, degree in design technology, IT course). 

I’ve worked in some theatre and film work assisting with prop and set construction and painting but I’m tired of the inconsistency and money stress involved, especially with Covid in the past. Which is why I recently completed a graphic design course as it’s still creative but more job security. Unfortunately though it is very competitive and tough to break into, I’ve gone through almost a year of applying and no job in the industry yet, I’ve only worked at a printing job which was not inspiring. I’m learning a lot of real design work is not like the fun, creative college projects. I’m also not sure if I can stand sitting and being in front of a computer every day, I miss the prop making using hand and power tools but real living can’t offer that as regular work of course. 

I’ve been jealous of my partner as he’s an electrician, does challenging work and gets real great pay and can work anywhere with his certificates. And he does his creative music passions on the side. It’s made me wonder if I should of gone his path and do an apprenticeship to, in the future, get a well paying trade where I can be hands on and not stress about money and do my own creative projects as hobbies. I wanted to do carpentry years ago but unfortunately I’m allergic to pinewood so that’s not an option. 

I’m currently working at a signage shop making signs and assisting installations. Good people, stress free work, nice hours, hands on but it does get boring, not that challenging, some heavy lifting and feel like I wasted my graphic design skills as they already have enough designers working there. The pay is low also, I know I would be getting better pay if I did electrical or mechanical fitting or if I stuck to graphic design through years of hard long hours, practicing and updating program skills and deadlines to go from meh to better jobs. Work from home sounds very nice too. Also so so so much plastics and wastage which I get saddened by as I am passionate about nature and the environment but I like doing some of the workshop jobs, not being at a desk the whole time.

I know all jobs don’t perfectly fit with one’s expectations and values and grass can be greener, but I would appreciate suggestions based on my situation. 

Not sure to try continue getting a basic graphic design job or try work my way up in signage or start an apprenticeship in higher paying industry that align with most of my values? 

My values:

- job security
- financial stability
- creativity is my strength but maybe should be for side projects
- being fit and healthy, I like physical work but concerned about when I get older 
- I love and care for nature and the environment
- afford to travel more
- like to be busy and challenged but I get anxious too
- problem solving
- introverted and like autonomy 
- I’m good with using construction tools and adobe programs",marshmellow_22,3,1.0,3,1701390928,2023-12-01 00:35:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/187y3xd/feel_lost_with_career_path_looking_at_options/,12,2023
187xmdd,"I have an opportunity to provide feedback on a candidate for a director position on my team who I would report to. My 2 most recent experiences with managers were nightmares, and I'm terrified of someone new coming on, even though it's a ""me"" issue. How do I navigate this? Any advice?","At my job there is an open rec for my team's director. With the current gap I'm reporting to a Sr. Director (""Michael""), who this new director would end up reporting to, and I would report to the new director. ""Michael"" has been in the final stages of a candidate that he's excited about, and he's mentioned multiple times to me that my opinion on these candidates is very valuable because I do my job well and have a good read on others' skillset. He sent the presentation this candidate worked on to me and wants to hear my opinion and address any concerns, because it's important to him that I have the excitement and trust working with this person.  
Well, I am PANICKED about this. For a back story, at my last job I was at for 3 years, I had a fantastic manager. But the company was acquired and he left and they hired this new manager who was an absolute nightmare. I'm pretty sure he lied on his resume, because he frequently made errors way below his level. He was a huge jerk too. But he took over my and my other coworkers' jobs and cut us off from everyone at the company. I ended up getting laid off in May, and I think he had something to do with that.

  
At my current job (about 6 months in), I was hired to report to a director (""George""), who ended up being terrible and incompetent. He screwed over my teammate and fired him, then tried to throw me under the bus a few times. Luckily the CMO (""Buster"") saw what was happening and got more involved in our team. ""George"" was either pushed out or quit a few months ago. I got rolled under ""Michael"" with ""George's"" departure, and it's been a godsend. He's been one of the best managers I've ever had, and I can actually do my job. He (1) knows our company's product well so he can direct me on strategic stuff (2) knows how to read metrics and understands what I work on (3) actually listens to me and advocates for his team.

  
What I ultimately want in a manager after the past few years is a manager who 

* Actually listens to what I say and validates me
* Won't throw me under the bus 
* Has the confidence to make decisions when I come to him with a question or need guidance and isn't threaten when corrected
* Can communicate clearly and specifically
* Isn't won over by buzzwords and can see through bullshit

  
I know this is a ""me"" issue, and I'm using past experiences when the current situation has none of the same factors. Plus since ""Michael"" and ""Buster"" like this candidate, I'm not going to be like, ""no"" lol. I also want to mention that ""Michael"" and ""Buster"" did not hire or promote ""George"", and I don't know their feelings towards him. 

  
Is there a way I can approach my concerns to ""Michael"" or his impression of the candidate on my above list?",MuffyCrosswire5,1,1.0,3,1701389621,2023-12-01 00:13:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/187xmdd/i_have_an_opportunity_to_provide_feedback_on_a/,12,2023
